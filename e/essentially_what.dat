25|$|Hopes for {{a timely}} start {{on such a}} line were dashed, when on 14 August 1958 it was {{announced}} that the project was to be deferred. A report that had been prepared on the subject stated that there was an insufficient volume of guaranteed traffic then or in the near future to justify the project at that time. Alternatives were mentioned, including a preferred 24km route between Waharoa and Apata with a 9km tunnel (<b>essentially</b> <b>what</b> ended up being the Kaimai Deviation). The budget for such an option was expected to be at least NZ$10.5 million. It was felt that there was still sufficient capacity on the existing line, and that the idea should be reviewed when demand required it.|$|E
500|$|BioShock has {{received}} critical acclaim. Mainstream press reviews have praised the immersive {{qualities of the}} game and its political dimension. The Boston Globe described it as [...] "a beautiful, brutal, and disquieting computer game... {{one of the best in}} years", and compared the game to Whittaker Chambers' 1957 riposte to Atlas Shrugged, Big Sister Is Watching You. Wired also mentioned the Ayn Rand connection (a partial anagram of Andrew Ryan) in a report on the game which featured a brief interview with Levine. The Chicago Sun-Times review said [...] "I never once thought anyone would be able to create an engaging and entertaining video game around the fiction and philosophy of Ayn Rand, but that is <b>essentially</b> <b>what</b> 2K Games has done... the rare, mature video game that succeeds in making you think while you play".|$|E

[...] Whitman noted that the concept, like others in the show, was based on real scientific knowledge, [...] "The notion is, {{some kind of a}} medical treatment that they were given allowed their brain to command vibrations that would take place. It really is true that <b>essentially</b> <b>what</b> heat is is vibrations of atoms, so if your brain can cause some kind of vibration to take place, eventually you could create enough heat to even create a flame."

Cook added that the parkour elements [...] "turn the Call of Duty format on its head" [...] and that Titanfall addressed all issues with Call of Duty game balance. Multiple reviewers referred to Titanfall as Call of Duty: Future Warfare or a variant whereof. Edge noted that the parkour elements made them approach at an angle instead of rushing directly at the dots on the mini-map, and GameSpot Chris Watters said simple player movement was both a pleasure and a challenge. The Verge Vlad Savov wrote that wall running [...] "hasn't felt this good since ... the Prince of Persia series". Eurogamer Whitehead said other shooters felt [...] "leaden and limited" [...] after playing Titanfall.|$|E
500|$|As he {{was writing}} the film in 1985, John Hughes kept track of his {{progress}} in a spiral-bound logbook. He noted that the basic storyline was developed on February 25. It was successfully pitched the following day to Paramount Studios chief Ned Tanen. Tanen was intrigued by the concept, but wary that the Writers Guild of America was hours away from picketing the studio. Hughes wrote the screenplay {{in less than a}} week. Editor Paul Hirsch explained that Hughes had a trance-like concentration to his script-writing process, working for hours on end, and would later shoot the film on <b>essentially</b> <b>what</b> was his first draft of the script. [...] "The first cut of Ferris Bueller's Day Off ended up at two hours, 45 minutes. The shortening of the script had to come in the cutting room", said Hirsch. [...] "Having the story episodic and taking place in one day...meant the characters were wearing the same clothes. I suspect that Hughes writes his scripts with few, if any costume changes just so he can have that kind of freedom in the editing." ...|$|E
500|$|Deep Blue Sea was {{inspired}} by Australian screenwriter Duncan Kennedy after he witnessed a [...] "horrific" [...] shark attack on a beach near his home. The tragedy contributed to a recurring nightmare of him [...] "being in a passageway with sharks that could read his mind". This motivated him to write a spec script, while acknowledging the challenge of approaching a shark movie without repeating Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic Jaws. Although Warner Bros. bought the script in late 1994, actual development on the project did not start until two years later. When Renny Harlin was chosen to direct the film, Kennedy's screenplay, which had already been re-written by several writers at Warner Bros., was presented to Donna Powers and Wayne Powers, who turned it into the film's final script. According to Wayne, [...] "The movie became <b>essentially</b> <b>what</b> we wrote. The draft we were first presented by [...] was {{much more of a}} military espionage, high-tech action movie, grenade launchers, that kind of thing. We wanted our team to include more blue-collar types and not to have weapons to fight back, to play it more as a horror film." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 5th century BC, Greek philosopher Parmenides, in {{his only}} known work, a poem {{conventionally}} titled On Nature, uses verbal reasoning to postulate that a void, <b>essentially</b> <b>what</b> {{is now known}} as a vacuum, in nature could not occur.

Hotchner describes Hemingway's memoir as [...] "a serious work", that Hemingway [...] "certainly intended it for publication", and contends: [...] "Because Mary was busy with matters relating to Ernest’s estate, she had little involvement with the book....

At this time the opposing dikir barat group’s tukang karut must reply with an answer more clever than the original question, and after the second awok-awok sings it back, the first tukang karut must take the dialogue another step higher. <b>Essentially,</b> <b>what</b> transpires {{is a type of}} lyrical debate, but instead of scoring technical debate points, tukang karuts who regularly produce well-created retorts will win audience laughter, affection, and admiration.|$|E
2500|$|Testimony and allegiances in the 1907 {{assassination}} conspiracy {{cases against}} Harry Orchard's alleged WFM taskmasters remain {{very difficult to}} sort out.

2500|$|Though {{not widely}} known, a new {{variation}} of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward.

Richard Feynman also ascribed to it: [...] "We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong." [...] This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey. [...] For Peirce, the idea of [...] "... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ..." [...] fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing. [...] As Feynman noted, an idea or theory [...] "... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right." [...] Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is [...] "self-corrective" [...] over time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1904, {{champion}} British golfer Harold Hilton described Travis: [...] "In style, the American champion is <b>essentially</b> <b>what</b> may {{be termed}} a made golfer, for {{his is a}} style which by the wildest stretch of imagination could not be called ornate. Still, it boasts useful attributes; it is business-like and determined, and {{is one in which}} no energy is wasted. Like all golfers who really scored a success at the game, he keeps the right elbow well in to the right side, holding the hands very low, like Messrs. Hutchings, Fry and G. F. Smith—three of the best examples of golfers who have risen to eminence while lacking the advantage of playing the game in their youth. The swing of the club is not long—in fact, it might be termed a three-quarter swing—but it is sufficient to get a free action with the wrist, and although Mr. Travis does not obtain an abnormal carry, he nevertheless gets a long roll on the ball, and against the wind in particular he is beyond the average as a driver, especially as he appears to have mastered the art of the scientific hooking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama {{has said}} that the death penalty is used too {{frequently}} and inconsistently.

And I think <b>essentially</b> <b>what</b> the reduction of aggravating factors does is, it says, 'Here's a narrower set of crimes that we think potentially at least could deserve the death penalty.'" [...] In his own words, [...] "While the evidence tells me that the death penalty does little to deter crime; I believe there are some crimes – mass murder, the rape and murder of a child – so heinous that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment. On the other hand, the way capital cases were tried in Illinois at the time was so rife with error, questionable police tactics, racial bias, and shoddy lawyering, that 13 death row inmates had been exonerated." ...|$|E
