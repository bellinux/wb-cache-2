40|$|SUMMARY Carotid endarterectomy {{has become}} a widely used {{approach}} {{to the treatment of}} cerebrovas-cular disease. In spite of increasing experience, a significant and varied morbidity remains attached to the procedure. A poorly recognized complication is postoperative headache. In a series of 57 endarterectomies in 50 patients, 24 patients experienced postoperative headaches encom-passing the entire spectrum of vascular headaches: nonspecific diffuse headaches, severe <b>hemicranias,</b> cluster headaches occurring early and delayed, chronic paroxysmal <b>hemicranias,</b> carotidynia, and Eagle's syndrome. Five patients had <b>hemicranias,</b> and all were homolateral to the endarterectomy. Therefore, we hypothesize that the spontaneously occurring <b>hemicranias,</b> the counterparts of postsurgical headache syndromes, also may be due to some overt or occult injury or disease of the carotid vessels or carotid sheaths in the region from the carotid bifurcation {{to the base of the}} skull. STENOTIC LESIONS of the common carotid artery or the internal carotid artery near the bifurcation are well recognized causes of cerebrovascular ischemia. Carotid endarterectomy is gaining increasing recogni-tion as a surgical approach in the prophylaxis an...|$|R
40|$|Sphaeranthus indicus is a {{well-known}} plant used in the Indian system of medicine. The plant is widely distributed throughout the plains and wet-lands of India, Sri Lanka and Australia. Folklore medicine claims its use in epileptic convulsion, mental illness, <b>hemicranias,</b> as a general tonic, deobstruent, aphrodisiac etc. Various biologically active compounds have been isolated from S. indicus. This study {{is an attempt to}} compile an up-to-date and comprehensive review of S. indicus that covers its traditional and folk medicinal uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology...|$|R
30|$|In {{conclusion}} this is, at our knowledge, {{the first}} paper showing the unusual occurrence {{of two different}} contralateral TACs: cluster headache and paroxysmal <b>hemicranias</b> in the same patient {{and at the same}} time. Both these headaches share the activation of the strictly closed hypothalamic region. It could be possible that a continuous hypothalamic activation give a maladaptive plasticity recruiting closed neuronal aggregates responsible for the developing of PH after a long period of CH, even if there are now no data confirming this hypothesis. Further studies need to explain the pathophysiology.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of SUNCT {{often lead}} to {{misdiagnosis}} as paroxysmal <b>hemicrania,</b> which is also categorized in the same group. Inefficiency of indomethacin usually indicates SUNCT over paroxysmal <b>hemicrania.</b>|$|E
50|$|Paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> is {{classified}} by {{the frequency and}} duration of attacks experienced by patients. Episodic paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> attacks occur {{at least twice a}} year and last anywhere from seven days to a year with pain free periods of a month or longer separating them. Chronic paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> attacks occur over the course of more than a year without remission or with remissions lasting less than a month.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cause of}} <b>hemicrania</b> {{continua}} is unknown. There is no definitive diagnostic test for <b>hemicrania</b> continua. Diagnostic tests such as imaging studies may be ordered {{to rule out}} other causes for the headache. When the symptoms of <b>hemicrania</b> continua are present, it's considered [...] "diagnostic" [...] if they respond completely to indomethacin. The efficacy of indomethacin may not be long term for all patients, as can eventually become ineffective.|$|E
40|$|Some {{headaches}} {{are relatively}} uncommon. They may be either primary of secondary and their recognition {{is dependent on}} the characterization of symptoms as well as identification of certain specific situations in which they need to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Primary headache syndromes like the paroxysmal <b>hemicranias,</b> SUNCT (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing), cough headaches and hypnic headaches are uncommonly encountered in routine clinical practice. They have subtle unique features and specific therapies which differentiate them from the commoner primary headaches. Among the secondary causes, headaches may be an uncommon presenting feature of known clinical disorders, lack of awareness of which may result in significant morbidity. These disorders which may present with headache as the main symptom will be the focus of discussion in this review...|$|R
30|$|This {{study shows}} that {{reducing}} the time duration to less than one hour would considerably {{increase the number of}} children diagnosed with migraine. One can argue that this time reduction might increase the overlap between the diagnostic criteria of migraine and tension type headaches but it can be easily overcome by adding one common/known migraine trigger and one family member suffering from ICHD 2 migraine to the present diagnostic features. One cannot consider any other diagnoses in these children even if only one of phonophobia or photophobia is present. Other short duration activity affected headaches like cluster headaches and paroxysmal <b>hemicranias,</b> though reported in children, are very rare and no case was diagnosed in this age group during the study period. Short duration mild to moderate non throbbing headaches attributed to uncorrected refractive errors, phorias and tropias were diagnosed when prolonged and tiring near or far focusing precipitated peri orbital pain. Other brief headaches attributed to cough, valsalva, cold, external compression etc. were easy to diagnose clinically and was not a problem differentiating from brief migraine without aura episodes. Children and adolescents complaining of aura like manifestations were not included in this study and benign occipital epilepsies with brief colored auras with automatisms were not a diagnostic consideration in these patients.|$|R
40|$|Purpose of review: Sleep and cluster {{headache}} (CH) {{are believed to}} be interconnected but the precise relation to the other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) is uncertain and complex. A better understanding of these relations may eventually lead to a clarification of the underlying mechanisms and eventually to more effective therapeutic regimens. This review aims to evaluate the existing literature on the subject of TACs and sleep. An association between episodic CH and distinct macrostructural sleep phases, especially the relation to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, has been described in some older studies but could not be confirmed in other, more recent studies. Investigations into the microstructure of sleep in these patients are lacking. Only a few case reports exist on the relation between sleep and other TACs. Summary: Recent studies do not find an association between CH and REM sleep. One older study suggests chronic paroxysmal <b>hemicranias</b> may be locked to REM sleep but otherwise the relation is unknown. Reports indicate that CH and obstructive sleep apnoea are associated in some individuals but results are diverging. Single cases show improvement of CH upon treatment of sleep apnoea, but the causal relationship remains in question. Other TACs are probably not connected to sleep and strictly nocturnal attacks should prompt investigations for secondary causes. The relation between CH and sleep is, however, fascinating and detailed sleep studies in carefully diagnosed patients are warranted...|$|R
50|$|<b>Hemicrania</b> {{continua}} (HC) is {{a persistent}} unilateral headache that responds to indomethacin. It is usually unremitting, but rare cases of remission have been documented. <b>Hemicrania</b> continua {{is considered a}} primary headache disorder, meaning {{that it is not}} caused by another condition.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Chronic {{paroxysmal}} <b>hemicrania</b> {{is characterized}} by intense pain {{on one side of}} the head.|$|E
5000|$|Chronic {{paroxysmal}} <b>hemicrania</b> (CPH) is {{a unilateral}} headache condition, without the male predominance usually seen in CH. Paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> {{may also be}} episodic. CPH typically responds [...] "absolutely" [...] to treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin where in most cases CH typically shows no positive indomethacin response, making [...] "Indomethacin response" [...] an important diagnostic tool for specialist practitioners seeking correct differential diagnosis between the conditions.|$|E
50|$|The International Headache Society's International Classification of Headache Disorders classifies <b>hemicrania</b> {{continua}} as {{a primary}} headache disorder.|$|E
5000|$|Complete {{response}} to therapeutic doses of indomethacin, although cases of <b>hemicrania</b> continua {{that do not}} resolve with indomethacin treatment have been documented.|$|E
50|$|A variant on <b>hemicrania</b> {{continua}} {{has also}} been described, in which the attacks may shift sides, although meeting the above criteria in all other respects.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{outwardly}} {{similar to}} cluster headaches, chronic paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> is rather different, {{and the two}} headaches are not a subset of one or the other. Key differences include: ...|$|E
50|$|CH has {{alternately}} {{been called}} erythroprosopalgia of Bing, ciliary neuralgia, erythromelalgia of the head, Horton's headache, histaminic cephalalgia, petrosal neuralgia, sphenopalatine neuralgia, vidian neuralgia, Sluder's neuralgia, Sluder's syndrome, and <b>hemicrania</b> angioparalyticia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemicrania</b> {{continua}} generally responds only to indomethacin 25-300 mg daily, {{which must}} be continued long term. Unfortunately, gastrointestinal side effects are a common problem with indomethacin, which may require additional acid-suppression therapy to control.|$|E
50|$|Treatment for TACs varies {{depending}} on the exact type, but can include medication such as Indomethacin (in the case of chronic paroxysmal <b>hemicrania)</b> or acute and prophylactic therapy (in the case of cluster headache).|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} that chronic paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> was first described by Johann Oppermann in 1747 under the term [...] "hemicranias horologica". Oppermann's report included a 35-year-old woman who had hemicranial pain that lasted for 15 minutes and recurred regularly every hour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemicrania</b> was {{mentioned}} in 1881 in The Therapeutic Gazette Vol. 2, by G.S.Davis, and the incident {{has been cited}} in King's American Dispensatory (1898 and later editions) {{in the description of}} the strong analgesic Jamaican Dogwood, a relatively low dose of which reportedly produced convulsions and prolonged respiratory depression over six hours in an elderly woman with this condition.|$|E
50|$|A second-century {{description}} by Aretaeus of Cappadocia divided headaches {{into three}} types: cephalalgia, cephalea, and heterocrania. Galen of Pergamon {{used the term}} <b>hemicrania</b> (half-head), from which the word migraine was eventually derived. He also proposed that the pain arose from the meninges and blood vessels of the head. Migraines were first divided into the two now used types - migraine with aura (migraine ophthalmique) and migraine without aura (migraine vulgaire) in 1887 by Louis Hyacinthe Thomas, a French Librarian.|$|E
50|$|For {{diagnosis}} of hypnic headache syndrome, headaches should occur at least 15 times {{per month for}} at least one month. Included in the differential {{diagnosis of}} a new onset nighttime headaches in the elderly is drug withdrawal, temporal arteritis, Sleep apnea, oxygen desaturated, Pheochromocytoma, intracranial causes, primary and secondary neoplasms, communicating hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma, vascular lesions, migraines, cluster headaches, chronic paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> and hypnic headache. All other causes must be ruled out before the diagnosis of hypnic headache can be made.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{paroxysmal}} <b>hemicrania</b> (CPH), {{also known}} as Sjaastad syndrome, is a severe debilitating unilateral headache usually affecting {{the area around the}} eye. It normally consists of multiple severe, yet short, headache attacks affecting only one side of the cranium. It is more commonly diagnosed in women than in men, but, unlike a migraine, has no neurological symptoms associated with it. CPH headaches are treated through the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with indomethacin found to be usually effective in eliminating symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|In newer times, <b>Hemicrania</b> {{continua}} {{was described}} in 1981; at that time around 130 cases were described in the literature. [...] However, rising awareness of the condition has led to increasingly frequent diagnosis in headache clinics, {{and it seems that}} it is not as rare as these figures would imply. The condition occurs more often in women than men and tends to present first in adulthood, although it has also been reported in children as young as 5 years old.|$|E
5000|$|Migraine without aura also {{referred}} to as a common migraine, (previously known as <b>hemicrania</b> simplex) is a specific neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, [...] headaches that often affect one side of the head (i.e., it is [...] ), are of at least [...] intensity, and may cause nausea, phonophobia or photophobia. One defining characteristic of the common migraine is a lack of the visual disturbances known as an aura. The exact International Classification of Headache Disorders diagnostic criteria appear to the right.|$|E
50|$|Various {{types of}} {{headaches}} {{are common in}} patients with pituitary adenomas. The adenoma may be the prime causative factor behind the headache or may serve to exacerbate a headache caused by other factors. Amongst the types of headaches experienced are both chronic and episodic migraine, and more uncommonly various unilateral headaches; primary stabbing headache, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) - another type of stabbing headache characterized by short stabs of pain -, cluster headache, and <b>hemicrania</b> continua (HS).|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on CBS News Sunday Morning on April 1, 2012, Smith explained the album's title: [...] "for those who are curious, you can find what Banga is if you read The Master and Margarita by Bulgakov." [...] In The Master and Margarita, Banga is Pontius Pilate's dog to whom Pilate could freely complain about the <b>hemicrania</b> that tortured him. Other songs on the album were also inspired by literature, particularly [...] "April Fool," [...] inspired by Nikolai Gogol.Coincidentaly the Photos within the Booklet of the CD detail part of the albums recording, in late 2011 aboard the Costa Concordia, months before she capsized {{off the coast of}} Italy.|$|E
40|$|Paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> and <b>hemicrania</b> {{continua}} are primary headache syndromes {{characterized by}} exquisite response to indometacin. Migrainous {{features such as}} phonophobia and photophobia occur in <b>hemicrania</b> continua and the differential diagnosis with unilateral chronic migraine can be challenging. This thesis explores the phenotypical aspects of paroxysmal <b>hemicrania,</b> <b>hemicrania</b> continua and unilateral chronic migraine, revisits the current criteria for the identification of paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> and <b>hemicrania</b> continua, and identifies clinical markers {{that can be used}} to differentiate <b>hemicrania</b> continua from unilateral chronic migraine. The study of thirty-one patients with paroxysmal <b>hemicrania</b> shows the pain is in a wider area of the head and face and a full range of cranial autonomic features occurs with the attacks.
