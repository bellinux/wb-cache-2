40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, theory, and measurement of a linearly polarized microstrip patch antenna {{with a novel}} substrate-integrated mechanism that can compensate the detuning effects from a physical deformation. Specifically, this antenna bends sharply through the center up to 90 (pivoted about the ground plane) and retuning (compensation) occurs by displacing electromagnetically functionalized colloidal dispersions (EFCDs) through a capillary in the substrate (parallel to the radiating edge). The displacement of a high permittivity EFCD by a low permittivity EFCD acts as a net length reduction (shown mathematically using perturbation theory). This mitigates the physical length extension from the deformation and stretching of the conductors. The design can be considered cognitive (conceptually in this thesis) by allowing the deformation and resulting compressive forces in the substrate to actuate displacement. The antennas to demonstrate this concept have been chosen to operate at 3 GHz and use a Sylgard 184 (a flexible silicone-based elastomer) substrate material with a height of 4 mm. Simulations of an HFSS model demonstrate a stable VSWR 2 : 1 bandwidth of 141 MHz across {{the entire range of}} bending. Currently available fabrication methods and EFCD material systems provide some limitations. Therefore, proof-of-concept is provided using 2 microstrip patch antennas (one flat patch and one patch bent 90) designed using 4 mm thick Rochelle Foam substrates and rigid copper sheets. A flexible patch was fabricated using Sylgard 184 and SEC 1233 (a conductive elastomer) but bending created several tears in the material and delaminating of the <b>flexible</b> <b>conductor.</b> However, the comparison of trends between simulated and measured results show good agreement and are used to validate this compensation mechanism...|$|E
40|$|In aerial {{transmission}} lines aluminium multiwire conductors are in use. Owing to their flexible design the electrodynamic effect of short circuit currents {{may lead to}} intolerable mutual rendezvous and even cross-whipping of the phase conductors. The increasing motion of the conductors caused by effect of the short-circuit electrodynamic force impulse is accompanied by the dynamic load impact affecting the conductors, insulating and supporting constructions of the aerial lines. Intensity of the short-circuit currents electrodynamic impact on the flexible conductors depends on the short circuit current magnitude. For research into electrodynamic endurance of the conductors of the aerial lines located at the vertices of arbitrary triangle with spans of a large length, the authors assume the conductor analytical model {{in the form of}} a flexible tensile thread whose mass is distributed evenly lengthwise the conductor. With this analytical model, by the action of the imposed forces the conductor assumes the form conditioned by the diagram of applied external forces, and resists neither bending nor torsion. The initial conditions calculation task reduces to solving the flexible thread statics equations. The law of motion of the conductor marginal points comes out of the conjoint solution of dynamic equations of the conductor and structural components of the areal electric power lines. Based on the proposed algorithm, the researchers of the Chair of the Electric Power Stations of BNTU developed a software program LINEDYS+, which in its characteristics yields to no foreign analogs, e. g. SAMSEF. To calculate the initial conditions they modified a software program computing the <b>flexible</b> <b>conductor</b> mechanics named MR 21. The conductor short-circuit electrodynamic interaction estimation considers structural elements of the areal lines, ice and wind loads, objective parameters of the short circuit.

40|$|Some {{problems}} in electro dynamics {{have been studied}} {{in the light of}} electromagnetic field theory and computational techniques. One is that of the retrograde motion of the electric arc – an old and intriguing problem of physics. A more complete model based on electrodynamics has been proposed for study of this problem. In this model, the plasma column is treated as a <b>flexible</b> <b>conductor.</b> The associated 3 -dimensional boundary-value problem was solved by the boundary element method (BEM). It has been shown that the retrograde motion can indeed be understood in terms of electrodynamics and a number of the reported features of this phenomenon have been explained by the proposed model. The others are concerned with a recent controversy in electrodynamics. It has been discussed in the thesis that Lorentz and Ampere force laws are equivalent in the sense of magnetostatics provided that the latter is appropriately used. The interactions of electromagnetic forces on the systems of the electromagnetic jet propulsion and the electromagnetic impulse pendulum have been examined. It turns out that the observations are consistent with the laws of electromagnetic energy and momentum. Two aspects of the water-arc explosion problem have been studied. One is the electromagnetic (EM) aspect which is calculated by the method of separation of the variables, the other is the magnetohydrodyuamic (MHD) aspect which is solved by the finite difference method (FDM). The numerical results of the two aspects show that neither the pure EM model nor the MHD model for the incompressible fluid could explain the explosive phenomenon; this strongly suggests that the shock wave produced by the under-water arc must account for the phenomenon. On the wire fragmentation, a preliminary study has shown that this phenomenon could be caused by the electromagnetically driven stress waves and a theoretical model has been proposed for further investigation. This is described in an Appendix to the thesis. </p...|$|E
