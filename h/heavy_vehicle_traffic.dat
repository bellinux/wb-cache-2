500|$|Communications between 3 RAR and Brigade Headquarters {{had failed}} early, while {{those with the}} forward {{companies}} were also poor. This was mostly due to {{the large number of}} South Koreans retreating through their position tearing out the line from the Command Post, as well the effect of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>traffic</b> and gunfire on the exposed line. Likewise, direct radio communication with the forward companies on the battalion command net with the new Type 31 VHF radios was obstructed by the rugged terrain due to the sitting of Battalion Headquarters in low ground relative to the forward companies and the requirement for line-of-sight. The forward companies were able to maintain communications with each other, but not with Battalion Headquarters, while the company level nets also functioned well. Ultimately contact was maintained between Ferguson and Burke through a radio set in the Middlesex Battalion Headquarters, while messages to the forward companies relied on line and a slow relay through C Company. These issues had only further complicated the conduct of the defence on the first night, with the co-ordination of the forward battle falling to O'Dowd. The next morning, O'Dowd finally managed to get through on a radio phone to a general in the US 1st Marine Division. The officer was incredulous, thinking it was a Chinese agent speaking.

50|$|Pizza Hut {{opened its}} first store in China in 1990, and Pizza Hut and Domino's Pizza both {{expanded}} in the Chinese {{market in the}} 2000s. Prior to entering the market, Pizza Hut performed market analysis and research into consumer food preferences, tastes, and dining habits, whereas Domino's simply entered the market providing their standard fare. With its planning and research, Pizza Hut was successful in its endeavors, opening over 1,300 stores in the country, whereas Domino's was rather unsuccessful, with under 40 stores in China in 2014. At the time, Domino's provided the company's delivery guarantee of thirty minutes or less, but did {{not take into account}} many Chinese cities' <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>traffic</b> and gridlock. Domino's lack of success in the Chinese market has also been attributed to the chain's fare lacking appeal to Chinese consumers, not having sit-down restaurants (Domino's stores were take-out and delivery only), and the large size of the company's pizzas, which made them difficult for consumers to eat while walking or hanging out on the street.|$|E

40|$|Fine {{airborne}} respirable particulates {{less than}} 10 micrometer (PM 10) are {{considered one of}} the top environmental public health concerns, since they contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are among the major carcinogenic compounds found in urban air. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the genotoxicity of the ambient PM 10 collected at 11 urban sites in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The PM 10 extractable organic matter (EOM) was examined for its genotoxicity by the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) comet assay and the Salmonella mutagenicity (Ames) test. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify 16 PAH compounds in four sites. Samples from oil refinery and <b>heavy</b> diesel <b>vehicles</b> <b>traffic</b> sites showed significant DNA damage causing comet in 20 - 44 % of the cells with tail moments ranging from 0. 5 - 2. 0 compared to samples from petrol driven cars and residential area, with comet in less than 2 % of the cells and tail moments of < 0. 02. In the Ames test, polluted sites showed indirect mutagenic response and caused 20 - 56 rev/ m 3, mean while residential and reference sites caused 2 - 15 rev /m 3. The genotoxicity of the EOM in both tests directly correlated with the amount of organic particulate and the PAHs concentrations in the air samples. The PAHs concentrations ranged between 0. 83 ng/m 3 in industrial and <b>heavy</b> diesel <b>vehicles</b> <b>traffic</b> sites to 0. 18 ng /m 3 in the residential area. Benzo(ghi) pyrene was the major PAH components and at one site it represented 65. 4 % of the total PAHs. Samples of the oil refinery site were more genotoxic in the SCGE assay than samples from the <b>heavy</b> diesel <b>vehicles</b> <b>traffic</b> site, despite the fact that both sites contain almost similar amount of PAHs. The opposite was true for the mutagenicity in the Ames test. This could be due to the nature of the EOM in both sites. These findings confirm the genotoxic potency of the PM 10 organic extracts to which urban populations are exposed...|$|R

Though later Tsing Yi North Bridge was built thus alleviating the congestion a bit, and the bridge was closed once in 1989 (after the opening of the North bridge) for renovation, the safety of the bridge was still a major concern. Finally, a rescue plan was implemented. A new bridge, Duplicate Tsing Yi Bridge, was built alongside to at first to replace Tsing Yi Bridge temporarily while Tsing Yi Bridge was closed for fixing in 2000. Some tensioned steel cables replaced the aging cables inside the bridge to straighten out the bent parts. After the project completed, the Tsing Yi Bridge, together with its 'new' brother, served the island again.|$|E

40|$|The {{composition}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>traffic</b> {{has changed dramatically}} {{on most of the}} major roads in southern Africa over the past 10 to 15 years. Observations in various countries confirmed that a continues shift is taken place in the {{composition of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>traffic,</b> which inter alia, leads to an increase in the growth in E 80 s per heavy vehicles (E 80 s/HV), the average calculated E 80 s/HV and subsequently the total calculated E 80 s. Available data has shown that there is a continues shift in composition from 2 and 3 axles heavy vehicles to the larger 4 to 7 axles heavy vehicle types. This can, inter alia, be explained by improved vehicle technology, economic growth as well as changes in legalisation (1996), which allows heavier loads to be carried, and better utilisation of heavy vehicles with an increase in economic activity.

40|$|While {{considering}} Sri Lankan Road network, several failures {{can be seen}} especially cracking in Sri Lankan road network. The {{main objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine whether effect of tires is a reason for the longitudinal crack in roads in Sri Lanka. Under literature review wheel loads of trucks mainly contribute to fatigue crack and permanent deformation. The tire pavement contact pressure distribution is significantly affected by tire inflation pressure, tire type, tire load and tire tread pattern. Two roads having longitudinal cracks were selected for this case study with varying composition of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Traffic</b> distribution of the roads was investigated. The survey conducted among tire sellers found that bias tires are widely used in <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Sri Lanka. It was found that in <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> radial tires are mostly used for the front axle and bias tires are mostly used for the rear axle which distribute significant amount of load to road surface. The core samples extracted from crack locations on the pavement exhibited that cracks originated from the top surface of the pavement (top down cracking) and asphalt layer thickness are not uniform throughout the road. The result of extraction test done for the core samples show that some samples are not in standard mixtures. From the literature review it found that Climatic conditions, traffic, ageing, structure and construction quality are the main causes pointed out for the initiation and propagation of top down cracking. And also usage of radial truck tires can be affect to top down cracking. Due to less usage of radial truck tires in Sri Lanka it might not be a main reason for such failure. Sri Lanka is a developing country having poor construction qualities. It seems that poor construction quality might be a significant reason for such failures in selected road section in Sri Lanka...|$|R
