The 350 Pennsylvania troops who first reached Washington on April 18 {{became known as the}} First Defenders and, after the war, the survivors formed an association with that name. While they were lodged at the Capitol, President Lincoln, Secretary of State William H. Seward, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron visited. Bosbyshell recalled Lincoln, [...] "yes, here, towering over all in the room was the great central figure of the war. I remember how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the kindliness of his face and awkward hanging of his arms and legs, his apparent bashfulness in the presence of these first soldiers of the Republic, and with it all a grave, rather mournful bearing in his attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a {{positive}} review, {{stating that the}} reveal was [...] "an effective narrative, and one which creates a [...] "satisfying" [...] resolution for the viewer {{as well as the}} character. Veronica Mars {{has done a good job}} of subverting expectations on a regular basis, but it’s still a TV show, with requirements for satisfying resolutions. [...] Which is my roundabout way of saying that while I wasn’t surprised by the reveal that it was Duncan Kane, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> how well it worked up to that point.

5000|$|His {{obituary}} for the Royal Society {{was written}} by Blackett, who also broadcast a radio appreciation of Williams in 1949, in which he said: [...] Looking back on Williams's short life, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the amount he achieved. We physicists feel constantly his loss. His distinctive gift of deep physical understanding, using only relatively simple mathematics, would have been of the greatest value to us today.|$|R

500|$|... "Like Father, Like Clown" [...] {{was written}} by the duo of Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Krusty's {{religion}} had not {{been part of the}} original concept of the character, so Kogen and Wolodarsky decided to parody The Jazz Singer and establish that Krusty is Jewish. They pitched the idea to co-executive producer Sam Simon, who rejected it, but it was approved by James L. Brooks. Krusty's last name, Krustofski, was established in this episode as pitched by Al Jean. The portion of the episode where characters quote the Bible in support or opposition of clowning were carefully researched. Cited passages from the Bible include Exodus 20:12 and Joshua 1:8. The quotations from the Talmud were also researched, and two rabbis, Lavi Meier and Harold M. Schulweis, were credited as [...] "special technical consultants". Schulweis was asked {{to take a look at}} a draft of the script. While not a fan of the show, he felt [...] "it was profound" [...] and added some corrections. He later commented, [...] "I thought it had a Jewish resonance to it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the underlying moral seriousness." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was at the}} International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in {{the year}} 1900 that I {{became aware of the}} {{importance}} of logical reform for the philosophy of mathematics. ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the fact that, in every discussion, [...] showed more precision and more logical rigour than was shown by anybody else. ...

To my observation, it seems {{fair to say}} that you belong with the best of your generation, which I would say includes May Swenson, Denise Levertov, Garrigue, et al." [...] Louis Untermeyer added his voice: [...] "I particularly like your fusion of observation and whimsicality, as well as your avoidance of the poetic stereotypes." [...] Rolfe Humphries was intrigued by Bartlett's poetic techniques: [...] "I enjoyed your poems and admire many...." [...] About Behold This Dreamer, Gustav Davidson wrote: [...] "I enjoyed reading these poems. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> their precision, clarity, and technical competence." [...] About the same work, critic Paul Jordan-Smith wrote: [...] "Your poems were begotten of a strong, imaginative sense. My congratulations on this beautiful collection." ...|$|E

60|$|Right here <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> {{the lack}} of clear-thinking on any of their parts. So spontaneously had the ship's company {{exploded}} into mutiny that it was dazed and confused even while it acted. For instance, {{in the months since}} we left Baltimore there had never been a moment, day or night, even when preventer tackles were rigged, that a man had not stood at the wheel. So habituated were they to this, that they were shocked into consternation at sight of the deserted wheel. They paused for an instant to stare at it. Then Bert Rhine, with a quick word and gesture, sent the Italian, Guido Bombini, around the rear of the half-wheelhouse. The fact that he completed the circuit was proof that nobody was there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Mr. Gorse, {{and nodded}} toward me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the felicity with which a {{cartoonist}} of the Pilot had once caricatured {{him by the}} use of curved lines. The circle of the heavy eyebrows ended at the wide nostrils; the mouth was a crescent, but bowed downwards; the heavy shoulders were rounded. Indeed, the only straight line to be discerned about him was that of his hair, black as bitumen, banged across his forehead; even his polished porphyry eyes were constructed on some curvilinear principle, and never seemed to focus. It might be said of Mr. Gorse that he had an overwhelming impersonality. One could never be quite sure that one's words reached the mark.|$|E
60|$|Presently the {{children}} came in. They looked very quaint, like acolytes, in their long straight dressing-gowns of quilted blue silk. The boy, particularly, {{looked as if}} he were going to light the candles in some childish church in paradise. He was very tall and slender and fair, with a round fine head, and serene features. Both children looked remarkably, almost transparently clean: it is impossible to consider anything more fresh and fair. The girl was a merry, curly headed puss of six. She played with her mother's green jewels and prattled prettily, while the boy stood at his mother's side, a slender and silent acolyte in his pale blue gown. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> his patience and his purity. When the girl had bounded away into George's arms, the lad laid his hand timidly on Lettie's knee and looked with a little wonder at her dress.|$|E

I like America and the Americans... people there are frank. It is a young country with the qualities and faults of youth. It is a delight to love people like that... Above all <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the greatness of this country and the freedom that it gives.|$|R
5000|$|On October 16, 2012, Rosa's {{manager and}} friend Angelo Medina {{announced}} that the release date of Draco Rosa's new album Vida had been pushed back from November 13, 2012 to February 2013 due to Rosa entering quarantine after {{a bone marrow transplant}} months before. [...] "He's fine, he spent several months in the hospital, he was discharged and is at home in this process they call quarantine, but for 80 days, which fall due in December.

60|$|As Nobs and I swung {{along in}} the growing light of the coming day, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the {{lessening}} numbers of savage beasts the farther north I traveled. With the decrease among the carnivora, the herbivora increased in quantity, though anywhere in Caspak they are sufficiently plentiful to furnish ample food for the meateaters of each locality. The wild cattle, antelope, deer, and horses I passed showed changes in evolution from their cousins farther south. The kine were smaller and less shaggy, the horses larger. North of the Kro-lu village I saw {{a small band of}} the latter of about the size of those of our old Western plains--such as the Indians bred in former days {{and to a lesser extent}} even now. They were fat and sleek, and I looked upon them with covetous eyes and with thoughts that any old cow-puncher may well imagine I might entertain after having hoofed it for weeks; but they were wary, scarce permitting me to approach within bow-and-arrow range, much less within roping-distance; yet I still had hopes which I never discarded.|$|E
6000|$|No sooner was I out on {{the streets}} than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the {{difference}} in status effected by my clothes. All servility vanished from the demeanour of the common people with whom I came in contact. Presto! in the twinkling of an eye, so to say, I had become one of them. My frayed and out-at-elbows jacket was the badge and advertisement of my class, which was their class. It made me of like kind, and in place of the fawning and too respectful attention I had hitherto received, I now shared with them a comradeship. The man in corduroy and dirty neckerchief no longer addressed me as [...] "sir" [...] or [...] "governor." [...] It was [...] "mate" [...] now--and a fine and hearty word, with a tingle to it, and a warmth and gladness, which the other term does not possess. Governor! It smacks of mastery, and power, and high authority--the tribute of the man who is under to the man on top, delivered in the hope that he will let up a bit and ease his weight, which is another way of saying that it is an appeal for alms.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me with that strange, unblinking gaze, and she thought and spoke with the slow deliberateness that {{characterized}} everything about her, as if well aware of an eternity that was hers and in which {{there was no need for}} haste. Again <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the enormous certitude of her. In this eternity that seemed so indubitably hers, there was time and to spare for safe-footing and stable equilibrium--for certitude, in short. No more in her spiritual life than in carrying the hundredweights of grain was there a possibility of a misstep or an overbalancing. The feeling produced in me was uncanny. Here was a human soul that, save for the most glimmering of contacts, was beyond the humanness of me. And the more I learned of Margaret Henan in the weeks that followed the more mysteriously remote she became. She was as alien as a far-journeyer from some other star, and no hint could she nor all the countryside give me of what forms of living, what heats of feeling, or rules of philosophic contemplation actuated her in all that she had been and was.|$|E

60|$|My uncle's {{estate was}} {{situated}} where the arable {{land of the}} plains begins to swell upwards into the rounded chalk hills which are characteristic of the county. As I drove from Dinton Station in the waning light of that autumn day, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the weird nature of the scenery. The few scattered cottages of the peasants were so dwarfed by the huge evidences of prehistoric life, that the present {{appeared to be a}} dream and the past to be the obtrusive and masterful reality. The road wound through the valleys, formed by a succession of grassy hills, and the summit of each was cut and carved into the most elaborate fortifications, some circular, and some square, but all on a scale which has defied the winds and the rains of many centuries. Some call them Roman and some British, but their true origin and the reasons for this particular tract of country being so interlaced with entrenchments have never been finally made clear. Here and there on the long, smooth, olive-coloured slopes there rose small rounded barrows or tumuli. Beneath them lie the cremated ashes of the race which cut so deeply into the hills, but their graves tell us nothing save that a jar full of dust represents the man who once laboured under the sun.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will dictate it to you,' said he; and, pacing up {{and down}} the long room, he poured forth a torrent of words, which poor de Meneval, his face shining with his exertions, strove hard to put upon paper. As he grew excited by his own ideas, Napoleon's voice became shriller, his step faster, and he seized his right cuff in the fingers of the same hand, and twisted his right arm in the {{singular}} epileptic gesture which was peculiar to him. But his thoughts and plans were so admirably clear that even I, who knew nothing of the matter, could readily follow them, while above all <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the marvellous grasp of fact which enabled him to speak with confidence, not only of the line-of-battle ships, but of the frigates, sloops, and brigs at Ferrol, Rochefort, Cadiz, Carthagena, and Brest, with the exact strength of each in men and in guns; while the names and force of the English vessels were equally at his fingers' ends. Such familiarity would have been remarkable in a naval officer, but when I thought that this question of the ships was only one out of fifty with which this man had to deal, I began to realise the immense grasp of that capacious mind. He {{did not appear to be}} paying the least attention to me, but it seems that he was really watching me closely, for he turned upon me when he had finished his dictation.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1897 I gave a glass ball to a young lady, {{previously}} a stranger to me, who was entirely unacquainted with crystal gazing, even by report. She had, however, not infrequent experience of spontaneous visions, which were fulfilled, including {{a vision of the}} Derby (Persimmon's year), which enriched her friends. In using the ball she, time after time, succeeded in seeing and correctly describing persons and places familiar to people for whom she [...] "scried," [...] but totally strange to herself. In one case she added a detail quite unknown to the person who consulted her, but which was verified on inquiry. These experiments will probably be published elsewhere. Four people, out of the very small number who tried on these occasions, saw fancy pictures in the ball: two were young ladies, one a man, and one a schoolboy. I must confess that, for the first time, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the belief that the lady's veracious visions, however they are to be explained, could not possibly be accounted for by chance coincidence. They were too many (I was aware of five in a few days), too minute, and too remote from the range of ingenious guessing. But [...] "thought transference," [...] tapping the mental wires of another person, would have accounted for every case, with, perhaps, the exception of that in which an unknown detail was added. This confession will, undoubtedly, seem weakly credulous, but not to make it would be unfair and unsportsmanlike. My statement, of course, especially without the details, is not evidence for other people.|$|E

40|$|Gloria Vaughn, Tennesseans, Good morning. It is a {{pleasure}} to <b>be</b> here. <b>I</b> {{have always had a}} kindred feeling for Tennessee. <b>I</b> have always <b>been</b> <b>I</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the research and demonstration projects coming from Te 1 U 1 essee which, in their concern for children, show respect for parental responsibility {{and the role of the}} family.

As the title of my address says, "If you care about children, then care about parents! " As you know, it doesn't automatically happen that way, and the idea I wish to express is that the way we focus on the child [...] either as individual professionals or as a society [...] does not always support the family as the primary institution responsible for the welfare and education of children. In our eagerness to serve or to teach children, or to protect them, we are sometimes led to ignore the parents, to be insensitive to their concerns, to compet...|$|R
