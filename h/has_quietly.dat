For over 20 years, a major desalination plant for Gaza has been discussed. The Palestinian Water Authority has approved a $500 million facility. Israel supports it and <b>has</b> <b>quietly</b> begun to offer Palestinians desalination training. In 2012 the French government committed a 10 million-euro grant for the plant. Arab countries, coordinated by the Islamic Development Bank, committed to provide half of the necessary funds, matching an expected European financial commitment. The European Investment Bank provides technical assistance.|$|E

His next role was Steven Soderbergh's dark comedy The Informant! (2009), in which his Golden Globe-nominated work was described by Entertainment Weekly as such: [...] "The star – who <b>has</b> <b>quietly</b> and steadily turned into a great Everyman actor – is in nimble control as he reveals his character's deep crazies." [...] Also in 2009, Damon portrayed South Africa national rugby union team captain François Pienaar in the Clint Eastwood-directed film Invictus, {{which is based on}} the 2008 John Carlin book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation and features Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela. Invictus earned Damon an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The New Republic observed that he brought [...] "it off with low-key charm and integrity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, {{the courts}} have also {{demonstrated}} an unwillingness to consult foreign constitutional case law, and have crafted a [...] "local conditions" [...] rationale which prescribes reading the Constitution [...] "within its own four walls {{and not in the}} light of analogies drawn from other countries such as Great Britain, the United States of America or Australia". This has been termed a conservative and restrictive approach that seems to undermine the court's duty to generously interpret fundamental liberties. However, it has been noted that this approach to constitutional interpretation was never applied consistently, and that [...] "it appears that the 'four walls' doctrine <b>has</b> <b>quietly</b> fallen out of fashion at least in practice, as courts now regularly consider foreign cases which have only persuasive, not precedential value. ... It {{is fair to say that}} the development of Singapore public law is not accomplished in a cloister sealed off from transnational models, but through a thoughtful engagement with foreign cases." ...|$|E

[...] In May 1989, Denmark established registered partnerships that granted same-sex couples many of the rights associated with marriage. In the same year, New York's highest court ruled that two homosexual men qualified as a family {{for the purposes of}} New York City's rent-control regulations. Within the movement for gay and lesbian rights, a debate between advocates of sexual liberation and of social integration was taking shape, with Andrew Sullivan publishing an essay [...] "Here Comes the Groom" [...] in The New Republic in August 1989 arguing for same-sex marriage: [...] "A need to rebel <b>has</b> <b>quietly</b> ceded to a desire to belong." [...] In September 1989, the State Bar Association of California urged recognition of marriages between homosexuals even before gay rights advocates adopted the issue.|$|E
2500|$|On February 23, 2015, Upfront Ventures, {{the largest}} early-stage fund raised in L.A since 2000, {{appointed}} Chamillionaire as an entrepreneur in residence. This {{marks the first}} time an honor of this kind has been bestowed upon a rap artist. Chamillionaire hopes that this pivotal new role will allow him to help usher in the next generation of tech entrepreneurs as well as continue to offer valuable advice and investment capital to worthy start-ups. A spokesperson for Upfront Ventures has stated that; [...] "Chamillionaire brings a wealth of expertise in this area to the table based on his own years of employing successful tech and marketing strategies as both an independent music artist and later a label partner with Universal Records. Add to that he <b>has</b> <b>quietly</b> been a fixture in the tech world for many years: attending major conferences both as a keynote and audience member, making him a sought-after promotional partner, advisor and potential investor. It was in this capacity that he met Upfront partner, Mark Suster, in 2009, becoming one of the earliest co-investors in Maker Studios, now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company." [...] In a letter penned by Mark Suster explaining the week he's had at Upfront Ventures in Los Angeles, he explains the presence of Chamillionaire around the office. [...] "The same Chamillionaire who was showing us how to get our respective shines on not a decade ago. But if Kanye has taught us anything, it's that we can find success in multiple creative outlets. In the past five years or so, Cham has been quietly but actively involved in the tech startup scene, from speaking on social media engagement in the music industry to hanging out with Y Combinator associates." ...|$|E

6000|$|This last volume {{has given}} us a higher {{conception}} of Mr. Whittier's powers. We already valued as they deserved his force of faith, his earnestness, the glow and hurry of his thought, and the (if every third stump-speaker among us were not a Demosthenes, we should have said Demosthenean) eloquence of his verse; but here we meet him in a softer and more meditative mood. He seems a Berserker turned Carthusian. The half-mystic tone of [...] "The Shadow and the Light" [...] contrasts strangely, and, we think, pleasantly, with the warlike clang of [...] "From Perugia." [...] The years deal kindly with good men, and we find a clearer and richer quality in these verses where the ferment is over and the rile <b>has</b> <b>quietly</b> settled. We have had no more purely American poet than Mr. Whittier, none in whom the popular thought found such ready and vigorous expression. The future will not fail to do justice to a man who has been so true to the present.|$|E
60|$|But I lay aside my pen amidst {{an ominous}} silence and the {{disappearance}} of the venerable head from my plane of vision.

The very pages I have devoted to an exposition of his deceit he <b>has</b> <b>quietly</b> abstracted, and I find them covered with cabalistic figures and wild-looking hieroglyphs traced with his forefinger dipped in ink, which doubtless in his own language conveys a scathing commentary on my composition. But he sleeps peacefully, and there is something in his face which tells me that he has already wandered away to that dim region of his youth where I cannot follow him. And as there comes a strange stirring at my heart when I contemplate the immeasurable gulf which lies between us, and how slight and feeble as yet is his grasp on this world and its strange realities, I find, too late, that I also am a willing victim of the Venerable Impostor.|$|E

6000|$|... "You conferred your 'a' upon New England, too, {{and there}} it remains; it has not {{traveled}} out of the narrow limits of those six little states in all these {{two hundred and fifty}} years. All England uses it, New England's small population--say four millions--use it, but we have forty-five millions who do not use it. You say 'glahs of wawtah,' so does New England; at least, New England says 'glahs.' America at large flattens the 'a', and says 'glass of water.' These sounds are pleasanter than yours; you may think they are not right--well, in English they are not right, but in 'American' they are. You say 'flahsk' and 'bahsket,' and 'jackahss'; we say 'flask,' 'basket,' 'jackass'--sounding the 'a' as it is in 'tallow,' 'fallow,' and so on. Up to as late as 1847 Mr. Webster's Dictionary had the impudence to still pronounce 'basket' bahsket, when he knew that outside of his little New England all America shortened the 'a' and paid no attention to his English broadening of it. However, it called itself an English Dictionary, so it was proper enough that it should stick to English forms, perhaps. It still calls itself an English Dictionary today, but it <b>has</b> <b>quietly</b> ceased to pronounce 'basket' as if it were spelt 'bahsket.' In the American language the 'h' is respected; the 'h' is not dropped or added improperly." ...|$|E

Vast numbers were carried to the Schloss:" [...] one figures Wilhelmina among them, figures the Hereditary Prince and old Margraf: their treatment there was [...] "beyond belief," [...] says Fassmann; [...] "not only dinner of the amplest quality and quantity, but much money added and other gifts." [...] From Baireuth the route is towards Gera and Thuringen, circling the Bamberg Territory: readers remember Gera, where the Gera Bond was made?--"At Gera, a commercial gentleman dined the whole party in his own premises, and his wife gave four groschen to each individual of them; other two persons, brothers in the place, doing the like. One of the poor pilgrim women had been brought to bed on the journey, a day or two before: the Commissarius lodged her in his own inn, for greater safety; Commissarius returning to his inn, finds she is off, nobody at first can tell him whither: a lady of quality (VORMEHME DAME) <b>has</b> <b>quietly</b> sent her carriage for the poor pilgrim sister, and has her in the right softest keeping.
