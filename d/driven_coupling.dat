40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{framework}} for robust 3 D tracking, using a dynamic data <b>driven</b> <b>coupling</b> of continuous and discrete methods {{to overcome their}} limitations. Our method uses primarily the continuousbased tracking which is replaced by the discrete one, to obtain model re-initializations when necessary. We use the error in the continuous tracking to learn off-line, based on SVMs, when the continuous-based tracking fails and switch between the two methods. We develop a novel discrete method for 3 D shape configuration estimation, which utilizes both frame and multi-frame features, {{taking into account the}} most recent input frames, using a time-window. We therefore overcome the error accumulation over time, that most continuous methods suffer from and simultaneously reduce the discrete methods complexity and prevent possible multiple solutions in shape estimation. We demonstrate the power of our framework in complex hand tracking sequences with large rotations, articulations, lighting changes and occlusions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between thin structures and incompressible Newtonian fluids is ubiquitous both {{in nature and}} in industrial applications. In this paper we present an isogeometric formulation of such problems which exploits a boundary integral formulation of Stokes equations to model the surrounding flow, and a non linear Kirchhoff-Love shell theory to model the elastic behaviour of the structure. We propose three different coupling strategies: a monolithic, fully implicit coupling, a staggered, elasticity <b>driven</b> <b>coupling,</b> and a novel semi-implicit coupling, where {{the effect of the}} surrounding flow is incorporated in the non-linear terms of the solid solver through its damping characteristics. The novel semi-implicit approach is then used to demonstrate the power and robustness of our method, which fits ideally in the isogeometric paradigm, by exploiting only the boundary representation (B-Rep) of the thin structure middle surface.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of network {{structure and the}} spreading of epidemic are common coexistent dynamical processes. In most cases, network structure is treated either static or time-varying, supposing the whole network is observed in a same time window. In this paper, we consider the epidemic spreading on a network consisting of both static and time-varying structures. At meanwhile, the time-varying part and the epidemic spreading {{are supposed to be}} of the same time scale. We introduce a static and activity <b>driven</b> <b>coupling</b> (SADC) network model to characterize the coupling between static (strong) structure and dynamic (weak) structure. Epidemic thresholds of SIS and SIR model are studied on SADC both analytically and numerically with various coupling strategies, where the strong structure is of homogeneous or heterogeneous degree distribution. Theoretical thresholds obtained from SADC model can both recover and generalize the classical results in static and time-varying networks. It is demonstrated that weak structures can make the epidemics break out much more easily in homogeneous coupling but harder in heterogeneous coupling when keeping same average degree in SADC networks. Furthermore, we show there exists a threshold ratio of the weak structure to have substantive effects on the breakout of the epidemics. This promotes our understanding of why epidemics can still break out in some social networks even we restrict the flow of the population...|$|E
40|$|I {{propose that}} there is a purely phonological drive to impose a reduplication-like {{structure}} (‘coupling’) on words. This structure can lead to enhancement or preservation of word-internal self-similarity. The case of vowel raising in Tagalog loan stems is examined in detail. Raising can be blocked in order to preserve similarity between the stem penult and the stem ultima. The more similar the penult and ultima along various dimensions, the more likely coupling is, and thus the more likely resistance to raising. I attribute phonologically <b>driven</b> <b>coupling</b> to the activity of a constraint Redup in generation, which shapes the way new words are lexicalised in the vowel raising case, but also consider an alternative source for reduplicative construals (the effect of *Spec in lexical learning). The proposal is compared to others that promote correspondence between similar or identical single segments within a word; I conclude that a relation between strings is necessary. 3 Aggressive Reduplication * Loans and rare words are often ‘repaired ’ by speakers to obey native phonotactics, as in the frequent pronunciation of English diphthong as dipthong, which avoids a sequence of fricatives.

40|$|This is {{the second}} {{of a series of}} three papers {{examining}} how viable it is for entanglement to be sustained at high temperatures for quantum systems in thermal equilibrium (Case A), in nonequilibrium (Case B) and in nonequilibrium steady state conditions (Case C). The system we analyze here consists of two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators each interacting with its own bath described by a scalar field, set at temperatures T_ 1 > T_ 2. For constant bilinear inter-oscillator coupling studied here (Case C 1) owing to the Gaussian nature, the problem can be solved exactly at arbitrary temperatures even for strong coupling. We find that the valid entanglement criterion in general is not a function of the bath temperature difference, in contrast to thermal transport in the same NESS setting [1]. Thus lowering the temperature of one of the thermal baths does not necessarily help to safeguard the entanglement between the oscillators. Indeed, quantum entanglement will disappear if any one of the thermal baths has a temperature higher than the critical temperature T_c. With the Langevin equations derived we give a full display of how entanglement dynamics in this system depends on T_ 1, T_ 2, the inter-oscillator coupling and the system-bath coupling strengths. For weak oscillator-bath coupling the critical temperature T_c is about the order of the inverse oscillator frequency, but for strong oscillator-bath coupling it will depend on the bath cutoff frequency. We conclude that in most realistic circumstances, for bosonic systems in NESS with constant bilinear coupling, `hot entanglement' is largely a fiction. In Paper III we will examine the case (C 2) of time-dependent <b>driven</b> <b>coupling</b> which contains the parametric pumping type described in [2] wherein entanglement was first shown to sustain at high temperatures.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{dynamics}} of externally driven open quantum systems. Using the path integral methods we found an analytical expression for time-dependent density matrix of two externally <b>driven</b> <b>coupled</b> quantum oscillators interacting with different baths of oscillators. It is shown that at the zeroing of external forces the density matrix becomes identical to the previously obtained one for freely developing coupled oscillators. Mean values of observables are computed by using the Hermitian part of the matrix. All elements of the covariance matrix composed by coordinates and momenta of two <b>driven</b> <b>coupled</b> oscillators are calculated. The time-dependent mean values, dispersions and covariances of coordinates of coupled oscillators at given external forces are numerically studied. It is shown that the larger the coupling constant the larger is the disturbances of the second oscillator due to external action on the first oscillator. Coupled dynamics of forced oscillators at relatively large coupling constant is demonstrated at different thermodynamic conditions. Comment: 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|A few {{components}} and debris collected from an aeroengine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of a crashed helicopter were sent to this laboratory for analysis. The items received for laboratory tests/investigation are: (a) <b>drive</b> sleeve, (b) <b>coupling</b> sleeve, (c) debris/deposits and (d) non-metallic pieces collected from {{various parts of the}} engine, and (e) metal pieces collected from magnetic chip detector (MCD). Debris collected from various parts of the engine was found to be either dust and soil or fragments of non-metallic fabric that was used {{in some parts of the}} engine. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic particles collected from the MCD were from the shaved off splines of <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves. The mode of failure in the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves was identified to be progressive in nature. There were three fatigue cracks in the coupling sleeve; all of them being initiated at the spline root region. However, it is to be noted that no fracture was associated with these cracks. Hence, fatigue cracks per se were not responsible for the failure of the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves. Rather, evidences suggest that the fatigue crack initiation and propagation had occurred subsequent to some other mechanism of failure. It was not possible to unambiguously establish the mode of failure of the splines of the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves because of the severe destruction that took place following the failure. But, there were tell-tale marks on the working flank of the available portion of the splines, which were indicative of relative movement between these components in the axial direction. Considering the nature of failure in the present case, this assumes significance. Analysis shows that in the event of such movement, wear on the meshing surfaces of the splines is inevitable. As wear progresses, the clearance between the engaging splines increases. This induces cyclic load of higher magnitude on the splines which increases the vulnerability for fatigue crack initiation at the spline root region. Moreover, the wear on the splines results in loss of material and thereby reduces cross section of the splines. When the cross section reduces to critical limit such that the splines can no longer sustain the application load, they fold or shear off. Although direct evidences to this proposed mechanism is scarce on the component because of the post failure destruction, available signatures, however, point towards such a sequence of failure. This is further supported by metallurgical investigation wherein both <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves were found conforming to the specifications with respect to (a) chemical composition, (b) microstructure, (c) surface treatment, and (d) hardness profile. The reason(s) for possible axial movement between the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves, however, could not be established from the laboratory investigation. In view of the progressive failure in the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves, it is justifiable to state that the failure in these components was primarily responsible for the sudden loss of power in the engine. This report provides a detailed account of laboratory investigation with test results and analysis. Also, a few recommendations are suggested for identification of probable cause(s) which could give rise to axial movement between <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves...|$|R
