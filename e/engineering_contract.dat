In the project implementation process, the legal risk loss will be immeasurable. The characteristics of legal risk make it predictable and preventable, thus strengthening international <b>engineering</b> <b>contracting</b> legal risk identification and coping strategies {{has a certain}} practical significance. This article starts from the related theory of legal risks, study our international <b>engineering</b> <b>contracting</b> market development process. On the basis of case studies, from the formation mechanism and {{the process and the}} type of legal risk to measure the international <b>engineering</b> <b>contracting</b> legal risk.
