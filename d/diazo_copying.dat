50|$|Tracing {{paper is}} paper made to have low opacity, {{allowing}} light to pass through. It was originally developed for architects and design engineers to create drawings {{which could be}} copied precisely using the diazo copy process, it then found many other uses. The original use for drawing and tracing was largely superseded by technologies which do not require <b>diazo</b> <b>copying</b> or manual copying (by tracing) of drawings.|$|E
50|$|The paper {{used for}} the <b>diazo</b> <b>copies</b> is usually a bond paper or similar type, with a diazo coating {{sensitive}} to the UV light.|$|R
50|$|The <b>diazo</b> <b>copies</b> are of {{different}} sizes {{and for this reason}} the diazo paper is obtainable in standard sizes that vary from 30 cm to 60 cm wide, after de process the copied paper can be cut to the desired size.|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine quality criteria for continuous-tone diazo film reproductions. The rank-order method was used to acquire judgement data {{from a group of}} experienced photographic scientists evaluating diazo reproductions varying in exposure level and tone reproduction contrast. Analysis of the data resulted in the conclusion that a high degree of agreement does exist between the judges, the quality of a <b>diazo</b> <b>copy</b> depends significantly on the exposure level and the silver positive input, and maximum density and tone reproduction contrast could be possible quality criteria for diazo reproductions...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{land use}} in the Phoenix (1 : 250, 000 scale) Quadrangle in Arizona have been mapped using only the images from ERTS- 1, tending to verify the utility of a land use {{classification}} system proposed for use with ERTS images. The period of change investigated was from November 1970 to late summer or early fall, 1972. Seasonal changes also were studied using successive ERTS images. Types of equipment used to aid interpretation included a color additive viewer, a twenty-power magnifier, a density slicer, and a <b>diazo</b> <b>copy</b> machine for making ERTS color composites in hard copy. Types of changes detected have been: (1) cropland or rangeland developed for new residential areas; (2) rangeland converted to new cropland; and (3) possibly new areas of industrial or commercial development. A map of land use previously compiled from air photos was updated in this manner...|$|R
