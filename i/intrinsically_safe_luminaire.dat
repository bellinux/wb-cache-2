The robot enables remote measurements of the concentrations of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, temperature, and humidity. Cameras enable the robot to observe {{the state of the}} excavation. All electronic circuits of the robot, for measurements, control, transmission, and supply, are <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe.</b> The transmission of data and control commands from/to the operator’s console are performed via an electric wire. Moreover, the wire enables to transmit <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> electric energy and is used to charge one of the accumulators. Thanks to that, the robot can operate in an isolated excavation for 3 months. An <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> pneumatic drive has been applied for setting wheels in motion. The non-commercial robot prototype was tested in a real excavation in an active hard coal mine. The technical solutions have been presented in the paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a characterization {{of a single}} Grounding System (GS) or a set of interconnected GSs, according to their safety level and defines their condition of “conventionally safe” and “intrinsically safe”.

It is proposed a new definition of Global Grounding Systems (GGSs) revising that offered by the Standards IEC 61936 - 1 /EN 50522.

40|$|Robots {{designed}} for surgery have three main advantages over humans. They have greater three dimensional spatial accuracy, are more reliable, and can achieve much greater precision. Although few surgical robots are yet {{in clinical trials}} one or two have advanced to the stage of seeking approval from the UK's Medical Devices Agency and the US Federal Drug Administration. Safety is a key concern. A robotic device can be designed in an <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> way by restricting its range of movement to an area where it can do no damage. Furthermore, safety can be increased by making it passive, guided at all times by a surgeon. Nevertheless, {{some of the most}} promising developments may come from robots that are active (monitored rather than controlled by the surgeon) and not limited to <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> motion...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research in}} the area of solenoid modelling and design. It is anticipated that the model described will contribute to the design of solenoids for operation in an <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> environment Firstly, the requirements for intrinsic safety are described including an overview of the complete system. The relevant standards to be applied are highlighted and the optimum power rating for a solenoid working in an <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> system is derived. The mathematical model is then described together with the assumptions made. The model is able to determine the most efficient gauge of wire to use for a given solenoid resistance from the dimensions of a solenoid coil former, and from this data calculate the expected force generated by the solenoid. The basis of the model is the probable flux path method of solenoid analysis. The method for verifying the model are then discussed as well as a complete analysis of an existing <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> solenoids. The purpose for the analysis of an existing solenoid was undertaken so that a set of solenoid design rules may be established. The design rules will enable the user to design for the exact requirements for the pneumatic comppnents based on the solenoid operating pressure. Finally, methods for reducing the manufacturing time and improving the assembly time of the solenoid are presented...|$|R

40|$|<b>Intrinsically</b> <b>Safe</b> ” (IS) is a {{protection}} certification {{for safe operation}} with electronic equipment in explosive atmospheres. The concept was developed for safe operation of process control instrumentation in hazardous areas, particularly around petro-chemicals. A device termed “intrinsically safe ” is designed and certified to eliminate or encapsulate any components that produce sparks or which could generate enough heat to cause an ignition in areas with flammable gasses, dusts or fuels. Cell phones, smart phones, PDA’s and other hand held devices can be ignition sources for explosives. A truly <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> cell phone will not ignite explosives. Understanding IS approval ratings can be a difficult proposition.

S. and Canada organize hazardous areas by classes, divisions, and groups and certify devices for use in those areas under the UL 913 Standard. Europe applies...|$|R
40|$|The IEC Standard 61936 - 1 “Power {{installations}} exceeding 1 kV a. c. ” {{defines the}} “Global Grounding System” (GGS) as an equivalent grounding system that ensures “no dangerous touch voltages”. This paper deals with {{an analysis of}} the parameters that characterize the behavior of Grounding Systems (GSs) operating in the same zone of influence and proposes to recognize four levels of “globality”. With this aim, the geometric criterion and the safety criterion are introduced to identify the zone of influence (ZOI). The safety criterion allows for identifying a GGS and allows for characterizing the global zone of influence of a GGS. This paper highlights the relevance to recognize the definition of <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> for a GS that guarantees safe touch/ step voltages lower than permissible permanent voltages. An integration of many coexisting GSs for constitution and extension naturally can reach the level of an <b>intrinsically</b> <b>safe</b> GS and so of a GGS...|$|R
