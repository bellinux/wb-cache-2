2500|$|Kierkegaard {{seems to}} have {{genuinely}} loved Regine {{but was unable to}} reconcile the prospect of marriage with his vocation as a writer, his passionate, introspective Christianity and his constant melancholy. [...] Regine was shattered by his rejection of her, and was unwilling to accept Kierkegaard's breaking of their engagement, threatening to kill herself if he did not take her back. [...] Kierkegaard attempted to quell her interest, he later wrote, [...] "there was nothing else for me to do but to venture to the uttermost, to support her, if possible, by means of deception, to do everything to repel her <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> order to rekindle her pride." [...] He wrote her cold, calculated letters {{in order to make it}} seem that he didn't love her anymore, but Regine clung to the hope that they would get back together, desperately pleading to him to take her back. [...] On October 11, 1841, Kierkegaard met with her and again broke off the engagement in person. [...] Her father tried to persuade him to reconsider after assessing Regine's desperate condition, claiming that [...] "It will be the death of her; she is in total despair" [...] Kierkegaard returned the next day and spoke with Regine. To her query as to whether he would ever marry, Kierkegaard icily responded: [...] "Well, yes, in ten years, when I have begun to simmer down and I need a lusty young miss to rejuvenate me." [...] In reality, Kierkegaard had no such plans, and would remain a celibate bachelor for the rest of his life.|$|E
