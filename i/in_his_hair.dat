5|$|Edward's unorthodox {{approach}} to his role also {{extended to the}} coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that {{of his or her}} predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done), to show the parting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair.</b> Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare. When George VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain the tradition by suggesting that, had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have shown him facing right.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} modern {{studies that have}} {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives. Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{smelting}} was independently {{invented in}} different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair,</b> a sign that he was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E

He is portrayed as an eccentric who prefers the company of animals to people, at one point using his powers to heal a dying hedgehog. Radagast is shown to be able to communicate with birds, some of which nest <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair.</b> In the film, Radagast is the first wizard to visit Dol Guldur after he realizes that an evil power has infected the wood he lives in. He discovers that a Necromancer (Sauron) has taken residence in the ruined fortress. In Dol Guldur he encounters the spirit of the Witch-king of Angmar, as well as the shadow of the Necromancer himself, and escapes with the Morgul blade taken from the Witch-king.|$|E

500|$|In the 18th century lead {{poisoning}} was fairly frequent {{on account of}} the widespread drinking of rum, which was made in stills with a lead component (the [...] "worm"). It was a significant cause of mortality amongst slaves and sailors in the colonial West Indies. Lead poisoning from rum was also noted in Boston. Benjamin Franklin suspected lead to be a risk in 1786. Also in the 18th century, [...] "Devonshire colic" [...] was the name given to the symptoms suffered by people of Devon who drank cider made in presses that were lined with lead. Lead was added to cheap wine illegally in the 18th and early 19th centuries as a sweetener. The composer Beethoven, a heavy wine drinker, suffered elevated lead levels (as later detected <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair)</b> possibly due to this; the cause of his death is controversial, but {{lead poisoning}} is a contender as a factor.|$|E
500|$|Depp wears a dreadlock wig in a rock-and-roll {{approach}} to a pirate aesthetic. He wears a red bandanna and numerous objects <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair,</b> influenced by Keith Richards' habit of collecting souvenirs from his travels; Sparrow's decorations include his [...] "piece of eight". Sparrow wears kohl around his eyes, which was inspired by Depp's study of nomads, whom he compared to pirates, and he wore contacts that acted as sunglasses. Sparrow has several gold teeth, two of which belong to Depp, although they were applied during filming. Depp initially forgot to have them removed after shooting The Curse of the Black Pearl, and wore them throughout the shooting of the sequels. Like all aspects of Depp's performance, Disney initially expressed great concern over Depp's teeth. Sparrow wears his goatee in two braids. Initially wire was used in them, but the wires were abandoned because they made the braids stick up when Depp lay down. Sparrow has numerous tattoos, and has been branded a pirate on his right arm by Cutler Beckett, underneath a tattoo of a sparrow.|$|E
500|$|Sitting Bull {{was born}} on land later {{included}} in the Dakota Territory. In 2007, Sitting Bull's great-grandson asserted from family oral tradition that Sitting Bull was born along the Yellowstone River, south of present-day Miles City, Montana. He was named Jumping Badger at birth, and nicknamed Hunkesi, or [...] "Slow," [...] said to describe his careful and unhurried nature. [...] When the boy was fourteen years old he accompanied a group of Lakota warriors (which included {{his father and his}} uncle Four Horns) in a raiding party to take horses from a camp of Crow warriors. Jumping Badger displayed bravery by riding forward and counting coup on one of the surprised Crow, which was witnessed by the other mounted Lakota. [...] Upon returning to camp his father gave a celebratory feast at which he conferred his own name upon his son. [...] The name, Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake, [...] which in the Lakota language means [...] "Buffalo Bull Who Sits Down", would later be abbreviated to [...] "Sitting Bull". [...] Thereafter, Sitting Bull's father was known as Jumping Bull. [...] At this ceremony before the entire band, Sitting Bull's father presented his son with an eagle feather to wear <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair,</b> a warrior's horse, and a hardened buffalo hide shield to mark his son's passage into manhood as a Lakota warrior.|$|E

500|$|Siegfried Kracauer said by {{coupling}} {{a fantasy}} in which Francis overthrows a tyrannical authority, with {{a reality in}} which authority triumphs over Francis, Caligari reflects a double aspect of German life, suggesting they reconsider their traditional belief in authority even as they embrace it. A contrast between levels of reality exists {{not only in the}} characterizations, but in the presentation of some of the scenes as well. This, as Barlow writes, [...] "reveals a contrast between external calm and internal chaos". For example, flashback scenes when Francis reads Dr. Caligari's diary, in which the doctor is shown growing obsessed with learning hypnotic powers, take place as Dr. Caligari is sleeping peacefully in the present. Another example is the fair, which on the surface appears to represent fun and escapism, but reveals a lurking sense of chaos and disaster in the form of Dr. Caligari and Cesare. The visual elements of the film also convey a sense of duality, particularly in the contrasts between black and white. This is particularly prevalent in the sets, where black shadows are set against white walls, but also in other elements like the costumes and make-up. For instance, Dr. Caligari wears mostly black, but white streaks are present <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> and on his gloves. Cesare's face is a ghostly white, but the darks of his eyes are heavily outlined in black. Likewise, Jane's white face contrasts with her deep, dark eyes.|$|E
