40|$|Because {{clinical}} trial agreements (CTAs) are complex business and legal documents unique to every sponsor, inexperienced sites often sign them without negotiating or even reading them. Even experienced sites can miss important points. eStudySite is an experienced, free-standing clinical research center that conducts 30 - 40 studies {{per year for}} pharmaceutical and biotech sponsors. Because the organization of every CTA template is different, we created the checklist in Exhibit 1 to facilitate a thorough review of the contract. Using the MAGI Model CTA as a guide, we have identified common issues that sponsor CTA templates frequently do not address, or that need clarification. 1 We also negotiate other points on a case-by-case basis. Different sites have different priorities, so their checklists will vary. When a CTA template comes in the door, we review the contract with checklist in hand. Then we redline-edit the CTA, sometimes cutting and pasting directly from the checklist or the MAGI Model CTA. In our experience, sponsors immediately accept about 70 % of our proposed changes. We negotiate the remaining 30 % depending upon the historic and strategic relationship with the sponsor, likely profitability of the study, relative risk-exposures, study duration, and other considerations. Every item in the checklist is acceptable to at least some sponsors. Exhibit 1. Clinical Trial Agreement Checklist • Parties to the agreement Party is “eStudySite”. If a hospital {{needs to be a}} party to the agreement, create a separate contract between eStudySite and the hospital, or put financial information in a separate <b>document</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> to the hospital. Sponsor can directly indemnify hospital. • Protocol Amendments “If, in Site’s judgment, any modifications or addendums, collectively {{from the beginning of the}} Study at Site, increase Site’s costs by more than 2 %, Sponsor will increase the Budget accordingly or Site may terminate this Agreement. ” • Monitoring Visits “First monitoring visit will occur within 2 weeks after first subject is enrolled, or sooner if enrollment is expected to exceed 1 subject per week. ...|$|E

5000|$|One {{of their}} primary targets was the IRS, with which Scientology {{was engaged in}} a bitter battle over tax exemptions.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{real-time}} tweet search task operationalized in the TREC Microblog evaluations, a topic {{consists of}} a query Q and a time t, modeling the task where the user wishes to see the most recent but rele-vant tweets that address the information need. To simulate the real-time aspect of the task in an evaluation setting, many systems search over the entire collection and then discard results that occur after the query time. This approach, while computationally efficient, “cheats ” in that it takes advantage of term statistics from <b>documents</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> at query time (i. e., future information). We show, however, that such results are nearly identical to a “gold standard ” method that builds a separate index for each topic containing only those documents that occur before the query time. The implications of this finding on evaluation, system design, and user task models are discussed. ...|$|R

The recently acquired 56.5 m long RV Sindhu Sankalp serves primarily on the continental margins, but it is capable of open-sea voyages.
