40|$|Many aquatic birds use sounds {{extensively}} for in-air communication. Regardless of this, we {{know very}} little about their <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities.</b> The in-air audiogram of a male adult great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) was determined using psychophysical methods (method of constants). Hearing thresholds were derived using pure tones of five different frequencies. The lowest threshold was at 2  kHz: 18  dB re 20  µPa rms. Thresholds derived using signal detection theory were within 2  dB of the ones derived using classical psychophysics. The great cormorant is more sensitive to in-air sounds than previously believed and its <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> are comparable to several other species of birds of similar size. This knowledge is important for our understanding of the <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> of other species of sea birds. It {{can also be used to}} develop cormorant deterrent devices for fisheries, as well as to assess the impact of increasing in-air anthropogenic noise levels on cormorants and other aquatic birds...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTinnitus is {{a common}} symptom of hearing impairment. Patients who are bilaterally hard of hearing are often {{affected}} by tinnitus. However, they cannot undergo any of the standard tinnitus therapies, since they rely on hearing. Cochlear implantation (CI) used to treat severe hearing disabilities, such as bilateral hearing loss, was also shown to reduce tinnitus. Our goal {{was to determine if}} CI induces sustained reduction of tinnitus. We performed prospective, longitudinal analyses of tinnitus-related distress in a uniform group of bilaterally deafened patients after CI. Patients and MethodsThe homogenous sample consisted of 41 patients who met the inclusion criteria and were consecutively included in this study. The impact of unilateral CI on tinnitus-related distress, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> was studied with validated instruments. The follow-up appointments were scheduled at 6, 12, and 24 [*]months after CI surgery. During the appointments, <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> were estimated with monosyllabic Freiburg test, whereas the tinnitus-related distress, the HRQoL, and the subjective hearing were measured with standard questionnaires [Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ), Nijmegen Cochlear Implantation Questionnaire, and Oldenburg Inventory, respectively]. ResultsTinnitus-related distress decreased significantly from the mean TQ score of 35. 0 (SD[*]=[*] 19. 6) prior to surgery to the mean TQ[*]=[*] 27. 54 (SD[*]=[*] 20. 0) 6 [*]months after surgery and remained sustained low until the end of follow-up period. In addition, CI significantly improved the <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> and the HRQoL of all patients. ConclusionThe results from our prospective study suggest that in a homogenous sample of bilaterally deafened, implanted patients who report having tinnitus prior to surgery, CI alone not only improves the <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> but also significantly reduces the tinnitus-related distress and improves the HRQoL in a sustained way...|$|R
40|$|Otolithic end organs in fishes {{function}} as accelerometers and {{are involved in}} the senses of balance and hearing (e. g. Popper et al. 2005). Otolith mass and shape are likely decisive factors influencing otolith motion, but while it is largely unknown how different shapes affect otolith movement relative to the sensory epithelium (Popper et al. 2005), greater otolith mass is predicted to result in enhanced stimulation of sensory hair cells and improved hearing (Lychakov and Rebane 2005). What few studies exist on this topic, however, yielded contradicting results in that they did or did not find a correlation between increased otolith mass and enhanced hearing (see Kéver et al. 2014). We investigated the relationship between otolith morphology (including 3 D-models of otoliths based on high-resolution microCT imaging and otolith weight) and <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> in cichlids while comparing three species (Etroplus maculatus, Hemichromis guttatus, Steatocranus tinanti) with different swimbladder morphology and <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> (Schulz-Mirbach et al. 2014). We predicted Etroplus maculatus—the species that displays the best hearing sensitivities—to possess larger/heavier otoliths. As swimbladder extensions in this species are connected to the lagena, we further predicted to find heavier lagenar otoliths. Compared to H. guttatus and S. tinanti, E. maculatus showed the heaviest saccular otoliths, while lagenar otoliths were significantly thinner and lighter than in the former two species, apparently contradicting the hypothesis that the lagena and its otolith are primarily involved in improved <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities.</b> Our results support {{the idea that there is}} no ‘simple’ relationship between otolith weight, ancilliary auditory structures and <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities.</b> 3 D-models of inner ears and otoliths may be ideally suited for future studies modeling complex otolith motion and thus, may provide a better understanding of how otolith morphology contributes to inner ear functions...|$|R
25|$|Hearing {{plays an}} {{important}} part in both speech generation and comprehension. When speaking, the person can hear their speech, and the brain uses what it hears as a feedback mechanism to fix speech errors. If a single feedback correction occurs multiple times, the brain will begin to incorporate the correction to all future speech, making it a feed forward mechanism. This is apparent in some deaf people. Deafness, as well as other, smaller deficiencies in hearing, can greatly affect one's ability to comprehend spoken language, as well as to speak it. However, if the person loses <b>hearing</b> <b>ability</b> later in life, most can still maintain a normal level of verbal intelligence. This is thought to be because of the brain's feed forward mechanism still helping to fix speech errors, {{even in the absence of}} auditory feedback.|$|E
2500|$|De-noise mode is an {{alternative}} to Active noise reduction. It provides for relatively noise-free listening to audio in a noisy environment. In this mode, audio intelligibility is improved due to selective gain reduction of the ambient noise. This method splits external signals into frequency components by [...] "filterbank" [...] (according to the peculiarities of human perception of specific frequencies) and processing them using adaptive audio compressors. Operation thresholds in adaptive audio compressors (in contrast to [...] "ordinary" [...] compressors) are regulated depending on ambient noise levels for each specific bandwidth. Reshaping of the processed signal from adaptive compressor outputs is realised in a synthesis filterbank. This method improves the intelligibility of speech signals and music. The best effect is obtained while listening to audio in the environment with constant noise (in trains, automobiles, planes), or in environments with fluctuating noise level (e.g. in a metro). Improvement of signal intelligibility in condition of ambient noise allows users to hear audio well and preserve <b>hearing</b> <b>ability,</b> in contrast to regular volume amplification.|$|E
2500|$|APD {{has been}} defined anatomically {{in terms of the}} {{integrity}} of the auditory areas of the nervous system. However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is {{made on the basis of}} performance on behavioral auditory tests. Auditory processing is [...] "what we do with what we hear", and in APD there is a mismatch between peripheral <b>hearing</b> <b>ability</b> (which is typically normal) and ability to interpret or discriminate sounds. Thus in those with no signs of neurological impairment, APD is diagnosed on the basis of auditory tests. There is, however, no consensus as to which tests should be used for diagnosis, as evidenced by the succession of task force reports that have appeared in recent years. The first of these occurred in 1996. This was followed by a conference organized by the American Academy of Audiology. Experts attempting to define diagnostic criteria have to grapple with the problem that a child may do poorly on an auditory test for reasons other than poor auditory perception: for instance, failure could be due to inattention, difficulty in coping with task demands, or limited language ability. In an attempt to rule out at least some of these factors, the American Academy of Audiology conference explicitly advocated that for APD to be diagnosed, the child must have a modality-specific problem, i.e. affecting auditory but not visual processing. However, an ASHA committee subsequently rejected modality-specificity as a defining characteristic of auditory processing disorders.|$|E

40|$|Comparing the <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> of echolocating and non-echolocating bats {{can provide}} insight into the effect of {{echolocation}} on more basic <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities.</b> Toward this end, we determined the audiograms of two species of non-echolocating bats, the straw-col-ored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), a large (230 – 350 g) African fruit bat, and the dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis), a small (30 – 45 g) bat native to India and Southeast Asia. A conditioned suppression/avoidance procedure with a fruit juice reward was used for testing. At 60 dB SPL, the hearing range of E. helvum extends from 1. 38 to 41 kHz with best sensitivity at 8 kHz; the hearing range of C. brachyotis extends from 2. 63 to 70 kHz with best sensitivity at 10 kHz. As with all other bats tested so far, neither species was able to hear below 500 Hz, suggesting that they may not use a time code for perceiving pitch. Comparison of the high-frequency <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> of echolocating and non-echolocating bats suggests that the use of laryngeal echolocation has resulted in additional selective pressure to hear high frequencies. However, the typical high-frequency sensitivity of small non-echolocating mammals would have been sufficient to support initial echolocation in the early evolution of bats, a finding that supports the possibility of multiple origins of echolocation...|$|R
2500|$|Digital audio, {{programmable}} control: Both {{the audio}} circuit and the additional control circuits are fully digital. The hearing professional programs {{the hearing aid}} with an external computer temporarily connected to the device and can adjust all processing characteristics on an individual basis. Fully digital circuitry allows implementation of many additional features not possible with analog circuitry, {{can be used in}} all styles of hearing aids and is the most flexible; for example, digital hearing aids can be programmed to amplify certain frequencies more than others, and can provide better sound quality than analog hearing aids. Fully digital hearing aids can be programmed with multiple programs that can be invoked by the wearer, or that operate automatically and adaptively. These programs reduce acoustic feedback (whistling), reduce background noise, detect and automatically accommodate different listening environments (loud vs soft, speech vs music, quiet vs noisy, etc.), control additional components such as multiple microphones to improve spatial hearing, transpose frequencies (shift high frequencies that a wearer may not hear to lower frequency regions where hearing may be better), and implement many other features. Fully digital circuitry also allows control over wireless transmission capability for both the audio and the control circuitry. Control signals in a hearing aid on one ear can be sent wirelessly to the control circuitry in the hearing aid on the opposite ear to ensure that the audio in both ears is either matched directly or that the audio contains intentional differences that mimic the differences in normal binaural hearing to preserve spatial <b>hearing</b> <b>ability.</b> Audio signals can be sent wirelessly to and from external devices through a separate module, often a small device worn like a pendant and commonly called a “streamer”, that allows wireless connection to yet other external devices. This capability allows optimal use of mobile telephones, personal music players, remote microphones and other devices. With the addition of speech recognition and internet capability in the mobile phone, the wearer has optimal communication ability in many more situations than with hearing aids alone. This growing list includes voice activated dialing, voice activated software applications either on the phone or on the internet, receipt of audio signals from databases on the phone or on internet, or audio signals from television sets or from global positioning systems. The first practical, wearable, fully digital hearing aid was invented by Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka. Their work resulted in US Patent 4,548,082, [...] "Hearing aids, signal supplying apparatus, systems for compensating hearing deficiencies, and methods" [...] by A Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka, filed in 1984. This patent formed the basis of all subsequent fully digital hearing aids from all manufacturers, including those produced currently.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Hearing {{comprises}} a {{lot more}} than just a peripheral sensitivity. To interpret such sounds, the participation of wide-ranging <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> is necessary. It is known that a motivating environment plays a key role to develop these abilities. Objective: study the <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> evaluated by the Staggered Spondaic Word test - SSW - in school children aged between 7 and 10 from dissimilar socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Method: A prospective, clinical and watching study. 51 children participated in this study and were divided into two groups in accordance with their socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Accordingly, Group 1 - G 1 - (medium-high class) was comprised of 23 children and Group 2 - G 2 - (medium-low class) had 28 children. SSW test was performed by analyzing both quantitative features: competitive right (CR) and competitive left (CL) conditions and the total of right answers in the test, and qualitative features: order effect (OE), hearing effect (HE), inversions and A-type standard. Results: Quantitative features: a statistically significant difference was found between the studied groups regarding the total of right answers in the test, but not in relation to CR and CL. Qualitative features: a statistically significant difference was noticed for the OE only. Although the statistical analysis has not found a significant difference for all the studied variants, it was possible to observe that G 1 had higher results for all of them. Conclusion: the <b>hearing</b> <b>abilities</b> evaluated by the SSW test in school children aged between 7 and 10 showed higher scores in children with a medium-high socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds in comparison with those of medium-low socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds...|$|R
