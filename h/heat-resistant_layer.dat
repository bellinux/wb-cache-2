40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} for analyzing the thermal {{response of the}} <b>heat-resistant</b> <b>layer</b> composed of high silica fiber reinforced phenolic matrix composites(SiO 2 /P) and aluminum, in which pyrolysis and phase transitions are exsited, such as melt, vaporization and sublimation. Based on this model, the thermal response of the <b>heat-resistant</b> <b>layer</b> with different SiO 2 /P thickness is calculated under a heat flux by using FORTRAN codes. As indicated in the results, the slope of temperature gets a sudden decline at the pyrolysis interface, {{which is due to}} the latent heat of pyrolysis; the thickness of <b>heat-resistant</b> <b>layer</b> has little influence on the heating-surface temperature, however, the back temperature may increase with the decreasing thickness; and the thermal conductivity of carbonized layer is very important to thermal response...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the research results on plasma-hardening of <b>heat-resistant</b> steel <b>layers</b> by plasma-welding deposition of congeneric materials under straight and reverse polarity current. The {{dependence of the}} deposited layer quality on the current polarity has been determined. A metallographic examination and measurement of micro-hardness of the deposited layer have been conducted. The dependence of the deposited layer characteristics on the welding parameters has been determined. The obtained results allow the use of plasma-welding deposition to obtain layers with the required strength characteristics using the material, congeneric to the parent material...|$|R
30|$|Zirconium oxide (ZrO 2) {{has high}} {{refractive}} index, high melting point, high resistance to oxidation, good tribological properties, oxygen ion conductivity, low thermal conductivity, and high coefficient of thermal expansion. ZrO 2 coatings {{are widely used}} in several technological applications such as <b>heat-resistant</b> <b>layers,</b> optical coatings, buffer layers for growing superconductors, oxygen sensors, ion conductors, high-k dielectrics, and thermal barrier coatings[1, 2]. Zirconia (ZrO 2) crystallizes in different polymorphs such as monoclinic (m), tetragonal (t), and cubic (c) at different temperatures in atmospheric pressure. For many high-temperature applications, zirconia is stabilized in its tetragonal structure at room temperature, thus avoiding phase transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic structure at about 1, 233 to 1, 453 K. One of the mechanisms to retain the tetragonal phase of zirconia (t-ZrO 2) is doping with other oxides or controlling the crystallite size of the high-temperature phase (tetragonal and cubic) within a few nanometers[2]. The surface energy of the tetragonal phase is {{lower than that of}} the monoclinic phase for similar crystallite size, and hence, the reduction of crystallite size to a few nanometers could result in stabilizing the tetragonal phase at room temperature[2 – 4]. Formation of Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 nanolaminate structure is an important method to stabilize the high-temperature zirconia phase at room temperature. Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 multilayer films have been used as bond layers of thermal barrier Coatings, dielectric films, and highly transparent materials in optical and protective coatings[2, 3]. Nanolaminates and nanocomposites of ZrO 2 represent a wide spectrum of useful properties. The Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 nanolaminate actively protects medical implant-grade 316 L stainless steel against perforated pitting[5, 6]. The Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 nanolaminate structure provides pinhole-free films, which are suitable for encapsulation layers for large-area organic devices[7]. The Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 ceramic oxide multilayers have high-temperature stability, chemical inertness, and improved mechanical properties, and hence, they find applications in components and equipment where the friction coefficient plays a major role[8].|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} the service life of CCM mold on their narrow sides from M 1 copper {{before the last}} renovation created a <b>heat–resistant</b> wear–resistant <b>layer</b> plating chromium coating. Previously investigated {{the structure of the}} coating, phase composition, hardness and microhardness of the surface layers. As shown by experiments, heat treatment of the walls with an aluminum gas–thermal coating in a protective environment at a temperature of 900 о С and the exposure time 10 h necessary to create the desired thickness of the diffusion layer, leading to them warping {{as a result of this}} process, which is not eliminated by mechanical means. Therefore, it was necessary to adjust the modes of heat treatment or applied to the wall material, not inferior in properties of Cu–Al diffusion layer and which does not require heat treatment. The coating of Nickel alloy was deposited on the entire working surface of the two narrow walls. The required cleanliness class of the working surface of the walls was achieved through machining. Chromium–Nickel coating thickness of 0. 5 – 0. 6 mm were deposited on the surface of the pair of narrow walls of thick–walled mold. The coating on the samples with a Cr–Ni layer consists of three phases: dark, contains the largest amount of chromium and oxygen: (Cr) to 63. 4 %, (O) to 33. 4 %, (Ni) 3, 2 – 9, 1 %; light, within which the detected maximum amount of Nickel to 89 % and sulfur phases: (Ni) = 63, 9 – 73, 5 %, (Cr) to 12. 4 %, (O) = 22 – 24, 9 %, (Fe) to 3. 4 %, (Si) = 0, 3 – 0, 5 % Thus, to obtain the desired cleanliness class of the surface of the walls required machining by grinding and will require work to {{increase the}} thickness of the Chromium–Nickel coating...|$|R
