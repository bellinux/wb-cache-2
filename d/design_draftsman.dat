50|$|After {{the war he}} {{returned}} to Barcelona, where she worked for the company Cros SA had entered the age of 14 as elevator Then, after studying at the School of Industrial and having obtained the title of Master of Industrial and draftsman draftsman, is promoted to the company {{as part of the}} technical office <b>design</b> as a <b>draftsman.</b> Between the years 1948-1953 {{was a member of the}} FAD (Promotion of Decorative Arts), today Promotion of Arts and Design, then located in the dome of the Coliseum on the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes Barcelona, where he attended and participate regularly. From this period is the collection of portraits and drawings of natural, sanguine, gouache, pencil or charcoal. The artistic activity was developed over many years combining his work with Cros and commissions from various industrial graphic design.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{it was not}} {{designed}} as a bank, and has never served as such, the building is nonetheless considered {{to be one of}} Sullivan's [...] "Jewel Boxes," [...] a series of banks designed and built in the Midwest between 1909 and 1919. As in the other [...] "Jewel Boxes," [...] Sullivan included many windows, both on the street side and in the skylight that allowed a great deal of natural light inside. The simple massing of this small, rectangular building with its clearly defined structure makes it typical of Sullivan's later work. The same massing, and similar detailing, particularly the entrance had been used by Sullivan's former associates Purcell & Elmslie in their slightly larger Exchange State Bank in Grand Meadow, Minnesota in 1910 and it is possible that this design influenced Sullivan. (Brooks) Sullivan was assisted in the <b>design</b> by his <b>draftsman,</b> Parker Berry, who drew the perspectives.|$|R
5000|$|Allen {{also taught}} math at the Crown Heights Yeshiva in Brooklyn, where he lived, and the Grace Church School in New York. During his {{more than six}} decades in New York, Allen had a variety of jobs, from factory worker to retail clerk, {{mechanical}} <b>design</b> <b>draftsman,</b> postal mail handler (and member of the Local of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union), and librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library.|$|E
50|$|Bazaar Canton {{was opened}} by Livermore resident, Amy Gee, {{a native of}} Shanghai, China and an {{accomplished}} Chinese watercolor artist. Family friends would have Chinese food for dinner at the Gee residence and ask Ms. Gee and her husband, Stanley Gee, a native of Canton, China and a mechanical <b>design</b> <b>draftsman</b> since 1956 at {{what is now called}} the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, to purchase Chinese groceries from San Francisco and Oakland chinatowns for their own meals.|$|E
50|$|Ko {{was hired}} by the firm's founder, Arthur McLaren (P.Eng), in 1980. A Registered Professional Engineer in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering and a Member of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, Ko progressed through the company, {{starting}} as a <b>Design</b> <b>Draftsman,</b> but later holding positions such as Technical Manager and later Vice-President of Operations. In the four years prior to his purchase of the firm, he managed projects valued in excess of $50 million on behalf of Allied Shipbuilders.|$|E
40|$|This working note {{discusses}} {{design and}} engineering processes at CERN and Computer Aided Design and Engineering tools. The {{main focus of}} this note is Mechanical design and CAE activities and how to share and organize the data produced by CAD/CAE tools. These issues cannot be addressed without taking a global view of the engineering activities at CERN. As {{more and more of}} the detailed design work is done by external suppliers, the design processes at CERN change. Traditional <b>design</b> work where <b>draftsmen</b> are producing drawings on the request from engineers is replaced by conceptual design work done by domain specialists and engineers. Furthermore CAD and FEM tools have evolved from specialist tools to mainstream utilities mastered by most engineers. Design activities nowadays can now be carried out directly by the project engineer without the use of a design (drawing) office. This environment poses different requirements for design- and engineering support activities as well as the selection of CAE-tools. Design activities should be carried out within project teams, while a small central design office should be maintained as a centre of competence for integration studies with CAD and Digital Mockup. Increased focus on CAD-interoperability and data exchange with suppliers is recommended...|$|R
50|$|Cory-Wright {{had trained}} as a <b>design</b> <b>draftsman</b> and spent two years at the University of Birmingham. In 1905, he moved to Zurich in Switzerland to {{undertake}} an engineering apprenticeship with Escher Wyss and Company. During this time, he also followed his passion of mountaineering in the Swiss Alps, while studying for a BSc in engineering from London University. During this time, he supervised the installation and commissioning of Escher Wyss equipment at Kinlochleven power station for Britain's first aluminium smelter at Fort William, in Scotland. By 1910, he had become an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, London.|$|E
50|$|Skidmore {{began working}} with Raymond Hood on the Board of Design, as the <b>design</b> <b>draftsman</b> or junior designer, and also hired Nat Owings. When General Rufus Dawes, head of the Fair, fired all the other architects on the board, Skidmore, being the only one left, became the {{reviewer}} for all the designs that were presented by the various companies for the Fair. As a result, Skidmore became acquainted {{with a lot of}} commercial companies. After the fair, the Museum of Science and Industry was created and for it Skidmore was hired to study the museum in Munich.|$|E
50|$|Gary Crew {{was born}} in Brisbane, Queensland on 23 September 1947. An illness during {{childhood}} kept him home from school but enabled him to develop an interest in reading adventure stories. Crew first trained as a <b>design</b> <b>draftsman</b> and he worked in this field for ten years. When he {{decided to become a}} teacher, his family responsibilities prevented him from accepting an art scholarship and he trained as an English teacher instead. While teaching, he also gained a Master of Arts in Literature from Queensland University. Crew was prompted to begin writing in order to provide relevant reading material for his school students. In 1986, he published his first novel, The Inner Circle and, by 1989, he had left teaching to write full time. Since then, he has written numerous books and won many awards. He has specialised in the areas of Teenage Fiction, Young Adult Fiction, and Children’s Picture Books.|$|E
50|$|In 1951 Nikkolai {{migrated}} to Australia under the International Refugee Scheme of the UN with his grandmother, mother, brother and sister. In 1958 he matriculated in Melbourne University with First Class Honours in Physics and Maths and {{was awarded a}} Commonwealth Scholarship. Around this time his IQ was tested at Melbourne University and he {{was found to have}} an IQ of 192. From 1961 to 1964, whilst employed by the Architectural Department of the Victorian Public Works Department, Ilya studied part-time, completing all subjects but final year design, of a six year Architecture Course at RMIT University. During this time Ilya designed and produced working drawings and specifications for numerous suburban and country police stations. He also designed and remodelled the Turana Youth Remand and Classification Centre, introducing laminated tempered glass in galvanized high tensile steel frames, solving long standing security and maintenance problems. Ilya also designed the dwelling (now part of a Heritage Site), for Rikket’s sanctuary in the Dandenong Ranges (Rikket was a prominent sculptor of mystical aboriginal themes). From 1964 to 1966 Ilya was employed as Architectural <b>Design</b> <b>Draftsman</b> by Godfrey Spowers Hughes Mewton and Lobb, a prominent architectural firm. He worked with teams for The Age Newspaper Building and the Dallas Brookes Hall, which until the completion of the Melbourne Concert Hall, served as Melbourne’s premier concert venue.|$|E
