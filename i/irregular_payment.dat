5000|$|González {{remained}} {{working in}} the midcard, improving his skills and gathering support from the fanbase. This earned him more backstage supporters and a push was planned following Colón's purported retirement. A tournament for the vacant title was announced, supposedly with rounds taking place in several countries. However, this was a mechanism to trigger a push for González, who was receiving vignettes where Colón was depicted training him. Brandi was brought to WWC, claiming {{that he was the}} winner of the other tournament branch. On August 13, 1997, González defeated his former tag team partner to win the Universal Heavyweight Championship. During this reign he was heavily pushed, eventually entering a feud against David Sierra. The belt was held up following a match between them, but González recovered it two weeks later in a rematch. His next feud was precipitated randomly, when [...] "El Nene" [...] interrupted González during a promo, challenging him for the championship. However, this was used to advance the actual storyline, which began with Colón advising him not to accept the challenge. González dropped the title and a confrontation between both ensued after the match, with the differences between both growing during the following months. On May 19, 1998, González won a rematch and went on to turn heel by delivering a promo insulting Colón afterwards. He went on to create a stable known as La Familia del Nuevo Milenio or New Milenium Family and defeated every face wrestler in the midcard, which set up a match between both at Aniversario 1998. In the first night of this event, Colón won the Universal Heavyweight Championship, only to drop it back to González the following night. He went on another successful midcard talent run and held the title until November 26, 1998, losing it to Shane Sewell, before recovering it two days later. On January 6, 1999, González dropped the title in a rematch against Colón, quickly winning it back three days later. González brought in Pierroth, Jr along several Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) wrestlers to 'invade' the WWC, but the Mexican turned on him after claiming being tired of receiving orders. The first contest between them resulted in a double disqualification due to illegal tactics, with the Universal Heavyweight Championship being held up. On April 3, 1999, González won the title back in a hair vs. mask apuestas match, unmasking Pierroth. However, he dropped it in their next encounter. The feud came to a conclusion in a stipulation match, in which the loser would leave WWC, which was won by González. Shortly afterwards, Carly Colón began appearing in WWC events as a cameraman. González began teasing him, prompting another contest against Colón, Sr., who won the championship after his son hit González with a shovel. On November 13, 1999, the title was held up due to outside interference, Colón regained it. González went on to defeat Colón, Sr. and regain the championship in WWC's next event, while Carly Colón began his career entering a major push. Soon, both engaged in a feud, and Colón became the youngest Universal Heavyweight Champion by pinning him on January 29, 2000. González then began bringing in several wrestlers to wrestle Colón for the championship, initially including Álvarez and Hercules Ayala.On February 19, 2000, he defeated Colón to regain the championship. At Aniversario 2000, González dropped the championship to Colón after Álvarez accidentally hit him. González turned on Álvarez, beginning a trend in which he would turn on wrestlers that [...] "failed" [...] the Familia. In this manner he entered a feud with Ayala and brought Curt Hennig to challenge for the title. His next guest challenger was Jerry Flynn. After this feud concluded, González and Colón once again feuded, with him winning the Universal Heavyweight Championship from Álvarez. On November 16, 2000, González defeated WWC President Victor Jovica to win 16% of WWC's stocks. This was used to explain the introduction of his own half-hour segment in WWC programming, [...] "El Café del Milenio". Later that month, he wrestled in a three-way dance against Huertas and Álvarez. In his first match of December, González defeated Colón. He subsequently re-joined Álvarez to wrestle Colón Sr. and Huertas to a no contest. González closed the year by getting disqualified in a match against Hennig, after turning on him in the usual fashion. One of the wrestlers that he brought in was Ricky Fontán, who wrestled as the masked [...] "Super Gladiador". Once he lost the mask to a jobber, La Familia expelled him. In a match against Fontán, the title was held up. On October 26, 2001, González won a rematch to regain the championship. This was followed by a program in which Félix [...] "Barrabás" [...] López and the tag team of Thunder and Lightning, compossed by Reynaldo [...] "Thunder" [...] Rodríguez and Alex [...] "Lightning" [...] Cruz took control of the stable away from González. This led to a brief partnership between him and Colón, who teamed to defeat Thunder and Lighting. However, González turned on him shortly afterwards and recovered control of La Familia del Nuevo Millenio. In Lockout, González dropped the title in another match. González was later invited to participate in two tapings of the X Wrestling Federation, owned by Valentine and Jimmy Hart. In this promotion, he teamed with Konnan to defeat Juventud Guerrera and Psicosis. In his only singles match for the XWF, González defeated Kevin Northcutt. He then brought in another foreign challenger to WWC, Vampiro, only to turn on him. In May 2002, González defeated him by disqualification twice. Subsequently, González left the WWC after wrestling in WWC for over a decade, due to internal conflicts against Colón, Sr. and Jovica following six months of <b>irregular</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to mention {{the relevance of the}} public unconditional cash transfer programme administered by the Social Welfare Fund (SWF).

The dynamics of class among pastoralists in southwestern Panjab provided the framework for the variable pathways and outcomes of localized power transactions among Panjabis and British that produced the colonial state. The transition from <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> to regular taxation and from animal to land capital formed the most important mechanisms of social change in the nineteenth century. In both cases the ruling elites of the precolonial and the colonial states attempted to persuade pastoralists {{to participate in the}} discourses which produced the state. British efforts of sedentarization and state-building succeeded because the exclusionary character of property in land under British law allowed pastoral chiefs to make permanent claims for control of pasture and water. Poorer herders threw in their lot with the state as they became legally and physically excluded from pasture and as their leaders became functionaries of the state and powerful landlords. By according analytical primacy to power transactions at their most local level, this study allows scholars to detach colonialism from its metanarratives, of both the imperialist and nationalist varieties, and to explore a rich middle ground between studies that segregate social and cultural causation. ...|$|E

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} for {{the award}} {{of the degree}} of Masters in Business Administration Health Care Management (MBA-HCM) Introduction: Purchasing of healthcare services is a critical component of healthcare financing. The purchasing mechanism adopted is the key to making health providers deliver better quality, undertake prevention programs that {{have an impact on the}} health of a population and manage healthcare costs. With serious efficiency challenges facing health systems there has been a greater drive to practice strategic purchasing as an efficiency goal in the use of scarce resources. An emerging agenda is how healthcare services could be purchased more strategically to promote quality in service delivery, manage expenditure growth and promote efficiency in service delivery. The study explored the purchasing arrangements for the teacher‟s medical scheme. Methodology: This was an exploratory qualitative study utilizing purposive sampling for the fund managers of the teachers‟ medical scheme and convenience sampling for the beneficiaries of the scheme. Participants were consented and in-depth interview guides used to collect data. Four fund managers and six beneficiaries were interviewed to a point where data saturation was attained. Data was analyzed using thematic content approach with predetermined themes on purchasing. Purchasing elements were compared against the actions of an ideal strategic purchaser and other purchasing actions. Results: The teachers‟ medical scheme has a well-articulated benefit package, uses limited capitation and fee for service as the provider payment mechanisms, contracts providers based on their regional distribution and through accreditation process and utilizes private providers only. Key strategic actions implemented include use of drug formularies, fraud monitoring and providers performance monitoring. Other practices include <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> of providers and lack of benefit updates with changing trends and alignment to populations‟ needs. Conclusion: There is limited strategic purchasing being practiced within the teachers‟ medical scheme especially with regard to the design of the benefit package and provider payment mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} the {{establishment}} of the primary health care (PHC) delivery system in Nigeria, facilities lack the capacity to achieve its objectives. 17 ze situation poses a threat in the nation's effort at achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which is less than 1000 days away. Studies on this focus are few and not really community based. To bridge this gap, current paper seeks to examine the factors retarding the operations of primary health care in Ado-Odo!Ota local government area in Ogzm State Nigeria in order to accelerate health care services especially at the grassroots among other PHC centres in the country. The methodology is based on survey work among all the 16 primary health care facilities within the 16 wards in Ado-Odo!Ota local government area (AOO), from which data were collected from the respondents. The respondents were health personnel available during the period of survey. Using a semi structured questionnaire. On the whole the total number of 16 PHCs was covered in the study. Descriptive and inferential analyses were carried out using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS). The variables referred to are as given on tables 1 to 4.

40|$|Magister Artium (Development Studies) - MA(DVS) Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a marked {{convergence}} in thinking regarding the importance of social cash transfers in poverty alleviation. As such, most governments especially in the developing world have began embracing the idea of rolling out various social cash transfers programmes in a bid to address poverty, social exclusion and vulnerability. This study which is predominantly centred on the LEAP social grant programme in Ghana aims at assessing the impact of the programme in alleviating household poverty in rural Ghana, specifically in the Tolon-Kumbungu district of the Northern region. Through a combination of both qualitative and quantitative strategies, the study focuses on unravelling in how far the programme has contributed to improving the livelihoods and general welfare of beneficiary households in the case study area. Using data from structured household questionnaires, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews conducted in two rural communities (Dingoni and Woribogu), the study establishes that the LEAP social grant has a significant positive impact on food consumption, frequency of utilization of healthcare facilities and the school enrolment rate for children aged 6 - 13 years in beneficiary households. However, although hypothesised, no significant impact is observed in relation to the incidence of child labour in the household. Thus, in line with Rawls’ theory of justice, the researcher argues that the LEAP social grant programme is a very useful mechanism for promoting social justice in the Ghanaian society. Despite its successes, the study also uncovers that, the insufficient nature of the cash transfer, <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> periods, lack of access to complimentary services and lack of transparency and accountability on the part of payment officials are some key challenges confronting the programme from the perspective of beneficiaries, whilst limited staff capacity, the non availability of training opportunities for staff, inadequate logistical support and no motivation for programme staff and voluntary structures also constitute some key challenges from the institutional perspective. In all, the study recommends that government increases the cash amount and pay transfers regularly, link beneficiaries to existing complimentary services in the district, recruit more staff and provide in-service training opportunities for them, strictly monitor compliance to LEAP conditionalities and ensure transparency and accountability in the payment of transfers to beneficiaries...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} address the {{challenges}} facing the community-based health workforce in Zambia, the Ministry of Health implemented the national community health assistant strategy in 2010. The strategy aims to address the challenges by creating {{a new group of}} workers called community health assistants (CHAs) and integrating them into the health system. The first group started working in August 2012. The objective {{of this paper is to}} document their motivation to become a CHA, their experiences of working in a rural district, and how these experiences affected their motivation to work. METHODS: A phenomenological approach was used to examine CHAs' experiences. Data collected through in-depth interviews with 12 CHAs in Kapiri Mposhi district and observations were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Personal characteristics such as previous experience and knowledge, passion to serve the community and a desire to improve skills motivated people to become CHAs. Health systems characteristics such as an inclusive work culture in some health posts motivated CHAs to work. Conversely, a non-inclusive work culture created a social structure which constrained CHAs' ability to learn, to be innovative and to effectively conduct their duties. Further, limited supervision, misconceptions about CHA roles, poor prioritisation of CHA tasks by some supervisors, as well as non- and <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> of incentives also adversely affected CHAs' ability to work effectively. In addition, negative feedback from some colleagues at the health posts affected CHA's self-confidence and professional outlook. In the community, respect and support provided to CHAs by community members instilled a sense of recognition, appreciation and belonging in CHAs which inspired them to work. On the other hand, limited drug supplies and support from other community-based health workers due to their exclusion from the government payroll inhibited CHAs' ability to deliver services. CONCLUSIONS: Programmes aimed at integrating community-based health workers into health systems should adequately consider multiple incentives, effective management, supervision and support from the district. These should be tailored towards enhancing the individual, health system and community characteristics that positively impact work motivation at the local level if such programmes are to effectively contribute towards improved primary healthcare...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the {{increase}} of household debt in Serbia {{as well as in}} the entire region has brought the issue of personal bankruptcy into the spotlight. The adoption of this procedure would enable individuals who are over-indebted and unable to settle out the credit and current payables to file for personal bankruptcy. The main objective of this procedure would be to ensure the maximum reimbursement of creditors' claims from the debtor's available assets and annual revenues. Such a procedure would also provide for the protection of the debtor's basic human rights and dignity. In order to provide a fresh start for the debtor and his financial standing, bankruptcy proceedings commonly include debt write-offs, to some extent. Obviously, personal bankruptcy has two sets of goals, which are mutually inconsistent, contradictory and often incompatible. In order to prevent possible abuses, bankruptcy reasons must be clearly defined and set out in more rigorous terms. This paper analyzes the impact of personal bankruptcy in generating the global economic crisis and the repercussion that personal bankruptcy has had on the global economy. The increase in the number of bankruptcy proceedings filed in the USA in 2005 was a warning about the forthcoming events. Mortgage loans were the major reason for filing a large number of personal bankruptcy claims. In fact, until 2006 the US real estate market had been booming but no one could have guessed then that the real estate values would fall sharply in the years to come. Credit deregulation caused higher demand for mortgage backed loans and the nation's household debt increased significantly. However, the negative selection of debtors, their insolvency and <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> of annuities caused turmoil, which generated major problems for financial institutions. At the end of 2007, nearly 16 percent of all mortgage loans were uncollectible in full. The analysis of events that led to the onset of the global economic crisis and the role of personal bankruptcy as its most probable cause yields a conclusion that the adequate legal regulation of this process is paramount. The experiences of countries that have already introduced this legal institute are invaluable. The countries in the region which have set too rigorous rules for debt write-offs are currently facing the option of undertaking massive write-offs of debtors' claims, which are most unlikely to be objective. On the other hand, in the countries which have envisaged too flexible proceedings for debt write-offs, there is a negative selection of debtors and default of financial institutions. With this experience in mind, it is necessary to regulate and apply the institute of personal bankruptcy so that it provides for the maximum debt collection as well as for accomplishing the major social goals...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine gender {{differences}} in the pattern and level of employment, main characteristics of women's employment and their participation in political institutions, public policy and decision-making process. The analysis contains comparative view pointed out on {{gender differences in}} Serbia and European Union and assessment of anti-discrimination measures and active integrative approach to gender participation. The quantitative data derived from official gender sensitive statistics from EU and UN institutions, supplemented by qualitative findings of recent surveys. The evidence presented in the paper pointed out unfavorable position of women in the labor market, characterized by low economic activity, limited access to managerial position and prestige wages, high unemployment, poverty and vulnerability. The Serbian labor market is characterized by a downward rate of activity of women and a high unemployment rate, the latter being the crucial factor of unequal position. Activity of women at the labor market amounting to 54. 6 % in 2006 relative to the total female population of working age is very low. Economic activity of women is considerably beneath that of men which amounts to 72. 7 % active men as compared to the total male population of working age. Statistics and reports on the structure of the unemployed show that women are more affected by unemployment than men. It is 1. 5 times higher than that of men of the same working age. The unemployment rate in Serbia is one of the highest in Europe, ranging from 21 % to 30 %, depending on the methodology of calculation. The position of unemployed women is determined by poor opportunities to contract full-time employment, low and <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> of unemployment benefits, poor chances for prequalification and professional retraining and a high probability of engagement on unpaid jobs at home or jobs in 'gray economy'. In {{the second part of the}} article the differences and similarities in patterns of political behavior of women in Serbia and European Union are examined, considering participation in governance, decision making and public policy. The analysis emphasizes that women are still under-represented in political system and its institutions in Serbia, more then in the most EU countries. Namely, the number of women in politics in Serbia was dramatically reduced in the course of the nineties due to strengthening of nationalistic politics, ethnic conflicts, economic sanctions and isolation of the country. Relative to the socialist period, when participation of women in parliaments was 17 %, women completely disappeared from the political scene in this period. After the 1992 elections, only 4. 0 % women were elected into the Serbian parliament, and after the elections in 2000, of the 250 members of the Serbian parliament, only 27 (10. 8 %) were women. Finally, participation of women at the 2008 Parliamentary Elections doubled (20, 4 %) following the introduction of quota for the less represented gender in the Law on Election of Members of Parliament. Representation increased to 21. 3 % at the local level also. But, women are still underrepresented on leading positions in governing and decision making in public policy.

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is {{a staple}} food crop in Cameroon and {{cultivated}} mainly for its starchy roots consumed raw, boiled or processed, {{but also for}} its leaves which serve as vegetable. Despite its importance, the yield gap is often large due to many challenges that include low soil fertility {{and the use of}} traditional production techniques while local varieties are susceptible to pests and diseases. To overcome these challenges, there have been efforts to introduce and evaluate several cassava varieties since the early 1980 s for root yield and other agronomic characteristics, to identify high-yielding varieties for dissemination. A few of the promising varieties were tested with farmers in collaboration with extension officers, but adoption was not successful, mainly because farmers were not involved in the selection process prior to dissemination. In 2001, 290 cassava clones were brought to Cameroon from IITA Ibadan, Nigeria, and evaluated in on-station and in on-farm, participatory trials. A socio-economic study was carried out to learn farmer criteria for cassava variety preference. (On-station evaluation was conducted in Mbalmayo between 2001 and 2004) In 2004 eleven varieties were selected from the initial several hundred for their agronomic characteristics as well as pest and disease resistance. Prior to on-farm testing, farmers in Mbalmayo visited the on-station trial at the vegetative and harvest stages for further selection of varieties manageable under farm conditions. Of the eleven, 6 varieties (8085, 88071 - 3, 92 / 0057, 92 / 0326, 96 / 0023 and 96 / 1414) were retained, based on yield performance, disease resistance and growth characteristics. On-farm participatory evaluation was conducted in 2004 and 2005 with 30 farmers and in five regions in 2006, where farmers evaluated the six improved varieties. Sensory quality data was successfully collected from all trials. Analysis of agronomic and sensory data showed that farmers generally preferred high yield, good mealiness, pest and disease resistance, early-maturity and ease in peeling, but regional preference varied for the branching habit, plant height, leafiness/plant canopy cover, long stem storage and root storage quality. These criteria in farmer preference were incorporated into the selection process to facilitate the policy dimension toward the official release of 5 varieties (92 / 0326, 92 / 0057, 96 / 0023, 96 / 1414 and 92 / 0067) and for their qualities and suitability in controlling cassava green mites. This selective process showed that future cassava evaluation could accelerate with farmer involvement at the earlier stages of varietal selection. To meet with the increased productivity of improved varieties, 80 manual and 20 motorized cassava chippers were improved and manufactured locally, tested with farmers, and delivered to about 1500 farmers in 35 villages in 10 regions of Cameroon. The chippers were made with locally available, low cost material, easy to repair/clean, manually driven with no additional fuel cost, mobile, and easy to carry and share with other farmers in rural and inaccessible areas without electricity. Because of the smallholder nature of farming systems and the low farmer density in more inaccessible areas, investment in immobile and motorized cassava processing equipment is often not economically justified by the production capacity in many areas of Cameroon. Despite these initiatives, full development of the cassava sector faced several challenges, such as poor organization and planning, limited access to credit and the market, and high transportation and transaction costs. To address these shortcomings, value chain approach was adopted that guarantees the coverage of production to consumption and considers all groups from farmers to consumers, including traders, transporters and processors and developed a variety of cassava processing techniques to broaden the range of products derived from cassava. Stakeholders’ platform was instituted as a mechanism for appropriate knowledge sharing so that smallholder farmers learned to organize themselves and work as legitimate groups and operate independently. A case study in Mbouda indicates that before year 2000, cassava marketing was on individual basis and dominated by traders from Central Africa Republic (CAR), Gabon and Congo Brazzaville. Supply was insufficient and irregular while quality was poor, coupled with <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> and varying prices as well as high transportation costs. In this study, group marketing was promoted and linkages among actors, and a women’s group were initiated in Mbouda by 10 female traders, and collection points were set up in neighboring villages. Cassava chips from retailers were sorted, graded and milled in a warehouse for export to Libreville and Port Gentile in Gabon and Congo Brazzaville with a small portion for domestic markets. Farmers were encouraged to work in co-operatives, and to set a minimum selling price to limit unfair competition between them, and to avoid being cheated by other producers and traders. The future of cassava in Cameroon is bright, but depends very much upon development of improved products to meet the expectations of producers, transporters and consumers and on its suitability for alternative uses. There is also need to build producer capacity for commercial farming designed to explore market opportunities, but {{there is no need to}} spend resources on improving production on the farm if the transportation of the product is expensive or the processing and marketing are inefficient...|$|E
