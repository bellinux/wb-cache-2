40|$|Surgical site infections remain one of {{the most}} {{frequent}} complications following abdominal surgery and cause substantial costs, morbidity and mortality. To assess the effectiveness of wound <b>edge</b> <b>protectors</b> in open abdominal surgery in reducing surgical site infections. A systematic literature search was conducted according to a prespecified review protocol in a variety of data-bases combined with hand-searches for randomized controlled trials on wound <b>edge</b> <b>protectors</b> in patients undergoing laparotomy. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of included trials was conducted. We identified 16 randomized controlled trials including 3695 patients investigating wound <b>edge</b> <b>protectors</b> published between 1972 and 2014. Critical appraisal uncovered a number of methodological flaws, predominantly in the older trials. Wound <b>edge</b> <b>protectors</b> significantly reduced the rate of surgical site infections (risk ratio 0. 65; 95 %CI, 0. 51 - 0. 83; p = 0. 0007; I 2 = 52 %). The results were robust in a number of sensitivity analyses. A similar effect size was found in the subgroup of patients undergoing colorectal surgery (risk ratio 0. 65; 95 %CI, 0. 44 - 0. 97; p = 0. 04; I 2 = 56 %). Of the two common types of wound protectors double ring devices were found to exhibit a greater protective effect (risk ratio 0. 29; 95 %CI, 0. 15 - 0. 55) than single-ring devices (risk ratio 0. 71; 95 %CI, 0. 54 - 0. 92), but this might largely be due to the lower quality of available data for double-ring devices. Exploratory subgroup analyses for the degree of contamination showed a larger protective effect in contaminated cases (0. 44; 95 %CI, 0. 28 - 0. 67; p = 0. 0002, I 2 = 23 %) than in clean-contaminated surgeries (0. 72, 95 %CI, 0. 57 - 0. 91; p = 0. 005; I 2 = 46 %) and a strong effect on the reduction of superficial surgical site infections (risk ratio 0. 45; 95 %CI, 0. 24 - 0. 82; p = 0. 001; I 2 = 72 %). Wound <b>edge</b> <b>protectors</b> significantly reduce the rate of surgical site infections in open abdominal surgery. Further trials are needed to explore their effectiveness in different risk constellations...|$|E
5000|$|These {{products}} {{usually have}} wall thicknesses of 1/16" [...] to 1/4" [...] {{and are used}} primarily for support packaging applications. Thick-Wall is also {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Slush Molded." [...] The surfaces are very rough on one side and moderately smooth on the opposite side. Product definition is moderate due to the use of relatively inexpensive single-pass molds and the use of mixed recovered paper and kraft paper slurries. Typical uses are for <b>edge</b> and <b>edge</b> <b>protector,</b> heavy item packaging, auto replacement parts, molded pulp pallet trays etc.|$|R
50|$|Hessian {{bags are}} often {{deployed}} as sandbags {{as a temporary}} response to flooding. Because of their material, they can either be reused or can be composted after use. Agencies like the State Emergency Service in Australia and Technisches Hilfswerk in Germany often deploy sandbags, and these {{are found in the}} majority of their emergency response vehicles. Plastic bags have been used as a substitute, but SES units have found hessian bags to be more versatile as they {{can be used in a}} variety of rescue applications: as an <b>edge</b> <b>protector</b> for rope rescue operations, for use as padding on slings used in animal rescue or used to dampen and beat out bush-fires.|$|R
50|$|The obverse of {{the coin}} depicts Oliver Cromwell as a Roman Emperor, with the {{inscription}} OLIVAR D G R P ANG SCO HIB &c PRO -- Oliver, {{by the grace of}} God Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, Ireland, etc.. The reverse depicts a crowned shield bearing the Commonwealth arms, with the inscription PAX QVAERITUR BELLO -- Peace is sought through war, and the date 1656, while there is also an <b>edge</b> inscription <b>PROTECTOR</b> LITERIS LITERAE NVMMIS CORONA ET SALVS -- A protector of the letters, the letters are a garland and a safeguard to the coinage.|$|R
30|$|The TLH was {{performed}} {{according to the}} procedure we previously reported [4, 5]. However, in this case, we omitted {{the use of the}} uterine manipulator due to unfavorable anatomical findings. A 12 -mm trocar was positioned via an open entry technique nearly the xiphoid process, and a 10 – 14 -mmHg pneumoperitoneum was obtained. Four 5 -mm trocars were positioned laterally to the rectus abdominis; the lowest of these was used, {{in the absence of the}} uterine manipulator, to push cephalad the markedly enlarged uterus to reproduce the “traction-counter traction” effect and obtain both the displacement of the lower uterine segment aside from ureters and elevation of uterine arteries alongside the cervix. A 12 -mm trocar was placed at the umbilicus, and another 5 -mm trocar was inserted in the suprapubic position. The surgery table was positioned in the Trendelenburg orientation, and the stages of surgery were as previously described by the authors [5] for the removal of uterus of similar weight combined with bilateral adnexectomy, using Ligasure (Tyco Healthcare, Norwalk, CT, USA). The uterine arteries were skeletonized, coagulated with the BiClamp LAP forceps (ERBE GmbH, Tubingen, Germany), and then resected with Ligasure. After the introduction of a small surgical swab in the vagina, the cervicovaginal edge was laparoscopically identified and catted with monopolar scissor, and the colpotomy was completed using Ligasure. As is our routine practice, after the cervix dissection, a Foley catheter was inserted into the vagina to prevent losing of the pneumoperitoneum. The laparoscopic suture of the vaginal cuff {{was performed}} with a continuous closure using the V-Loc device (Covidien-Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The uterus was then extracted from the abdomen via a very low transverse laparotomy cut of approximately 5  cm, to reduce operative time, utilizing a wound protector/retractor (Wound <b>Edge</b> <b>Protector</b> - 3 MTM Steri-DrapeTM 1073, Diegem, Belgium), and morcellated outside the abdomen with a cold blade scalpel to avoid spillage. Finally, after suture of the low minilaparotomy, we laparoscopically cautiously evaluated the abdominal cavity and repeatedly washed it.|$|R
