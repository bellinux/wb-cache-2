5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss key {{projects}}. These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, {{which would be}} explicitly dedicated to each project. This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed sooner than expected. The panels identified three such projects: 1) {{a study of the}} nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies; 2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3) a project to determine the Hubble constant within ten percent by reducing the errors, both external and internal, in the calibration of the <b>distance</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the <b>distance</b> <b>scale</b> ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue {{about the nature of the}} systems that produce GRBs.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the <b>distance</b> <b>scale</b> from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

String theory, causal dynamical triangulations, renormalization group approaches, noncommutative geometry, loop quantum gravity and Horava-Lifshitz gravity all find that the dimensionality of spacetime appears to decrease from approximately 4 on large <b>distance</b> <b>scales</b> to approximately 2 on small <b>distance</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|R

25|$|Zwicky {{was skeptical}} of the {{expansion}} of space in 1929, because the rates measured at that time seemed too large. It was not until 1956 that Walter Baade corrected the <b>distance</b> <b>scale</b> based on Cepheid variable stars, and ushered in the first accurate measures of the expansion rate. Cosmological redshift is now conventionally understood to be {{a consequence of the}} expansion of space; a feature of Big Bang cosmology.|$|E
25|$|Determining the {{distances}} to astronomical objects {{is crucial to}} understanding them, {{but the vast majority}} of objects are too far away for their distances to be directly determined. Calibration of the astronomical <b>distance</b> <b>scale</b> relies on a sequence of indirect and sometimes uncertain measurements relating the closest objects, for which distances can be directly measured, to increasingly distant objects. Open clusters are a crucial step in this sequence.|$|E

40|$|New model-independent {{constraints}} on possible modifications of Newtonian gravity over solar-system <b>distance</b> <b>scales</b> are presented, and their implications discussed. The constraints {{arise from the}} analysis of various planetary astrometric data sets. The results of the model-independent analysis are then applied to set limits on {{a variation in the}} l/r-squared behavior of gravity, on possible Yukawa-type interactions with ranges of the order of planetary <b>distance</b> <b>scales,</b> and on a deviation from Newtonian gravity of the type discussed by Milgrom (1983) ...|$|R
25|$|In the Standard Model, {{all of the}} quark and lepton Yukawa {{couplings}} {{are small}} compared to the top quark Yukawa coupling. Understanding this hierarchy in the fermion masses is an open problem in theoretical physics. Yukawa couplings are not constants and their values change depending on the energy scale (<b>distance</b> <b>scale)</b> at which they are measured. The dynamics of Yukawa couplings {{are determined by the}} renormalization group equation.|$|E
25|$|If {{the lens}} {{includes}} a DOF scale, the hyperfocal distance {{can be set}} by aligning the infinity mark on the <b>distance</b> <b>scale</b> with the mark on the DOF scale corresponding to the f-number to which the lens is set. For example, with the 35mm lens shown above set to f/11, aligning the infinity mark with the '11' {{to the left of}} the index mark on the DOF scale would set the focus to the hyperfocal distance.|$|E
25|$|If {{the marks}} {{for the near}} and far {{distances}} fall outside the marks for the largest f-number on the DOF scale, the desired DOF cannot be obtained; for example, with the 35mm lens above, {{it is not possible}} to have the DOF extend from 0.7m to infinity. The DOF limits can be determined visually, by focusing on the farthest object to be within the DOF and noting the distance mark on the lens <b>distance</b> <b>scale,</b> and repeating the process for the nearest object to be within the DOF.|$|E
30|$|Concerning {{the effects}} on the {{movement}} kinematics, we found that how ID was varied (i.e., via D or W) {{as well as the}} nature of the task (i.e., discrete or cyclic) had pronounced effects on the movement kinematics investigated. In that regard, it is often stated that <b>scaling</b> target <b>distance</b> versus its width ‘simply’ stretches the velocity profile or skews it, respectively [7, 11, 12]. Here, we found that although increasing the ID by scaling target width reduced the degree asymmetry of the movement’s velocity profile more than under the <b>distance</b> <b>scaling,</b> the latter also reduced it (Fig.  3 b). Again, this may to some extent be due to the smallness of the target under the present <b>distance</b> <b>scaling.</b> By comparison, we here used a target width smaller than the one used in [12] and [11] under a (modestly; relative to [10]) larger <b>distance</b> <b>scaling.</b> A closer look at these studies, however, shows that while, indeed, the degree of asymmetry increases markedly more under the width than <b>distance</b> <b>scaling,</b> categorically setting apart the effects of these variations in terms of skewing versus stretching the velocity profiles appears a simplification that does not do justice to the observations.|$|R

25|$|Many lenses for small- and medium-format cameras include scales that {{indicate}} the DOF {{for a given}} focus distance and f-number; the 35mm lens in the image is typical. That lens includes <b>distance</b> <b>scales</b> in feet and meters; when a marked distance is set opposite the large white index mark, the focus is set to that <b>distance.</b> The DOF <b>scale</b> below the <b>distance</b> <b>scales</b> includes markings {{on either side of}} the index that correspond to f-numbers. When the lens is set to a given f-number, the DOF extends between the distances that align with the f-number markings.|$|R
25|$|Euclidean {{geometry}} has {{two fundamental}} types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would {{be referred to}} as half of a right angle. The <b>distance</b> <b>scale</b> is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{distances}} to nearby clusters have been established, further techniques can extend the <b>distance</b> <b>scale</b> to more distant clusters. By matching the main sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for a cluster at a known distance {{with that of}} a more distant cluster, the distance to the more distant cluster can be estimated. The nearest open cluster is the Hyades: the stellar association consisting of most of the Plough stars is at about half the distance of the Hyades, but is a stellar association rather than an open cluster as the stars are not gravitationally bound to each other. The most distant known open cluster in our galaxy is Berkeley 29, at a distance of about 15,000parsecs. Open clusters are also easily detected in many of the galaxies of the Local Group.|$|E
25|$|In Euclidean geometry, {{a figure}} can be scaled up or scaled down indefinitely, and the {{resulting}} figures are similar, i.e., {{they have the same}} angles and the same internal proportions. In elliptic geometry this is not the case. For example, in the spherical model we can see that the distance between any two points must be strictly less than half the circumference of the sphere (because antipodal points are identified). A line segment therefore cannot be scaled up indefinitely. A geometer measuring the geometrical properties of the space he or she inhabits can detect, via measurements, that there is a certain <b>distance</b> <b>scale</b> that is a property of the space. On scales much smaller than this one, the space is approximately flat, geometry is approximately Euclidean, and figures can be scaled up and down while remaining approximately similar.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, {{the surveys}} {{indicate}} that Russians are not socially distanced in Ukraine. The {{indicator of the}} willingness of Ukraine's residents to participate in social contacts of varying degrees of closeness with different ethnic groups (the Bogardus Social <b>Distance</b> <b>Scale)</b> calculated based on the yearly sociological surveys has been consistently showing that Russians are, on the average, least socially distanced within Ukraine except the Ukrainians themselves. The same survey has shown that, in fact, that Ukrainian people are slightly more comfortable accepting Russians into their families than they are accepting Ukrainians living abroad. Such social attitude correlates with the political one as the surveys taken yearly between 1997 and 2005 consistently indicated that the attitude {{to the idea of}} Ukraine joining the union of Russia and Belarus is more positive (slightly over 50%) than negative (slightly under 30%).|$|E
25|$|Some {{distance}} scales have markings {{for only}} a few distances; for example, the 35mm lens above shows only 3ft and 5ft on its upper scale. Using other distances for DOF limits requires visual interpolation between marked distances. Since the <b>distance</b> <b>scale</b> is nonlinear, accurate interpolation can be difficult. In most cases, English and metric distance markings are not coincident, so using both scales to note focused distances can sometimes lessen the need for interpolation. Many autofocus lenses have smaller distance and DOF scales and fewer markings than do comparable manual-focus lenses, so that determining focus and f-number from the scales on an autofocus lens may be more difficult than with a comparable manual-focus lens. In most cases, determining these settings using the lens DOF scales on an autofocus lens requires that the lens or camera body be set to manual focus.-number from user-determined near and far points in much the same manner as using DOF scales on manual-focus lenses (Canon Inc. 2000, 61–62). The feature has not been included on models introduced after April 2004.|$|E

But, in their short life, the electron will be attracted by the charge, and the positron will be repelled.
