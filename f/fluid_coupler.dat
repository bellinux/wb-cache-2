50|$|Bluewood {{is one of}} the few {{resorts in}} the country that is 100% self-sufficient, {{generating}} all of its own electric power via diesel generators. There are two diesel generators in the basement, one that runs the lodge at night and the other that runs the lodge and the two electric chair lifts during the day. The main chairlift (Skyline Express) has its own separate diesel powered generator, connected via a clutch and <b>fluid</b> <b>coupler.</b> The Triple Nickel and pama lifts are electric and uses power from the main diesel generators, located in the basement of the lodge.|$|E

Rotating <b>fluid</b> <b>coupler</b> permits unlimited platform revolutions and eliminates danger of lines being pulled loose from supplies...|$|E
40|$|A dual-arm task {{execution}} primitive {{has been}} implemented for cooperative dual-arm telerobotic task execution utilizing multiple sensors concurrently. The primitive has been {{integrated into a}} telerobot task execution system and can be called by a task planning system for execution of tasks requiring dual-arm sensor based motion, e. g., force control, teleoperation, and shared control. The primitive has a large input parameter set {{which is used to}} specify the desired behavior of the motion. Move-squeeze decomposition is utilized to decompose forces sensed at the wrists of the two manipulators into forces in the move subspace, which cause system motion, and forces in the squeeze subspaces, which cause internal forces. The move and squeeze forces are then separately controlled. Several space servicing tasks utilizing the cooperative dual-arm control capability are described, and experimental results from the tasks are given. The supervisory and shared control tasks include capture of a rotating satellite, orbital replacement unit changeout, <b>fluid</b> <b>coupler</b> seating and locking, and contour following...|$|E
50|$|In 1993 Jeep re-introduced Quadra-Trac, {{this time}} on the Jeep Grand Cherokee using the NP249 {{transfer}} case. Like the NP219, this transfer case utilizes a center differential with a viscous coupler to provide smooth and efficient four-wheel drive operation on all surfaces. This system has 4WD All-Time, Neutral, and 4WD Low modes. In normal 4WD All-time mode, the center differential is open and distributes torque to both {{the front and rear}} axles. When a difference in speed occurs between the axles, heat buildup causes the viscous <b>fluid</b> inside the <b>coupler</b> to thicken, which progressively locks the center differential thus transferring power to the axle with more traction. In 4WD Low, the input torque is multiplied through a 2.72:1 planetary gearset. NP249 transfer cases used the viscous coupler to transfer power in both high and low ranges.|$|R
40|$|The Johnson Space Center (JSC) {{initiated}} a dynamic {{study to determine}} possible improvements available through advanced technologies (not used on previous or current human vehicles), identify promising development initiatives for advanced active thermal control systems (ATCS's), and help prioritize funding and personnel distribution among many research projects by providing a common basis to compare several diverse technologies. Some technologies included were two-phase thermal control systems, light-weight radiators, phase-change thermal storage, rotary <b>fluid</b> <b>coupler,</b> and heat pumps. JSC designed the study to estimate potential benefits from these various proposed and under-development thermal control technologies for five possible human missions early in the next century. The study compared all the technologies to a baseline mission using mass as a basis. Each baseline mission assumed an internal thermal control system; an external thermal control system; and aluminum, flow-through radiators. Solar vapor compression heat pumps and light-weight radiators showed the greatest promise as general advanced thermal technologies which can be applied {{across a range of}} missions. This initial study identified several other promising ATCS technologies which offer mass savings and other savings compared to traditional thermal control systems. Because the study format compares various architectures with a commonly defined baseline, it is versatile and expandable, and is expected to be updated as needed...|$|E
