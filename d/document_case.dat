5000|$|A key {{difference}} between the document-oriented and relational models is that the data formats are not predefined in the <b>document</b> <b>case.</b> In most cases, any sort of document {{can be stored in}} any database, and those documents can change in type and form at any time. If one wishes to add a COUNTRY_FLAG to a CONTACT, this field can be added to new documents as they are inserted, this will have no effect on the database or the existing documents already stored. To aid retrieval of information from the database, document-oriented systems generally allow the administrator to provide hints to the database to look for certain types of information. These work in a similar fashion to indexes in the relational case. Most also offer the ability to add additional metadata outside of the content of the document itself, for instance, tagging entries as being part of an address book, which allows the programmer to retrieve related types of information, like [...] "all the address book entries". This provides functionality similar to a table, but separates the concept (categories of data) from its physical implementation (tables).|$|E

His face turns towards his wife and he rests his left arm on the table, whilst writing {{with his right hand}} using a feather pen. The table is covered with scarlet velvet, many papers, a casket, an inkwell with two more feather pens, a barometer, a gasometer, a water still and a glass bell jar. A large round-bottom flask and a tap are on the floor to the right, by the table. To the table's extreme left is a chair with a large document-case and black cloth on it. The document-case, presumed to correspond to Madame's interest in the art of drawing, is an emphasis of the depiction of a left to right symmetry in the portrait of M.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} this Wikipedia {{is to develop a}} local voice from the GCC and West Asia and North Africa and the notion of “the rise and fall of innovation”. This {{initiative}} is a follow up on the concept of Integral Innovation (Al-Jayyousi, 2017). It aspires to deepen and broaden the perspectives of innovation based on case studies and experiences of thinkers and experts from all domains of knowledge. These case studies may cover many dimensions of innovation including innovative universities, firms, individuals, initiatives, and nations.Innovation is underpinned by culture and ecology which is beyond economics and business models. This knowledge-based initiative is intended to present a holistic view for innovation with a focus on ecology and society. It is simply about integral innovation that includes Individual, Community (or city), Organization and National (ICON) innovation as the domain of action and reflection. In terms of theory and practice, I looked at other four dimensions. These include: Cultural (or social), Ecological, Technological and Economic (CETE) innovation (Al-Jayyousi, 2017). The Objectives of this Wilkipedia/Wikimedia (in both languages Arabic and English) are outlined below:• Articulate and frame a new discourse on the drivers and enablers for innovation and renewal for higher education to support AGU as a model for an innovative university.• Seek inspiration form culture and local knowledge for new models of social and eco-innovations to develop an innovative university in GCC and MENA region.• <b>Document</b> <b>case</b> studies on the role of innovation in social renewal and transformation.• Reflect of global experiences and practices of innovation in higher education and private and public sectors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} the approach CBRDIA (Case Based Reasoning for Document Invoice Analysis) which uses {{the principles of}} case-based reasoning to analyze, recognize and interpret invoices. Two CBR cycles are performed sequentially in CBRDIA. The first one consists in checking whether a similar document has already been processed, which makes {{the interpretation of the}} current one easy. The second cycle works if the first one fails. It processes the document by analyzing and interpreting its structuring elements (adresses, amounts, tables, etc) one by one. The CBR cycles allow processing documents from both knonwn or unknown classes. Applied on 923 invoices, CBRDIA reaches a recognition rate of 85, 22 % for documents of known classes and 74, 90 % for documents of unknown classes. Key words: case-based reasoning, <b>document</b> <b>case,</b> structure case, invoice analysis, invoice interpretation, structure extraction. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, implementation, {{and performance of}} the Harvard Array of Clustered Computers (HACC), a cluster-based design for scalable, cost-effective web servers. HACC is designed for locality enhancement. Requests that arrive at the cluster are distributed among the nodes so as to enhance the locality of reference that occurs on individual nodes in the cluster. By improving locality on individual cluster nodes, we can reduce their working set sizes and achieve superior performance for less cost than conventional approaches. We implemented HACC on Windows NT 4. 0 and evaluated its performance for both static documents and workloads of dynamically generated documents adapted from logs of commercial web servers. Our performance results show that HACC's locality enhancement can improve performance by up to 121 % for our stochastically generated static file case, by up to 40 % for our tracebased static file case, and by up to 52 % for our tracebased dynamic <b>document</b> <b>case,</b> com [...] ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Strong ground motions {{caused by}} {{earthquakes}} can induce catastrophic avalanches. Massive snow avalanching {{has also been}} observed on slopes near quarries and underground mines where ground motions are produced by explosives. To address a lack of information regarding seismogenic snow avalanches, we have compiled an inventory to <b>document</b> <b>case</b> histories. For the period 1899 – 2010, 22 cases are identified worldwide, related to natural or artificial seismicity with magnitudes of 1. 9 Mw 9. 2 and source-to-site distances of ~ 0. 2 – 640 km. In the extreme case, many thousands of simultaneously released large-scale avalanches have been reported. The obtained distribution and variety of parameters are discussed and compared with earthquake-induced landslides and ice avalanches; the results are similar among these three types of failure events, although all data derived from statistical analyses (i. e. non-witnessed cases) represent outliers, suggesting {{a significant reduction in}} the threshold magnitudes proposed for landslides. This proposal could be verified by the collection of additional data. 1...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} effectiveness of using three different influenza immunization surveillance forms in accounting for all influenza vaccine distributed in a community setting. Methods: All family practice physicians and community health nurses (CHNs) in the Eastern Region of Newfoundland and Labrador were randomly sent one of three influenza immunization surveillance forms: individual, tally or government. They were asked to: <b>document</b> <b>case</b> information about patients given influenza vaccine in the 2001 - 2002 season, return completed forms as well as unused vaccine, and provide feedback about the forms {{at the end of}} the study. Results: There was 100 % participation by CHNs and 82. 4 % by physicians. Of the 13, 310 doses of influenza vaccine distributed, 7, 645 (57. 5 %) doses were accounted for using the surveillance forms. Use of the government form accounted for statistically significantly more influenza vaccine than use of the tally and individual forms (p< 0. 0005), while the tally form accounted for significantly more vaccine than the individual form (p< 0. 0005). The tally and individual forms provided more information than the government form about those who received the vaccine. Feedback identified that health care professionals preferred less paper and fewer questions, but supported influenza immunization surveillance. Conclusion: The study's findings supports using a tally form as a way to collect useful influenza immunization surveillance data in future influenza immunization seasons...|$|E
30|$|Studies {{show that}} {{problems}} associated with the requirements specifications are widely recognized for affecting software quality and impacting effectiveness of its development process. The reuse of knowledge obtained from previous projects can facilitate the identification and writing of the requirements to reach the elaboration of a complete and consistent requirements document. Software patterns are a solution to capture and reuse knowledge from different contexts for the software development. On the information system domain, it is common to find a set of requirements that have similar characteristics and repeat themselves in different systems of this domain, indicating a possibility of becoming a requirements pattern. By reusing knowledge obtained in previous projects, requirements patterns can be elaborated to facilitate a more complete and consistent specification of system requirements in that domain. The advantage of using requirements patterns is to provide the software engineer a starting point for the elaboration of requirements documents, instead of starting from scratch to solve known problems. The requirements patterns can contribute to the improvement of the software quality, minimize the development time and costs, because previously defined and tested solutions are reused. This paper shows a set of functional requirements patterns and business rules elaborated to help the software engineer in the writing of the requirements document. The non-functional requirements were not considered in this project. A computational support was developed, based on that set of patterns, to facilitate the organized and complete writing of the requirements <b>document.</b> <b>Case</b> studies are presented {{with the use of the}} computational support.|$|E
