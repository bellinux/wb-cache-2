40|$|Monitoring of {{environmental}} working conditions {{is very important}} for many industrial sectors, especially, when poisonous or toxic organic solvents are used in production. In this work we present filled elastomer-nanostructured carbon based film as a promising material for nonselective <b>gas</b> <b>indicator.</b> The material is made by dispersing nanostructured carbon into the natural polyisoprene raw rubber matrix and vulcanizing afterwards. When the concentration of conductive filler is close to the percolation threshold such composite exhibits sharp changes of its electrical resistance when exposed to certain organic solvent vapor. The absorbed vapor causes the matrix to swell and increases the tunneling gaps between conductive filler particles, thus increasing the electrical resistance of the composite. Similar changes on electrical resistivity are observed due to mechanical interaction on composite, such as strain or external pressure. Thick film samples by thickness of 1 mm and 200 microns with embedded brass foil electrodes were made to compare their sensitivity to toluone vapor. All samples were weared-in by multi cyclic pre-straining using universal material testing machine. It was found out that decreasing the sample thickness leads to up to 5 times increased vapor sensitivity. This means although, that effective exposure time can be shortened up to 5 times for similar exposure conditions. The sensing intensity is compared and conclusions are made...|$|E
40|$|Until {{the present}} time, road {{maintenance}} {{work has been}} based on technical and economic aspects, and only recently in France have environmental considerations been taken into account in project-related decisions. Road administrators are now being asked much more frequently to introduce socalled "green solutions" when it comes to maintaining their roads. Some of these solutions involve the reuse of bituminous mixtures, which includes applying hot recycling techniques in asphalt mix plants and reclamation techniques conducted in situ at cold temperatures. This article presents a study carried out within the framework of an LCPC research program, entitled EPEES (for "Evaluation and Prediction of the Environmental Effects caused by Infrastructure"). The focus here is to track energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions relative to two comparable road maintenance worksites, both located in the center of France. The first project consists of in situ reclamation at cold temperature using emulsions, while the second entails a conventional bituminous mixture at high temperature. Results target energy consumption and equivalent carbon for various phases of the production process: materials, transport and actual road works. The study also draws up an environmental comparison between these two techniques, according to a greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>indicator,</b> and reveals the gas emission savings realized when employing the cold reclamation technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} an {{underground}} coal mine heating event is predominantly assessed based on gas sampling {{results from the}} affected area. The gas samples can be obtained {{in a number of}} different ways, but for accurate determination of the gases present analysis is normally performed using gas chromatography. Several gas indicators have been identified from past experiences that are used in combination to determine a Trigger Action Response Plan for individual mines. The upper levels of the Trigger Action Response Plan contain more urgent actions in response to the assessed level of advanced heating, with the ultimate level being withdrawal from the mine. Once this point is reached the only action that can be taken to control the event has to be done remotely and also, once activated it is difficult to re-enter the mine. Recent experience of a heating event provides new data that demonstrates the importance of understanding and interpreting the status of hot spot development to risk management and control applied by an Incident Management Team.

Methods: A total of 80 patients with pulmonary heart disease merged with respiratory failure who were admitted in our hospital {{were included in the}} study and randomized into the observation group (n= 40) and the control group (n= 40). The patients in the control group were given routine symptomatic treatments of pulmonary heart disease. On the above basis, the patients in the observation group were given intravenous drip of heparin and magnesium sulfate. The patients in the two groups were treated for 2 weeks. The blood <b>gas</b> <b>indicators,</b> blood viscosity indicators, PAPs, SBP, and DBP in the two groups were compared. The clinical efficacy in the two groups was evaluated. Results: After 2 -week treatment, PaO 2 and PaCO 2 in the two groups were improved, pH value was not significantly changed, PaO 2 in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group, while PaCO 2 was significantly lower than that in the control group. The hemorheology indicators after treatment in the two groups were significantly reduced when compared with before treatment, among which the comparison of WBV, PV, Hct, and EAI between the two groups was statistically significant, and PAPs after treatment in the observation group was significantly reduced when compared with the control group. SBP and DBP after treatment in the two groups were not significantly changed. Conclusions: Heparin in combined with magnesium sulfate in the treatment of pulmonary heart disease merged with respiratory failure can improve the blood <b>gas</b> <b>indicators</b> and blood viscosity indicators, and reduce SBP of pulmonary artery, with a higher efficacy; therefore, it deserves to be widely recommended in the clinic...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe applied {{analysis}} AVO with partial stacking to an onshore gas {{field in}} order to detect gas {{at the top of}} the Ciénaga de Oro formation (FCO), by using seismic gathers of the Güepajé- 3 D project. The technique was supported by petrophysical analysis of the Ayombe- 1 well. The sensitivity of seismic response to changes in the saturating fluid was evaluated by fluid substitution technique in an interval of the Ayombe- 1 well. As a result, a class I AVO anomaly {{at the top of the}} FCO was observed, even though the gas and water responses were similar. After applying AVO with partial stack technique at the top of FCO, AVO class I anomalies were observed in the Ayombe- 1 and Güepajé- 1 gas wells and none in the dry Güepajé- 3 well. In spite of being reported with gas, the results in the Güepajé- 2 well indicated any to an incipient class I anomaly related to a weak seismic response associated to gas. When the technique was applied to the seismic volume of the Güepajé- 3 D Project, a map of the direct <b>gas</b> <b>indicator</b> was obtained. The map shows a high correlation with the structural surface at top of FCO.

40|$|ABSTRACT When {{the coal}} mine fire occurs, {{it is crucial}} to judge the fire {{combustion}} state by analyzing <b>indicator</b> <b>gases</b> concentration and changing trends of various gas ratios in order to formulate proper rescue measures. It's an effective methodology to estimate the changes of combustion state in coal mine fire accurately by the trends analysis of <b>indicator</b> <b>gases</b> and gas ratios independent of the external environment disturbs, such as air leakage and inner gases injection. However, there are few experimental researches about the changing rules of <b>indicator</b> <b>gases</b> and gas ratios at different combustion phases at present. Therefore, this paper has established a small-sized coal combustion experimental platform in confined space, on which the experimental studies on variation trends about <b>indicator</b> <b>gases</b> and gas ratios of the whole combustion phases are conducted. The experiment results have shown that the coal combustion trends could be accurately estimated by analyzing the relationship between <b>indicator</b> <b>gases</b> and gas ratios among different combustion phases. In the end of this paper, the conclusions are verified by a real coal mine fire disaster relief case, and the practical results are in agreement with the experimental analysis...|$|R

Design: the technique {{in which the}} <b>indicator</b> <b>gas</b> is injected {{at the mouth of}} the patient (post-mix) is compared with the technique where the <b>indicator</b> <b>gas</b> is administered in the bellows of the ventilator (pre-mix). Setting: Surgical Intensive Care Unit of a University Hospital. Patients: 10 post-operative mechanically ventilated patients. Interventions: None. Measurements and results: 3 wash-out tests with the post-mix and 3 wash-out tests with the pre-mix method were performed within an hour on every patient. The calculated mean end expiratory lung volume (EEV) was 1. 91 ± 0. 871 with the post-mix technique and 1. 89 ± 0. 881 with the premix technique. There was a good agreement with a mean difference of - 1. 9 ± 6. 5 % in the calculated EEV values by the two different techniques.

40|$|The Zeit Bay field {{reservoir}} units {{consist of}} sandstone and carbonates, partially overlaying a tilted block of fractured basement reservoir with a complex drive mechanism. A secondary recovery scheme of gas re-injection into the original gas cap was initiated to maintain reservoir energy and to overcome pressure decline. Hence accurate detection of gas movement is very critical. Several difficulties to monitor gas-oil contacts were encountered in {{a considerable number}} of wells. Some of these difficulties were, gas channelling behind the casing, gas coning, wellbore fluid changes, porosity and lithology changes, wellbore fluid invasion into the reservoir and the presence of formation stimulation fluid. The application of conventional methods using the response of <b>gas</b> <b>indicator</b> curves could result in a false indication of formation gas-oil contacts. This paper discusses the approach adopted {{in order to determine the}} gas-oil contact in wells where such problems occur. A database was established including more than 70 TDT runs, open hole log and pressure data of 12 infill wells, and production performance records of all Zeit Bay wells. The approach follows the Polyachenko model of functional relationship between count rates and gas saturation. Several crossplots for the same range of porosity and connate water saturation, e. g. formation capture cross section (SIGM), total selected near detector counts (TSCN), total selected far detector counts (TSCF), the capture cross section of the borehole (SIBH), and inelastic far detector counts (INFD). Each crossplot gives a definite diagnostic shape around the depth of the formation gas-oil contact By using these crossplots it will be possible to calculate gas saturation from a stand alone run. The model was validated by RFT and open hole log data from infill wells. Also it was successfully applied in wells which showed an ambiguity in the detected formation gas-oil contact. The field gas-oil contact in Zeit Bay was revised using the results of the model. This revision lead to an accurate definition of the oil column and to the drilling of three additional wells in the field. The open hole log results of these wells verified the gas-oil contact determined by the model...|$|E
40|$|Logging {{research}} at The University of Texas {{has been carried}} out in several areas. We have studied how rock resistivity varies with water saturation when other variables, such as rock wettability, stress, saturation history, and shale content are varied. Both experimental and theoretical work have been done. Rock wettability (oil or water wet) has by far the largest effect. Shale content and saturation history are also important. Rock stress is the least important, at least in the Berea sandstones and glass bed packs we have studied. We have published several papers and theses which describe this work in detail. We have also studied the effect of certain trace elements (boron, mainly) on the neutron log. Boron has a very high thermal neutron capture cross Section. Analyses of a number of Frio formation cores from the Texas Gulf Coast area show that boron occurs frequently in these rocks in amounts (up to 100 ppm or more) that would seriously affect several procedures in neutron log interpretation. It could, for example, reduce or even eliminate the neutron log [...] density log porosity reversal that is commonly used as a <b>gas</b> <b>indicator.</b> A recent paper reports details of our work in the Frio. We are currently extending our trace element studies to the West Texas area. The lower porosities occurring there make a given boron content in the rock even more important than in the higher porosity Gulf Coast area. Another effort has been the application of logging data to obtain better estimates of rock type, and inferentially, rock permeability. The work is semi-empirical, and results are usually limited in application geographically. These results can be very important, however; for example, when extrapolating core data to parts of a field where no cores were taken. Several papers have reported details of this work, which is continuing. Finally, we have advised the Department of Energy on logging programs and problems in the Geothermal-Geopressured research effort. In the early phases of the work we studied why water resistivities calculated from the self potential log were so often wrong. and showed that most of the error came from use of incorrect mud filtrate resistivities in the calculation. Several papers and theses give details of this research. A recent problem has been the estimation of free gas saturation in a deep, thick, geopressured sand in the Hulin Well in South Louisiana. A pulsed neutron log run recently in this well supports free gas indications from open hole resistivity logs run in this well earlier by Superior Oil Company. The presence of free gas here is important, since the gas/water ratio from this zone will be much larger if free gas is present. Future logging research under consideration or being started at The University of Texas includes (1) petrophysical problems in tight gas sands (bimodal porosity systems, trace element effects, etc.), (2) resistivity versus water saturation relations at high desaturation pressures (1500 psi), and (3) improved theoretical and computer modeling of rock resistivity as affected by water saturation, rock wettability, saturation history, etc. Support of logging {{research at}} The University of Texas is currently from the Department of Energy and from a consortium of companies and organizations (Gas Research Institute, logging companies, and oil companies) ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{contained}} {{in this thesis}} was concerned with rebreathing methods of measuring lung volume. In particular, one novel rebreathing technique which uses oxygen as the <b>indicator</b> <b>gas</b> was assessed. This technique appeared methodologically simple and readily applicable in a clinical environment. In essence, it relied on a graphical extrapolation of the time related changes in oxygen concentration to allow for oxygen uptake. This technique has been tested using a mass spectrometer which enabled nitrogen and argon as well as oxygen to be simultaneously used as <b>indicator</b> <b>gases.</b> Although the lung volumes {{as measured by the}} different <b>indicator</b> <b>gases</b> should have been the same, these were found to be different. These discrepancies were related to the concentration of the <b>indicator</b> <b>gas</b> which existed in the bag and lung prior to rebreathing. A hypothesis explaining these inconsistancies was formulated. This was based on an initial but non-sustained output of carbon dioxide into the bag-plus-lung system. A numerical model of idealised rebreathing showed that the hypothesis was sufficient to explain the discrepancies observed. A correction procedure was devised which performed successfully in the model. This correction was incorporated into an on-line computing procedure for calculating real lung volume. When tested in normal subjects this gave consistent results for lung volume, irrespective of <b>indicator</b> <b>gas</b> employed. The corrected lung volumes were unaffected by the initial gas compositions in the bag and lung, and were also independent of non-sustained gas exchange, whether this was due to carbon dioxide and/or nitrous oxide. This technique could, therefore, be use under anaesthetic conditions, since the uptake or output of nitrous oxide no longer upsets the calculation of lung volume. The use of more than one <b>indicator</b> <b>gas,</b> within the same manoeuvre, was shown to provide a valuable indication of the presence of errors in the system. When this approach was applied to more conventional rebreathing techniques of lung volume measurement, it also highlighted the presence of inaccuracies. </p...|$|R

Purging is accomplished by pumping inert gas into the tank until hydrocarbons have been sufficiently expelled. Next the tank is gas freed which is usually accomplished by blowing fresh air into the space with portable air powered or water powered air blowers. [...] "Gas freeing" [...] brings the oxygen content of the tank up to 20.8% O2. The inert gas buffer between fuel and oxygen atmospheres ensures they are never capable of ignition. Specially trained personnel monitor the tank's atmosphere, often using hand-held <b>gas</b> <b>indicators</b> which measure the percentage of hydrocarbons present. After a tank is gas-free, it may be further hand-cleaned in a manual process known as mucking.

40|$|Abstract. This aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of intervention with low-molecular-weight heparin calcium on the pulmonary function and blood coagulation function of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the acute exacerbation stage. A total of 70 patients with COPD in the acute exacerbation stage were selected and randomly divided into the control group (32 cases) and the anticoagula-tion group (38 cases). The patients of the control group were treated with oxygen therapy, spasmolysis, asthmarelief, cough relief and sputum reduction. The patients in the anticoagulation group, in addition to the conventional therapy used the control group, were also treated with low-molecular-weight heparin calcium 4100 AXaIU/time. by abdominal subcutaneous injec-tion once every 12 h. For both groups, one treatment course lasted 10 days. The pulmonary function indicators and blood coagulation indicators of the two groups before and after treat-ment were determined. Following treatment, the pulmonary function and arterial blood <b>gas</b> <b>indicators</b> of the two groups were significantly better than those before treatment, and the extents of the improvements in the anticoagulation group were significantly greater than those in the control group. The D-dimer level and blood coagulation indicators [international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB) concentration] of the anticoagulation group were significantly improved compared with those prior to treatment, but there were no significant differences between these measures before and after treatment for patients in the control group. No serious adverse reaction occurred in the anticoagulation group. Although, the conventional therapy was able to improve the overall condition of patients with COPD, it was not able to effectively improve the hypercoagulative state of the patients' blood. The combination of conventional therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin calcium anticoagulation improved the blood coagulation and pulmonary functions of patients...|$|R
40|$|Some {{information}} on the “metadata ” forms was copied into multiple indicators, sometimes inappropriately so. The {{information on}} the “metadata ” forms should be more informative and specific to the individual indicators.

EPA Response The metadata forms were revised to provide additional indicator-specific information. Peer Review Comments on General Issues for All Indicators Indicator text would benefit from issue-specific contextual discussion, similar to interpretations presented in annual reports and other documents published by OAR and OAQPS.

For instance, the greenhouse <b>gas</b> emission <b>indicator</b> does not include data on the contributions of CFCs, the indicator on mercury deposition does not present information on dry deposition, and several emissions indicators do not include data on contributions of natural sources.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) in {{combined}} with prednisone on the arterial blood gas and pulmonary function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Methods: A total of 76 patients with IPF who were admitted in our hospital from March, 2015 to March, 2016 {{were included in the}} study and randomized into the observation group and the control group. The patients in the two groups were given oxygen inhalation, bronchodilator agents, phlegm dissipating and asthma relieving, anti-infection, and other supporting treatments. The patients in the control group were orally given prednisone (0. 5 mg/ kg. d), continuously for 4 weeks, then in a dose of 0. 25 mg/kg. d, continuously for 8 weeks, and finally the dosage was reduced to 0. 125 mg/kg. d. On this basis, the patients in the observation group were given additional EGb, i. e. Ginkgo leaf capsule, 1 g/time, 3 times/d, continuously for 12 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated after 12 -week treatment. PaO 2, PaCO 2, P(A-a) O 2, and SaO 2 before and after treatment were detected. FVC, FEV 1 /FVC, MVV, TLC, and DLCO before and after treatment were determined. Results: PaO 2, PaCO 2, and SaO 2 after treatment were significantly elevated, while P(A-a) O 2 was significantly reduced when compared with before treatment. The comparison of PaO 2 and P(A-a) O 2 between the two groups was statistically significant, while the comparison of PaCO 2 and SaO 2 between the two groups was not statistically significant. After treatment, FVC, FEV 1 /FVC, MVV, TLC, and DLCO in the two groups were significantly elevated when compared with before treatment, and those in the observation group were significantly superior to those in the control group. Conclusions: EGb in combined with prednisone in the treatment of IPF can effectively improve the arterial blood <b>gas</b> <b>indicators</b> and pulmonary function, and enhance the patients’ living qualities; therefore, it deserves to be widely recommended...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} value of {{arterial}} blood lactate and early lactate clearance in evaluating the prognosis in patients with COPD merged with respiratory failure. Methods: A total of 78 patients with COPD merged with respiratory failure {{were included in the}} study. The arterial blood lactate level 1 d before treatment and 6 h after treatment was detected. The early lactate clearance was evaluated. The patients were divided into the severe elevation group, mild elevation group, and normal control group according to the blood lactate level. APACHE Ⅱ score, 28 d death rate, and other clinical related indicators in the three groups were compared. According to the early lactate clearance, the patients were divided into the high lactate clearance group and low lactate clearance group. The arterial blood lactate level, APACHE Ⅱ score, death rate, and arterial blood <b>gas</b> <b>indicators</b> in the two groups were compared. The multiple-factor analysis of prognosis was performed. Results: With the increasing of blood lactate concentration before treatment, APACHE Ⅱ score, mechanical ventilation time, ventilation rate, hospitalization time, and death rate were gradually elevated, and the comparison among the three groups was not statistically significant. When compared with before treatment, the arterial blood lactate level, APACHE Ⅱ score, and PaCO 2 in the high lactate clearance group were significantly reduced, but PaO 2 and pH were significantly elevated, while PaO 2 in the low lactate clearance group was significantly elevated. The death rate in the high lactate clearance group was significantly lower than that in the low lactate clearance group. The early lactate clearance was a factor in protecting the prognosis in patients with COPD merged with respiratory failure. Conclusions: The arterial blood lactate level and early lactate clearance can affect the prognosis in patients with COPD merged with respiratory failure. Dynamic monitoring of early blood lactate level can better evaluate the disease severity degree and prognosis...|$|R
