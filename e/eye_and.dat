40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{detecting}} facial components in thermal imagery (specifically <b>eyes,</b> nostrils <b>and</b> mouth). One of the immediate goals is to enable the automatic registration of facial thermal images. The detection of <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> nostrils is performed using Haar features and the GentleBoost algorithm, which are shown to provide superior detection rates. The detection of the mouth {{is based on the}} detections of the <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> the nostrils and is performed using measures of entropy and self similarity. The results show that reliable facial component detection is feasible using this methodology, getting a correct detection rate for both <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> nostrils of 0. 8. A correct <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> nostrils detection enables a correct detection of the mouth in 65 % of closed-mouth test images and in 73 % of open-mouth test images. 1...|$|R

5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} <b>eye)</b> <b>and</b> anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E
