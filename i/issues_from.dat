5|$|Fantastic Universe was a U.S. {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} which began publishing in the 1950s. It ran for 69 <b>issues,</b> <b>from</b> June 1953 to March 1960, under two different publishers. It {{was part of}} the explosion of science fiction magazine publishing in the 1950s in the United States, and was moderately successful, outlasting almost all of its competitors. The main editors were Leo Margulies (1954–1956) and Hans Stefan Santesson (1956–1960); under Santesson's tenure the quality declined somewhat, and the magazine became known for printing much UFO-related material. A collection of stories from the magazine, edited by Santesson, appeared in 1960 from Prentice-Hall, titled The Fantastic Universe Omnibus.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E
5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> any sort of arbitration.

Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E

The ceremony was attended by the provincial governors, Supreme Court president Julio Nazareno, the heads of the armed forces, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Raúl Alfonsín was the only former president in attendance. Kirchner walked to the Casa Rosada along Avenida de Mayo, breaking with protocol to get close to the people, and was accidentally hit {{in the head with a}} camera.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the French government's anger against Morocco was increasing. A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in October 1849 damaged relations between both countries; {{a series of}} assassinations directed at the French frontier had occurred, and the French Consul had requested the dismissal of Pacha Ouchda, who was believed to have caused these <b>issues.</b> <b>From</b> 1845 to 1851, Morocco had a serious agricultural crisis caused by a drought, resulting in crop failure. The people of Morocco were suffering {{as the price of}} wheat and barley reached unprecedented heights. In Salé, many people were starving, and the agricultural crisis and anger towards France ultimately led to the bombardment of Salé.|$|E

Beginning with issue No. 47, it was placed under the Vertigo imprint. It {{tells the story of}} Dream of the Endless, who rules over the world of dreams.

5|$|The cusp at {{the front}} of M1, the anterocone, is {{separated}} into two smaller cusps by an indentation. In A.donovani, a ridge generally connects the two cusps {{at the front}} margin of the tooth, so that the indentation separating them is closed at the front (an anteromedian fossette), but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is open toward the front (an anteromedian flexus). An additional crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the anterocone. Further to the back, there is a pair of cusps—the protocone at the lingual, or inner, side and the paracone at the labial, or outer, side. A crest <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> the paracone and is attached to the front or middle part of the protocone. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph crest is present; an additional crest usually connects the two. At the back of the tooth, there are two additional large cusps—the hypocone (lingual) and metacone (labial)—and a prominent crest, the posteroloph, <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> the hypocone and is located behind the metacone. In A.donovani, the metacone is generally connected to the posteroloph, but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is directly connected to the hypocone. The valleys that separate the cusps extend from the lingual and labial margins to about the midline of the molar. In addition to a large root at the front and two large roots at the back (one labial, one lingual) there is a small additional labial root.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 19,499,337 gold dollars were coined, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 at Charlotte, 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at Dahlonega. According to an {{advertisement}} in the February 1899 issue of The Numismatist, gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still in demand as {{a birthday present}} and for jewelry. That journal in 1905 carried news of a customer depositing 100 gold dollars into a bank; the teller, aware of the value, credited the account with $1.60 per coin. In 1908, a dealer offered $2 each for any quantity. As coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early 20th century, gold dollars became a popular specialty, a status they retain. The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins rates the least expensive gold dollar in very fine condition (VF-20) at $300, a value given {{for each of the}} Type 1 Philadelphia <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> 1849 to 1853. Those seeking one of each type will find the most expensive to be a specimen of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 estimated at $350 in that condition; the other two types have dates valued at $300 in that grade.|$|E

5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{suffered}} {{its final}} disappointment {{of the season}} on March 17 as it fell to the Princeton Tigers. Bill Clark remained suspended and Damian Saunders led the team with only 14 points. Duquesne dominated the game early on, taking a 20–11 lead before Princeton came back, eventually leading 28–23 at the half. The Dukes were unable to turn the momentum and continued to fall behind, eventually losing 51–65. The absence of Bill Clark showed on defense, as the Dukes were out-rebounded heavily. The Dukes also failed to improve on their <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> the regular season, going only 8 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 15 from 3-point range. This loss ended the 2009 season, and all Duquesne could do was look ahead to the next year.|$|E
5|$|Gernsback {{experimented with}} the price and format, looking for a {{profitable}} combination. Both Air Wonder and Science Wonder were bedsheet-sized (8.5 × 11.75 in, or 216 × 298mm) and priced at 25cents, as were the first issues of Wonder Stories. With the November 1930 issue Wonder Stories changed to pulp format, 6.75 × 9.9 in (171 × 251mm). It reverted to bedsheet after a year, and then in November 1933 became a pulp magazine for good. The pulp issues all had 144pages; the bedsheet issues generally had 96pages, though five <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> November 1932 to March 1933 had only 64pages. Those five issues coincided with a price cut to 15cents, which was reversed with the April 1933 issue. Gernsback cut the price to 15cents again from June 1935 until the sale to Beacon Publications in 1936, though this time he did not reduce the page count. The short duration of these price cuts suggests Gernsback rapidly realized that the additional circulation they gained him cost too much in lost revenue. Under Beacon Publications Thrilling Wonder remained pulp-sized throughout.|$|E
