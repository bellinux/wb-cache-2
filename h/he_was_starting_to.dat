5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> be taken seriously as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned {{the support of the}} teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{returned}} to England in 1147, {{when he was}} fourteen. Taking his immediate household and {{a small number of}} mercenaries, he left Normandy and landed in England, striking into Wiltshire. Despite initially causing considerable panic, the expedition had little success, and Henry found himself unable to pay his forces and therefore unable to return to Normandy. Neither his mother nor his uncle were prepared to support him, implying that they had not approved of the expedition in the first place. Surprisingly, Henry instead turned to King Stephen, who paid the outstanding wages and thereby allowed Henry to retire gracefully. Stephen's reasons for doing so are unclear. One potential explanation is his general courtesy to a member of his extended family; another is that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> consider how to end the war peacefully, and saw this as a way of building a relationship with Henry. Henry intervened once again in 1149, commencing what is often termed the Henrician phase of the civil war. This time, Henry planned to form a northern alliance with King David I of Scotland, Henry's great-uncle, and Ranulf of Chester, a powerful regional leader who controlled most of the north-west of England. Under this alliance, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack York, probably with help from the Scots. The planned attack disintegrated after Stephen marched rapidly north to York, and Henry {{returned to}} Normandy.|$|E

25|$|Byrne {{started a}} new series, Namor, the Sub-Mariner in April 1990. Byrne's take on the undersea antihero Namor cast him {{as the head of}} a surface company, Oracle, Inc., in order to help keep the ocean unpolluted, and had Namor {{involved}} in corporate intrigue. After writing and drawing the book for 25 issues, Byrne told editor Terry Kavanagh that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> feel constrained on the book and thought having a different artist might inspire him to a fresh approach. Kavanagh suggested newcomer Jae Lee, and Byrne continued as strictly writer of the book up through issue #32.

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film was due to air on British {{television}} in December 2012, Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock: [...] "He {{made it very clear}} what was expected of me, but I was equally clear that I wasn't interested...Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant moviemaker and I enjoyed working with him before I realised <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> take an almost obsessive interest in me." [...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of the conflict in England gradually began to shift; as historian Frank Barlow suggests, by the late 1140s [...] "the civil war was over", barring the occasional outbreak of fighting. In 1147 Robert of Gloucester died peacefully, {{and the next year}} the Empress Matilda left south-west England for Normandy, both of which contributed to reducing the tempo of the war. The Second Crusade was announced, and many Angevin supporters, including Waleran of Beaumont, joined it, leaving the region for several years. Many of the barons were making individual peace agreements with each other to secure their lands and war gains. Geoffrey and Matilda's son, the future King Henry II, mounted a small mercenary invasion of England in 1147 but the expedition failed, not least because Henry lacked the funds to pay his men. Surprisingly, Stephen himself ended up paying their costs, allowing Henry to return home safely; his reasons for doing so are unclear. One potential explanation is his general courtesy to a member of his extended family; another is that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> consider how to end the war peacefully, and saw this as a way of building a relationship with Henry.|$|E
500|$|Watts' {{return to}} the AFL saw his form improve, {{particularly}} his average disposal count, which increased by six a match in the five weeks from rounds eight to twelve, compared with the first six weeks of the season; he credited {{the opportunity to play}} in the VFL as a key reason to his improved form and his mind frame was more [...] "calm and relaxed" [...] heading into matches. He continued his good form playing on both the wing and in the forward line and after his performance in the thirty-seven point win against Collingwood at the MCG in round eighteen where he recorded twenty-six disposals—eleven of which were contested—four marks and a goal, Herald Sun journalist, Chris Vernuccio, stated <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> [...] "fulfil his potential and silence the doubters" [...] and The Age journalist, Michael Gleeson, noted he may have finally [...] "turned a corner". The next few weeks saw Melbourne suffer heavy defeats and as Melbourne's form diminished, so did Watts' and he was omitted from the side for the final round clash against Greater Western Sydney at Etihad Stadium. Watts finished the season playing twenty matches in total.|$|E

2500|$|On fight night, {{in front}} of a 6,513 crowd, Hopkins lost to Smith via TKO when he was knocked out of the ring in the 8th round and failed to make it back into the ring as referee Jack Reiss made a 20 count.

He insisted that he had been pushed out of the ring, but replays showed it was not a push. Hopkins said to HBO in the post fight interview, [...] "He shoved me out of the ring.
