5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} Baltic coast. The 331st {{captured}} the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> {{into the path}} of a powerful German counterstrike to hold open a land link to the rest of Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men and women were killed and more wounded.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{casualties}} of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry, an 85-year-old widow and invalid, who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House.

25|$|It was {{not unusual}} for {{electric}} recordings to be played back on acoustic phonographs. The Victor Orthophonic phonograph was a prime example where such playback was expected. In the Orthophonic, which benefited from telephone research, the mechanical pickup head was redesigned with lower resonance than the traditional mica type. Also, a folded horn with an exponential taper was constructed inside the cabinet to provide better impedance matching to the air. As a result, playback of an Orthophonic record sounded like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> from a radio.|$|E
25|$|Hudson River School {{paintings}} {{reflect the}} themes of discovery, exploration, and settlement in America in the 19th century. The detailed and idealized paintings also typically depict a pastoral setting. The works often juxtapose peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness, which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley just as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. The school characterizes the artistic body, its New York location, its landscape subject matter, and often its subject, the Hudson River. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature {{in the form of}} the American landscape was an ineffable manifestation of God, though the artists varied in the depth of their religious conviction. Their reverence for America's natural beauty was shared with contemporary American writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The artist Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School, while painters Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were the most successful painters of the school.|$|E

Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call.

[...] Burton also said that, [...] "In a lot of versions it's a very one-note kind of character and you know [...] goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character."

Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter's clothes, skin, hair, personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions. In an interview with Depp, the character was paralleled to [...] "a mood ring, [...] his emotions are very close to the surface". The [...] Hatter is [...] "made up of different people and their extreme sides", with a gentle voice much like the character's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent (which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher's Rab C.

However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not really something I'm interested in."

[...] MacFarlane commented on this, saying, [...] "She made an effort , so let me just put it that way." [...] He ultimately praised her performance, calling it [...] "surprisingly fantastic", and said: [...] "She came in, and she'd prepared before she even arrived. She hired an acting coach, with her own money, and she nailed it. She never once complained, and it was a long session. There was a lot of dialog. Her stamina was astonishing." ...|$|E
