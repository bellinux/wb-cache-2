25|$|Depending on the {{situation}} {{and the type of}} pitcher, the 12–6 curveball may be more or less effective. Against a batter with the same handedness as the pitcher, the 12 to 6 curveball has been proven to be a very <b>effective</b> <b>pitch</b> in general, but the pitch is much easier to hit if the batter is are the opposite handedness of the pitcher, making an 11 to 5 curveball the more <b>effective</b> <b>pitch</b> type in that situation. The effectiveness of the pitch also depends on the ability of the pitcher to apply topspin to the ball, creating movement. When stats for a high level pitcher's average 12 to 6 curveball are factored in, the 12 to 6 and the 11 to 5 are much more effective than Major League Baseball's average throwers of the pitch due to the pitcher's high level of ability for that pitch.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{attempting}} to lead sequences against hitters with the fastball and {{a myriad of}} mechanical issues limited Miller's success as a starting pitcher early in his major league career. [...] He also threw a changeup more frequently earlier in his career. [...] His most <b>effective</b> <b>pitch</b> is the slider (83-87mph), and after he began to use that more frequently, he experimented more with varying the output.

50|$|Regardless of ball humidity, {{elevation}} {{is still}} a factor in games at Coors Field. The ball does slip more easily through the thin air allowing for longer hits.

50|$|Brooklyn {{dominated}} the NL {{for the next}} two seasons, but, in 1954, Durocher's Giants — led by batting champion Willie Mays and the runner-up, Don Mueller — emerged as champions, winning the pennant by five games. They drew the Cleveland Indians, who had set an American League record by winning 111 games, as their opponents in the 1954 World Series. But the Giants won in four straight games, highlighted by Mays' game-saving catch of Vic Wertz' long drive in Game 1, the clutch hitting of obscure outfielder and pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes, and <b>effective</b> <b>pitching</b> from four different starters.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} year's ALCS, the Toronto Blue Jays beat Leibrandt badly in Game 1 {{but he turned}} in an <b>effective</b> <b>pitching</b> performance in Game 4. However, he lost when, leading 1-0 in the ninth, he walked Dámaso García, who scored on Lloyd Moseby's double. Responsible for Moseby, Leibrandt watched as the Blue Jays scored twice off reliever Dan Quisenberry and got tagged with the loss. He redeemed himself, however, {{coming out of the}} bullpen to replace the injured Bret Saberhagen in Game 7 and picking up the win that sent the Royals to the World Series.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the lack}} of hitting on his 2008 ball club, Ricciardi had {{assembled}} {{one of the more}} <b>effective</b> <b>pitching</b> staffs in Major League Baseball, bolstered by bullpen pick-ups such as Scott Downs, Brian Tallet, Jesse Carlson, and Shawn Camp. Over the season, the team had the best ERA in baseball at 3.49 and the bullpen ERA of 2.94. Early in the season, the Jays struggled, and the team fired manager John Gibbons, replacing him with former manager Cito Gaston. Toronto ended the season on a high note, finishing with a final record of 86 wins and 76 losses, the organization's third-best showing since the 1993 season.|$|R
50|$|Many early designs {{failed to}} provide <b>effective</b> <b>pitch</b> control to {{compensate}} for the missing stabiliser. Some examples were stable but their height could only be controlled using engine power. Others could pitch up or down sharply and uncontrollably if they were not carefully handled.

It was not until the later success of the tailless delta configuration in the jet age that this reputation was widely accepted to be undeserved.|$|E
50|$|Quevedo's most <b>effective</b> <b>pitch</b> was his changeup, {{which he}} threw {{with the same}} arm motion as his 89 MPH fastball. Meanwhile, his slider and curve were average. He allowed a {{significant}} number of fly balls, resulting in a high number of home runs allowed. In a four-year MLB career, Quevedo posted a 14-30 record with 237 strikeouts and a 6.15 ERA in 326.1 innings. During his minor league career he was named an AAA all-star in 2001 while pitching for the Iowa Cubs.|$|E
50|$|The curveball is {{a popular}} and <b>effective</b> <b>pitch</b> in {{professional}} baseball, {{but it is not}} particularly widespread in leagues with players younger than college-level players. This is with regard {{for the safety of the}} pitcher - not because of its difficulty - though the pitch is widely considered difficult to learn as it requires some degree of mastery and the ability to pinpoint the thrown ball's location. There is generally greater chance of throwing wild pitches when throwing the curveball.|$|E
2500|$|The 12–6 curveball {{is one of}} {{the types}} of pitches thrown in baseball. It is {{categorized}} as a breaking ball because of its downward break. The 12–6 curveball, unlike the normal curveball (also referred to as the [...] "11 to 5 curve" [...] or a [...] "2 to 8 curve" [...] for its motion), breaks in a downward motion in a straight line. This explains the name [...] "12–6", because the break of the pitch refers to the ball breaking from the number 12 to the number 6 on a clock. [...] While the 11-5 and 2-8 variations are very <b>effective</b> <b>pitches,</b> they are less effective than a true 12–6, because the ball will break {{into the heart of the}} bat more readily.|$|R
50|$|<b>Effective</b> <b>pitching</b> is {{critical}} to a baseball team, as pitching is the key for the defensive team to retire batters and to prevent runners from getting on base. A full game usually involves over one hundred pitches thrown by each team. However, most pitchers begin to tire before they reach this point. In previous eras, pitchers would often throw up to four complete games (all nine innings) in a week. With new advances in medical research and thus {{a better understanding of}} how the human body functions and tires out, starting pitchers tend more often to throw fractions of a game (typically six or seven innings, depending on their performance) about every five days (though a few complete games do still occur each year).|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the {{displacer}} units, {{and the way in}} which they are mounted means that as the suspension is compressed, the (roughly spherical) displacer deforms, and hence presents a larger area to the mounting plates. The pressure in the system is thus acting over a larger area, and hence applying additional force. This gives the suspension a sharply rising rate even in pitch, so that there is a strong tendency to return to equilibrium. Without this rising rate there would be no <b>effective</b> <b>pitch</b> resistance at all.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sequence}} where Bugs {{throws a}} pitch so slowly that three batters strike out swinging {{on it in}} succession inspired the term [...] "Bugs Bunny Change-Up" [...] in baseball slang.

50|$|The two-seam fastball {{appears to}} have more {{movement}} than a four-seam fastball, but can {{be more difficult to}} master and control. The amount of break on the pitch varies greatly from pitcher to pitcher depending on velocity, arm slot angle, and pressure points of the fingers. The two-seamer is a very natural pitch to throw, and is often taught to pitchers at a very early age. Its use is widespread throughout all levels of baseball, and most pitchers at any level have a two-seamer in their repertoire. Many pitchers, especially those without exceptional velocity, prefer a two-seam fastball to the four-seam because of its movement at the plate. However, power pitchers such as Justin Verlander combine control, high velocity, and break to make the two-seamer one of the most <b>effective</b> <b>pitches</b> in baseball.|$|R
