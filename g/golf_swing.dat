5|$|Woods collaborated {{closely with}} TAG Heuer {{to develop the}} world's first {{professional}} golf watch, which was released in April 2005. The lightweight, titanium-construction watch, designed to be worn while playing the game, incorporates numerous innovative design features to accommodate golf play. It is capable of absorbing up to 5,000 Gs of shock, far {{in excess of the}} forces generated by a normal <b>golf</b> <b>swing.</b> In 2006, the TAG Heuer Professional Golf Watch won the prestigious iF product design award in the Leisure/Lifestyle category.|$|E

25|$|William Ben Hogan (August 13, 1912 – July 25, 1997) was an American {{professional}} golfer, {{generally considered}} one of the greatest players {{in the history of the}} game. Born within six months of two other acknowledged golf greats of the 20th century, Sam Snead and Byron Nelson, Hogan is notable for his profound influence on <b>golf</b> <b>swing</b> theory and his legendary ball-striking ability.|$|E

He currently {{resides in the}} Los Angeles area. On the subject of writing a book, Jackson has admitted that he's considered it, but joked that he would only sit down and work on one {{if he were to}} ever lose his <b>golf</b> <b>swing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tevez {{made his}} return to the Manchester City first-team in a 2–1 home victory against Chelsea on 21 March, coming on for Nigel de Jong in the 66th minute before {{providing}} the assist for Samir Nasri's winning goal. His first goal of the season came four matches later, the third goal in a 4–0 home win against West Brom on 11 April. On 14 April, Tevez scored a hat-trick and provided an assist for Sergio Agüero in a 6–1 away win against Norwich City. He celebrated his third strike with a <b>golf</b> <b>swing,</b> in response to the pundits who questioned his desire during his leave of absence in which he was pictured on the golf course. He also played in City's title-winning match against Queens Park Rangers on 13 May.|$|E
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his <b>golf</b> <b>swing.</b> Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank {{from a bottle}} of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E
50|$|Morrison wrote {{two books}} that are now out of print; one of which {{introduced}} the concept of centrifugal force in <b>golf</b> <b>swings.</b> His other book called Better Golf Without Practice contained instruction on visualization techniques.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 and 2009, Jones had {{surgeries}} for tennis elbow. He {{made his}} first full <b>golf</b> <b>swings</b> in January 2011. In 2011, Jones returned to playing professional golf. In January, Jones played the Bob Hope Classic on the PGA Tour.|$|R

500|$|Hutchinson {{was an avid}} student—and later teacher—of the {{mechanics}} of the <b>golf</b> <b>swing,</b> so he decided to put forth in writing his suggestions on methods of play. He said, among other things, [...] "The great secret of all strokes played for the most part is to make the club travel as long as possible in the direction in which you want the ball to go".|$|E
500|$|Heyward {{still has}} {{a hole in his}} swing that has yet to resolve. [...] While he was in the minor leagues, his unorthodox swing was not {{regarded}} as a significant issue, but rather was perceived to have worked for him because of his enormous talent. [...] To the contrary, one scout compared it to an awkward <b>golf</b> <b>swing.</b> [...] "You watch him, he really stiff-arms the bat out there", noting Heyward almost fully extends his arms to attempt to power the head of the bat through the strike zone. [...] He does not protect the inside of part of the strike zone as well as the outside. [...] That creates a weakness that allows pitchers – especially power pitchers – to throw inside, thus exploiting an inability to attain contact on inside pitches efficiently.|$|E
2500|$|Hogan {{thought that}} an individual's <b>golf</b> <b>swing</b> was [...] "in the dirt" [...] and that {{mastering}} it required plenty {{of practice and}} repetition. He is also known to have spent years contemplating the <b>golf</b> <b>swing,</b> trying a range of theories and methods before arriving at the finished method which brought him his greatest period of success.|$|E

2500|$|Although not a {{particularly}} powerful player for a tall man, Faldo's strengths included his distance control, course management and his strong competitive mind. He was renowned for his single-minded dedication to the game. His intense dedication meant that he attended to every detail in the <b>golf</b> <b>swing.</b> Gary Player said of Faldo: [...] "He had a work ethic that was quite unbelievable." ...|$|E
2500|$|McMahon {{followed}} Carson from Who Do You Trust? as his announcer and sidekick and Skitch Henderson {{was installed}} as the maestro of the NBC orchestra. McMahon's famous introduction, [...] "Heeeeere's Johnny!!!" [...] {{was followed by}} a brief monologue by Carson. This was often followed by comedy sketches, interviews, and music. Carson's trademark was a phantom <b>golf</b> <b>swing</b> {{at the end of his}} monologues, aimed stage left toward the studio orchestra. (Guest hosts sometimes parodied that gesture. Bob Newhart rolled an imaginary bowling ball toward the audience.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{authored}} {{several books}} on golf including Down the Fairway with Oscar Bane [...] "O.B." [...] Keeler (1927), The Rights and Wrongs of Golf (1933), Golf Is My Game (1959), Bobby Jones on Golf (1966), and Bobby Jones on the Basic <b>Golf</b> <b>Swing</b> (1968) with illustrator Anthony Ravielli. The 300-copy limited edition of Down the Fairway {{is considered one of}} the rarest and most sought after golf books by collectors. To keep this book readily available to golfers, Herbert Warren Wind included a reproduction of Down the Fairway in his Classics of Golf Library.|$|E

In 2008, a theft was attempted on some irises, by removing them and putting them in a plastic bag, but they were recovered.|$|R
5000|$|Bad Golf Made Easier is a 53-minute video by actor Leslie Nielsen. It is {{a parody}} of golf and other golf videos and books. It {{demonstrates}} many humorous bad <b>golf</b> <b>swings,</b> and a slogan found in it is: [...] "I don't play golf to feel bad; I play bad golf but feel good!" [...] In the video, many people hit the dirt out from the ground, drop their golf clubs into the water, and make other mistakes.|$|R
5000|$|Stewart was {{a popular}} golfer with spectators, who responded enthusiastically to his {{distinctive}} clothing. He was reputed to have the biggest wardrobe of all professional golfers and was a favorite of photographers because of his flamboyant attire of ivy caps and patterned pants, which were a cross between plus fours and knickerbockers, {{a throwback to the}} once-commonplace golf [...] "uniform". Stewart was also admired for having one of the most gracefully fluid and stylish <b>golf</b> <b>swings</b> of the modern era.|$|R
2500|$|Fleetwood-Smith was {{famed for}} his {{eccentric}} nature on the field. He would sing, whistle, practice his <b>golf</b> <b>swing,</b> imitate birds such as magpies and kookaburras, pretend to catch imaginary butterflies, and shout encouragement for his favourite football team, Port Melbourne. While playing in England, {{he liked to}} chant Lord Hawke's name and chat to the spectators {{with his back to}} the play. His inattention to batting and fielding exasperated his teammates; he was quoted as saying, [...] "if you can't be the best batsman in the world, you might as well be the worst." ...|$|E
2500|$|After turning {{professional}} in 1932, Nelson {{served as a}} club {{professional in}} Texas, and played as many significant tournaments as he could afford, to develop his game. Money was tight, as Texas was hit very hard by the Great Depression. A pair of top-three finishes in important Texas events encouraged him. He then took a club professional's job at the Ridgewood Country Club in New Jersey in 1935. He worked hard on his game, having earlier realized that with the technological change from hickory to steel shafts, which was gathering momentum in the early 1930s, that the <b>golf</b> <b>swing</b> would have to adapt as well. Nelson {{was among the first}} {{of a new generation of}} players who developed a full swing with increased leg drive leading the downswing; this is the forerunner of modern golf technique as practiced by top players, right to the present day. Nelson is sometimes credited as being the father of the modern <b>golf</b> <b>swing.</b> He refined the changes for a couple of years, and then took his game to the highest level of competition, the PGA Tour. Nelson waited until 1935 to post his first significant victory, at the New Jersey State Open. He followed this up with a win at the Metropolitan Open the following year. He reportedly won this tournament with [...] "$5 in my pocket".|$|E
2500|$|Theodore Ernest Els ( [...] ; born 17 October 1969) is a South African {{professional}} golfer. A former World No. 1, he {{is known}} as [...] "The Big Easy" [...] due to his imposing physical stature (he stands [...] ) along with his fluid <b>golf</b> <b>swing.</b> Among his 71 career victories are four major championships: the U.S. Open in 1994 at Oakmont and in 1997 at Congressional, and The Open Championship in 2002 at Muirfield and in 2012 at Royal Lytham & St Annes. He is one of six golfers to twice win both the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.|$|E
30|$|YouTube [35] dataset {{includes}} 11 action categories: basketball shooting, biking, diving, <b>golf</b> <b>swinging,</b> horseback riding, soccer juggling, swinging, tennis swinging, trampoline jumping, volleyball spiking, {{and walking}} with a dog. This dataset is very challenging due to large variations in camera motion, object appearance and pose, object scale, viewpoint, cluttered background, illumination conditions, etc. For each category, the videos are grouped into 25 groups. In total, 1168 videos {{are used in the}} experiment. Leave-one-out setup is utilized, and average accuracy over all classes is reported as the performance measure.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze a golfer’s {{movement}} and provide the feedback related to the golfer’s skill with the simple and novel ways. A golfer can easily measure <b>golf</b> <b>swings</b> and get feedback based on his performance using an Android smart phone without expensive or complicated devices. In this thesis, we designed and implemented an Android application using an accelerometer sensor to analyze swing data for identifying critical points and to give various kinds of feedback based on the data. The feedback helps golfers to understand their swing patterns, timing and speed so it makes them improve their skills...|$|R
30|$|UCF Sports [34] dataset {{contains}} ten human actions: diving, <b>golf,</b> <b>swinging,</b> kicking, weight lifting, horseback riding, running, skating, swinging bench, swinging side, and walking. For most action classes, {{there is}} considerable variation inaction performance, human appearance, camera movement, viewpoint, illumination, and background. Besides, due to its high resolution, we resize each video in it to half its original spatial to reduce the time consumption. Similar to [23], we add a horizontally flipped version of each sequence to the dataset to increase data samples and use the leave-one-out setup, i.e., testing on each original sequence while training on all other sequences except the flipped version of the tested sequence. We report average accuracy over all classes.|$|R
2500|$|Hogan {{believed}} that a solid, repeatable <b>golf</b> <b>swing</b> involved only a few essential elements, which, when performed correctly and in sequence, were {{the essence of the}} swing. His book Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf (written with Herbert Warren Wind) is perhaps the most widely read golf tutorial ever written, although Harvey Penick's Little Red Book would also have a claim to that title, and the principles therein are often parroted by modern [...] "swing gurus". In the Five Lessons, Hogan breaks down the swing into four parts: The Fundamentals, The Grip, Stance and Posture, and The Swing.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1967, {{the editor}} of Cary Middlecoff's 1974 book The <b>Golf</b> <b>Swing</b> watched every shot that 54-year-old Hogan hit in the Colonial National Invitational in Fort Worth, Texas. [...] "Hogan shot 281 for a third-place tie with George Archer. Of the 281 shots, 141 were taken in {{reaching}} the greens. Of the 141, 139 were rated from well-executed to superbly executed. The remaining two were a drive that missed the fairway by some 5 yards and a 5-iron to a par-3 hole that missed the green by about the same distance. It was difficult, if not impossible to conceive of anybody hitting the ball better over a four-day span." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>golf</b> <b>swing</b> is {{outwardly}} {{similar to}} many other motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement, such as an axe or a baseball bat; however, unlike many of these motions, {{the result of the}} swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed, to ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path, the clubface is in line with the swing path, and the ball impacts the centre or [...] "sweet spot" [...] of the clubface. The ability to do this consistently, across a complete set of clubs {{with a wide range of}} shaft lengths and clubface areas, is a key skill for any golfer, and takes a significant effort to achieve.|$|E
5000|$|Bad Kaeloo: The hulking, massive monster {{into which}} Kaeloo {{transforms}} when angry or threatened. While Kaeloo herself had stated {{in an early}} episode that the transformations must be triggered by anger, she has been seen in several episodes deliberately taking this form to cheat at games which require a level of physical prowess (e.g. strong <b>golf</b> <b>swings)</b> or to intimidate others. The transformations seem {{to be accompanied by}} a profound drop in intellectual capacity and reasoning, later followed by remorse once she returns to her [...] "normal" [...] form. This implies that Bad Kaeloo's actions are usually beyond her conscious control. It is hinted at in one episode that this personality will become the dominant one later in her life. The changes that occur are also characteristic of taking steroids.|$|R
