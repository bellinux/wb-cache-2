Severe kinetic loss of Pt activity on oxygen reduction reaction was observed for aromatic compounds due to the greater coverage on Pt/C than aliphatic compounds. An ion-exchange reaction by amine-containing aromatic compounds results in significant conductivity losses of the membrane/ionomer, which is main contributor of the performance loss in this study.

The dependencies of the bend angle of dsDNA on the composition and the length of the looped regions were determined. It was established that the bend of the irregular region of dsDNA depended on the electrostatic interaction of the phosphate residues. The tension in the complex structure could be reduced by the introduction of additional nucleotide units opposite the loop, which led to some relaxation of the bent helix.

OBJECTIVES: (i) To investigate whether it is relevant to add isobornyl acrylate to the (meth) acrylate test series. (ii) To report patients with (meth) acrylate contact allergy at an occupational dermatology clinic. PATIENTS/MATERIALS/METHODS: Our patch test database was screened for positive reactions to (meth) acrylates between 1993 and 2012. A selected group of 14 patients was tested with an isobornyl acrylate dilution series: 0. 3 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 033 %, and 0. 01 %. Readings were performed on D 2, D 3, and D 7. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one patients were tested with our (meth) acrylate series; 24 had positive reactions. Most positive reactions were to 2 -hydroxypropyl acrylate, 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 -hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and <b>diethyleneglycol</b> diacrylate. Hypothetical screening with 2 -hydroxypropyl acrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, ethoxylated bisphenol A glycol dimethacrylate and trimethylolpropane triacrylate identified 91. 7 % of the 24 patients.

Studies were carried out using DDW and the effect of temperature, pressure and orifice size on CFL; it was found that low temperatures and high pressures resulted in more intense CFL. The effect of re-gassing with different noble gases was investigated and resulted in a large increase in CFL. Investigations in to the effect of solute concentration on CFL were performed using dimethylsulphoxide, polyethyleneglycol- 200, isopropanol, <b>diethyleneglycol</b> and Triton X 100 & titanium sulphate nano-particles. Solutes with low vapour pressures resulted in an increase in CFL whereas solutes with a high vapour pressure supressed CFL, due to quenching effects. Low resolution spectra were produced using bandwidth filters to identify wavelength areas of strong emission from CFL...|$|E
40|$|Background Acrylates {{constitute}} an important cause of occupational contact dermatitis. Isobornyl acrylate sensitization {{has been reported}} in only 2 cases. We encountered an industrial process operator with occupational contact dermatitis caused by isobornyl acrylate. Objectives (i) To investigate whether it is relevant to add isobornyl acrylate to the (meth) acrylate test series. (ii) To report patients with (meth) acrylate contact allergy at an occupational dermatology clinic. Patients/materials/methods Our patch test database was screened for positive reactions to (meth) acrylates between 1993 and 2012. A selected group of 14 patients was tested with an isobornyl acrylate dilution series: 0. 3 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 033 %, and 0. 01 %. Readings were performed on D 2, D 3, and D 7. Results One hundred and fifty-one patients were tested with our (meth) acrylate series; 24 had positive reactions. Most positive reactions were to 2 -hydroxypropyl acrylate, 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 -hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and <b>diethyleneglycol</b> diacrylate. Hypothetical screening with 2 -hydroxypropyl acrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, ethoxylated bisphenol A glycol dimethacrylate and trimethylolpropane triacrylate identified 91. 7 % of the 24 patients. No positive reactions were observed in 14 acrylate-positive patients tested with the isobornyl acrylate dilution series. The 0. 3 % isobornyl acrylate concentration induced irritant reactions in 3 patients. Conclusions We report a rare case of allergic contact dermatitis caused by isobornyl acrylate. However, this study provides insufficient support for isobornyl acrylate to be added to a (meth) acrylate series. ...|$|E
40|$|Urchin-like CoSe 2 {{assembled}} by nanorods has been synthesized via simple solvothermal route {{and has been}} first applied as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with ether-based electrolytes. The CoSe 2 delivers excellent sodiation and desodiation properties when using 1 m NaCF 3 SO 3 in <b>diethyleneglycol</b> dimethylether as an electrolyte and cycling between 0. 5 and 3. 0 V. A high discharge capacity of 0. 410 Ah g− 1 is obtained at 1 A g− 1 after 1800 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention of 98. 6 % calculated from the 30 th cycle. Even at an ultrahigh rate of 50 A g− 1, the capacity still maintains 0. 097 Ah g− 1. The reaction mechanism of the as-prepared CoSe 2 is also investigated. The results demonstrate that at discharged 1. 56 V, insertion reaction occurs, while two conversion reactions {{take place at the}} second and third plateaus around 0. 98 and 0. 65 V. During the charge process, Co first reacts with Na 2 Se to form NaxCoSe 2 and then turns back to CoSe 2. In addition to Na/CoSe 2 half cells, Na 3 V 2 (PO 4) 3 /CoSe 2 full cell with excessive amount of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4) 3 has been studied. The full cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 0. 380 Ah g− 1. This work definitely enriches the possibilities for anode materials for SIBs with high performance...|$|E
40|$|The ionic liquids (ILs) 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidizolium {{chloride}} (C 4 mim-C 1), 1 -butyl- 3 - methylimidizolium <b>diethyleneglycol</b> monomethylethersulfate ([C 4 mim]DEMGS), and 1 -butyl- 1 -methylpyrollidinium dihydrogenphosphate ([p 1, 4]dhp) {{were tested}} for {{their effects on}} the crystallization of the proteins canavalin, beta-lactoglobulin B, xylanase, and glucose isomerase, using a standard high throughput screen. The crystallization experiments were set up with the ILs added to the protein solutions at 0. 2 and 0. 4 M final concentrations. Crystallization droplets were set up at three proteixprecipitant ratios (1 : 1, 2 : 1, and 4 :l), which served to progressively dilute {{the effects of the}} screen components while increasing the equilibrium protein and IL concentrations. Crystals were obtained for all four proteins at a number of conditions where they were not obtained from the IL-free control experiment. Over half of the protein-IL combinations tested had more successful outcomes than negative, where the IL-free crystallization was better than the corresponding IL-containing outcome, relative to the control. One of the most common causes of a negative outcome was solubilization of the protein by the IL, resulting in a clear drop. In one instance, we were able to use the IL-induced solubilizing to obtain beta-lactoglobulin B crystals from conditions that gave precipitated protein in the absence of IL. The results suggest that it may be feasible to develop ILs specifically for the task of macromolecule crystallization...|$|E
40|$|The hydrolytic {{activities}} of beta-galactosidases {{from three different}} sources have been determined in various 50 % (v/v) organic solvent-buffer mixtures {{with a view to}} finding solvent systems of reduced water content suitable for the synthesis of glycosides and oligosaccharides. K. fragilis beta-galactosidase lost activity rapidly (within 30 min) in all mixtures examined. The enzymes from E. coli and A. oryzae retained significant activity during extended periods (120 h) and are suitable for synthetic experiments. The level of activity depended on the enzyme and organic component of the solvent in the order tetraglyme > triethyl phosphate > monoglyme > triglyme = trimethyl phosphate > diglyme > diethylene glycol diethyl ether > 2 -methoxyethyl acetate > acetone = acetonitrile (zero activity) for the E. coli enzyme and methoxyethyl acetate > trimethyl phosphate > triethyl phosphate > monoglyme > acetone approximate to diglyme approximate to triglyme approximate to tetraglyme > <b>diethyleneglycol</b> diethyl ether > acetonitrile for the A. oryzae enzyme. The decay in hydrolytic activity over time was exponential, and in some cases biphasic with the second decay phase being an order of magnitude slower than the first. The reduction in enzyme activity was shown to be reversible with respect to the removal of organic solvent by dialysis and is attributed to changes in substrate solvation as well as partial enzyme denaturation. Changes in V-max/K-M for the beta-galactosidase-catalysed hydrolysis of 2 -nitrophenyi-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPGal) are weakly correlated with lipophilicity of the added cosolvent. In several cases, we successfully used various organic water-miscible solvent systems in the aid of oligosaccharides versus hydrolysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
