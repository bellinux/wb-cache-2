40|$|Complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays are a {{powerful}} high throughput technology {{developed in the}} last decade allowing researchers to analyze the behaviour and interaction of thousands of genes simultaneously. The large amount of information provided by microarray images requires automatic techniques to develop accurate and ef cient processing. Each spot in the microarray contains the hybridization level of a single gene. One of the most important features of these images are the regularity and pseudo-periodicity implicit in the spot arrangement. In this paper, an automatic approach based on texture analysis techniques is proposed to localize spots in microarray images. The method estimates the displacement vectors which characterize the texture (i. e. the spot arrangement). This is achieved by means of applying the generalized Hough transform on the 2 D autocorrelation function previously segmented via morphological operations. The obtained displacement vectors are used to generate a <b>grid</b> <b>template</b> which is matched to the original image. The root mean square error between the estimated locations and the ones computed via a semiautomatic tool is computed to evaluate the accuracy of the process.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction and objective: Focal {{cryotherapy}} {{emerged as}} an efficient option to treat favorable and localized prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of this video is to describe the procedure step by step. Materials and methods: We present {{the case of a}} 68 year-old man with localized PCa in the anterior aspect of the prostate. Results: The procedure is performed under general anesthesia, with the patient in lithotomy position. Briefly, the equipment utilized includes the cryotherapy console coupled with an ultrasound system, argon and helium gas bottles, cryoprobes, temperature probes and an urethral warming catheter. The procedure starts with a real-time trans-rectal prostate ultrasound, which is used to outline the prostate, the urethra and the rectal wall. The cryoprobes are pretested and placed in to the prostate through the perineum, following a <b>grid</b> <b>template,</b> along with the temperature sensors under ultrasound guidance. A cystoscopy confirms the right positioning of the needles and the urethral warming catheter is installed. Thereafter, the freeze sequence with argon gas is started, achieving extremely low temperatures (- 40 °C) to induce tumor cell lysis. Sequentially, the thawing cycle is performed using helium gas. This process is repeated one time. Results among several series showed a biochemical disease-free survival between 71 - 93 % at 9 - 70 month- follow-up, incontinence rates between 0 - 3. 6 % and erectile dysfunction between 0 - 42 % (1 – 5).

30|$|This study delineates {{and maps}} the hydrocarbon-bearing {{reservoir}} HD 2000 from surface seismic sections and well logs within the depth interval of 5, 700  ft (1, 737  m) and 6, 200  ft (1, 890  m). The {{objective is to}} establish the geometry, reservoir distribution, delineate hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs from surface seismic sections and well logs. In this process, a 3 -D structural interpretation and estimation {{of the volume of}} hydrocarbon in place of the reservoirs was carried out. Well-to-seismic tie revealed that hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs were associated with direct hydrocarbon indicators (bright spots and dim spots) on the seismic sections. Two horizons were studied (HD 2 and HD 2 _version 2) and several faults mapped for the purpose of carrying out 3 -D subsurface structural interpretation. This was used in generating the time structure maps. From the maps, it was observed that the principal structure responsible for hydrocarbon entrapment in the field was the anticlinal structure {{at the center of the}} field which tied to the crest of the rollover structure seen on the seismic sections. Check shots from the control well were used to create a velocity model from which the time to depth conversion was made. Horizon slice taken shows the reservoir spans a thickness of 400  ft. Direct hydrocarbon indicators were used to map the reservoir boundary. They were seen on the reflection amplitude maps as high amplitude zones (bright spots) and low amplitude zones (dim spots). Reservoir area extent estimated by square <b>grid</b> <b>template</b> method revealed that reservoir HD 2000 had an area estimate of 5.29  km 2. The results show the effectiveness of the estimation techniques in the lateral prediction of reservoir properties, discriminating litho-fluid and determining the porosity, saturation, net-to-gross ratio, and moreover the reserve volume. Hydrocarbon saturation varied between 0.64 and 0.65, while effective porosity varied between 0.31 and 0.32. Estimation of the volume of hydrocarbon in place revealed that the delineated reservoir HD 2000 contained an estimate of 776, 545, 418.22 barrels (123, 460, 855.4  cm 3) of hydrocarbon which shows great potential of considerable size.|$|E

Methods: The system is fed with information from the planning system with regard to each seed’s location and its depth, and an entry file is automatically created with all the cards (instructions) for each seed regarding their cell blocks and surfaces spread out spatially in the 3 D environment. The system provides with precision a reproduction of the clinical scenario for the MCNPX code’s simulation environment, thereby allowing the technique’s in-depth study. Results and Conclusion: The preliminary results from this study showed that the lateral penumbra of uniform scanning proton beams was less sensitive In order to validate the computational system, an entry file was created with 88 125 I seeds that were inserted in the phantom’s MAX 06 prostate region with initial activity determined for the seeds at the 0. 27 mCi value. Isodose curves were obtained in all the prostate slices in 5 mm steps in the 7 to 10 cm interval, totaling 7 slices. Variance reduction techniques were applied in order to optimize computational time and the reduction of uncertainties such as photon and electron energy interruptions in 4 keV and forced collisions regarding cells of interest. Through the acquisition of isodose curves, the results obtained show that hot spots have values above 300 Gy, as anticipated in literature, stressing the importance of the sources’ correct positioning, in which the computational system developed provides, in order not to release excessive doses in adjacent risk organs. The 144 Gy prescription curve showed in the validation process that it covers perfectly {{a large percentage of the}} volume, at the same time that it demonstrates a large decline for short distances.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of simultaneous EEG and fMRI data is generally {{based on the}} extraction of regressors of interest from the EEG, which are correlated to the fMRI data in a general linear model setting. In more advanced approaches, the spatial information of EEG is also exploited by assuming underlying dipole models. In this study, we present a semi automatic and efficient method to determine electrode positions from electrode gel artifacts, facilitating the integration of EEG and fMRI in future EEG/fMRI data models. In order to visualize all electrode artifacts simultaneously in a single view, a surface rendering of the structural MRI is made using a skin triangular mesh model as reference surface, which is expanded to a "pancake view". Then the electrodes are determined with a simple mouse click for each electrode. Using the geometry of the skin surface and its transformation to the pancake view, the 3 D coordinates of the electrodes are reconstructed in the MRI coordinate frame. The electrode labels {{are attached to the}} electrode positions by fitting a <b>template</b> <b>grid</b> of the electrode cap in which the labels are known. The correspondence problem between template and sample electrodes is solved by minimizing a cost function over rotations, shifts and scalings of the <b>template</b> <b>grid.</b> The crucial step here is to use the solution of the so-called "Hungarian algorithm" as a cost function, which makes it possible to identify the electrode artifacts in arbitrary order. The <b>template</b> electrode <b>grid</b> has to be constructed only once for each cap configuration. In our implementation of this method, the whole procedure can be performed within 15 min including import of MRI, surface reconstruction and transformation, electrode identification and fitting to template. The method is robust in the sense that an electrode template created for one subject can be used without identification errors for another subject for whom the same EEG cap was used. Furthermore, the method appears to be robust against spurious or missing artifacts. We therefore consider the proposed method as a useful and reliable tool within the larger toolbox required for the {{analysis of}} co-registered EEG/fMRI data. © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

We formulate this task as a regression problem and train our network by leveraging upon manually annotated facial landmarks "in-the-wild". We use such landmarks to establish a dense correspondence field between a three-dimensional object template and the input image, which then serves as the ground-truth for training our regression system. We show that we can combine ideas from semantic segmentation with regression networks, yielding a highly-accurate "quantized regression" architecture. Our system, called DenseReg, allows us to estimate dense image-to-template correspondences in a fully convolutional manner. As such our network can provide useful correspondence information as a stand-alone system, while when used as an initialization for Statistical Deformable Models we obtain landmark localization results that largely outperform the current state-of-the-art on the challenging 300 W benchmark.

We discuss the case of the cluster B 407, with a metallicity [Fe/H] ~- 0. 6 and located at a large projected distance from the centre of M 31 and from the galaxy major axis. Metal-rich globulars at large galactocentric distances are rare both in M 31 and in the MW. B 407, in addition, has a velocity in stark contrast with the rotation pattern shared by the bulk of M 31 clusters of similar metallicity. This, along with other empirical evidence, supports the hypothesis that the cluster is physically associated with a substructure in the M 31 halo that has been interpreted as the relic of a merging event.

With {{the aim of}} {{increasing}} the sample of M 31 clusters for which a colour-magnitude diagram is available, we searched the HST archive for ACS images containing objects included in the Revised Bologna Catalogue of M 31 globular clusters ⋆ ⋆. Methods. Sixty-three such objects were found. We used the ACS images to confirm or revise their classification {{and were able to}} obtain useful CMDs for 11 old globular clusters and 6 luminous young clusters. We obtained simultaneous estimates of the distance, reddening, and metallicity of old clusters by comparing their observed field-decontaminated CMDs with a <b>grid</b> of <b>template</b> clusters of the Milky Way. We estimated the age of the young clusters by fitting with theoretical isochrones. Results. For the old clusters, we found metallicities in the range− 0. 4 ≤[Fe/H]≤− 1. 9. The individual estimates generally agree with existing spectroscopic estimates. At least four of them display a clear blue horizontal branch, indicating ages> ∼ 10 Gyr. All six candidate young clusters are found to have ages< 1 Gyr. The photometry of the clusters is made publicly available through a dedicated web page. Conclusions. With the present work the total number of M 31 GCs with reliable optical CMD increases from 35 to 44 for the old clusters, and from 7 to 11 for the young ones. The old clusters show similar characteristics to those of the MW. We discuss the case of the cluster B 407, with a metallicity [Fe/H]≃− 0. 6 and located at a large projected distance from the centre of M 31 (Rp= 19. 8 kpc) and from the major axis of the galaxy (Y = 11. 3 kpc).
