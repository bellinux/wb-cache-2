5|$|Barbette {{continued}} to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report {{the year as}} 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942. The end of Barbette's performing career is attributed {{to a number of}} causes including a fall, pneumonia, polio, or some combination of the three. All generally agree that whatever the cause, Barbette was left in extreme pain and in need of surgery and extensive rehabilitation to allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> again.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, Minton {{suffered}} a heart attack while in Washington; he was hospitalized for three months at Walter Reed Hospital. After returning to work, he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia, and he sought to lessen his workload. To further complicate his health, on August 5, 1949, Minton tripped over a stone in his yard and broke his leg. The injury forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> with a cane for the remainder of his life.|$|E

5|$|Narseh {{declared}} war on Rome in 295 or 296. He appears to have first invaded western Armenia, where he seized the lands delivered to Tiridates in the peace of 287. Narseh moved south into Roman Mesopotamia in 297, where he inflicted a severe defeat on Galerius in the region between Carrhae (Harran, Turkey) and Callinicum (Raqqa, Syria) (and thus, the historian Fergus Millar notes, probably somewhere on the Balikh River). Diocletian {{may or may not}} have been present at the battle, but he quickly divested himself of all responsibility. In a public ceremony at Antioch, the official version of events was clear: Galerius was responsible for the defeat; Diocletian was not. Diocletian publicly humiliated Galerius, forcing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> for a mile at the head of the Imperial caravan, still clad in the purple robes of the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Raziel, a disfigured and ghostly vampire. The game {{is normally}} shown from a third-person perspective behind Raziel, but players can rotate the viewpoint around him. Gameplay relies largely on shifting between {{the material and}} spectral planes of existence to progress through areas. Although interaction with objects is limited in the spectral realm, this can be advantageous, because Raziel can phase through otherwise impassable gates there, and water is insubstantial, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> on lakebeds; however, blocks, doors, and switches can be manipulated only in the physical realm. Many puzzles {{are based on the}} differences between the two realms; for example, platforms and environment features in one realm may change form to open new paths in the other. Block puzzles are also common and require the rotation, flipping, and moving of large blocks to progress, often with a time limit and while avoiding enemies.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} special cap power-ups appear {{in certain areas}} on many stages. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to {{withstand}} wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons {{can be used to}} reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.|$|E

60|$|Thus adjured, {{the miserable}} Job, with a most awful yell, precipitated himself face {{downwards}} on the plank--he did not dare, small blame <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> it, and commenced to draw himself across in little jerks, his poor legs hanging down {{on either side}} into the nothingness beneath.|$|R

5|$|Eusebius, Lactantius, and Constantine each {{allege that}} Galerius was the prime {{impetus for the}} {{military}} purge, and its prime beneficiary. Diocletian, for all his religious conservatism, still had tendencies towards religious tolerance. Galerius, by contrast, was a devoted and passionate pagan. According to Christian sources, he was consistently the main advocate of such persecution. He was also eager to exploit this position to his own political advantage. As the lowest-ranking emperor, Galerius was always listed last in imperial documents. Until {{the end of the}} Persian war in 299, he had not even had a major palace. Lactantius states that Galerius hungered for a higher position in the imperial hierarchy. Galerius's mother, Romula, was bitterly anti-Christian, for she had been a pagan priestess in Dacia, and loathed the Christians for avoiding her festivals. Newly prestigious and influential after his victories in the Persian war, Galerius might have wished to compensate for a previous humiliation at Antioch, when Diocletian had forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{at the front of the}} imperial caravan, rather than inside it. His resentment fed his discontent with official policies of tolerance; from 302 on, he probably urged Diocletian to enact a general law against the Christians. Since Diocletian was already surrounded by an anti-Christian clique of counsellors, these suggestions must have carried great force.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E
5|$|Rhys {{meets with}} Jim Dolan {{for his first}} round of {{chemotherapy}} and assures him {{it is a simple}} procedure. He learns Karl and Susan Kennedy have been giving Jim advice about his treatment and he asks them to stop. A few days later, Jim informs Rhys that he wants to stop the chemotherapy. Rhys meets Kate Ramsay at the local bar and they have a one-night stand. During his rounds, Rhys checks on Jim and stays with him as he dies. Affected by Jim's death, Rhys goes to the gym looking for distraction and he befriends Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). Rhys flirts with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), but she rebuffs his advances. Jade later asks for Rhys' help in getting her housemate, Michelle Tran (HaiHa Le), to move out.

He then asks Karl if he can join his golf game with Martin Chambers, the head of surgery. Kyle invites Rhys to move in with him and Jade and he accepts. Kyle defends Rhys when he flirts with Steve Barnes' (Nicholas Gunn) girlfriend, but he refuses to listen when Rhys tells <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away. Steve punches Kyle, who becomes angry with Rhys for leaving him. Rhys apologises and hires a cleaner for the house to make it up to Kyle.|$|E

25|$|Although Nuvolari started 1938 as an Alfa Romeo driver, a split {{fuel tank}} {{in the first}} race of the season at Pau was enough for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out on the team, {{critical}} of the poor workmanship that was exhibited.

The following morning, her body was recovered from a water-filled pit by Penns Lane, Erdington. Thornton was quickly traced and arrested for her murder. At the trial, Thornton provided evidence that it was not possible for him to have killed Mary at the suggested time. As a result, the jury found him not guilty of her murder and rape, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> free from the court.|$|E
25|$|Robert the Devil's 1881 {{campaign}} {{began with}} an anti-climax as no owner entered a horse to oppose him in the Rosebery Plate at Newmarket, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> over to claim the prize money. On June 3,at the Derby meeting, Robert the Devil met Bend Or {{for the fifth time}} in the Epsom Gold Gup, over the Derby distance of one and a half miles. The Derby winner was in good form, having produced an impressive weight-carrying performance to win the City and Suburban Handicap in April. With other intended runners dropping out the race became a match, attracting extraordinary interest and provoking unprecedented scenes of excitement. Robert the Devil set off in front, and Archer followed close behind on Bend Or. Approaching the final furlong, Archer made his move, sending Bend Or into the lead. On this occasion, Robert the Devil could not respond and Bend Or appeared to have won rather more easily than the neck margin suggested.|$|E

Captain Allmand, however, with the utmost gallantry charged on by himself, hurling grenades into the enemy gun positions and killing three Japanese himself with his kukrie. Inspired by the splendid example of their platoon commander the surviving men followed him and captured their objective. Two days later Captain Allmand, owing to casualties among the officers, took over command of the Company and, dashing 30 yards ahead of it through long grass and marshy ground, swept by machine gun fire, personally killed a number of enemy machine gunners and successfully led his men onto the ridge of high ground {{that they had been}} ordered to seize.
