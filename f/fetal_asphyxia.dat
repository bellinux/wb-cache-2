Methods: In the study, 200 pregnant women were divided into four groups, including 50 cases with ICP and HBV infection, 50 cases with ICP, 50 cases with HBV infection, and 50 healthy pregnancies. The delivery process and perinatal outcomes were analyzed among different groups. Results: When compared to the healthy pregnancy group, significantly increased rates of premature rupture of membranes, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and cesarean section were observed in cases of ICP, HBV infection, or ICP patients with HBV (P< 0. 05). Specifically, the rates of HBV infection in the newborn, <b>fetal</b> distress, neonatal <b>asphyxia,</b> and birth defects in the newborn, and infant Apgar scores were higher in ICP pregnancies with HBV (56 %, 48 %, 16 %, and 48 %, respectively) than in the other groups (P< 0. 05).

After injection of catecholamines skin blood flow rose, tc PCO 2 fell and the arterio-transcutaneous difference in PCO 2 decreased. Then skin perfusion decreased and tc PCO 2 increased. We conclude, that during stress situations with a low skin perfusion, as in the acutely instrumented guinea pig, re PCO 2 is higher than the arterial PCO 2 and can be influenced by changes in skin blood flow.

40|$|Abstract Background Preeclampsia is a {{frequent}} syndrome and its cause {{has been linked to}} multiple factors, making prevention of the syndrome a continuous challenge. One of the suggested risk factors for preeclampsia is advanced maternal age. In the Western countries, maternal age at first delivery has been steadily increasing, yet few studies have examined women of advanced maternal age with preeclampsia. The purpose of this registry-based study was to compare the obstetric outcomes in primiparous and preeclamptic women younger and older than 35 years. Methods The registry-based study used data from three Finnish health registries: Finnish Medical Birth Register, Finnish Hospital Discharge Register and Register of Congenital Malformations. The sample contained women under 35 years of age (N[*]=[*] 15, 437) compared with those 35 and over (N[*]=[*] 2, 387) who were diagnosed with preeclampsia and had their first singleton birth in Finland between 1997 and 2008. In multivariate modeling, the main outcome measures were Preterm delivery (before 34 and 37 weeks), low Apgar score (5 min.), small-for-gestational-age, <b>fetal</b> death, <b>asphyxia,</b> Cesarean delivery, induction, blood transfusion and admission to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

Using a <b>fetal</b> lamb <b>asphyxia</b> model, we sought to determine whether hemodynamic or gas-exchange parameters predicted successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The umbilical cord was occluded in 22 lambs to induce asphyxial cardiac arrest. Following five minutes of asystole, resuscitation as per AHA-Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines was initiated. Hemodynamic parameters and serial arterial blood gases were assessed during resuscitation. ROSC occurred in 18 lambs (82 %) at a median (IQR) time of 120 (105 - 180) seconds. There were no differences in hemodynamic parameters at baseline and {{at any given time}} point during resuscitation between the lambs that achieved ROSC and those that did not. Blood gases at arrest prior to resuscitation were comparable between groups. However, lambs that achieved ROSC had lower PaO 2, higher PaCO 2, and lower lactate during resuscitation. Increase in diastolic blood pressures induced by epinephrine in lambs that achieved ROSC (11 ± 4 mmHg) did not differ from those that were not resuscitated (10 ± 6 mmHg). Low diastolic blood pressures were adequate to achieve ROSC. Hemodynamic parameters in a neonatal lamb asphyxia model with transitioning circulation did not predict success of ROSC. Lactic acidosis, higher PaO 2 and lower PaCO 2 observed in the lambs that did not achieve ROSC may represent a state of inadequate tissue perfusion and/or mitochondrial dysfunction...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: We compared 11 -β-HSD 2 gene expression in placental samples from all IUGR pregnancies treated in our clinic between January 1, 2010 and January 1, 2011 vs. 140 normal pregnancy samples from the same study period. Clinical characteristics were also assessed and compared between the IUGR and normal pregnancy groups. RESULTS: Mean gestational weight gain in the IUGR group was significantly lower than in the control group. Similarly, change in body mass index (BMI) was lower. Impending intrauterine <b>fetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> was significantly {{more common in the}} IUGR group. The 11 β-HSD 2 gene was underexpressed compared to controls, but this underexpression was only observed after the 33 rd gestational week. Within the IUGR group, in cases of impending intrauterine <b>fetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> the 11 β-HSD 2 gene was underexpressed compared to both impending asphyxia in non-IUGR cases, or IUGR without impending asphyxia. CONCLUSION: Low gestational weight gain appears to predict IUGR. The 11 β-HSD 2 gene in IUGR is underexpressed and may result in an impaired placental barrier, decreasing protection against maternal glucocorticoids, which are thought to be prominent in fetal programming. Maternal glucocorticoid exposure resulting from an impaired placental barrier may increase the risk for cardiovascular and metobolic disorders later in adult life. In IUGR, before the 33 rd gestational week, the expression of the 11 β-HSD 2 gene remains physiological. The underexpression of this gene after the 33 rd week in impending intrauterine <b>fetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> in IUGR points to an increased sensitivity to hypoxia when impending asphyxia is present in the late phase of IUGR pregnancies...|$|E

We measured heart rate, blood pressure, carotid and femoral blood flows, vascular resistance, electroencephalographic activity and cerebral changes in haemoglobin concentration by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Fetuses tolerated 30 min of asphyxia and the cardiovascular response was characterized by three phases: initial redistribution of blood flow away from the periphery to maintain vital organ function, partial failure of this redistribution and near terminal cardiovascular collapse, with profound hypotension and cerebral and peripheral hypoperfusion.

It is obvious that maternal convulsions resulting from an overdose or inadvertent intravascular injection of a local anesthetic may lead to <b>fetal</b> <b>asphyxia.</b> Paralysis of the mother's respiratory muscles by high epidural or spinal anesthesia may also result in maternal, and conse-quently fetal hypoxia. However, these complications are fortunately in-frequent in competent hands. A more common problem associated with epidural and spinal anesthesia i s maternal hypotension.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{value of}} the 12 -hour daily fetal movement count (DFMC) {{as a test of}} antepartum fetal wellbeing was assessed. The lowest 2 - 5 % of 1654 DFMCs recorded by 61 women who subsequently delivered healthy infants fell below 10 movements per 12 hours. This level was taken as the lower limit of normal for clinical purposes. A normal DFMC in a population at risk was associated with a satisfactory fetal outcome. A low DFMC was associated with a high incidence of <b>fetal</b> <b>asphyxia,</b> and when fetal death occurred fetal movements rapidly diminished and stopped 12 to 48 hours before death. The DFMC is a generally applicable method of monitoring fetal welfare during pregnancy which provides an inexpensive adjunct or even an alternative to the more expensive placental function tests in current use...|$|E
40|$|Background: Diabetes {{constitutes}} {{the most frequent}} medical complication during pregnancy, {{and it has a}} direct impact on the perinatal results. Objectives: To determine the effect of the diabetes on perinatal results. Methods: A descriptive study of series of cases was carried out. Of an universe of 13 603 childbirths from January 1 st, 2003 to December 31 st, 2005, in the Obstetric Service of the University Hospital ¨Dr. Gustavo Aldereguía Lima¨ in Cienfuegos, a sample of 229 pregnant women with diabetes was taken. Rates were determined for under weight, premature births, congenital malformations, late <b>fetal</b> deaths, macrosomia, <b>asphyxia</b> and assessment of caesarean operation in the diabetic women; as well as the risk of these complications for this group with regard to the non diabetic pregnant women and between the gestational and pre-gestational diabetes. Results: Diabetes incidence and pregnancy was of 1, 68 %. The risk of premature birth (17, 4 %), of under weight of the newborn (13, 1 %), macrosomia (15, 3 %), malformations (3, 5 %), neonatal death (0, 4 %), late fetal death (0, 9 %) and birth by Caesarean operation (64, 2 %) was higher in the diabetic population, with regard to the non diabetic. The pre- gestational diabetes turned out to have bigger risks with regard to the gestational one regarding the premature childbirth, the most important congenital malformations and the late fetal deaths. Conclusion: Although the province shows a low incidence of diabetes in the pregnancy, the risk of adverse perinatal results is considerable for this group, especially in pre-gestational diabetic women...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxyl radical (OH •) is a {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} produced during severe hypoxia, asphyxia or ischemia that can cause cell death resulting in brain damage. Generation of OH • may occur in the <b>fetal</b> brain during <b>asphyxia</b> in utero. The very short half-life of OH • requires use of trapping agents such as salicylic acid or phenylalanine for detection, but their hydroxylated derivatives are either unstable, produced endogenously, or difficult to measure in the small volume of microdialysis samples. In the present study we used terephthalic acid (TA), hydroxylation of which yields a stable and highly fluorometric isomer (excitation, 326 nm; emission, 432 nm). In vitro studies using OH • generated by the Fenton reaction showed that hydroxylated terephthalic acid formed quickly (< 10 sec), was resistant to bleaching (< 5 % change in fluorescence), and permitted detection of < 0. 5 pmol OH •. In vivo studies were performed in fetal sheep using microdialysis probes implanted into the parasagittal cortex. The probe was perfused at 2 µl/min with artificial CSF containing 5 mM TA and samples collected every 30 min. Fluorescence measured in 10 µl of dialysate was significantly greater than in the efflux from probes perfused without TA. HPLC analysis showed that the fluorescence in dialysis samples was entirely due to hydroxylation of TA. Thus, this study shows {{it is possible to}} use terephthalic acid as a trapping agent for detecting low concentration of OH • both in vitro and in vivo, and that low concentrations of OH • are present in fetal brain tissue and fluctuate with time...|$|R

Etiology Cerebral palsy is a condition that can arise at any time during brain development. Although its etiology is multifactorial, CP is usually linked to one of several prenatal, perinatal, neonatal or early childhood brain injuries or infections. Frequently, such injuries are sequelae of treatment for pulmonary complications associated with prematurity. 7, 8 The disorder occurs in proportion to the increasing rates of survival among low birthweight infants; incidence varies inversely with gestational age and/or birthweight, affecting approximately one significantly premature infant per hundred and one newborn infant per thousand. 9, 10, 11 While the etiology of CP is not fully understood, recognized causes include prenatal infection with rubella (German measles), cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis and meningitis; Rh blood group incompatibility between mother and child; <b>fetal</b> stroke; severe <b>asphyxia</b> during delivery, as well as a range of complications associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation. CPmay also be acquired postnatally as a result of stroke, head trauma, or brain infection. 12 Clinical manifestations Disabilities associated with CP range from mild to profound, and may include involuntary movements, poor coordination, problems maintaining balance, and difficulty executing voluntary movement. CP is classified on the basis of motor symptoms 13...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, 98 % of {{stillbirths}} {{occur in}} low-income countries (LIC), where stillbirth rates are ten-fold {{higher than in}} high-income countries (HIC). Although most HIC stillbirths occur prenatally, in LIC most stillbirths occur at term and during labor/delivery. Conditions causing stillbirths include those of maternal origin (obstructed labor, trauma, antepartum hemorrhage, preeclampsia/eclampsia, infection, diabetes, other maternal diseases), and fetal origin (fetal growth restriction, fetal distress, cord prolapse, multiples, malpresentations, congenital anomalies). In LIC, aside from infectious origins, most stillbirths are caused by <b>fetal</b> <b>asphyxia.</b> Stillbirth prevention requires recognition of maternal conditions, and care in a facility where fetal monitoring and expeditious delivery are possible, usually by cesarean section (CS). Of major causes, only syphilis and malaria can be managed prenatally. Targeting single conditions or interventions is unlikely to substantially reduce stillbirth. To reduce stillbirth rates, LIC must implement effective modern antepartum and intrapartum care, including fetal monitoring and CS...|$|E

Three methods have been propose namely (1) ANFIS (2) Wavelets preprocessing followed by ANFIS (3) ANFIS followed by wavelet post processing. The results obtained by three methods were analyzed in terms of signal to noise ratio, correlation coefficients and with performance indices.

40|$|Free radical-induced reperfusion {{injury is}} a {{recognized}} cause of brain {{damage in the}} newborn after birth asphyxia. The xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol reduces free radical synthesis and crosses the placenta easily. Therefore, allopurinol is a promising therapeutic candidate. This study tested the hypothesis that maternal treatment with allopurinol during <b>fetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> limits ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) damage to the fetal brain in ovine pregnancy. The I/R challenge was induced by 5 repeated measured compressions of the umbilical cord, each lasting 10 minutes, in chronically instrumented fetal sheep at 0. 8 of gestation. Relative to control fetal brains, the I/R challenge induced significant neuronal damage in the fetal hippocampal cornu ammonis zones 3 and 4. Maternal treatment with allopurinol during the I/R challenge restored the fetal neuronal damage toward control scores. Maternal treatment with allopurinol offers potential neuroprotection to the fetal brain in the clinical management of perinatal asphyxia...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Whether being {{small for}} gestational age (SGA) {{increases}} the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in premature infants remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: to study the impact of SGA (birthweight < percentile 10) on cognition, behavior, neurodevelopmental impairment and use of therapy at 5 years old. METHODS: This population-based prospective cohort included infants born before 32 weeks of gestation. Cognition was evaluated with the K-ABC, and behavior with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Primary outcomes were cognitive and behavioral scores, as well as neurodevelopmental impairment (cognitive score < 2 SD, hearing loss, blindness, or cerebral palsy). The need of therapy, an indirect indicator of neurodevelopmental impairment, was a secondary outcome. Linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze the association of SGA with neurodevelopment. RESULTS: 342 / 515 (76 %) premature infants were assessed. SGA was significantly associated with hyperactivity scores of the SDQ (coefficient 0. 81, p < 0. 04), but not with cognitive scores, neurodevelopmental impairment or the need of therapy. Gestational age, socio-economic status, and major brain lesions were associated with cognitive outcome in the univariate and multivariate model, whereas asphyxia, sepsis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were associated in the univariate model only. Severe impairment was associated with <b>fetal</b> tobacco exposition, <b>asphyxia,</b> gestational age and major brain lesions. Different neonatal factors were {{associated with the use of}} single or multiple therapies: children with one therapy were more likely to have suffered birth asphyxia or necrotizing enterocolitis, whereas the need for several therapies was predicted by major brain lesions. DISCUSSION: In this large cohort of premature infants, assessed at 5 years old with a complete panel of tests, SGA was associated with hyperactive behavior, but not with cognition, neurodevelopmental impairment or use of therapy. Birthweight < 10 th percentile alone does not appear to be an independent risk factor of neurodevelopmental adverse outcome in preterm children...|$|R

40|$|Localization is an {{important}} enabling technology for many applications, such as wireless sensor networks, emergency rescue services, civil defense and transportation. Suppose that a room is equipped with several microphones (or sensors), and one person is making a sound while moving around in the room. Can one find microphone and sound source positions as well as reconstruct a room geometry? The answer is “Yes”. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, a system for microphone self-localization based on ambient sound without any assumptions on the 3 D locations of the microphones and sound sources has been developed. The results show that the system works well when there is one dominant sound source. For such a setup the resulting accuracy is in the range of few millimeters. In addition, we also considered the problem when two microphones are fixed on a rigid rack. For such a constellation, particularly the minimal problems (i. e. minimal number of microphones and sources needed to solve the problem) have been analyzed and we have identified the number of solutions. Preterm birth is among the top causes of death in infants worldwide. Nowadays, increasing numbers of extremely preterm infants are surviving, however, they are at greater risk for short and long-term complications. The problem examined in the thesis is to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) activity burst patterns to predict outcome in preterm infants (fetus born between 23 - 30 weeks gestational age) by using feature extraction and machine learning techniques. For this purpose, pilot datasets from 15 extremely preterm born infants have been studied. The results showed 80 % of precision on the test set. However, because of the limited dataset, it is not possible to draw a solid conclusion about the exact predictability of our method. Nowadays surveillance of fetal condition during labor is made using cardiotocography (CTG). While there are impressive achievements in modern obstetric care, there is still room for improving automatic bed-side CTG-interpretation for finding early signs of fetal distress. Considerable expertise is required to interpret whether the fetal response to the uterine contractions is adequate, or fetal response shows sign of <b>fetal</b> exhaustion or <b>asphyxia.</b> In this work, we aim to automatically detect suspicious patterns in short intervals by finding the correlation between fetal heart rate patterns and uterine contraction patterns. Our proposed method has shown some predictive power, however, further research is needed to improve the results for this important problem...|$|R
