2500|$|TEPCO {{released}} further {{estimates of}} the state and location of the fuel in a November 2011 report. The report concluded that the Unit 1 RPV was damaged during the disaster and that [...] "significant amounts" [...] of molten fuel had fallen {{into the bottom of the}} PCV. The erosion of the concrete of the PCV by the molten fuel after the core meltdown was estimated to stop at approx. [...] in depth, while the thickness of the containment is [...] thick. <b>Gas</b> <b>sampling</b> carried out before the report detected no signs of an ongoing reaction of the fuel with the concrete of the PCV and all the fuel in Unit 1 was estimated to be [...] "well cooled down, including the fuel dropped on the bottom of the reactor". Fuel in Units 2 and 3 had melted, however less than in Unit 1, and fuel was presumed to be still in the RPV, with no significant amounts of fuel fallen to the bottom of the PCV. The report further suggested that [...] "there is a range in the evaluation results" [...] from [...] "all fuel in the RPV (none fuel fallen to the PCV)" [...] in Unit 2 and Unit 3, to [...] "most fuel in the RPV (some fuel in PCV)". For Unit 2 and Unit 3 it was estimated that the [...] "fuel is cooled sufficiently". According to the report, the greater damage in Unit 1 (when compared to [...] the other two units) was due to the longer time that no cooling water was injected in Unit 1. This resulted in much more decay heat [...] accumulating, as for about 1 day there was no water injection for Unit 1, while Unit 2 and Unit 3 had only a quarter of a day without water injection.|$|E

We pooled <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> –analogously to soil pooling – to overcome this challenge. Our sample pooling technique collects a composite <b>gas</b> <b>sample</b> from several chambers instead of the conventional practise of analyzing samples from chambers individually, thus reducing numbers of <b>gas</b> <b>samples.</b> The method was verified to be reasonably accurate in forest, grassland and agricultural fields over a four week measurement campaign.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to correlate the chem. compn. and the odor concn. of emissions produced during storage and composting of pig slaughterhouse sludge (PSS). Seven exptl. conditions were monitored using composting reactors with forced aeration and cells designed to simulate storage. Sixty-six <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> were collected and characterized by both GC-MS and olfactometry. Two types of correlation were investigated between the chem. compn. and the odor concn. (OC) of every <b>gas</b> <b>sample.</b> The odor activity value for a given emitted compd. (OAV) was computed as the ratio of its chem. concn. to its odor detection threshold (ODT). The correlation OAVMAX considered that the OC of a <b>gas</b> <b>sample</b> was equal to its highest OAV whereas the correlation OAVSUM considered that the odor of the <b>gas</b> <b>sample</b> was equal to the sum of the OAV of every compd. contained in the <b>gas</b> <b>sample.</b> As per Std. EN 13725, both OAVMAX and OAVSUM were compared using a confidence level for OC defined as [OC/ 1. 65 to 1. 65 × OC]. Whereas OAVMAX values were within the confidence level of OC for 62 % of the 66 <b>gas</b> <b>samples,</b> OAVSUM values were within this confidence level for only 53 %.

5000|$|It {{is useful}} {{to keep in mind}} that {{although}} the waves traverse the entire expansion chamber over each cycle, the actual gases leaving the cylinder during a particular cycle do not. The gas flows and stops intermittently and the wave continues on to the end of the pipe. The hot gases leaving the port form a [...] "slug" [...] which fills the header pipe and remains there for the duration of that cycle. This causes a high temperature zone in the head pipe which is always filled with the most recent and hottest gas. Because this area is hotter, the speed of sound and thus the speed of the waves that travel through it are increased. During the next cycle that slug of gas will be pushed down the pipe by the next slug to occupy the next zone and so on. The volume this [...] "slug" [...] occupies constantly varies according to throttle position and engine speed. It is only the wave energy itself that traverses the whole pipe during a single cycle. The actual gas leaving the pipe during a particular cycle was created two or three cycles earlier. (This is why exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> on two stroke engines is done with a special valve right in the exhaust port. The gas exiting the stinger has had too much resident time and mixing with gas from other cycles causing errors in analysis.) ...|$|E

40|$|The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Hazardous Waste Facility Permit (HWFP) {{limits the}} {{allowable}} emissions of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) from contact handled (CH) transuranic (TRU) waste. The environmental Performance standard within the HWFP, Module IV, Table IV. D. 1, prescribes the allowed VOC emissions from the waste to ensure protection of {{human health and the}} environment. Compliance with the performance standard to ensure control of VOC emissions is based on VOC concentrations and monitoring in the underground. One of the mechanisms used to ensure compliance with the emissions standards is measuring the VOC concentration in the headspace gas of waste containers prior to disposal. Headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis is the waste characterization activity used to determine the concentration of VOCs in the headspace of waste containers. In addition to being used to demonstrate compliance with the emissions standards of Module IV, Table IV.

Headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis has been an ongoing part of the CH TRU waste characterization program and therefore data are now available concerning its use and applicability. The information from approved Waste Stream Profile Forms (WSPFs) and the headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis results for over 16, 000 containers of CH TRU waste were considered as part of this study.
