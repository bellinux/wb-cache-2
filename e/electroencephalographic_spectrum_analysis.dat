40|$|This paper aims at {{developing}} a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysis</b> approach for suppressing the electromagnetic interference (EMI) in power converters via chaotic sinusoidal {{pulse width modulation}} (CSPWM) control signals based on double Fourier series. In detail, we prove that the total harmonics of power converters under CSPWM control are the same with those of power converters under traditional SPWM control. Then, we introduce a novel <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysis</b> approach based on sawtooth carrier and double Fourier series. Moreover, a photovoltaic (PV) inverter is used to validate the proposed <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysis</b> approach based on the calculation of the output voltage spectrum for CSPWM control signals. In particular, this proposed method {{can also be used}} for the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysis</b> of multiperiodic signals.

40|$|A {{hybrid model}} {{integrating}} artificial neural networks and support vector regression {{was developed for}} daily rainfall prediction. In the modeling process, singular <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysis</b> was first adopted to decompose the raw rainfall data. Fuzzy C-means clustering was then used to split the training set into three crisp subsets which {{may be associated with}} low-, medium- and high-intensity rainfall. Two local artificial neural network models were involved in training and predicting low- and medium-intensity subsets whereas a local support vector regression model was applied to the high-intensity subset. A conventional artificial neural network model was selected as the benchmark. The artificial neural network with the singular <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysis</b> was developed for the purpose of examining the singular <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysis</b> technique. The models were applied to two daily rainfall series from China at 1 -day-, 2 -day- and 3 -day-ahead forecasting horizons. Results showed that the hybrid support vector regression model performed the best. The singular <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysis</b> model also exhibited considerable accuracy in rainfall forecasting. Also, two methods to filter reconstructed components of singular <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysis,</b> supervised and unsupervised approaches, were compared.

40|$|Uroguanylin (UGN) is an {{endogenous}} peptide {{that acts}} on membrane-bound guanylate cyclase receptors of intestinal and renal cells increasing cGMP production and regulating electrolyte and water epithelial transport. Recent research works demonstrate {{the expression of}} this peptide and its receptor in the central nervous system. The current work was undertaken in order to evaluate modifications of <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>spectra</b> (EEG) in anesthetized Wistar rats, submitted to intracisternal infusion of uroguanylin (0. 0125 nmoles/min or 0. 04 nmoles/min). The current observations demonstrate that 0. 0125 nmoles/min and 0. 04 nmoles/min intracisternal infusion of UGN significantly enhances amplitude and frequency of sharp waves and evoked spikes (p = 0. 03). No statistical significance was observed on absolute alpha and theta spectra amplitude. The present data suggest that UGN acts on bioelectrogenesis of cortical cells by inducing hypersynchronic firing of neurons. This effect is blocked by nedocromil, suggesting that UGN acts by increasing the activity of chloride channels...|$|R
