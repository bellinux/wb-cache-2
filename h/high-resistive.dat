5000|$|Normal. At {{differential}} mode (the two input voltages change in opposite directions), the two voltage (emitter) followers oppose each other - {{while one of}} them tries to increase the voltage of the common emitter point, the other tries to decrease it (figuratively speaking, one of them [...] "pulls up" [...] the common point while the other [...] "pulls down" [...] {{it so that it}} stays immovable) and v.v. So, the common point does not change its voltage; it behaves like a virtual ground with a magnitude determined by the common-mode input voltages. The <b>high-resistive</b> emitter element does not play any role it is shunted by the other low-resistive emitter follower. There is no negative feedback since the emitter voltage does not change at all when the input base voltages change. The common quiescent current vigorously steers between the two transistors and the output collector voltages vigorously change. The two transistors mutually ground their emitters; so, although they are common-collector stages, they actually act as common-emitter stages with maximum gain. Bias stability and independence from variations in device parameters can be improved by negative feedback introduced via cathode/emitter resistors with relatively small resistances.|$|E
