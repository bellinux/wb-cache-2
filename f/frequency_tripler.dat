40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the Heterostructure Barrier Varactor (HBV) and its application in frequency multipliers. Different HBV materials, fabrication processes, and device models are presented. The {{aim of this}} work {{is to improve the}} efficiency of HBV frequency multipliers. Efficiency limitations of symmetric varactor frequency multipliers are investigated. Simple varactor models with capacitance-voltage characteristics of varying shapes have been analyzed. Calculations show that the conversion efficiency is improved for a C(V) -shape with large non-linearity at zero-volt bias. For quintuplers, the optimal embedding impedance at the third harmonic is an inductance in reso-nance with the varactor capacitance.
