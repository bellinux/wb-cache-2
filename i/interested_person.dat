25|$|The High Court has general {{supervisory}} and revisionary {{jurisdiction over}} all subordinate courts. If {{the interests of}} justice appear to require it, the Court may, either {{of its own motion}} or if requested by any <b>interested</b> <b>person,</b> call for the records of any matter or proceeding in a subordinate court, whether civil or criminal, at any stage. It may then order that the matter be transferred to the High Court or give the subordinate court directions regarding how the matter should be conducted, as justice may require. When exercising supervisory or revisionary jurisdiction, it is for the Court {{to decide whether or not}} to hear submissions from any party to the proceedings; no party has a right to be heard before the Court. However, if the Court intends to make a final order that is to the prejudice of any person, that person must first be given an opportunity of being heard.|$|E

2500|$|An {{appropriately}} <b>interested</b> <b>person,</b> such as {{a losing}} candidate, may question the result (the [...] "return of the writ") in a federal election by a petition to the High Court as Court of Disputed Returns, normally within 40 days of the result. [...] A petition can also be filed by the Australian Electoral Commission. [...] The High Court may hear the whole case itself or may delegate factual questions for determination by the Federal Court; the High Court itself will determine the validity of a candidate's election or of the whole of that particular election, including issues of constitutional interpretation. [...] The admissible grounds for a petition are generally at the Court's discretion but include corruption and do not extend to administrative errors that have not affected the result. [...] The Court can compel production of documents and attendance of witnesses, and can examine witnesses on oath. [...] However, the Court [...] "must make its decision on a petition as quickly as is reasonable in the circumstances", it is not bound by strict rules of evidence, {{and all of its}} decisions [...] "shall be final and conclusive and without appeal, and shall not be questioned in any way" [...] (thus there is no recourse to the High Court in its other capacities or to the Parliament).|$|E

60|$|With strong concern, {{and with}} many reproaches {{for not being}} called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear {{in the morning of}} what had passed. Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her {{conviction}} of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less <b>interested</b> <b>person</b> with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's compassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Tarrant had an {{idea that}} she (Mrs. Tarrant) liked to study people, {{and that she was}} now engaged in an {{analysis}} of Miss Chancellor. It carried her far, and she came out at unexpected times with her results. It was still her purpose to interpret the world to the ingenious mind of her daughter, and she translated Miss Chancellor with a confidence which made little account {{of the fact that she}} had seen her but once, while Verena had this advantage nearly every day. Verena felt that by this time she knew Olive very well, and her mother's most complicated versions of motive and temperament (Mrs. Tarrant, with the most imperfect idea of the meaning of the term, was always talking about people's temperament) rendered small justice to the phenomena it was now her privilege to observe in Charles Street. Olive was much more remarkable than Mrs. Tarrant suspected, remarkable as Mrs. Tarrant believed her to be. She had opened Verena's eyes to extraordinary pictures, made the girl believe that she had a heavenly mission, given her, as we have seen, quite a new measure of the interest of life. These were larger consequences than the possibility of meeting the leaders of society at Olive's house. She had met no one, as yet, but Mrs. Luna; her new friend seemed to wish to keep her quite for herself. This was the only reproach that Mrs. Tarrant directed to the new friend as yet; she was disappointed that Verena had not obtained more insight into the world of fashion. It was one of the prime articles of her faith that the world of fashion was wicked and hollow, and, moreover, Verena told her that Miss Chancellor loathed and despised it. She could not have informed you wherein it would profit her daughter (for the way those ladies shrank from any new gospel was notorious); nevertheless she was vexed that Verena shouldn't come back to her with a little more of the fragrance of Beacon Street. The girl herself would have been the most <b>interested</b> <b>person</b> in the world if she had not been the most resigned; she took all that was given her and was grateful, and missed nothing that was withheld; she was the most extraordinary mixture of eagerness and docility. Mrs. Tarrant theorised about temperaments and she loved her daughter; but she was only vaguely aware of the fact that she had at her side the sweetest flower of character (as one might say) that had ever bloomed on earth. She was proud of Verena's brightness, and of her special talent; but the commonness of her own surface was a non-conductor of the girl's quality. Therefore she thought that it would add to her success in life to know a few high-flyers, if only to put them to shame; as if anything could add to Verena's success, as if it were not supreme success simply to have been made as she was made.|$|E
