Smith was asked to create a [...] "neural stimulator" [...] in the script to [...] "Momentum Deferred", but [...] "didn’t really know the episodes well enough to say, ‘Oh, ok, that’s exactly what it is.’ So <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> director, {{who had been on}} season 1, and he goes, ‘Oh, I don’t know, it’s just something that goes on the guy’s head'." [...] Smith discovered that the headpiece in question had been rented during the first season, causing him to recreate the prop over one weekend. He called this process [...] "a little bit stressful." [...] The gadget, Smith explained, was important because it [...] "defined the way that Walter works. He’s this mad scientist who takes conventional science and then puts his own twist on it, as it were. And then the thing that struck me about that one was that it made me uncomfortable to look at it." [...] Smith added, [...] "It’s {{one of those things that}} people love and hate about Fringe, it puts your [...] out of your comfort zone. That’s sort of what I was trying to say about Walter… there’s kind of a bird’s nest of wires everywhere, and then they end up on the guy’s head, and from that he can tell what the guy’s thinking. It’s quite cool." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2008, Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I thought I had {{the idea}} broken, but I've hit a wall in the final act that I haven't quite figured out". Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It has sort of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. I continue to want to do it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home video people, because a movie like that would be driven by video. The [...] didn't do that well... So they didn't feel there was a need or an audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|In press interviews, Myrons Captain Neal leveled {{criminal}} charges against the captains of Adriatic and H.P. McIntosh that prompted an investigation of many months by United States marine inspectors. At a special Steamboat Inspection Service hearing, Captain Neal stated: I was clinging {{to the roof of}} the pilothouse when the McIntosh hailed me shortly after the Myron went down from under me. The McIntosh drew alongside me, not more than [...] away. Although it was dusk, the ship was so close that I had no difficulty in making out her name. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> captain and expected that he would put out a yawl and pick me up. He did not do so, nor attempt in any way to help me. 'I will have a boat sent for you,' the captain of the McIntosh called. And he drew away. I have never seen him since, nor do I ever want to see him by the great hokey, pokey.|$|E

60|$|We {{have had}} a great many Russian and English gentlemen and ladies on board to-day, and the time has passed cheerfully away.

I was getting weak now, and sometimes I seemed to wander, and my thoughts got mixed up, and <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boys as if they could hear me. Once or twice my hold had slipped, and I had hard work enough to get hold again.

60|$|Sometimes we get {{a little}} fillip of excitement. One evening, as I was leaning over the railings, more than forty yards from the nearest sentry, a short man with a red {{moustache}} walked quickly down the street, followed by two colley dogs. As he passed, but without altering his pace in the slightest, or even looking towards me, he said quite distinctly 'Methuen beat the Boers to hell at Belmont.' That night the air seemed cooler and the courtyard larger. Already we imagined the Republics collapsing and the bayonets of the Queen's Guards {{in the streets of}} Pretoria. Next day <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> War Secretary. I had made a large map upon the wall and followed {{the course of the war}} as far as possible by making squares of red and green paper to represent the various columns. I said: 'What about Methuen? He has beaten you at Belmont. Now he should be across the Modder. In a few days he will relieve Kimberley.' De Souza shrugged his shoulders. 'Who can tell?' he replied; 'but,' he put his finger on the map, 'there stands old Piet Cronje in a position called Scholz Nek, and we don't think Methuen will ever get past him.' The event justified his words, and the battle which we call Magersfontein (and ought to call 'Maasfontayne') the Boers call Scholz Nek.|$|E

Then <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dear old professor, and he showed me the way. I can honestly say that not one penny of that money has ever been spent, directly or indirectly, upon myself. I believe that if the old man could come to life and read my bank-book he'd have a worse fit than the one which carried him off. I appointed myself the trustee of his fortune, and it's spread pretty well all over the world. I've never refused to stand at the back of any reasonable scheme for the betterment of our fellow-creatures. There have been a few failures perhaps, but many successes. The Davis buildings are mine--in trust, of course. They've done well. I've a larger scheme on hand now on the same lines. And in spite of it all the money grows! I can't get rid of it. The old man chose his investments well, and many of our purely philanthropic schemes are beginning to pay their way. It isn't that I care a fig about the money, but you must try to make these things self-supporting, or you injure the character of those who benefit by them. Now I've told you all the truth, but don't let it go out of this room. You can consider yourselves fellow-trustees with me, if you like. Show me an honest way to use money for the real benefit of the world's unfortunates, and it's yours as much as mine." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{would speak}} {{first of a}} contrast--and yet I have come to {{recognize}} how impossible it is to convey to the dweller in America the difference in atmosphere between England and France {{on the one hand}} and our country on the other. And when I use the word [...] "atmosphere" [...] I mean the mental state of the peoples as well as the weather and the aspect of the skies. I have referred in another article to the anxious, feverish prosperity one beholds in London and Paris, to that apparent indifference, despite the presence on the streets of crowds of soldiers to the existence of a war of which one is ever aware. Yet, along with this, one is ever conscious of pressure. The air is heavy; there is a corresponding lack of the buoyancy of mind which is the normal American condition. Perhaps, if German troops occupied New England and New York, our own mental barometer might be lower. It is difficult to say. At any rate, after an ocean voyage of nine days one's spirits rise perceptibly as the ship nears Nantucket; and the icy-bright sunlight of New York harbour, the sight of the buildings aspiring to blue skies restore the throbbing optimism which with us is normal; and it was with an effort, when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reporters on landing, that I was able to achieve and express the pessimism and darkness out of which I had come. Pessimism is perhaps too strong a word, and takes no account of the continued unimpaired morale and determination of the greater part of the British and French peoples. They expect much from us. Yet the impression was instantaneous, when I set forth in the streets of New York, that we had not fully measured the magnitude of our task--an impression that has been amply confirmed as the weeks have passed.|$|E
