5|$|Before Lucas {{had started}} writing, his {{producing}} partner Rick McCallum {{was preparing for}} the film. McCallum stated that his experience with The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles led to many of his decisions on The Phantom Menace, such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> creation of sets and landscapes with digital technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.|$|E

5|$|In 1911 another Royal Commission {{investigation}} into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was {{ignored by the}} state government, which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with {{the appointment of a}} superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> election of a Labor government with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Himmler {{founded the}} first SS {{business}} venture, Nordland-Verlag, a publishing house that released propaganda material and SS training manuals. Thereafter, he purchased Allach Porcelain, which {{then began to}} produce SS memorabilia. Because of the labor shortage and a desire for financial gain, the SS started exploiting concentration camp inmates as slave labor. Most of the SS businesses lost money until Himmler placed them under the administration of Pohl's Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt (Administration and Business office; VuWHA) in 1939. Even then, most of the enterprises were poorly run and did not fare well, as SS men were not selected for their business <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> workers were starving. In July 1940 Pohl established the Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH (German Businesses Ltd; DWB), an umbrella corporation under which he took over administration of all SS business concerns. Eventually the SS founded nearly 200 holding companies for their businesses.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|It has {{peaked in}} the top twenty of the United States and Canada, {{becoming}} Drake's fourth consecutive top twenty hit in the U.S. It also charted with{{in the top}} five on the U.S. R and rap charts, becoming Drake's fourth consecutive top five on those respective charts. The song has also charted in the United Kingdom and its R chart. The song's accompanying music video features Drake reflecting on an <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> struggle between his old life and the new. Several artists have made a freestyle over the track, including Eminem, Trey Songz, and Diggy Simmons, among others. Drake performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards. The track received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The song is also featured on the NBA 2K11 soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The CPFC 2010 consortium, {{consisting}} of businessmen Steve Parish, Martin Long, Stephen Browett and Jeremy Hosking, appointed former Scotland boss George Burley as the club's new {{manager for the}} 2010–11 season, with Freedman remaining at the club as his assistant. The club was short on players, with {{several members of the}} squad from the previous season having departed. One of Burley's first signings to bridge this gap was former Netherlands midfielder Edgar Davids. Palace started poorly in the league, however, and by November sat bottom, with Davids departing after less than impressive performances for the club. The club's away form {{in the first half of}} the season was poor and a heavy South London derby defeat to Millwall on New Year's Day saw Burley sacked, with Palace second-from-bottom in the Championship table. Dougie Freedman was appointed manager, Lennie Lawrence was brought in as his assistant to provide some much-needed <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> duo successfully guided Palace to safety with a game to spare.|$|E

Their orange groves, however, had gone, {{now part of the}} new state of Israel, which had declared its independence on 14 May 1948. The family moved to Nablus in the West Bank, then under Jordanian control. Abu Nidal graduated from high school there in 1955, and joined the Arab nationalist Ba'ath party. He began a degree course in engineering at Cairo University, but left without a degree after two years.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E
5|$|The first {{training}} courses at No.3 EFTS were not conducted by RAAF instructors {{under the auspices}} of EATS but by Essendon's civil organisations under government contract. The training aircraft were privately owned deHavilland Tiger Moths and Gipsy Moths. All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline, and the school's training program was directed by Squadron Leader King. The initial intake of sixteen students arrived on 8January 1940, and received eight weeks of instruction that finished on 4March; {{all but one of the}} trainees had prior flying <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> course was accident-free. The next student intake at No.3 EFTS arrived on 5February 1940. The school's inaugural EATS course commenced in May. Overall student numbers at this time were reported as being 48, while staff totalled 50. The second EATS course began in July. By this time, Essendon's civilian presence had effectively been absorbed by the military organisation; privately owned aircraft were taken over by the RAAF, which had also begun employing its own aircraft, the first being a Gipsy Moth that arrived in March. Training accidents were frequent, particularly during landings, but did not result in any fatalities.|$|E
