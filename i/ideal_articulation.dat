40|$|Total hip {{replacement}} {{is one of}} the most frequently performed and successful surgical procedures. Its most common modes of failure identified in joint registries are dislocation in the short term and aseptic loosening associated with wear and osteolysis in the long term. Therefore, the <b>ideal</b> <b>articulation</b> would have both a low incidence of dislocation and low wear. Metal-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) articulations of 36 mm diameter have been demonstrated in a randomised controlled trial to have a significantly lower incidence of dislocation at one year postoperatively compared to 28 mm articulations. Historically, large articulations (femoral head size ≥ 32 mm) have been associated with increased wear rates of conventional polyethylene compared to smaller articulations. Advances in polyethylene manufacture with cross-linking for clinical use in total {{hip replacement}}s has significantly reduced early wear rates compared to conventional polyethylene. This has prompted reconsideration of the ideal femoral head size to enhance the longevity of articulations. This study aims to compare the wear of 36 mm and 28 mm metal-on-highly crosslinked polyethylene total hip replacements through a post hoc analysis of radiographs of patients enrolled in the randomised controlled trial referred to above. Comparison of wear rates between cohorts was undertaken by use of computer-assisted analysis (PolyWare™) of patient radiograph sets. Radiograph sets for 326 patients, 164 with 28 mm and 162 with 36 mm articulations, were analysed. 36 mm metal-on-HXLPE articulations were found to have a statistically significant higher magnitude of bedding-in and creep at three but not twelve months when compared to the 28 mm cohort. The mean annual two-dimensional wear rate from 1 year until final radiograph was 0. 00 mm/yr for both cohorts. There were no differences between 36 mm to 28 mm cohorts in mean annual volumetric wear rates or significant differences in the proportion of patients in each cohort with two-dimensional wear rates ≥ 0. 1 mm/yr or volumetric wear rates ≥ 80 mm³/yr. These wear rates have previously been associated with osteolysis when using metal-on-conventional polyethylene articulations. While the use of large articulations had been reported to be associated with comparatively greater wear rates of articulations incorporating conventional PE, this appears not to apply to large articulations incorporating HXLPE. The low wear rates measured combined with the findings of the RCT of a significantly reduced incidence of dislocation at one year of 36 mm compared to 28 mm articulations, support the use of 36 mm metal-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene articulations. Longer term follow-up is required to assess whether low wear rates are maintained for both 36 mm cohorts and whether wear of HXLPE is associated with the development of periprosthetic osteolysis.

40|$|Movement {{modeling}} {{and control of}} a bonnet tool polishing machine, based on a strategy of static highest-stiffness, are presented. The aim is to achieve polishing controllability as the bonnet tool executes a precessive motion trajectory. Taking an aspheric optical surface, e. g. lens or mirror, as the workpiece, the precessive polishing tool trajectory is designed as if the moving parts were rigid bodies connected by <b>ideal</b> <b>articulations.</b> Then by establishing the Jacobian stiffness matrix of the bonnet tool machine, the static stiffness of the machine is derived taking into account tool loading along its path. To minimize deformation, the control algorithm that achieves a maximum static stiffness strategy is superposed on the rigid body system tool trajectory model. This combined bonnet tool trajectory is produced by numerical simulation. Finally suitability of the rigid body movement model, compensated for desired static, but not inertial, load deflection, is assessed by simulating the trajectory of the tools rotational axis {{to determine how much}} angular deviation it sustains from the local surface normal. It was found that this bonnet polishing tool compensation method, based on a greatest static stiffness strategy, will produce satisfactory results. ? 2014 The Chinese Institute of Engineers...|$|R
40|$|Coordination of {{counselor}} {{education and}} supervision {{is one of}} the major issues demanding immediate attention. Various background aspects are discussed: (1) the need for counseling supervisn, (2) the function of counseling supervision, (3) the goals of supervision, (4) the status of supervision, and (5) the Purposes of this study. Tncluded in this last point are the congruence of supervision in practice now and the <b>ideal,</b> and the <b>articulation</b> between supervision in counseling preparation and on-the-job counseling. While much has been written on supervision, there is little agreement on function and technique. Various research studies are cited. Instruments were developed by a Committee on Counselor Effectiveness and sent to 2, 000 members of the Association of Counselor Education and Supervision. Of the 2, 00 e sent, 613 were returned. After analyzing the data, six recommendations were presented, including: (1) the qualifications of supervisio...|$|R
40|$|The several {{contributors}} 2005. All rights reserved. This chapter explores one of {{the most}} problematic theoretical commitments of Edmund Husserl's phenomenological projects: the idea of a logic of consciousness or phenomenologic. It shows why Husserl is committed to this idea and why it is so out of step with contemporary approaches in the philosophy of mind. It then tries to render the idea intelligible along two paths. First, to take the idea of a logic of consciousness seriously, we must challenge our entrenched atomistic assumptions about conscious states. Second, to recognize the sense in which a science of consciousness might be logical, we must come to terms with Husserl's conception of an ideal science. For on a Husserlian conception, apophantic logic and phenomenology must be seen as two varieties of <b>ideal</b> science: systematic <b>articulations</b> of the content and structure of an ideal that is constitutive for conscious experience of a world...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{introduction}} of different interocclusal recording materials has put clinicians in dilemma that which material {{should be used}} in routine clinical practice for precise recording and transferring of accurate existing occlusal records for articulation of patient’s diagnostic or working casts in the fabrication of good satisfactory prosthesis. In the era of developing world of dentistry the different materials are introduced for interocclusal record with different brand names because of this; the utility of the material is confusing for successful delivery of prosthesis with lack of in vitro or in vivo studies which will predict the property of the material with utility recommendations. Purpose of the study The aim of this multicenter research is to evaluate the time dependent linear dimensional stability of three types of interocclusal recording materials; which gives very clear idea to clinicians in regard to its usage in routine practice and recommendations for usage of the different materials. Also to find out <b>ideal</b> time for <b>articulation</b> of three types of interocclusal recording materials with accuracy. Materials and method Commercially available and ADA approved Polyether bite registration paste (Ramitec), Poly vinyl siloxane bite registration paste (Jetbite) and Zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) bite registration paste (Super bite) were used in the study. A stainless steel die was made according to modified American dental Associations (ADA) specification no. 19. Each one of the tested materials were manipulated according to manufacturers’ instructions. The materials separated from die, 3 -mins after their respective setting time, resulted in disks of standard diameter. Two parallel lines and three perpendicular lines reproduced on the surface. The distance between two parallel lines was measured at different time intervals i. e. 1 hour, 24, 48 and 72 hours by using travelling microscope (magnus) and compared with standard die measurements made according to ADA specification no. 19 to find out the dimensional stability of these interocclusal recording materials. Total 120 samples were made for observation and results were subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and then Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test for comparison among groups at the 0. 05 level of significance. After statistical analysis of the data, results were obtained and analyzed for interpretation. Results The results shows significant difference between the dimensional stability of all three material at different intervals with p-value Conclusion The dimensional stability decreased with increase in time and is influenced by both material factor and time factor. Polyether was found to be more dimensionally stable interocclusal recording material, which was followed by Silicone and Zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE). The dimensional stability of Polyether was good. Zinc oxide eugenol is dimensionally more unstable when compared with polyether and polyvinyl siloxane. We recommend that the polyether interocclusal records must be articulated within 48 hours and Polyvinylsiloxane interocclusal records must be articulated within 24 hours and the ZOE should be articulated within 1 hour to get a correct restoration to have very minimum distortion and maximum satisfaction without failure of prosthesis. </p...|$|R
