5|$|A 2008 {{molecular}} phylogenetic study clarified {{the relationships}} among the mushroom-forming species of the family. The authors demonstrated the existence of four distinct lineages of <b>gilled</b> mushrooms, {{which led to the}} description of Multifurca as a new genus separated from Russula and the segregation of Lactifluus from Lactarius.|$|E
5|$|The Russulaceae are {{a diverse}} family of fungi {{in the order}} Russulales, with roughly 1,900 known species and a {{worldwide}} distribution. They comprise the brittlegills and the milk-caps, well-known mushroom-forming fungi that include some edible species. These <b>gilled</b> mushrooms are characterised by the brittle flesh of their fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|Despite vast {{differences}} in appearance and morphology, A.vulgare {{is related to}} such varied taxa as the <b>gilled</b> fungi of Lentinus, the poroid genus Albatrellus, the coral-like Clavicorona, and fellow tooth fungus Hericium. The relationship {{of all of these}} taxa—members of the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales—has been demonstrated through molecular phylogenetics.|$|E

5|$|Armillaria is a genus of fungi {{commonly}} known as honey mushrooms. First treated by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, and later assigned generic rank by Friedrich Staude in 1857, Armillaria is classified in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales, the <b>gilled</b> mushrooms. The majority of species in Armillaria are saprotrophic and live mainly on dead wood, but some are parasites that can cause root and butt rot in over 600 species of woody plants. Some Armillaria species form mycorrhizae with orchids; others, such as A.gallica, A.mellea, and A.tabescens, are bioluminescent.|$|E
5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis, {{commonly}} known as the Appalachian waxy cap, is a <b>gilled</b> fungus of the waxcap family. It is found in the eastern United States, where it fruits singly, in groups, or clusters on the ground in deciduous and mixed forests. The species, described in 1963 from collections made in the Appalachian Mountains, was originally classified in the related genus Hygrophorus. It was transferred to Hygrocybe in 1998, in which it has been proposed as the type species of section Pseudofirmae.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, a phylogenetic {{analyses}} using {{nuclear and}} mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences helped {{to clarify the}} phylogeny of Calostoma. Using the species C.cinnabarinum and C.ravenelli as representative examples, the research showed the genus evolutionarily related to the monophyletic Boletales clade, and separate from clades containing most of the <b>gilled</b> mushrooms, puffballs, stalked puffballs, earthstars, stinkhorns and non-bolete Gasteromycetes. Calostoma belongs to the suborder Sclerodermatineae in the Boletales order. The Boletales comprise the following genera: Boletinellus, Calostoma, Gyroporus, Phlebopus, Pisolithus, Scleroderma, and Veligaster. Calostoma {{is thought to have}} diverged evolutionarily from the other Boletales between 52–115 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|The agaricoid {{species in}} Lactarius, Lactifluus, Multifurca, and Russula are readily {{distinguished}} from other <b>gilled</b> mushrooms by {{the consistency of}} their flesh, which is granular, brittle and breaks easily, somewhat {{like a piece of}} chalk. Russulaceae never have a volva, but a partial veil can be found in some tropical species. Gills are adnate to decurrent, and the colour of the spore print ranges from white to ochre or orange (with the brown-spored Lactarius chromospermus as an exception).|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca {{has been}} {{confused}} with the true chanterelles (genus Cantharellus) because of overall similarities in appearance. However, the forked gills, frequently off-centre stipe placement, and dextrinoid spores of H.aurantiaca suggested a relationship with Paxillus, prompting Rolf Singer to classify the genus Hygrophoropsis in the family Paxillaceae in 1946. Several pigments have been identified from the fungus, including the orange variegatic acid, methyl variegate, the red variegatorubin, and several derivatives of pulvinic acid. The presence of these pigments suggests a chemotaxic relationship with the Boletaceae, Coniophoraceae, and Paxillaceae—families of Boletales with members that have similar compounds. Molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed its affinity lay in the order Boletales in 1997, though later research showed it is not closely related to Paxillus or other <b>gilled</b> members of the order.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum, {{commonly}} known as spotted tricholoma, tiger tricholoma, tigertop, leopard knight, or dirty trich, is a <b>gilled</b> mushroom widely distributed across North America and Europe, as well as parts of Asia. It is generally found in beech woodland in summer and autumn. Two subspecies have been described from southern Europe. First officially described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801, Tricholoma pardinum has had a confusing taxonomic history that extends over two centuries. In 1762, German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer described the species Agaricus tigrinus with an illustration corresponding to what {{is thought to be}} T.pardinum, and consequently, the name Tricholoma tigrinum has been used erroneously in some European field guides.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gill</b> slits are {{individual}} openings to <b>gills,</b> i.e., multiple <b>gill</b> arches, which lack {{a single}} outer cover. Such <b>gills</b> {{are characteristic of}} cartilaginous fish such as sharks, and rays, as well as primitive fish such as lampreys. In contrast, bony fishes have a single outer bony <b>gill</b> covering called an operculum.|$|R
5|$|Limnoperdon incarnatum was {{originally}} {{thought to be}} associated with the Gasteromycetes, an artificial assemblage of species united by the fact that their spores mature inside the fruit bodies and are not forcibly discharged from the basidia. Other morphologically similar genera include the Gasterella of the family Gasterellaceae, and the Protogaster of the family Protogastraceae; however, it was excluded from these genera because of significant differences in spore color and structure, presence of clamp connections, and structure of the basidia. For these reasons the new family Limnoperdaceae was described to contain the new species, and it was classified along the Protogastraceae in the (now defunct) order Protogastrales. More recently, molecular phylogenetics has been used to clarify the relationship Limnoperdon with other fungi. In 2001, David Hibbett and Manfred Binder established the membership of Limnoperdon incarnatum in the euagarics clade, a phylogenetically related group of species traditionally forming the order Agaricales. Additional molecular studies have placed Limnoperdaceae in the pluteoid clade of the Agaricales, a grouping that includes the families Pluteaceae, Amanitaceae, and Pleurotaceae; other studies that used comparisons of ribosomal DNA sequences placed Limnoperdon near the <b>gilled</b> genera Melanoleuca or Resupinatus, of the Tricholomataceae family.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin {{is present}} in varying {{concentrations}} in over 200 species of Basidiomycota mushrooms which evolved to produce the compound from muscarine some 20 million years ago. In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of hallucinogenic mushrooms, Gastón Guzmán and colleagues considered these to be distributed amongst the following genera: Psilocybe (116species), Gymnopilus (14), Panaeolus (13), Copelandia (12), Hypholoma (6), Pluteus (6), Inocybe (6), Conocybe (4), Panaeolina (4), Gerronema (2) and Agrocybe, Galerina and Mycena (1species each). Guzmán increased his estimate {{of the number of}} psilocybin-containing Psilocybe to 144 species in a 2005 review. The majority of these are found in Mexico (53 species), with the remainder distributed in the US and Canada (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and associated islands (19). In general, psilocybin-containing species are dark-spored, <b>gilled</b> mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods of the subtropics and tropics, usually in soils rich in humus and plant debris. Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents, but the majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests. Psilocybe species commonly found in the tropics include P.cubensis and P.subcubensis. P.semilanceata — considered by Guzmán to be the world's most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom — is found in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, but is entirely absent from Mexico. Although {{the presence or absence of}} psilocybin is not of much use as a chemotaxonomical marker at the familial level or higher, it is used to classify taxa of lower taxonomic groups.|$|E
