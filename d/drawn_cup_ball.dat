5000|$|A typical <b>cups</b> and <b>balls</b> routine {{includes}} {{many of the}} most fundamental effects of magic: the balls can vanish, appear, transpose, reappear and transform. Basic skills, such as misdirection, manual dexterity, sleight of hand, and audience management are also essential to most <b>cups</b> and <b>balls</b> routines. As a result, mastery of the <b>cups</b> and <b>balls</b> is considered by many as the litmus test of a good magician. Indeed the late magic authority John Mulholland wrote that no less a person than Harry Houdini had expressed the opinion that no one could be considered an accomplished magician until he had mastered the <b>Cups</b> and <b>Balls.</b> Professor Hoffman called the <b>cups</b> and <b>balls</b> [...] "the groundwork of all legerdemain".|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{new method}} for {{predicting}} {{the position of}} the galling generation in square <b>cup</b> <b>drawing</b> is proposed {{based on the fact that}} galling at a <b>drawn</b> <b>cup</b> occurs at the position subjected to the maximum temperature and at the moment that the position is just sliding out from the die. Three kinds of blank shape, square, octagon, and tricontadigon are used to change the galling position on the <b>drawn</b> <b>cup.</b> FEM simulation shows that galling on the <b>drawn</b> <b>cup</b> occurs at the top of the boundary between the drawn area and the bent area for the square blank and at the top of the middle of the drawn zone for the octagon or tricontadigon blank. Demonstration experiments using a high-tensile-strength steel sheet under a lubricated condition show that the galling on the <b>drawn</b> <b>cup</b> does occur as predicted by FEM simulation. Galling on the die surface is left at the path end of the galling position of the blank material. It is also found that the sliding distance after the galling position of the blank reaches the maximum temperature gives a great effect on the galling generation: the longer the sliding distance is, the easier the galling generation becomes...|$|R

However, the size {{effects in the}} micro hydro deep drawing become considerable and significantly influence shape accuracy of <b>drawn</b> <b>cups.</b> In this study, a Voronoi micro scale simulation model was developed to consider the size effects of SUS 304 foils. A surface layer model was additionally applied in the simulation to further explain the size effects. The micro hydro deep drawing experiments were conducted with annealed SUS 304 foils and the <b>drawn</b> <b>cups</b> were examined. The wrinkling phenomenon was generally aggravated with the hydraulic pressure. Simulation results also show that the high hydraulic pressure does not improve the shape accuracy of the <b>drawn</b> <b>cups</b> as that in the normal scale hydro deep dawning process does.

We fit a novel functional form to drag coefficient curves {{and in the}} absence of empirical data provide estimates of lift coefficient behaviour via a consideration of the physics of the boundary layer. Differences in both these coefficients for recent balls, which result from surface texture modification, can significantly alter trajectories. Numerical simulations are used to quantify the effect these changes have on the flight paths of various balls. Altitude and temperature variations at recent world cup events are also discussed. We conclude by quantifying the influence these variations have on the three most recent world <b>cup</b> <b>balls,</b> the Brazuca, the Jabulani and the Teamgeist.

40|$|Repeated {{unidirectional}} bending (RUB) {{process was}} carried out to improve the texture of AZ 31 alloy sheets. Compared to the as-received sheet with a strong basal texture, the RUB processed sheet with a weaker basal texture can be successfully drawn at a larger limiting drawing ratio (LDR) of 1. 7. For both the <b>drawn</b> <b>cups,</b> the c-axis of some grains tends to rotate toward the transverse direction (TD) of the sheet in the inner regions of the shoulders due to the occurrence of extension twinning and the basal texture dramatically changes to the c-axis//TD texture in {{the walls and the}} edges. Compared with the <b>drawn</b> <b>cup</b> of the as-received sheet, the <b>drawn</b> <b>cup</b> of the RUB processed sheet maintains a weaker texture intensity in the shoulder, which results in a larger Schmid factor of basal slip and thus contributes to the sheet thinning. Further, for the <b>drawn</b> <b>cup</b> of the RUB processed sheet, a finer grain microstructure resulting from the twin dynamic recrystallization (TDRX) is observed in the edge. The TDRX {{plays an important role in}} the softening during plastic deformation and consequently favours the further deformation. The changed Schmid factor of basal slip is caused by the rotation of the c-axis of grains and the texture evolution.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 768 on 15. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) Many researchers of children's drawings {{have concentrated on}} assessing how drawing develops through several stages. Around eight years of age the child progresses from producing drawings based on internal stereotypes of objects (intellectually realistic stage), to producing drawings which reflect an external view of these objects (visually realistic stage). This research has highlighted numerous variables which affect this developmental sequence and has shown that {{children as young as}} four can produce visually realistic drawings under certain circumstances. The present study firstly conducted a series of cross-sectional experiments to assess two of the variables highlighted by previous research, i. e. instructions and the order of presentation of tasks. Children between four and eight years of age were asked to <b>draw</b> various <b>cup</b> and <b>ball</b> models while these variables were manipulated. By employing the novel procedure of measuring the amount of attention that the children paid towards the drawing models, it was possible to gain insight into underlying cognitive mechanisms. The research showed that intellectual and visual realism can be artificially induced by procedural changes that affect the amount of strategic attention that the child employs in a drawing task. Increased attention is associated with visual realism while reduced attention is associated with intellectual realism. This thesis therefore concludes that there are no distinct stages of development, but instead these are a by-product of strategic attentional processes. In order to place drawing in a broader cognitive context, a longitudinal study was then conducted which assessed drawing in relation to memory and selective attention. The developmental patterns of performance, strategy use and metacognitive awareness in the drawing task, were similar to those in the memory and selective attention tasks. This suggested that children have underlying abilities common to these three different cognitive areas. It was concluded {{that there is a need}} to assess drawing within the context of general cognitive development...|$|R
