50|$|Working area: Working {{area is the}} plastically {{deforming}} {{area for}} drawing materials. Length and cone angle are the two factors for the working performance of this area. If the working area is too short, excessive pressure to the working area will be generated by the metal stretched. For the above reason, the tensile stress increased significantly, resulting in the accelerated wear of the mold. The principles for {{the selection of the}} length of the working area are as follows: a. The working area used for stretching soft metal wire is shorter than the working area used for stretching hard metal wire; b. The working area used for stretching metal wire with small diameter is shorter than the working area used for stretching metal wire with a large diameter; c.The working area worked under the condition of wet lubrication is shorter than the working area worked under the condition of <b>dry</b> <b>lubrication.</b> As for the taper angle, the taper angle is smaller when stretching steel, while the cone angle should be larger when stretching non-ferrous metals and its alloys.|$|E

40|$|Computer Numerical Control (CNC) {{machining}} {{is currently}} {{one of the}} most important machining processes for manufacturing in industry. This is because the CNC machine offers favorable accuracy and precise machining. However, the frictional behavior in linear guideways is {{one of the most}} crucial challenges with CNC machining, as higher friction produces motion and accuracy problems. Lubrication in CNC machine guideways is used to overcome such problems. Currently, a predefined lubrication system via CNC coding command is used to lubricate guideways in CNC machines. This lubrication process is performed based on fixed times and amounts of oil injection regardless of cutting force value, weight and size of the workpiece, friction force on the guideways, and machining process conditions. This leads to less protection of guideways against high friction force or excessive oil consumption to attain less friction force in the guideways. For these reasons, a new lubricant control technique is introduced based on the friction conditions in CNC machine linear guideways. Controlling the lubricant amount and time based on friction force values in linear guideways exhibits a major difference between the new proposed lubrication technique and existing systems. First, the friction force values in <b>dry</b> <b>lubrication</b> conditions in linear guideways and in the X and Z directions are calculated from the cutting force measured via force analysis in the guideways. Second, servomotor current is predicted using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) modeling, as the ANFIS system is ideal for predicting motor current in <b>dry</b> <b>lubrication</b> conditions due to the nonlinear condition in the machining process. Third, the friction forces predicted with ANFIS modeling are verified using a new testing scheme to identify the average predicted error and accuracy, which were found to be 1. 38...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe rising {{requirements}} in cutting operations for higher performance and higher efficiency respecting also environmental phenomena are influencing {{the use of}} different coolants and flushing conditions. In machining difficult-to-cut materials, in particular high-temperature materials, conventional emulsion cooling is unsuitable due to the insufficient cooling effect and the energy and cost intensive equipment required. For this reason new cooling and lubricating strategies have to be developed and investigated. Using hybrid processes, mainly by superposition of various cooling strategies, offers the potential to extend the existing technological process limits of conventional cutting processes. The paper introduces theoretical, experimental and simulation results with various innovative cooling strategies, such as high-pressure cooling, cryogenic cooling and aerosol <b>dry</b> <b>lubrication</b> in grooving, turning and drilling and derives the appropriate field of application for each flushing strategy...|$|E

For a graphene flake sliding on top of h-BN the anisotropy of the sliding energy corrugation with respect to the misfit angle between the two naturally mismatched lattices is found to reduce with the flake size. For sufficiently large flakes the sliding energy corrugation is expected to be at least an order of magnitude lower than that obtained for matching lattices regardless of the relative interlayer orientation thus resulting in a stable low-friction state. This is in contrast to the case of the homogeneous graphene interface where flake reorientations are known to eliminate superlubricty.
