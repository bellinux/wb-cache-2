5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states [...] "The mostly little-known {{material}} (five originals by the sidemen plus [...] "Here's That Rainy Day") suits <b>Baker</b> <b>fine.</b> The {{emphasis is on}} slower tempoes (other than Buster Williams' closing blues) including a pair of jazz waltzes. <b>Baker's</b> chops sound <b>fine</b> within the limited scope that he plays. The overall results are not essential but are worthwhile.".|$|R
