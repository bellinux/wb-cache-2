5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> unseaworthy.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E

Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> Robinson's last Olympics.|$|E

500|$|In 1988, Jeff Koons {{made the}} three {{identical}} porcelain sculptures Michael Jackson and Bubbles {{as part of}} his Banality exhibit. At the time, each sculpture was said to be worth $250,000. Koons once said of the pop star, [...] "If I could be one other living person, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> Michael Jackson." [...] The art piece became one of Koons' best known works. The figure shows Jackson and the chimpanzee wearing gold military-style suits. In 2001, one of the figures was put up for auction and was expected to fetch between $3 million and $4 million. The figure sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for $5.6 million. The sale was a record for a work by Koons. Two of the sculptures are housed at The Broad Contemporary Art Museum in downtown Los Angeles and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.|$|E

50|$|The British {{were more}} and more {{concerned}} {{about the fact that the}} Chetniks were more willing to fight Partisans than Axis troops. At the third Moscow Conference in October 1943, Anthony Eden expressed impatience about Mihailović's lack of action. The report of Fitzroy Maclean, liaison officer to the Partisans, convinced Churchill that Tito's forces were the most reliable resistance group. The report of Charles Armstrong, liaison officer to Mihailović, arrived too late for Anthony Eden to take it to the Tehran Conference in late November 1943, though Stevan K. Pavlowitch thinks that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> insufficient to change Churchill's mind. At Tehran, Churchill argued in favor of the Partisans, while Joseph Stalin expressed limited interest but agreed that they should receive the greatest possible support.|$|R

500|$|During {{his journey}} to Ireland, Lody met a Minneapolis doctor, John William Lee, {{who had been}} {{studying}} eye, ear, nose and throat diseases in Vienna before the outbreak of war had compelled him to leave. Lee was planning to travel back to New York aboard the RMS Baltic, leaving Queenstown (now Cobh) on 7 October, and intended {{to spend a few}} days exploring Ireland before his departure. Lody asked where Lee was planning to stay in Dublin; Lee told him that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> the Gresham Hotel on Sackville Street, to which Lody replied, [...] "All right, let's go there." [...] They travelled together to the hotel, booked into separate rooms, had dinner together and went to the Empire Theatre. Lody told Lee that he had been based in Germany working for an American adding-machine company. When the conversation turned to the war, Lody opined that the German army was a very well-trained body of strong-bodied and enduring men, {{and that it would be}} hard to beat them. The following day they had breakfast together and went for a walk in Phoenix Park.|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{interview}} with Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker, Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons {{said that he}} thought the time had passed to make a Watchmen movie. Gibbons felt that the window to make a Watchmen movie was during {{the success of the}} 1989 Batman film. When that time passed, Gibbons also told Neon magazine that he was [...] " [...] glad because it wouldn't have been up to the book". Gibbons felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> better adapted as a television series like The Prisoner. When given the opportunity, Gibbons enjoyed the script by Alex Tse. Gibbons gave Snyder some script advice, which the director accepted. He drew licensing art for the film, consulted on merchandise and the webcomics, publicized the film with Snyder, and wrote a tie-in book about the creation of the comic, entitled Watching the Watchmen. Moore did not mind Gibbons' involvement and felt it did not have any impact on their friendship. Snyder asked Gibbons to draw up a storyboard for the film's altered ending, which the comics' colorist John Higgins also returned to work on. Gibbons believed watching the film on DVD would emulate flipping through the book, with viewers pausing or rewinding the film to catch details.|$|E
500|$|One {{member of}} the company, Giovanni Gallini, had made his début at the theatre in 1753 and had risen to the {{position}} of dancing master, gaining an international reputation. Gallini had tried to buy Harris' share but had been rebuffed. He now purchased the mortgage. Sheridan quickly became bankrupt after placing the financial affairs of the theatre in the hands of William Taylor, a lawyer. The next few years saw a struggle for control of the theatre and Taylor bought Sheridan's interest in 1781. In 1782 the theatre was remodelled by Michael Novosielski, formerly a scene painter at the theatre. In May 1783, Taylor was arrested by his creditors, and a forced sale ensued, with Harris purchasing the lease and much of the effects. Further legal action transferred the interests in the theatre to a board of trustees, including Novosielski. The trustees acted with a flagrant disregard for the needs of the theatre or other creditors, seeking only to enrich themselves, and in August 1785 the Lord Chamberlain took over the running of the enterprise, {{in the interests of the}} creditors. Gallini, meanwhile, had become manager. In 1788, the Lord Chancellor observed [...] "that there appeared in all the proceedings respecting this business, a wish of distressing the property, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> consumed in that very court to which ... seemed to apply for relief". Performances suffered, with the box receipts taken by Novosielski, rather than given to Gallini to run the house. Money continued to be squandered on endless litigation or was misappropriated. Gallini tried to keep the theatre going, but he was forced to employ amateur performers. The World described a performance as follows: [...] "... the dance, if such it can be called was like the movements of heavy cavalry. It was hissed very abundantly." [...] At other times, Gallini had to defend himself against a dissatisfied audience who charged the stage and destroyed the fittings, as the company ran for their lives.|$|E
