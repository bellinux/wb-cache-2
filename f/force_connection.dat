5000|$|Tom Cavanagh {{primarily}} portrays Professor Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash on The Flash in {{the form}} of Dr. Harrison Wells, while Matt Letscher plays the character's original likeness. He is depicted as a scientist from the distant future who duplicated the reaction that gave Barry Allen/The Flash his powers and became the hero's archenemy, the Reverse-Flash. Eobard eventually traveled back in time to the year 2000 to kill his nemesis as a child. When the 2024 Flash intervened, the Reverse-Flash murdered Barry's mother and framed his father instead, thus erasing this Flash from existence while unintentionally severing his own connection to the Speed Force, leaving him stranded in the 21st Century. Knowing that Dr. Harrison Wells would be responsible for creating metahumans in 2020, Eobard killed the scientist and took his identity, subsequently spending the next thirteen years founding S.T.A.R. Labs and creating a particle accelerator to [...] "recreate" [...] Barry Allen as the Flash and regain his own link to the Speed Force. Faking paralysis, [...] "Dr. Wells" [...] constantly pushes Barry to run faster in hopes of using the latter's pure Speed <b>Force</b> <b>connection</b> to travel back to his time. After Eobard's secret is discovered, he is defeated by the combined efforts of the Flash, the Arrow and Firestorm. Eobard then offers Barry a chance to travel back in time to save his mother in exchange for a time sphere to return to the future once the Speed Force wormhole is open, but Barry ultimately chooses not to do so and returns to destroy Eobard's machine. As the Reverse-Flash prepares to kill the Flash, his ancestor Detective Eddie Thawne kills himself and seemingly erases Eobard from existence. A year later, Barry temporarily creates a new reality and restores a time remnant of Eobard to the timeline in the process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Rubber {{suspension}} {{system is a}} new {{suspension system}} in which rubber is {{used to be the}} elastic element, thus rubber spring {{is one of the key}} components of suspension. Based on its concrete structure, a finite element model of rubber spring is made and so as to analyze the rubber suspension forces under different working conditions, to analyze the strength and stiffness for providing a reference for the design. The introduction Suspension system is the floorboard of all <b>force</b> <b>connection</b> devices of car frame and axle or wheels, its function is to transfer the force and moment between the wheels and the frame, to amortize the impact caused by uneven road surface to the frame or the car and attenuate the vibration to make sure the car goes smoothly[1]. Rubber suspension becomes popular in recent years, which has the advantage of simple structure, easy installation, light weight, free maintenance, lubrication free, favorable possibility and comfort. It can greatly reduce the vibration caused by uneven road, reduce the driver’s fatigue, protect the vehicle parts and the integrity of the goods and extend the lifespan of the parts equipped on the vehicle[2].

30|$|First {{group of}} {{relations}} (i.e., Simulation and Parameter) describe time-invariant information of the simulation system. The System Properties table contains time-variant information {{of the entire}} system (instead of individual atoms). The Atom Static Info table holds the static features of an atom and forms a star-shaped schema {{with a series of}} other tables: Location, Velocity, <b>Force,</b> <b>Connection,</b> Torsion, Angle, and Molecules. The first three form {{the main body of the}} database - they represent atom states that change over time during the simulation. The reason why we cannot combine these three into one table is: MS programs usually do not output data at every step of the simulation, and different intervals (in steps) can be set to output location, velocity, and force. For the same reason, each of the three tables is linked to another table that maps the step number to the frame number. The next three tables hold information that describes atom to atom relationships. For example, a row in Connection represents a chemical bond between two atoms. Such relationships are time-variant therefore we again need to map their step numbers to frame numbers. The Molecules table is similar except it holds static relationship among the atoms. Specifically, each row in this table records the membership of one atom as a part of a molecule.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this Master?s Thesis has been to verify several aspects of the EMPIG flow assurance system through functional prototype physical testing. Summaries of key findings, with reference to focus area, methods and results, are included in this abstractMagnetic lock force 28 physical tests were performed with the intention to investigate the magnetic lock <b>force</b> <b>connection</b> between the magnetic sled and PIG using two PIG concepts. This resulted in an axial magnetic lock force of 1719 N for the passive PIG, and 2655 N for the active PIG concept. The results of the analysis study performed in the Project Thesis, written the autumn of 2012 [1], showed that the passive- and active PIG potentially produce a lock force of 1801 N and 3938 N respectively. The result of the analysis study and the physical tests {{were found to be}} especially similar for the passive PIG concept. Wax layer removal 32 physical tests were performed with the intention to investigate the cleaning efficiency and scraper resistance of the seven tested scraper designs. A 1 mm paraffin-wax-based deposition layer was added to all test pipes. The scraper resistance results were found to be in the range of 90 N ? 1200 N with equally large variations in cleaning efficiency. Compared to the magnitude of the magnetic lock forces, the scraper resistance was not considered to be an issue. Full system testingA flow loop was designed and built in order to directly investigate if a 1 mm wax deposition layer could be removed using only the magnetic connection between the magnetic sled and PIG. The test was successful. Based on the results of this thesis, the EMPIG system was found to be feasible for both the passive- and the active PIG concept. </p...|$|E
40|$|Traditional seismic design {{philosophy}} for {{reinforced concrete}} seismic frame structures localises damage and inelastic deformation to regions of significant plasticity within the beam (plastic hinge zones) during a severe earthquake event. Collapse prevention {{of the frame}} is applied through capacity design methods, requiring the maximum expected flexural strength of the beam plastic hinges to be reliably assessed in order to design for, and ensure, the predominantly elastic flexural response of the columns in the frame. Previous experimental and numerical investigations have shown that significant and detrimental damage to the frame and floor system occurs due to the formation and elongation of ductile beam plastic hinges; requiring extensive post-earthquake repair or demolition with likely loss of function of the building. This poses significant economic consequences to occupiers of the building, as {{the time required to}} reinstate the integrity of the structural and non-structural building components is often lengthy. More importantly, it has been highlighted that the interaction between elongating ductile plastic hinges and the accompanying floor system enhances the flexural strength of the beam hinges, altering the distribution of forces in the seismic frame compared to that assumed during capacity design. Research has shown that the consideration of frame-floor interaction in current New Zealand design codes significantly underestimates the flexural strength enhancement of beam plastic hinges, threatening the hierarchy of strength and collapse prevention mechanisms employed in capacity design. Recent research has introduced change in the design philosophy of precast concrete seismic frames. Rather than designing for localised damage in the frame, unique Non-tearing (of the floor) connection details have been developed which provide a gap or slot between the end of the beam and column face and <b>force</b> <b>connection</b> rotation to occur about a shallow hinge located {{at the top of the}} beam, thereby avoiding the formation of plastic hinges and associated beam elongation effects altogether. Research investigations have shown that Non-tearing connections successfully minimise damage to the structural frame and floor, while providing seismic energy dissipation characteristics at least comparable to that of traditional reinforced concrete connections. In this research, the mechanics of different non-tearing connection arrangements were investigated and original theory introduced for the aspects of connection behaviour which diverged from fundamental reinforced concrete design. A variety of precast concrete non-tearing connection details were developed, with the design focus placed on economic and construction efficiency in order to encourage the rapid implementation of non-tearing connection technology into New Zealand construction industry. The performance of the developed connection details were explored and assessed experimentally and analytically. A two bay precast concrete frame with precast floor system was tested under a demanding reversed cyclic, quasi-static loading protocol using displacement control. The seismic response of the non-tearing connection details employed in the test frame successfully minimised damage to the frame and floor systems. Only minor repair of one primary crack at each connection between the floor diaphragm and supporting beam would be required after a design level earthquake. Issues encountered with buckling of the longitudinal reinforcement in the bottom of the beam reduced the connection performance at high levels of drift. However, detailing measures were successfully employed in successive tests which improved the drift capacity of the connections. Detailing improvements to enhance the seismic response of the developed non-tearing connections were recommended based observations from the frame test. Numerical analysis of the non-tearing connection details was performed using simple rotational and compound spring models, with the key features of the experimental response captured with excellent accuracy. The analytical models were constructed using engineering theory, rather than by calibration with experimental observations. The modelling assumptions and principles adopted in the analysis have been presented for use in design offices or future research programmes when designing and analysing seismic frames using non-tearing connections. This research successfully contributed to the development and progression of non-tearing frame technology. With further research and the refinement of construction details, non-tearing floor connections exhibit impressive potential for providing superior seismic safety, performance and efficiency in precast concrete seismic frame buildings...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The way of {{assignment}} of exact numerical truth value to any vague predicate sentence {{remains to be}} problematic.   Methodology. I would like to propose one of the possible ways of estimation for vague sentences: to exploit the supevaluationists' idea of precisification for the interpretation of verity. We can think of the verity of a borderline sentence (the degree {{to which it is}} close to definite truth) as the proportion of permissible precisifications on which it is true. Scientific novelty. The proposed construal of degrees, interpreting verities {{on the basis of a}} measure over admissible precisifications, allows discrimination among borderline cases that would otherwise (on the standard supervaluationist account) all inhabit the same truth-value gap. My view of vague expressions assumes also that a borderline sentence may affect verity of another borderline sentence.   The notion of relative verity reflects an intuitive assumption about possible semantic connections between applications of vague predicates. So-called <b>forcing</b> <b>connection</b> is a non-symmetric, transitive relation, which does not express any temporal or causal dependence between borderline cases; rather, it expresses a logical or semantic relation. I consider different kinds of <b>forcing</b> <b>connection</b> between vague expressions. Conclusion. Using of the notions “relative verity” and “forcing” provides preservation for borderline sentences of certain logical connections, which are postulated by classical logic...|$|R
