5|$|When Dixit {{realizes that}} the {{artifact}} in the museum he is guarding happens to be imperfect, he rushes to the other museum, where a disguised Mr. A steals a rare diamond and escapes. In a television channel, Mr. A challenges the police that he will steal an ancient warrior sword. In response, Dixit, Bose, and Khan enforce a strict guard {{at the location of}} the sword. At night, Mr. A meets a doppelgänger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> holds the sword. The police are alerted, but they manage to steal the sword and escape. The impersonator turns out to be Sunehri (Aishwarya Rai), a woman who idolises Mr. A; Sunehri convinces Mr. A to form an alliance.|$|E
25|$|This is {{what the}} Chinese room thought {{experiment}} is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, {{there is no one}} or nothing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.|$|E
500|$|General Nguyen Van Chuan {{was invited}} to the coup {{headquarters}} by Khiêm after the takeover was complete. He recalled that there were 15–20 Vietnamese officers present along with Khánh and Khiêm, and that many had been placed on leave without pay or removed after Diệm's overthrow. Chuan said that Khánh chaired a meeting, and claimed that Minh's government was [...] "neutralist, pro-Communist and pro-French", and incompetent. He said that the plotters [...] "didn't know what to call the coup d'état {{to make it sound}} all right; it was only a while later that they thought of the term 'rectification'". Wilson was present at the meeting and telephoned Harkins [...] "every five minutes", and Khánh left the meeting early and left Khiêm in charge, saying that he had to meet Harkins. During the meeting, Thieu and Mậu turned up by 08:40 and the atmosphere of the meeting was likened to a triumphant election campaign function on vote-counting night. Before leaving and telling the others he was meeting Harkins, Khánh had announced to the officers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> he would be heavily dependent on US advice and support.|$|E

500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
2500|$|These replies {{provide an}} {{explanation}} of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something besides the man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> can understand Chinese, Searle can't argue that (1) the man doesn't understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle's argument fails to prove that [...] "strong AI" [...] is false.|$|E

[...] A friend afterwards remarked that he had grossly offended a large company, and wondered why none had appeared to resent the affront. [...] "Oh!"

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{sessions}} the band explored new and alternative arrangements to a number of their songs, both old and new, with some involving full band arrangements and others solely focusing on frontman Jesse Lacey. The band had not entered the studio with the intention to record alternate versions, but after setting up in the fairly confined studio, [...] "there wasn’t really a feeling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> you wanted to play loudly," [...] Accardi commented in an interview. Kevin Devine joined the band {{on the second day of}} recording for an alternate rendition of [...] "Jesus", which Devine had previously covered at his solo shows and with Lacey. The recording would later be included as a b-side to the [...] "At the Bottom" [...] single, released on August 11, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The live {{portion of}} the album was {{recorded}} in the Persian Room of New York's Plaza Hotel at a September jazz party given by Columbia Records to celebrate [...] "the healthy state of jazz" [...] at the label. Later issued in full as Jazz at the Plaza in 1973, the live set featured three staples of Davis' and Coltrane's concert repertoire during their collaborating years. The sextet opened up with the standard [...] "Straight, No Chaser", composed by Thelonious Monk. The musicians took the number at a brisk tempo, and though Jimmy Cobb lacked former drummer Philly Joe's technocratic flair, he and Paul Chambers remained consistent, as the horns carried into whirling solos. Evans used Adderley's solo and the song's tempo to improvise, as he scattered Bud Powell-like clusters. Journalist Lindsey Planer later called the performance [...] "slippery and triple-jointed", {{and went on to}} state [...] "The band plays as if Monk might have been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> night. This is Davis at his most muted magnificence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Garter Room {{now known}} as [...] "The Servery", which served as the State Bedroom is {{to the west of}} The Small Tapestry Dining Room. Designed by Borra in 1755 and {{completed}} over the next five years. None of the original decoration survived the reconstruction of the west pavilion in 1935. There is a reconstruction of the original plaster ceiling with its Garter insignia in the centre. The most important painting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>that</b> used to hang on the east wall, was Joshua Reynolds's Marquess of Granby, now {{in the collection of the}} National Army Museum, Earl Temple's nephew Richard Grenville was the Marquess's Aide-de-camp during the Seven Years' War. The magnificent state bed which was set up in the room in 1759-60 and was nearly [...] in height, survives in the Lady Lever Art Gallery. It used to be in the recess on the west wall. The bed was moved to the Rembrandt Room for Queen Victoria's visit. The two elaborately carved and gilt robe chests, one of gophir the other of sandalwood that used to stand on the north wall flanking the white marble fireplace are now in the Wallace Collection. The room takes up the space behind the two western tripartite windows of the South Front, the corners of the room prior to 1935 contained separate closets. The south-western closet was called the Japan Closet and was decorated in a Japanese style, this used to contain the Chandos Jewels finally sold for nearly £10,000 by Lady Kinloss in 1929, also the room used to have a staircase to the dressing room on the floor above. The south-eastern closet was called the Shakespeare Closet because it contained the Chandos portrait of William Shakespeare now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, also from this room and now in the National Gallery, London, are two paintings, a portrait of Martin Luther which used to be ascribed to Hans Holbein the Younger and Francesco Raibolini's portrait of Bartolomeo Bianchini. The north-east closet was a water-closet. In the niches in the walls that flank the recess between the two southern closets used to be displayed a collection 120 pieces of Maiolica. One of the finest pieces a dish painted with St. Thomas touching Christ's wound from Deruta is now in the Courtauld Institute of Art.|$|E

5000|$|The {{arrangement}} of objects represents {{a compromise between}} the need to display the museum objects {{and the need to}} represent a typical home of the time, where bread was baked and cloth was woven. The lighting deliberately creates a theatrical atmosphere, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>that</b> present [...] "realism". Other exhibits, such as [...] "From Earth to Wine" [...] and [...] "From Earth to Bread" [...] are lit more neutrally, giving more of an outdoors effect.|$|R
