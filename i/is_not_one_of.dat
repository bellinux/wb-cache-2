5|$|Quinine wouldn't be {{successfully}} synthesized until 1918. Synthesis remains elaborate, expensive and low yield, {{with the additional}} problem of separation of the stereoisomers. Though quinine <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the major drugs used in treatment, modern production still relies on extraction from the cinchona tree.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor {{one in which the}} mind is eager to range: there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{the history}} of civilization <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> harmony.|$|E

500|$|CL – A college lecturer: Joliffe taught {{students}} at Jesus College, but he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Fellows ...|$|R

50|$|Although {{small in}} size, Mohanpur <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the small states that were merged with Baroda State under the Attachment Scheme in December 1943.|$|R
25|$|N has {{at least}} 101 prime factors and at least 10 {{distinct}} prime factors. If 3 <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the factors of N, then N {{has at least}} 12 distinct prime factors.|$|E
25|$|Hitotsubashi University is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most prestigious universities in Japan, consistently ranking amongst the top universities in Japanese university rankings. It is one of the highest ranked national universities that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the National Seven Universities.|$|E
25|$|The Prize in Economics <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} Nobel Prizes created by Alfred Nobel's will. However, the nomination process, selection criteria, and awards {{presentation of the}} Prize in Economic Sciences are performed {{in a manner similar}} to that of the Nobel Prizes.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to rumor, Nungesser <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the stunt pilots {{killed during}} the filming of Hell's Angels (1930), the epic {{aviation}} movie by Howard Hughes.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the release}} of the Fair Work Australia report, the Australian Federal Police {{commenced}} investigations. Thomson claimed he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the five people of interest.|$|R
25|$|The {{problem of}} {{politics}} over economics. The making {{and implementation of}} policy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> discovery, but rather of top down implementation. Rigid state control will limit how a society can respond to tensions and crisis, and thus politics creates its own presuppositions and limits creativity and alternative solutions.|$|E
25|$|Some {{businesses}} {{maximize their}} profit margins through vertical integration; book publishing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. Although {{newspaper and magazine}} companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a distributor who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells on a sale or return basis.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{cases have}} focused {{attention}} {{on the fact that}} the view of the informed observer has sometimes become dangerously close to becoming the court's view. In dealing with this, the court must adopt the public's view of the facts, not its own view. This distinction <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> semantics, but bears great significance as it signifies the acceptance of public perception in the judicial process.|$|E
50|$|Although Athens <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{earliest}} Greek democracies, {{it is often}} regarded as the birthplace of democracy and remains a really important reference point of democracy.|$|R
50|$|George Novack <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the 18 SWP leaders {{imprisoned in}} World War II under the Smith Act, but {{he played a}} major role in the defense campaign.|$|R
25|$|Spain had a {{relatively}} isolated economy, with high protective tariffs and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the main countries {{affected by the}} Depression. The banking system held up well, as did agriculture.|$|R
25|$|The prize was {{established}} in 1968 by a donation from Sweden's central bank, the Swedish National Bank, on the bank's 300th anniversary. Although it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the prizes that Alfred Nobel established in his will in 1895, it is referred to {{along with the other}} Nobel Prizes by the Nobel Foundation. Laureates are announced with the other Nobel Prize laureates, and receive the award at the same ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Steven Nadler {{suggests}} that settling {{the question of}} Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> reverence or religious awe, but instead one of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open {{to the possibility of}} error and superstition.|$|E
25|$|Someone {{has played}} a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in {{question}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about 1979–80, challenging each other to an escape contest. There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be easy enough to check out.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, {{with the}} {{takeover}} of EMI, the studio became the property of Universal Music. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the entities that were sold to Warner Music as part of Parlophone.|$|R

50|$|Despite, {{or perhaps}} because of, the {{emergence}} of local chieftains and warbands, {{there are signs that}} the 5th and 6th centuries <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> economic strain in Cumbria (not more than usual, at least).|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the persons mentioned above, under section 9(1) of the MRHA the Minister may also make an order against any other persons where the Minister is satisfied that (a) the person is inciting, instigating or encouraging any religious group or religious institution or any person mentioned in section 8(1) to commit any of the acts specified in that subsection; or that (b) the person, who <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the persons mentioned in section 8(1), has caused or is attempting to cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different religious groups.|$|E
25|$|North of {{the railway}} line, which crosses Astana in an east-west direction, are {{industrial}} and poorer residential areas. Between the railway {{line and the}} Ishim river is the city centre, where at present intense building activity is occurring. To the west and east are more elevated residential areas with parks and the new area of government administration {{to the south of}} the Ishim River. Here many large building projects are under way; for example, the construction of a diplomatic quarter, and a variety of different government buildings. By 2030, these quarters are to be completed. Astana's current chief planner, Vladimir Laptev, wants to build a Berlin in a Eurasian style. He has stated that a purely administrative capital such as Canberra <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his goals.|$|E
25|$|Immunization {{against the}} {{pathogens}} that cause diarrheal {{disease is a}} viable prevention strategy, however it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination. In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2-3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6-10%. Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease. Since this time, more effective vaccines have been developed that {{have the potential to}} save many thousands of lives in developing nations, while reducing the overall cost of treatment, and the costs to society.|$|E
2500|$|In 1865, {{biologist}} Thomas Huxley {{presented the}} views <b>of</b> polygenesists (Huxley <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them) as [...] "some imagine their assumed species of mankind were created {{where we find}} them... the Mongolians from the Orangs".|$|R
50|$|Hesketh {{lost his}} seat in the House of Lords in 1999, when the House of Lords Act 1999 removed all but 92 {{hereditary}} peers. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the 92 who were elected to keep their seats.|$|R
50|$|Although Serjeant <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the initial}} players offered a {{contract}} to play World Series Cricket, his success in England saw an attempt to recruit him. Serjeant turned down the offer as {{he wanted to play}} establishment cricket.|$|R
