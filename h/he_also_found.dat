5|$|Using {{this method}} of compounding, Dietrich found that {{approximately}} 120 'basic' characters {{can be used for}} over 1,500 combinations. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> {{that the vast majority of}} the corpus consists of compounds.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Ketèlbey {{worked for a}} series of music publishers, {{including}} Chappell & Co and the Columbia Graphophone Company, making arrangements for smaller orchestras, a period in which he learned to write fluent and popular music. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> great success writing music for silent films until the advent of talking films in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|He {{stays in}} Sarawak, and finds the Simunjon coal-works convenient, as {{the workers are}} happy to be paid a little for insects they find, {{including}} locusts, stick insects and about 24 new species of beetles each day. In all he collects 2000 species of beetle in Borneo, nearly all at the coal mine site; <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> a flying frog and orang-utans in the same place.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>founded</b> 2 other schools.|$|R

5|$|In addition, Euler {{elaborated}} {{the theory}} of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern complex analysis. He also invented the calculus of variations including its best-known result, the Euler–Lagrange equation.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in terms}} of fan base, the two fan bases are close in a way. Although the general public has held a {{stereotype}} of heavy metal fans being suicidal, depressed and a danger to themselves and society in general. However, Adrian North, a Heriot-Watt University professor who studies genre listeners found that metal listeners were above all else creative, at ease with themselves and introverted — qualities <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> in classical listeners.|$|E
5|$|Green {{also took}} photos of a {{prepared}} list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E

5|$|However he {{struggled}} with poor form during the 1950–51 season as his first marriage {{was coming to an}} end and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> that the well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer.|$|E
5|$|Later in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, {{including}} the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea {{was influenced by the}} Star Wars franchise, but added depth to the gameplay by giving the player more options. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous and {{successful}} apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg, who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced {{to stay on the}} island of Dejima outside Nagasaki, so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus' death.|$|E

5|$|Striker Arthur Chandler is {{currently}} the club's all-time record goal scorer, netting 273 in his 12 years at the club; <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> the net in 8 consecutive matches in the 1924–25 season. The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 44 by Arthur Rowley, in the 1956–57 season. The fastest goal in the club's history was scored by Matty Fryatt, when he netted after just nine seconds against Preston North End in April 2006.|$|E
5|$|Van der Aue {{worked on}} {{procedures}} for surface decompression and oxygen {{use in the}} early 1950s and during his research found problems with the 1937 tables for long dive times. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> that the fast tissues which had been dropped in the 1930s would control decompression in some cases, so he re-introduced the fast compartments to the model, and added an extra slower compartment to better model long-duration dives.|$|E
5|$|Asch {{found that}} some 1/4 of all {{subjects}} successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1//20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch {{also found that the}} effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.|$|E

5|$|Clayman (IGN) {{reported}} that the game had no major technical issues, which was a major concern in the protracted run-up to the game's release. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> that most of its levels {{did not appear to}} leverage the Xbox 360's advances in areas apart from graphics. Bramwell (Eurogamer), on the other hand, fought the controls and camera throughout the game. He lamented a particular issue in which the camera would spin 180 degrees when Kameo was hit, which made the path of retreat harder to see. Theobald (GameSpy) also lamented the camera. Kasavin (GameSpot) found Kameo to be technically outstanding, and praised its automatic game save features, short loading times, steady frame rates, and detailed display on both standard- and high-definition televisions. Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that Kameo was technically impressive to the point of overwhelming the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of {{commercial}} success {{when it was first}} released, the C5 gained an unexpected degree of cult status in the later years. Collectors began purchasing them as investment items, reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price. One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax. According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as £2,500 – more than six times the original retail price. By 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to be worth more than £5,000 to collectors.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E

5|$|Milne managed {{three goals}} in 22 league {{appearances}} in 1988–89. The {{first was a}} 20-yard volley on 3 December 1988 in a 3–0 home win over former club Charlton Athletic, which ended United's nine-match winless run (eight draws and a defeat) in the First Division. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> the net on Boxing Day in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford. The week after Milne played what he felt was his best game in a Manchester United jersey in a 3–1 New Year's victory over rivals Liverpool. However {{they were unable to}} maintain their form and finished 11th in the league after winning only three of their last 14 league games. Milne scored his third and final United goal on 25 March 1989 in a 2–0 home win over Luton Town, once again in the league.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding {{his other}} actions, Peckham's {{relations}} with the king were generally good, and Edward sent him on a diplomatic mission to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in Wales. In 1282 he attempted to mediate between the Welsh and King Edward, but given that Edward would not budge on the main issues, it was a hopeless mission. In the end, Peckham excommunicated some of the Welsh who were resisting Edward, not unsurprising given Peckham's views of the Welsh. Peckham visited the Welsh dioceses {{as part of his}} tour of all his subordinate dioceses. While there, Peckham criticised the Welsh clergy for their unchaste lives, conspicuous consumption, and heavy drinking. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> the Welsh clergy to be uneducated, although he did order a Welsh-speaking suffragan bishop to be appointed to help with pastoral duties in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. Peckham also criticised the Welsh people as a whole, contrasting their pastoral economy with the farming-based economy of England, and finding the Welsh to be lazy and idle.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, 1978, Paramount {{assembled}} the largest press conference {{held at the}} studio since Cecil B. DeMille announced he was making The Ten Commandments. Eisner announced that Academy-Award winning director Robert Wise would direct a film adaptation of the television series, titled Star Trek—The Motion Picture. Wise had only seen a few Star Trek episodes, so Paramount gave him about a dozen to watch. The budget was projected at $15million. Dennis Clark (Comes a Horseman) was invited to rewrite the script and to include Spock, but he disliked Roddenberry, who demanded sole credit. Livingston returned as writer, and although <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> Roddenberry unreasonable, Wise and Katzenberg convinced him to continue rewriting the script throughout production.|$|E
