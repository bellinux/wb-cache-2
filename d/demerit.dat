5|$|Students earn <b>demerit</b> {{points for}} poor behaviour. Accumulated <b>demerit</b> points can affect final grades and {{eligibility}} for certain awards, scholarships and overseas trips. The student handbook states that, for serious offences, male students at Hwa Chong Institution may be punished with detention, suspension, caning or expulsion. Only the Principal or Discipline Master may administer corporal punishment, {{which consists of}} a maximum of five strokes of the cane. Students found smoking are immediately caned or suspended or both. Caning may also be given for integrity-related offences (e.g. cheating), uncivilized behaviour (e.g. defiance), and criminal offences (e.g. fighting).|$|E
5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is <b>demerit</b> (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken <b>demerit.</b> Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E
5|$|Under Boothroyd's successor, Brendan Rodgers, Watford {{finished}} 13th. Rodgers left {{to manage}} Reading {{at the end}} of the season; Malky Mackay, who had previously served as caretaker manager, was his replacement. Amid the departures of several key players during Mackay's tenure, including Tommy Smith and Jay <b>DeMerit,</b> and the club coming close to administration, Watford finished 16th in 2009–10 and 14th the following season. Mackay left to manage Cardiff City in June 2011 and was replaced by Sean Dyche. Despite presiding over Watford's highest league position in four years, Dyche was dismissed as Watford manager in July 2012. He was replaced by former Italy international Gianfranco Zola following the Pozzo family's purchase of the club.|$|E

50|$|The Paul VI {{school day}} starts at 8:05 AM, and ends at 2:30 PM. Students are {{required}} to wear the designated school uniforms for {{the entirety of the}} day, except during casual days. Separate gym uniforms are required for Physical Education. Discipline is organized into a system of <b>demerits,</b> whereby <b>demerits</b> are given out to students who break the school code of conduct as published annually in the student handbook. The number of <b>demerits</b> given depends on the severity of the infraction. Ten <b>demerits</b> result in a student receiving a detention. As Paul VI is a Catholic high school, students are expected to act according to Catholic teaching.|$|R
5|$|Under HCI's Integrated Programme, the Sabbatical Programme {{is offered}} whereby {{students}} from Secondary 1 to 4 go on one week sabbatical courses in each {{term in the}} first semester (Terms 1 and 2). The programme is unique in allowing {{the majority of the}} school populace to put aside formal curricular lessons for a week in pursuit of their passions or interests. Sabbaticals offered are of a wide variety, in categories as defined by the school: Arts & Aesthetics, Chinese Studies, Humanities, English & Literature, Leadership, Technology, Science and Math, Camps and Student Exchange; they are essentially courses for students to opt for, such as beginner guitar and songwriting lessons, professional music production, Model United Nations training camps, football friendlies with other schools, et cetera. Also, the school requires students to use the specifically designed Online Bidding System - the i-ComP - to organise their sabbatical plans. Students who accumulate <b>demerit</b> points as a result of various offences are penalised in their sabbatical bidding or are recommended for corrective work order.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have often}} {{connected}} {{the notion of}} karma to the determinism in the caste system in India. Just like {{in the case of}} karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate. Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, {{as in the case of}} someone ordaining as a monk for a few years. And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out. Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and <b>demerit.</b> In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to improve the situation through merit-making. Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the earned value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.|$|E
5|$|The Braves scored {{their fifth}} {{run in the}} eighth as Del Crandall hit a one-out triple and then scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Mantilla. Don Demeter pinch hit for Churn, the pitcher, in {{the bottom half of}} the inning but the Dodgers were put out in order. Sandy Koufax pitched the top of the ninth for the Dodgers and though he loaded the bases with three successive walks to Aaron, Torre, and <b>DeMerit</b> he did not allow any runs. Moon and Snider led off the bottom of the frame with successive singles. Bob Lillis pinch ran for Snider and Gil Hodges hit another single to load the bases. Don McMahon relieved Burdette, but allowed a fourth consecutive single to Norm Larker which scored Moon, Lillis, and advanced Hodges to third leaving the score 5–4. Warren Spahn relieved McMahon, Carl Furillo pinch hit for Roseboro, and Joe Pignatano pinch ran for Larker. Furillo tied the game, hitting a sacrifice fly which scored Hodges. Spahn allowed a single to Wills and was pulled in favor of Joey Jay. Ron Fairly grounded out as a pinch hitter and Gilliam flew out, leaving the game tied at five runs apiece and forcing extra innings.|$|E
40|$|Using an Internet-based {{industry}} survey, {{the differences}} and similarities of offset and digital print <b>demerits</b> within the print industry are examined. Running parallel to this examination {{is a look}} at the extent to which demerit-based quality assurance procedures exist within the printing industry. The survey findings indicate that offset and digital printing processes share common color-related print <b>demerits.</b> What differentiates offset print <b>demerits</b> from digital print <b>demerits</b> can be attributed to two factors: (1) technology differences and (2) printing standards. Offset printing, given the multitude of material choices, produces more frequent print <b>demerits,</b> relating to non-conforming materials. Digital print <b>demerits</b> more likely result from technical constraints such as addressability and resolution. The other factor associated is a lack of printing standards for digital printers. While both processes show a high frequency of color-related problems, offset print providers have more tools and standards available for addressing these problems. Digital print providers, on the other hand, have few color standards or tools for solving similar problems. When examining procedures for defect prevention, the general lack of digital printing standards makes the use of formal quality assurance procedures difficult. Offset print providers {{are more likely to have}} formal quality assurance procedures for dealing with frequent and severe print <b>demerits</b> and formal procedures for how customer quality requirements are communicated...|$|R

25|$|Reichenbach {{suggests}} that the theories of karma are an ethical theory. This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, <b>demerit</b> and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or <b>demerit</b> or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent. In ethics, one's intentions, attitudes and desires matter {{in the evaluation of}} one's action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless. A karma theory considers not only the action, but also actor's intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory.|$|E

25|$|The Karma {{theory of}} Buddhism is {{integrated}} into its Twelve Nidanas doctrine, {{and has been}} extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna. Karma consists of any intentional action, whether of body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (<b>demerit).</b> Both good and bad karma sustain the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and associated dukkha, and both prevent the attainment of nirvana.|$|E
