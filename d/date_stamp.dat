5|$|Suillus spraguei has had {{a complex}} taxonomic history. Although the first {{specimen}} was originally collected in New England in 1856 by Charles James Sprague, a formal scientific description was not published until 1872 when Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis called it Boletus spraguei. In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named the species Boletus pictus. Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they {{believed to be a}} new species—Boletus murraii—although this was later considered by Rolf Singer to be merely a younger version of their Boletus spraguei. Although Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, the <b>date</b> <b>stamp</b> on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural priority under the rules of fungal naming. However, in 1945 Singer reported that the name Boletus pictus was illegitimate because it was a homonym, already being used for a polypore mushroom described by Carl Friedrich Schultz in 1806. The name was officially switched to Suillus spraguei in 1986 (Otto Kuntze had previously transferred the taxon to Suillus in 1898).|$|E

25|$|Beyond {{the names}} {{of two of the}} actors involved, there is very little in this print to {{identify}} the play it documents.

25|$|The print's {{attribution}} is {{a subject}} of some contention. Copies of the print belong to at least 2 public collections: that of the ROM, and that of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. According to its labeling, these institutions disagree on when and by whom it was produced. The problem lies mainly {{in the fact that}} the print has no <b>date</b> <b>stamp</b> and is signed Sadamasu ga , a name used by two nineteenth century Osaka print-makers: Sadamasu I and Sadamasu II.|$|E

The postage stamps of India and Hong Kong were used on some mail, but they were probably carried there by individuals, instead of being on sale in Labuan. Mail was routed through Singapore. From 1867, Labuan officially used the postage stamps of the Straits Settlements but began issuing its own in May 1879.|$|E

500|$|Other {{issues of}} {{contention}} include {{the lack of}} historical context; the film does not cover some of the {{events leading up to}} Chávez's ousting, including the long-running political crisis and the general strike. Gunson also criticizes the filmmakers for showing events out of order. In June 2002, they filmed an opposition community group as its members considered [...] "how to defend themselves against possible... attacks" [...] from Chávez's supporters. In the film, this sequence is placed before the march. Bartley justified the action, saying that the residents' opinions were representative of those held [...] "long before" [...] the events of April 2002. Responding to the critique, the BBC added a <b>date</b> <b>stamp</b> to the sequence for the film's repeat broadcast. Gunson also cites footage of Caracas mayor Freddy Bernal as he sings to a happy group of Chávez supporters in front of the palace. Later images of a [...] "differently dressed Bernal" [...] reveal that the footage was from another day. Similarly, Gunson says that until shot at, [...] "The opposition march was entirely peaceful." [...] The film presents footage of its [...] "violent finale"—including an image from another day—as if it occurred during the protest's approach to the palace, accompanied by the narrated claim that [...] "some in the vanguard looked ready for a fight". Bartley and ÓBriain admit that they included a [...] "limited" [...] amount of archive footage, but say it was a [...] "legitimate reconstruction" [...] to build context [...] "before the core narrative of the coup [...] off" [...] as they [...] "could not be everywhere filming at all times".|$|E

2500|$|In 1861, James Roe {{was convicted}} in the Old Bailey of forging a money order.

After the uncle's death, Roe had produced a money order for £6000 apparently made out to him from the uncle. [...] The cousin challenged the authenticity of the order, and Roe was charged with forgery. The prosecution's case mainly hinged upon evidence suggesting that the <b>date</b> <b>stamp</b> on the envelope in which the money order was claimed to have been sent had been faked.
