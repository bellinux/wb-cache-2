5|$|Much of the {{questioning}} of Oppenheimer concerned {{his role in}} the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> review panel.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned that nothing had been heard from Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had long since been exhausted and that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere. It was also evident that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authorities the relief of Shackleton's party should have priority over the men marooned at Cape Evans.|$|E

5|$|Motives for {{collection}} of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter {{as having a}} social and cultural context. The {{collection of}} Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated {{by the need to}} display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam. In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and objet's d'art from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.|$|E
5|$|Not long after, {{the legend}} continues, {{a group of}} Sakalava (or, by some accounts, Vazimba) warriors were {{preparing}} to attack a village north of Alasora called Ambohipeno. Ralambo {{announced that it would}} be sufficient to throw a rotten egg at the warriors, and Kelimalaza would take care of the rest. According to oral history, the egg was thrown and hit a warrior in the head, killing him on contact; his corpse fell onto another warrior and killed him, and this corpse fell onto another and so forth, until the warriors had all been destroyed, forevermore confirming the power of Kelimalaza as the protector of the kingdom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Merina populace. Similarly, at the besieged Imerina village of Ambohimanambola, invoking Kelimalaza was said to have produced a massive hailstorm that wiped out the enemy warriors.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
40|$|Let {{me begin}} by {{postulating}} {{that the high}} status now enjoyed by science is precarious. It is founded on fallacies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> many people {{about the nature of}} science. These fallacies are widespread not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public <b>mind</b> but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> scientists themselves because they have failed to recognise the significance of <b>the</b> human element <b>in</b> science. <b>The</b> general public entertains a different fallacy {{based on the belief that}} science's main role is a technological one, destined to help us improve material welfare and wage war. My address discusses the nature and effects of these fallacies, and particularly <b>the</b> way <b>in</b> which they have reduced the status of the social sciences, not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> other scientists, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public as well.

5|$|The {{idea that}} the crusades were a {{response}} to Islam dates {{back as far as}} 12th-century historian William of Tyre, who began his chronicle with the fall of Jerusalem to Umar. Although the original Islamic conquests had taken place centuries before the First Crusade, more recent events, or atrocities, committed by the Muslims in their occupation of the Levant, would have been fresh <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Christians of the time. For example, in 1009 the Church of the Holy Sepulchre had been destroyed by the Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah; Pope Sergius IV supposedly called for a military expedition in response, and in France, many Jewish communities were even attacked in a misdirected retaliation. Despite the Church's rebuilding after al-Hakim's death, and pilgrimages resuming, including the Great German Pilgrimage of 1064–1065, pilgrims continued to suffer attacks from local Muslims. Liberating the Sepulchre is often presented as motivation for the crusaders. In addition, the even more recent Turkish incursions into Anatolia and northern Syria were certainly viewed as devastating by Eastern Christian chroniclers, and it is plausible they were presented as such by the Byzantines to the Pope in order to solicit the aid of European Christians.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Sumerian King List {{attained}} its final form, though it used many much earlier sources.

25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that these great tombs, far more {{impressive}} than would be required of mere repositories for bones, were the centres of ritual activity in the early Neolithic: they were shrines as well as mausoleums.

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that these territories did not belong to the Commonwealth any longer, and were under foreign rule, their {{administration}} existed for further 100 years, until the Partitions of Poland, with a complex hierarchy of all kinds of regional offices. The existence of fictional titles {{was the result of the}} special role of offices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish–Lithuanian nobility: even though these offices were only honorary, without any material privileges and salaries, they determined social status of their bearers. Furthermore, having a title, albeit fictional, emphasized the position of an individual nobleman as a keen citizen and co-creator of the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|The Athenian {{fleet of}} 180 ships {{caught up with}} Lysander shortly after he had taken Lampsacus, and {{established}} a base at Sestos.

The location was less than ideal {{because of the lack of}} a harbor and the difficulty of supplying the fleet, but proximity seems to have been the primary concern <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Athenian generals. Every day, the fleet sailed out to Lampsacus in battle formation, and waited outside the harbor; when Lysander refused to emerge, they returned home.|$|E

25|$|As one of {{the first}} Canadian {{painters}} who could earn a living from his artwork alone, Kane prepared the ground for many later artists. His travels inspired others to similar journeys, and a very direct artistic influence is evident in the case of F. A. Verner, whose mentor Kane became in his later years. According to Harper, the early Lucius O'Brien was also influenced by Kane's work. Kane's 1848 exhibition of his sketches, which included 155 watercolour and 85 oil on paper paintings, helped establish the genre <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public and cleared the way for artists like William Cresswell or Daniel Fowler, who both were able to make a living from their watercolour paintings.|$|E

His doctors assured him that it was benign, and that he would make a full recovery, but he took the opportunity to resign on the grounds of ill-health. He was succeeded by Home, who campaigned on Britain's nuclear deterrent in the 1964 election. While unimportant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electorate, it was an issue on which Home felt passionately, and the majority of voters supported his position. Home narrowly lost the election to Harold Wilson.|$|E
25|$|The {{belief in}} ghosts is deeply {{ingrained}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people of India across generations {{and it still}} persists even {{in an era of}} modern technology and scientific development. The various concepts of ghosts trace their roots in the vast bodies of Hindu mythology, religious texts, literature and folktales. There are many allegedly haunted places in India, such as dilapidated buildings, royal mansions, forts, forest bungalows, burning ghats etc. Ghosts also occupy a significant place in the Bengali culture. Ghosts and various supernatural entities form {{an integral part of the}} socio-cultural beliefs of the both Hindu and Muslim communities of rural Bengal. Fairy tales often use the concept of ghost and references to paranormal activities are found amply in modern-day Bengali literature, cinema, radio and TV programmes.|$|E
