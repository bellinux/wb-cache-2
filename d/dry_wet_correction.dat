40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} land reclamation (<b>drying,</b> <b>wetting,</b> flushing, and leaching) on the change of soil chemical properties of acid sulphate soils from Kalimantan. Randomized Complete Design (RCD) by two factors treatments with two replications is used in this research. Factor I was soil reactiveness that is define as (a) low reactive= R 1; (b) moderate reactive =R 2; (c) strong reactive= R 3, and (d) very strong reactive= R 4 respectively. Factor II was <b>drying,</b> <b>wetting,</b> and diluting that is define as (1) <b>drying</b> continuously after <b>wetting</b> = W 1, (2) wetting continuously = W 2; (3) drying after weeting and diluting =W 3; and (4) wetting and diluting. The result of experiments show that continuous <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) and <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) or continuous weeting (W 2) gave soils pH lower than the weeting and diluting (W 4). Dried on the strong reactive soils (R 4) not decrease soil pH significantly. The continouos <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) can increase EC (electrical conductivity) higher than the continous wetting (W 2) and wetting that followed diluting (W 4) or <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3). The continouos wetting (W 2) and the continouos <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) has given the total soluble acidity of 63, 30 dan 61, 71 cmolc kg- 1 respectively, higher than <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) and wetting thatfollowed diluting (W 4) that given total soluble acidity of 54, 03 and 51, 95 cmolc kg- 1 respectively. The effects of <b>drying,</b> <b>wetting,</b> flushing, and leaching on the total soluble acidity, Soluble Al and soluble H, especially on the strong reactive soils are very significant. All of the exchangeble bases (Ca, Mg, K, Na) on the continouos <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) are lower than the continous wetting (W 2) and wetting that followed diluting (W 4) or <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) respectively. The continouos <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> (W 1), the continous wetting (W 2) and wetting that follow diluting (W 4) or <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) decrease exchangable Mg, especially on strong reactive soils (R 4), but contradictive to low reactive soils (R 1). The continouos <b>drying</b> after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) increase exchangable Na, especially on low reactive soils (R 1), but the wetting that followed diluting (W 3, W 4) decreases exchangable Na...|$|R

40|$|Uniaxial {{compression}} test of cement asphalt (CA) mortar specimens, due to <b>drying</b> and <b>wetting</b> cycle of 0, 2, 4 and 8 times, {{is carried out}} by using the electronic universal test machine, with the strain rate ranging from 1 × 10 − 5 [*]s− 1 to 1 × 10 − 2 [*]s− 1. The effects of strain rate and <b>drying</b> and <b>wetting</b> cycle time on the compressive strength, elasticity modulus, and stress-strain full curve are investigated. Experimental {{results show that the}} strain-stress full curve of CA mortar is affected obviously by strain rate and <b>drying</b> and <b>wetting</b> cycle time. The compressive strength and elasticity modulus increase with the strain rate under the same <b>drying</b> and <b>wetting</b> cycle time. The compressive strength and elasticity modulus decrease with the increase of <b>drying</b> and <b>wetting</b> cycle time in the same strain rate. The lower the strain rate is, the greater the compressive strength and elasticity modulus of CA mortar decrease. When the strain rate is 1 × 10 − 5 [*]s− 1 and <b>drying</b> and <b>wetting</b> cycle time is 8, the largest reduction of average compressive strength of CA mortar is 40. 48 %, and the largest reduction of elasticity modulus of CA mortar is 35. 51 %, and the influence of <b>drying</b> and <b>wetting</b> cycle on the compressive strength of CA mortar is greater than its influence on the elasticity modulus...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to verify if the {{occurrence}} of <b>dry</b> and <b>wet</b> days are conditionally dependent on the sequences of the <b>dry</b> and <b>wet</b> three preceding days, in a rainfall homogeneous area, using the nonhomogeneous third-order Markov chains. The results showed that daily transition probabilities can be properly estimated from two-month aggregate data, and then adjusted by means of sinusoidal functions. Besides, it was evidenced that everyday rain events in that area are conditionally dependent on the sequences of the <b>dry</b> and <b>wet</b> three days previous to occurrences. The third-order nonhomogeneous Markov chains are an important instrument {{for the analysis of}} the dependence between sequences of <b>dry</b> and <b>wet</b> days in certain areas...|$|R

40|$|Quasi-static {{and high}} cycle fatigue tests have been {{conducted}} on brick masonry test specimens under laboratory <b>dry,</b> <b>wet</b> and submerged test conditions. The relatively low compressive strengths of the bricks and mortar used to manufacture the test specimens were intended to {{be representative of the}} type of bricks and mortar likely to be encountered in relatively old masonry arch bridges. The quasi-static test results indicate that the compressive strength of brick masonry increases with an increase in the compressive strength of the mortar, and decreases with an increase in the degree of saturation. The compressive strength of brick masonry, based on assumed linear no tension stress distributions, increases with an increase in the load eccentricity or stress gradient. Approximately 20 % of the apparent increase in compressive strength due to load eccentricity can be attributed to non-linear material behaviour, resulting in non-linear no tension stress distributions in the mortar joints. The {{high cycle fatigue}} tests on laboratory <b>dry,</b> <b>wet</b> and submerged test specimens indicate that the fatigue strength of brick masonry depends upon the induced stress range, the mean or maximum induced stress and the quasi-static compressive strength of the brick masonry under similar loading conditions. A lower bound fatigue strength curve for laboratory <b>dry,</b> <b>wet</b> and submerged brick masonry is proposed...|$|R

UV-B stressed GOWMATHI seeds under wet condition failed to respond in vitro germination. Control and UV-B stressed FOLA and NS- 634 seeds both in <b>dry</b> and <b>wet</b> treatments germinated under in vitro condition.
