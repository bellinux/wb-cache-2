5|$|Petit <b>Ferret</b> {{developed}} Popotan in 2002. Seki Hayabusa and Iwashinichi Shimizu handled scenario development, and Akio Watanabe designed its characters {{while working}} under the alias Poyoyon♥Rock. Higuchi Hideki and Kajihara Masahiro composed music for the series; Under17 contributed theme music with vocals. Petite <b>Ferret</b> created over 1,000 two-dimensional computer graphics for backgrounds, events, and character poses. Though only characters' mouths and eyes are animated, numerous poses exist for both major and minor characters; Petit <b>Ferret</b> created slightly fewer graphics for the latter to reduce production costs. The game uses a character placement system to display the characters relative to the protagonist; distant characters appear small, and grow larger as the player approaches them.|$|E

40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} {{prevalence of}} hyperadrenocorticism in <b>ferrets</b> in The Netherlands and evaluate age, sex, and age at neutering in affected <b>ferrets.</b> Design—Prevalence survey and retrospective study. Animals— 50 <b>ferrets</b> with hyperadrenocorticism and 1, 267 <b>ferrets</b> without hyperadrenocorticism. Procedure—A questionnaire {{was sent to}} 1, 400 members of a ferret-owners organization in The Netherlands; 492 (35 %) owners returned the questionnaire, providing usable data on 1, 274 <b>ferrets.</b> Seven of these <b>ferrets</b> developed hyperadrenocorticism during the survey period; medical records for these <b>ferrets</b> and 43 <b>ferrets</b> with confirmed hyperadrenocorticism were reviewed. Hyperadrenocorticism was confirmed by histologic examination of an excised adrenal gland (92 % of <b>ferrets)</b> or clinical improvement after excision. Results—Prevalence of hyperadrenocorticism in the survey population was 0. 55 %. Sex {{was not associated with}} prevalence of disease. Median time interval between neutering and diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism was 3. 5 years. A significant linear correlation between age at neutering and age at time of diagnosis was detected. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Age at neutering may be associated with age at development of hyperadrenocorticism in <b>ferrets.</b> (J Am Vet Med Asso...|$|R

5|$|The {{southern}} {{side of the}} massif lies mostly within Italy and is {{bounded by}} the Val Veny and Val <b>Ferret</b> whose watercourses meet just above the town of Courmayeur. From Courmayeur these waters flow southwards as the Dora Baltea towards Aosta, eventually joining the Po river. However, the extreme southwestern end of the massif does lie within France and is bounded by the Vallée des Glaciers (which connects to the Val Veny over the watershed of the col de la Seigne), and its waters flow southwards towards the Isère river and onwards to the Rhône. The northeastern end of the massif falls within Switzerland, and is bounded by a separate valley, confusingly also called Val <b>Ferret,</b> and which separates it from the Pennine Alps further east. Its watercourse, la Dranse de <b>Ferret,</b> flows northwards to join the Rhône at Martigny.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Rome, all the {{livestock}} known in ancient Egypt were available. In addition, rabbits were domesticated for food {{by the first}} century BC.

40|$|A {{comparison}} was made, both in vivo and in organ culture, between newborn (1 -day-old) and suckling (15 -day-old) <b>ferrets</b> {{of lower}} respiratory tract tissue infected with a virulent strain (clone 7 a) of influenza virus. Newborn <b>ferrets</b> were killed by influenza virus following intranasal inoculation but suckling <b>ferrets</b> were almost as resistant as adult <b>ferrets.</b> In newborn <b>ferrets</b> there was a rapid, severe and progressive infection of lung tissue with infection of alveolar cells {{as well as those}} of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium (assessed by monitoring virus infectivity and by fluorescent antibody staining). In suckling <b>ferrets,</b> as previously shown for adult animals, the lung infection was less severe, less persistent and confined to the epithelium of bronchi with only a small bronchiolar involvement and even less alveolar cell infection. These differences observed in vivo were repeated in organ cultures obtained from various areas of the lung. i. e. alveolar and airway epithelial cells of newborn <b>ferrets</b> exhibited a greater susceptibility than those of older <b>ferrets.</b> Thus, it appears that one factor determining the greater susceptibility of the {{lower respiratory tract}} of newborn <b>ferrets</b> is a greater inherent susceptibility of alveolar and airway epithelial cells to infection with influenza virus. Other factors may also be involved and have yet to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|We {{surveyed}} 27 {{people who}} had adopted a total of 43 adult domestic <b>ferrets</b> after their use {{in a series of}} veterinary student surgery teaching laboratories to assess the success of those adoptions and to determine the rate of occurrence of common maladies of domestic <b>ferrets</b> after adult gonadectomy as compared with the usual practice of early-age gonadectomy. The adoptions took place 1 – 7 y prior to the survey. The response rate was 48 % of adopters, covering 53 % of the <b>ferrets.</b> Overall the success of former breeding and instructional <b>ferrets</b> as pets were rated as 91 % good or excellent and 4. 5 % poor. Behav-ioral issues (for example, nipping, failure to litter train) were noted as the most common problems (36 % of <b>ferrets).</b> Adrenal gland disease, insulinoma, or lymphosarcoma occurred in 23 % of all <b>ferrets</b> and accounted for 57 % of those <b>ferrets</b> that had died prior to the time of the survey...|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} mustelids, <b>ferrets</b> have scent glands near their anus, the {{secretions}} from {{which are used}} in scent marking. <b>Ferrets</b> can recognize individuals from these anal gland secretions, {{as well as the}} sex of unfamiliar individuals. <b>Ferrets</b> may also use urine marking for sex and individual recognition.|$|R

5000|$|Canada — <b>Ferrets</b> {{brought from}} {{anywhere}} except the US require a Permit to Import from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Animal Health Office. <b>Ferrets</b> from the US require only a vaccination certificate signed by a veterinarian. <b>Ferrets</b> under three months old {{are not subject}} to any import restrictions.|$|R
5000|$|For millennia, {{the main}} use of <b>ferrets</b> was for hunting, or <b>ferreting.</b> With their long, lean build, and {{inquisitive}} nature, <b>ferrets</b> {{are very well}} equipped for getting down holes and chasing rodents, rabbits and moles out of their burrows. Caesar Augustus sent <b>ferrets</b> or mongooses (named [...] "viverrae" [...] by Plinius) to the Balearic Islands to control the rabbit plagues in 6 BC. In England, in 1390, a law was enacted restricting the use of <b>ferrets</b> for hunting to the relatively wealthy: it is ordained that no manner of layman which hath not lands {{to the value of}} forty shillings a year shall from henceforth keep any greyhound or other dog to hunt, nor shall he use <b>ferrets,</b> nets, heys, harepipes nor cords, nor other engines for to take or destroy deer, hares, nor conies, nor other gentlemen's game, under pain of twelve months' imprisonment. [...] <b>Ferrets</b> were first introduced into the New World in the 17th century, and were used extensively from 1860 until the start of World War II to protect grain stores in the American West from rodents. They are still used for hunting in some countries, including the United Kingdom, where rabbits are considered a plague species by farmers. [...] The practice is illegal in several countries where it is feared that <b>ferrets</b> could unbalance the ecology. In 2009 in Finland, where <b>ferreting</b> was previously unknown, the city of Helsinki began to use <b>ferrets</b> to restrict the city's rabbit population to a manageable level. <b>Ferreting</b> was chosen because in populated areas it is considered to be safer and less ecologically damaging than shooting the rabbits.|$|R
5000|$|Male <b>ferrets</b> {{are called}} hobs; female <b>ferrets</b> are jills.

A group of <b>ferrets</b> {{is known as a}} [...] "business", or historically as a [...] "busyness". Other purported collective nouns, including [...] "besyness", [...] "fesynes", [...] "fesnyng", and [...] "feamyng", appear in some dictionaries, but are almost certainly ghost words.|$|R

5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two <b>ferrets</b> inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the <b>ferrets</b> from escaping.

In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the <b>ferrets</b> free access from one leg to the other, and the <b>ferrets</b> must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|R

5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and <b>ferret</b> skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the {{regiment}} {{converted to a}} light reconnaissance role equipped with armoured cars, such as the Daimler, Humber, Saladin and <b>Ferret.</b> By 1964, there were just three armoured regiments in the Territorial Army and, in 1967, {{it was decided to}} reduce the TA even further and {{the regiment}} was disbanded as an independent unit.

40|$|Recent {{events have}} {{heightened}} {{the need for}} the rapid development of vaccines directed against pandemic influenza H 1 N 1 viruses circulating during 2009 to 2010. The current study was conducted to establish a virus challenge dose for a subsequent CA/ 04 vaccine efficacy study in 3 -mo-old domesticated <b>ferrets.</b> An additional consideration in using CA/ 04 in <b>ferrets</b> is the selection of endpoints on which to base the challenge dose, given the potential nonlethality of this particular model. Four doses ranging from 104 to 107 TCID 50 units of CA/ 04 per animal were administered by intranasal instillation to groups of male and female <b>ferrets,</b> and virus titers in nasal washes obtained 1, 3, and 5 d thereafter were determined in MDCK cells. Dosed <b>ferrets</b> developed clinically mild infections. Peak virus titers occurred on day 3 after instillation regardless of dose. Virus-treated <b>ferrets</b> had less weight gain than did untreated <b>ferrets.</b> In conclusion, 3 -mo-old <b>ferrets</b> can be infected with doses as low as 104 TCID 50 units of CA/ 04, and virus titers in nasal washes and decreased body weight gain can be used to assess the course of nonlethal infection of 3 -mo-old <b>ferrets</b> by CA/ 04...|$|R

5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always <b>ferret</b> out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe thick outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) is {{characteristic}} {{of the development of}} human neocortex. How this region originates from the ventricular zone (VZ) is largely unknown. Recently, we showed that over-proliferation-induced acute nuclear densification and thickening of the VZ in neocortical walls of mice, which lack an OSVZ, causes reactive delamination of undifferentiated progenitors and invasion by these cells of basal areas outside the VZ. In this study, we sought to determine how VZ cells behave in non-rodent animals that have an OSVZ. A comparison of mid-embryonic mice and <b>ferrets</b> revealed: (1) the VZ is thicker and more pseudostratified in <b>ferrets.</b> (2) The soma and nuclei of VZ cells were horizontally and apicobasally denser in <b>ferrets.</b> (3) Individual endfeet were also denser on the apical (ventricular) surface in <b>ferrets.</b> (4) In <b>ferrets,</b> apicalward nucleokinesis was less directional, whereas basalward nucleokinesis was more directional; consequently, the nuclear density in the periventricular space (within 16 μm of the apical surface) was smaller in <b>ferrets</b> than in mice, despite the nuclear densification seen basally in <b>ferrets.</b> These results suggest that species-specific differences in nucleokinesis strategies may have evolved in close association with the magnitudes and patterns of nuclear stratification in the VZ...|$|R
