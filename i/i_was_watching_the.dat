500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
500|$|In late April 2011, Grace Potter {{from the}} American rock band Grace Potter and the Nocturnals sang a rootsy {{acoustic}} rendition of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] along with strategic handclaps and drummer Matthew Burr's backbeat. Potter said that choosing to cover [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was easy {{because she is}} [...] "big-voiced". She elaborated: [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> video, I was watching for the visual candy. Then I slowly began {{falling in love with}} the song." [...] Jessica Letkemann of Billboard magazine complimented the cover, writing: [...] " [...] may usually rock with a 60s feel while Texas-born Beyoncé is a queen of R, but one thing the two women undoubtedly have in common is an amazing set of pipes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding Callas's acting ability, vocal {{coach and}} music critic Ira Siff remarked, [...] "When I saw {{the final two}} Toscas she did in the old , I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> actual story on which the opera had later been based." [...] Callas was not, however, a {{realistic}} or verismo style actress: her physical acting was merely [...] "subsidiary to the heavy Kunst of developing {{the psychology of the}} roles {{under the supervision of the}} music, of singing the acting... Suffering, delight, humility, hubris, despair, rhapsody—all this was musically appointed, through her use of the voice flying the text upon the notes." [...] Seconding this opinion, verismo specialist soprano Augusta Oltrabella said, [...] "Despite what everyone says, [...] was an actress in the expression of the music, and not vice versa." ...|$|E
2500|$|An early 1996 Q {{magazine}} interview {{revealed that}} relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy {{wrote that he}} found them [...] "on {{the verge of a}} nervous breakup". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. [...] "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, [...] "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day , <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane, and booked into the Saga hotel. I didn't know it meant Saga holidays, for older people—I thought it was Saga as in Nordic sagas. But it was actually an OAP cruise hotel. I was on my own: I didn't know anybody. I went into the street, Laugavegur, where the bars are, and that was it." ...|$|E

60|$|There is nothing, unless, perhaps, the English language, more terrible {{than the}} {{workings}} of an English railway-line.

5000|$|... "It {{is still}} a {{commonly}} accepted notion that the editor just [...] "cuts out all the bad bits." [...] I liken editing more to sculpture.

6000|$|One {{sometimes}} {{wonders whether}} he has gained so very much. A small acquaintance of mine is being brought up on strange principles.

6000|$|The next {{afternoon}} I {{was back in}} the big woods to investigate. Fifty feet behind the thicket where I had been struck was a tall dead stub overlooking a little clearing. [...] "That's his watch tower," [...] I thought. [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> deer, he was up there watching my head, and when it moved he swooped." ...|$|E
60|$|The next morning, {{dressed in}} a shabby blouse, alpaca cap, and {{trousers}} frayed out round the ankles, I--Hector Ratichon, the confidant of kings--was lounging under the porte-cochere of No. 65 Rue des Pyramides. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> movements of a man, similarly attired to myself, as he crossed and recrossed the courtyard to draw water from the well or to fetch wood {{from one of the}} sheds, and then disappeared up the main staircase.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not answer}} instantly; for I believe <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> traces of that bewitching smile, and speculating against its {{influence}} with the pertinacity {{of a man who}} was determined not to be taken in. That smile haunted me for a week, and it was a long time before I fully comprehended it. I decided, however, to come to the point at once, as respects Bayard and my sister, and not be beating the bush with indirect allusions.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] she explained, [...] "things became {{absolutely}} {{impossible for}} me at Market Burnham. I won't say that they disbelieved me--not my father, at any rate--but he {{seems to think that}} it was somehow my fault--that if you hadn't been there that night the thing wouldn't have happened. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> whole of the time, in fact not a soul has said a civil word to me--since you left. I just couldn't stand it any longer. I packed up this morning and I came away without saying a word to any one." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{sat on the}} parapet of the bridge, {{and swung}} my feet over the water that frothed and fretted at the central pier below. Above the bridge the stream broadened into a cress-bespangled pool, over which the {{sapphire}} dragon-flies hovered, and its earlier course was hidden by the big oak trees that bent towards each other from either bank. Through their speckled tracery of green one saw the hazy blue depths of the further forest. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> proceedings of some quick-moving brown bird amid the rushes and marsh marigolds of the opposite bank.|$|E
60|$|The {{five men}} were in {{the bow of the}} boat--a bad place when a craft is towing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> {{behavior}} of their boat as the great fisherman's staysail, far, far larger than the top-sail and used only in light breezes, was broken out. As the Mary Rebecca lurched forward with a tremendous jerk, the nose of the boat ducked down into the water, and the men tumbled over one another in a wild rush into the stern to save the boat from being dragged sheer under water.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{you know}} what to-morrow is, Kitty?' Alice began. 'You'd have guessed if you'd been up in the window with me--only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn't. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> boys getting in sticks for the bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we'll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.' Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten's neck, {{just to see how}} it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have come,' she whispered, 'but it was {{at great}} risk. Ye know not how <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>watched.</b> <b>The</b> priests <b>watch</b> me.

But the diploma work is not limited to one region.

Throughout my diploma thesis, I notice the local self-government of the Německý Brod, transformation of the city and its inhabitants and fates of Josefa Menšíková friends.

60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} sunlight {{upon the}} trees and the town, the shift and play of colour in the crowded street of the cherry, and crooning to myself because the sky <b>was</b> blue and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> alive beneath it with a pair of eyes in my head.|$|R
60|$|A surgeon came in {{to dress}} the wounded soldier, and I learned that it was two in the afternoon. My {{headache}} was no better, and the surgeon paused from his work long enough {{to give me a}} powerful drug that would depress the heart and bring relief. I slept again, and the next I knew I was on top of the building. The immediate fighting had ceased, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> balloon attack on the fortresses. Some one had an arm around me and I was leaning close against him. It came to me quite {{as a matter of course}} that this was Ernest, and I found myself wondering how he had got his hair and eyebrows so badly singed.|$|E
60|$|When I {{was here}} {{about eight years}} ago I was coming up in a car of the {{elevated}} road. Very few people were in that car, and on one end of it there was no one, except on the opposite seat, where sat a man about fifty years old, with a most winning face and an elegant eye--a beautiful eye; and I took him from his dress to be a master mechanic, a man who had a vocation. He had with him a very fine little child of about four or five years. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> affection which existed between those two. I judged he was the grandfather, perhaps. It was really a pretty child, and I was admiring her, {{and as soon as he}} saw I was admiring her he began to notice me.|$|E

If I could have {{understood}} their language, I should have learned something worth telling. I felt inclined to scare them by giving a tremendous yell, and I know I could have got away all right. They were sitting round a big fire and {{would not have been able}} to see in the dark.
