5000|$|Identity {{assurance}} specifically {{refers to}} the degree of certainty of an identity assertion made by an identity provider by presenting an <b>identity</b> <b>credential</b> to the Relying Party. In order to issue this assertion, the Identity Provider must first determine whether or not the claimant possesses and controls an appropriate token, using a predefined authentication protocol. Depending on the outcome of this authentication procedure, the assertion returned to the Relying Party by the Identity Provider allows the Relying Party {{to decide whether or not}} to trust that the identity associated with the credential actually [...] "belongs" [...] to the person presenting the credential.|$|E
5000|$|Identity assurance, in {{an online}} context, {{is the ability of}} a relying party to determine, with some level of certainty, that a claim to a {{particular}} identity made by some entity can be trusted to actually be the claimant's [...] "true" [...] identity. Identity claims are made by presenting an <b>identity</b> <b>credential</b> to the Relying Party. In the case where the entity is a person, this credential may take several forms, including: (a) personally identifiable information such as name, address, birthdate, etc.; (b) an identity proxy such a username, login identifier (user name), or email address; and (c) an X.509 digital certificate.|$|E

In the proposed model, Privacy is ensured via pseudonym based signature scheme that ensures the minimal and selective disclosure of user information. The Authentication module includes IdP that provides the <b>identity</b> <b>credentials</b> to users and is also responsible for performing their verification. UIMM also ensures Authorized access to multiple federated security realms. The identity meta-system component aims to provide User-Centricity via identity selector component that allows the user to choose the credentials for different resource accesses. On the contrary, UIMM offers no support for Identity Federation; even though it allows the user to access the information from anywhere, but that information is retrieved from a central location, which may result in single point of failure. This model does not offer support to Auditing and Logging principle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Digital <b>identity</b> <b>credentials</b> {{are a key}} enabler for {{important}} online services, but widespread theft and misuse of such credentials poses serious risks for users. We believe that an identity management system (IdMS) that empowers users {{to become aware of}} how and when their <b>identity</b> <b>credentials</b> are used is critical for the success of such online services. Furthermore, rapid revocation and recovery of potentially compromised credentials is desirable. By following a user-centric identity-usage monitoring concept, we propose a way to enhance a user-centric IdMS by introducing an online monitoring agent and an inexpensive storage token that allow users to flexibly choose transactions to be monitored and thereby to balance security, privacy and usability. In addition, by utilizing a threshold signature scheme, our system enables users to revoke and recover credentials without communicating with identity providers. Our contributions include a system architecture, associated protocols and an actual implementation of an IdMS that achieves these goals. ...|$|R
50|$|Service {{authentication}} {{refers to}} the identity verification process from the service provider to the user. So far, virtually all types of authentication have been a user authentication where a user provides his or her credentials to the service {{in lieu of the}} service providing its <b>identity</b> <b>credentials</b> to the user. There has been a steady rise of needs for service authentication to protect users from the malicious hacking attack, commonly known as ‘pharming’, which lures users to fake sites. Since pharming effectively entices a user to believe the site is genuine, it is obviously vital for users {{to find a way to}} carefully verify the authenticity of a site. Service authentication, a type of mutual authentication technology combined with the international standard security protocol, would prevent such pharming attacks if properly administered by providing the <b>identity</b> <b>credentials</b> of the server to the client through securely encrypted communication. There have been several attempts within the community of IT security vendors and IAM providers to successfully incorporate the service authentication for more robust protection of the client-server communication.|$|R

To reduce this burden, we explore the effectiveness of an anomaly detection based approach that relies on <b>identity</b> <b>credential</b> usage log records. More specifically, we use an anomaly-based metric to score the risk of each <b>identity</b> <b>credential</b> usage, e. g., a login request. Scores are determined based on categorical attribute values extracted from log records, such as timestamps. We utilize actual log data of login attempts to a university portal {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this approach. Our approach can work in conjunction with intrusion or fraud detection systems. It is also possible that stronger authentication can be required only when the risk score is high, which can help balance security and usability demands...|$|E

30|$|At step (1), a {{challenge}} message {{with a fresh}} nonce is issued to a platform (in this case, the TED) to attest its identity and integrity with the application service. Once this message is received, the TED platform at step (2) calls a TPM function to generate an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) and the TPM credentials. These credentials, along with other credentialsa the public part of the AIK and the original challenge nonce are signed by the private TPM Endorsement Key. The resulting signed credential is then encrypted using the public part of the certifying authority’s key. This is then sent at step (3) to the certifying authority as a request to validate its credentials. If successful, the certifying authority creates a signed, encrypted credential that is {{sent back to the}} platform at step (4). Step (5) is used to produce an encrypted summary of measurements of the environment held in sealed storage (the Platform Configuration Registers, or PCR) in the TPM chip. (e.g. one measurement may be a list of loaded and running processes just after boot, another measurement may be a new list of running processes several hours after boot). This encrypted measurement information is then sent back to the challenger, along with the <b>identity</b> <b>credential</b> received from the certifying authority at step (6). Upon reception of the message, the challenging application service now validates at step (7) the measured environment and compares it to its own expected measurements that it holds. During this process, the challenging application service checks the <b>identity</b> <b>credential</b> to determine that it was signed by the certifying authority, as well as verifying the signature of the measured values and that it contains the original challenge nonce. Depending on the application requirements, step (8) may optionally be used to signal to the application client the success of the measurement and attestation process.|$|E
30|$|For non-encryption based <b>identity</b> <b>credential,</b> {{information}} is hashed using a one-way hash function {{and the key}} processed by the supplicant. Thus, this method is computationally efficient. To verify the supplicant’s identity, the authenticator must own the key used by the supplicant and know the one-way hash function used by the supplicant to regenerate the results that were disclosed by the supplicant as identity. Another form of hash based non-encryption <b>identity</b> <b>credential</b> uses a delayed key disclosure as in timed efficient stream loss-tolerant authentication (TESLA) [21], lightweight hop-by-hop authentication protocol (LHAP) [22], hop-by-hop efficient authentication protocol (HEAP) [23], and adaptive and lightweight protocol for hop-by-hop authentication (ALPHA) [10]. TESLA is a broadcast authentication protocol based on loose time synchronization. However, hop-by-hop authentication is not supported by TESLA. What is more, the computational overhead of TESLA is also high due {{to the existence of}} network latencies and redundant hash elements. LHAP bases on the principles of TESLA to carry out both packet authentication and hop-by-hop authentication, wherein intermediate nodes authenticate all the packets received prior to forwarding them. However, LHAP also suffers from long latency and poor throughput and is not designed to prevent inside attacks. HEAP authenticates packets at every hop using modified hash message authentication code-based algorithm along with two keys and dropping any packet that originates from outsiders. However, HEAP still suffers from inside attack and could not provide end-to-end authentication. ALPHA, which makes use of interaction-based hash chains and Merkle trees, provides both end-to-end and hop-by-hop authentication and integrity protection and overcomes the shortcomings of the above-proposed protocols. Therefore, ALPHA is adopted as the authentication protocol in the proposed game-theoretic approach for security and QoS co-design in cooperative wireless communication networks.|$|E

Federated Identity provides IdPs and relying parties with a common set of identity trust conventions that transcend individual identity service providers, users, or networks, so that a relying party will know it can trust a credential issued by IdP 'A' at a level of assurance comparable to a common standard, which will also be agreed upon by IdPs 'B,' 'C,' and 'D.' ...|$|R
