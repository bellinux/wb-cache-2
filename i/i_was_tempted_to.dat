2500|$|Conner's plane {{arrived at}} LAX at 4:40 pm; he was flown by {{helicopter}} to CBS Studios and landed during a commercial break. After {{appearing on the}} show with Comăneci and Panait, Conner met with [...] Comăneci in the green room, later saying of the meeting:I think I can understand why Nadia said what she did ... She said, 'He (Panit) is my manager. We don't have a relationship, so it doesn't matter if he's married or not.' But it came off really awful. She regrets it, and I don't think she realized how misunderstood she would be. She really got burned. She said the Miami media was really not nice to her. Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who wasshy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed {{that he was being}} open and honest.

60|$|When he left Five Hundred Pounds to his {{faithful}} servant Frederic Higginson, courier, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> interpose; but I refrained in time, and I {{was glad}} of it afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{promised the}} Marquis that I would demand {{satisfaction}} of his son, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> {{do so and}} risk the consequences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doubtless he does," [...] {{answered}} Karlsefin; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> {{think that}} he, like some others among us, pines for an absent sweetheart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You {{have been}} some time giving me these lessons,’ he went on, ‘and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> think rather well of you. <b>I</b> believe you <b>are</b> a gentleman.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is such a}} fine {{evening that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> come and see the {{magnolia}} that {{you have all been}} boasting of: and really it is worth seeing. Those white blossoms are magnificent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have in my}} pouch here, Egbert, some cakes, which I cooked this morning, and a capon {{which one}} of the monks of Croyland gave me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> throw it away as I ran." ...|$|E
6000|$|Having {{heard his}} views, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> push on, and inquired as flatteringly as {{possible}} {{of a young}} portrait painter how he mixed his paints: [...] "So as to get exactly the colours you want, you know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drink, man, drink!" [...] cried Nicholas impatiently, [...] "before <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> {{change my}} mind. Christina, {{provided}} you marry her, is the richest bride in Zandam. There is the deed; read it; and read quickly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Aunt!" [...] he said. [...] "Almost <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{sorry for}} her. Two girls--fighting {{one against the}} other for Elmhurst--and both fawning before a cruel and {{malicious}} old woman who could never love anyone but herself." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I may {{be forgiven}} for reading between his lines. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> think that Mr. Holbrooke is only {{discussing}} his own grievances against the English public, and that the real heading of his articles should be 'Holbrooke's v. German or any other music'" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{occurrence}} interested me, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> experiment further. But when I {{would have}} essayed it another new and entirely unaccountable force restrained me. For {{the first time}} in my life I felt embarrassment in the presence of a woman.|$|E
60|$|This, however, was {{afterwards}} {{of use to}} me, {{the impression}} continuing on my mind; so that often, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, Don't give {{too much for the}} whistle; and I saved my money.|$|E
60|$|Father Adam wept when he {{sold her}} to me; after I had sold {{her in my}} turn, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> follow his example; and being alone with a stage-driver and four or five {{agreeable}} young men, I {{did not hesitate to}} yield to my emotion.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, don't say that," [...] she protested {{with strange}} earnestness. [...] "I am the most {{severely}} disciplined {{person in the}} world. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> say that my discipline has stopped at nothing short of killing myself. I suppose you can hardly understand what I mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{your book}} I take no account," [...] he said, [...] "but in {{the vision of}} your pure spirit <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> believe. Perhaps {{the things that you}} foresee will happen, so, child, fly. You will not lack an escort and I can give you treasure." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fascinating}} and confusing effect which {{the appearance of}} fire at night has on animals is a most interesting subject; and {{although it is not}} probable that anything very fresh remains to be said about it, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> add here the results of my own experience.|$|R
6000|$|He {{rose and}} {{put aside the}} book he had idly picked up. [...] "I am afraid I am an {{intentional}} intruder this time, Miss Nott. But I found no one here, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> look into this ship-shape little snuggery. You see the temptation {{got the better of}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{attempt to}} excuse myself. I don't {{expect you to}} {{consider}} how sorely <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> secure the happiness of my brother's life, by marriage with such a woman as yourself. I don't remind you that I knew--when I put obstacles in your way--that you were blindly devoting yourself {{to the discovery of}} an innocent man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I was a boy, father," [...] said Will earnestly, [...] "your {{speaking}} {{sharply to}} me was natural, for I was foolish, and acted on impulse. I am thankful now that I did not give way to rebellion, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> do; but I am not now a boy, father. If you will talk calmly with me--" ...|$|E
60|$|As an {{illustration}} of how a good worker may suddenly become inefficient, and what then happens <b>to</b> him, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> give the case of M'Garry, a man thirty-two years of age, and an inmate of the workhouse. The extracts are quoted from the annual report of the trade union.|$|R
6000|$|... "None {{the less}} sad {{that a friend}} has proved false, Jew," [...] he said sternly. [...] "It has never been my custom to call any of your race `dog,' as too many of my creed have done in time past, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> change my custom this night." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} {{there are two kinds of}} people in the world - those who will learn {{something}} from this book (People in Quandaries) and those who will not. The best blessing I can give you is to wish that as you go through life you will be surrounded by the former and neglected by the latter.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seemed to}} me {{necessary}} you should regain all your strength, {{that you might be}} able to meet the disaster which I feel is near upon us. There have been times when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> call for Uncle 'Rasmus, insisting he send you out at once; but I was checked by the thought that you had already endured much of labor and should be allowed the slumber which was needed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was awful!" [...] {{the girl}} said, putting {{her hand to}} her face. [...] "Awful to be {{standing}} there and hearing them laughing and shouting and cursing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> go behind him, and shoot him suddenly; but the others would have been just as bad, and we should have gained nothing by it. I would not go through that half hour again, for {{all the money in the}} world.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a long story," [...] {{replied the}} visitor, [...] "but I {{always had the}} idea that we should meet again. Your {{photograph}} has been with me all over the world. In the backwoods of Canada, in the bush of Australia, it has been my one comfort and guiding star. If ever <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> do wrong, I used to take your photograph out and look at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{one more}} {{tradition}} I may allude, {{that we are}} somehow descended from a French barber-surgeon who came to St. Andrews {{in the service of}} one of the Cardinal Beatons. No details were added. But the very name of France was so detested in my family for three generations, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> suppose there may be something in it. {12a} ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I assure you," [...] went on Mr. Lavender, [...] "that we {{have none}} of us the right in these days to delay for a single minute the {{delivery}} of anything--not even of speeches. When <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> do so, <b>I</b> think of our sons and brothers in the trenches, and how every shell and every word saves their lives, and I deliver----" ...|$|R
60|$|LEMMY. As I daon't {{believe in}} a life beyond the gryve, <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> send yer there.|$|R
60|$|This request arrested {{me in my}} fictional progress. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> {{accept this}} commission, not merely because of the editor's generous terms of payment but for the deeper reason that Grant was a word of epic {{significance}} in my mind. From the time when I was three years of age, this great name had rung in my ears {{like the sound of}} a mellow bell. I knew I could write Grant's story--but--I hesitated.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} I strike out some other praiseful things which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> add. I do not strike them {{out because they}} were not true or not well said, but because I find them better said by another man--and a man more {{competent}} to testify, too, because he belongs on the ground, and knows. I clip them from a chatty speech delivered some years ago by Mr. William Little, who was at that time mayor of Ballarat: ...|$|E
60|$|You {{should hear}} the Saga of the States reeled {{off by a}} young and {{enthusiastic}} citizen who had just carved out for himself a home, filled it with a pretty little wife, and is preparing to embark on commerce on his own account. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> believe that pistol-shots were regrettable accidents and lawlessness only the top scum on the great sea of humanity. I am tempted to believe that still, though baked and dusty Utah is very many miles behind me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very {{grateful}} to you, Wampus, and <b>I</b> know you <b>are</b> a brave and true man. I shall expect you to protect me at all times, for I really don't wish to shoot anyone, although I think it best to carry a revolver. Always after this, before <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> fire, <b>I</b> shall look {{to see if you}} are not near me." ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{specimen}} Mr. Ford examined weighed 170 1bs., {{without the}} thoracic, or pelvic, viscera, and measured four feet four inches round the chest. This writer describes so minutely and graphically {{the onslaught of}} the Gorilla--though he does not for a moment pretend to have witnessed the scene--that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> give this part of his paper in full, for comparison with other narratives: ...|$|R
2500|$|Roosevelt {{closed the}} police-managed lodging rooms in which Riis had {{suffered}} {{during his first}} years in New York. [...] After reading the exposés, Roosevelt was so deeply affected by Riis's sense of justice that he befriended Riis for life, later remarking, [...] "Jacob Riis, whom <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> call the best American I ever knew, although he was already a young man when he came hither from Denmark".|$|R
