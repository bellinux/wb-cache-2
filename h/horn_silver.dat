50|$|Smelting is {{the process}} of extracting metal from ore. Charcoal-fueled {{smelting}} in both pits and kilns had been used in Utah since at least 1872. Overall, there were 36 beehive-shaped smelting kilns operating in the district. The five granite beehive-shaped charcoal smelting kilns that have survived in Frisco were created by the Frisco Mining and Smelting Company under the supervision of Benjamin Y. Hampton, primarily for the <b>Horn</b> <b>Silver</b> Mine, between 1877 and 1880 for $500-$1000 apiece. Each kiln varies in size from the other, anywhere from 16 to 32 feet in diameter. The company was hard-hit by the <b>Horn</b> <b>Silver</b> Mine cave-in, and eventually closed up shop in 1884. The surviving kilns were added to the National Register of Historic Places March 9, 1982 {{as an integral part of}} Utah's history.|$|E
