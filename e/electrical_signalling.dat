5|$|Between 5–28 June 1926, {{the station}} was closed to allow the Southern Railway to carry out various works, {{including}} the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of the tracks and installation of {{a new system of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>signalling</b> – the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated and the glass roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains. The signal box spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.|$|E
25|$|Because {{double and}} single track may use {{different}} signalling systems, {{it may be}} awkward and confusing to mix double and single track too often. For example, intermediate mechanical signal boxes on a double-track line can be closed during periods of light traffic, but this cannot be done {{if there is a}} single-line section in between. This problem is less serious with <b>electrical</b> <b>signalling</b> such as Centralized traffic control.|$|E
25|$|OBD-II is an {{improvement}} over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout, the <b>electrical</b> <b>signalling</b> protocols available, and the messaging format. It also provides a candidate list of vehicle parameters to monitor along with how to encode the data for each. There is a pin in the connector that provides power for the scan tool from the vehicle battery, which eliminates the need to connect a scan tool to a power source separately. However, some technicians might still connect the scan tool to an auxiliary power source to protect data in the unusual event that a vehicle experiences a {{loss of electrical power}} due to a malfunction. Finally, the OBD-II standard provides list of standardized DTCs. As a result of this standardization, a single device can query the on-board computer(s) for these parameters in any vehicle. OBD-II standardization was prompted to simplify diagnosis of increasingly complicated emissions equipment, and though only emission-related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it according to U.S. legislation, most manufacturers have made the OBD-II Data Link Connector the main connector in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and reprogrammed. OBD-II Diagnostic Trouble Codes are 4-digit, preceded by a letter: P for engine and transmission (powertrain), B for body, C for chassis, and U for network. Manufacturers may also add custom data parameters to their specific OBD-II implementation, including real-time data requests as well as trouble codes.|$|E

40|$|The plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> {{has some}} features, e. g. weak, low-frequency and time-varying. To detect changes in plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signals,</b> LED light source {{was used to}} create a {{controllable}} light environment in this study. The <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> data were collected from Sansevieria leaves under the different illumination conditions, and the data was analyzed in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain, respectively. These analyses are helpful to explore the relationship between changes in the light environment and <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> in Sansevieria leaves. The changes in the plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> reflected the changes in the intensity of photosynthesis.

40|$|Electrophysiological signal {{in plant}} is a weak <b>electrical</b> <b>signal,</b> which can {{fluctuate}} {{with the change}} of environment. An amplification detection system was designed for plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> acquisition by using integrated op-amps (CA 3140, AD 620, and INA 118), patch electrode, data acquisition card (NI USB- 6008), computer, and shielded box. Plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> were also studied under pressure and flooding stress. The amplification detection system can make nondestructive acquisition for Aquatic Scindapsus and Guaibcn with high precision, high sensitivity, low power consumption, high common mode rejection ratio, and working frequency bandwidth. Stress experiments were conducted through the system; results show that <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> were produced in the leaf of Aquatic Scindapsus under the stress of pressure. <b>Electrical</b> <b>signals</b> in the up-leaf surface of Aquatic Scindapsus were stronger than the down-leaf surface. <b>Electrical</b> <b>signals</b> produced in the leaf of Guaibcn were getting stronger when suffering flooding stress.

50|$|Surface {{acoustic}} wave sensors are {{a class of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) which rely on the modulation of surface {{acoustic wave}}s to sense a physical phenomenon. The sensor transduces an input <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> into a mechanical wave which, unlike an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal,</b> can be easily influenced by physical phenomena. The device then transduces this wave back into an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal.</b> Changes in amplitude, phase, frequency, or time-delay between the input and output <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> {{can be used to}} measure the presence of the desired phenomenon.|$|R

50|$|Several {{aspects of}} neural {{development}} {{are related to}} cognitive development. For example, increases in the myelination of neuronal axons, which protect the transmission of <b>electrical</b> <b>signalling</b> along the axons from leakage, are related to changes in general processing efficiency. This, in turn, enhances the capacity of working memory, thereby facilitating transition across the stages of cognitive development.|$|E
50|$|The early {{mechanical}} engineer {{was concerned with}} mechanical moving parts and for many years this responsibility also included railway signalling, particularly points and semaphore signals, as these were entirely mechanically operated.

40|$|Plants sense their {{environment}} by producing <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> which in essence represent changes in underlying physiological processes.

In this paper, we compute 11 statistical features from the raw non-stationary plant <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> time series to classify the stimulus applied (causing the <b>electrical</b> <b>signal).</b> By using different discriminant analysis based classification techniques, we successfully establish {{that there is}} enough information in the raw <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> to classify the stimuli. In the process, we also propose two standard features which consistently give good classification results for three types of stimuli - Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Sulphuric Acid (H 2 SO 4) and Ozone (O 3). This may facilitate reduction in the complexity involved in computing all the features for online classification of similar external stimuli in future. Comment: 22 pages, 7 figures, 9 table...|$|R

50|$|Voice pipes {{could be}} used over {{distances}} as long as 300 ft. However, very long speaking tubes might use an <b>electrical</b> <b>signalling</b> device to indicate a call, as the large volume of air in the pipe would {{make it difficult to}} blow with enough pressure to sound a whistle at the far end. Despite this, a pipe with a larger internal diameter was desirable for longer runs as the signal loss is inversely proportional to the pipe's cross-sectional area.|$|E

50|$|Gamma wave thalamocortical {{oscillation}} is prominent during REM sleep, {{similar to}} the awakened, active brain. Contrary to the conscious state, however, it appears that sensory input may be blocked or gated from interfering with the intrinsic activity of the brain during REM. Measures of bulk <b>electrical</b> <b>signalling</b> in the brain by MEG show no impact of auditory stimuli on the gamma wave patterns; measurements on conscious subjects show a distinct modulation due to the auditory input. In this way, the thalamocortical system acts to gate the brain from external stimuli during REM.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that higher plants respond to environmental stimuli producing <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> that are in practise the information carriers in intracellular and intercellular communication. Since the amplitude of the biosignal can give only indistinct information about plant reaction, helping to distinguish when plant remain in a normal or in a stimulated situation, it is unable to answer what stimuli causes plant's reaction and the <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> generation. In order to relate plant electric wave signals characteristics to solar radiation (400 to 1100 nm) and PAR (400 to 700 nm), measurements were performed on a single stem chrysanthemum plant.
