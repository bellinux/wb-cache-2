The band appeared at various festivals, including Central Illinois Metalfest, The Goregrowler's Ball and Germany's <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Commerce. Devourment also released its second DVD in January 2007. In an interview with SMNnews.com in October 2007, Majewski said that the band aimed to complete a third studio album by mid-2008 which saw them performing less in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Topon {{has stated}} {{numerous}} {{times that the}} name <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Facts was chosen, in part, as a statement about his attitude towards the music he wrote. He tried not to feel hampered by genre labels, and that {{is reflected in the}} musical style. The earlier <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Facts recordings up until approximately 2000 featured a combination of grindcore and noise. Though those two genres were prominent during this era of recording, many other styles crept into the music as well including death metal, electronic and even as some as diverse as disco and jazz. When Discoing the Dead was released in early 2001, it retained many of these experimental styles, paving the way for the beginning of the first incarnation of <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Facts as a full band.|$|E

A companion EP, Misery, was released the same day by the band. <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Facts released the EP Amer on June 18, 2013. The band released a new EP, Abandoned, on October 1, 2014.|$|E
25|$|Mathieu Vilandré and Steve Chartier (aka Esteve Decalisse) {{were brought}} on guitar and bass {{respectively}} {{just in time}} for touring in support of <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Fact’s next release, Legacy of Hopelessness. This six-song EP had been recorded in the fall of 2004 and was co-released in June 2005 through Topon's Ghetto Blaster Recordings and Steve's label Capital Kill. A much more experimental release, Legacy of Hopelessness featured more electronic and ambient elements combined with the usual <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Facts grindcore sound. The summer support tour for the EP took the band all the way from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E

25|$|<b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Facts has {{had three}} {{different}} vocalists, all {{with their own}} style and impact on {{the sound of the}} band. The first recordings up until Discoing the Dead feature only Topon on vocals (aside from a few guest appearances). His singing varies between deep growls and more high pitched screams. The Mullet Fever lineup features Brent Christoff who has a slightly deeper, more grunting sound. The biggest change is with the replacement of Brent with Mel Mongeon who has a very distinctive high-pitched shriek which has become the vocal style that the band is most known for.|$|E
25|$|Most (if not all) <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Facts {{songs are}} played on guitars tuned down a fourth (B E A D F# B). Bass tuning {{is the same}} (B E A D), though {{depending}} on the performer, sometimes a 5 string bass is used. Common grindcore elements such as blast beats are also present. Generally, most of the songs feature the darker modes such as Aeolian, Phrygian, Locrian and heavy use of the tritone, though many songs feature other more chromatic scales as well. Different textures are used to create different moods. For example, a common feature will be the use of clean guitar {{within the context of}} a grindcore song that creates a radical change in the sound of the piece (an example would be the last half of Gated Community from Mullet Fever). Despite these few generalities, the musical style of the band has changed over the years.|$|E

[...] Thus, on 31 October 1997, K2 Plant Hire announced [...] "The People's Pyramid", an estimated -high structure built from as many house bricks as there were British 20th century births (estimated by the duo as 87 million), with no cost to the taxpayer. [...] According to Melody Maker, a statement posted on K2 Plant Hire's website [...] "pointedly contrast the intended virtues of their People's Pyramid with the drawbacks of the officially sponsored Millennium Dome". [...] The Guardian noted drily that the idea [...] "would appear to be far-fetched even by their own standards" [...] and [...] "Planning permission might pose a problem." [...] The Pyramid was never built.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Radiohead's Oxford studio, Godrich's studio in Covent Garden, and Yorke's home. Yorke wanted to [...] "approach and engage with computers and not a lot else, and yet still have lots of life and energy in the music." [...] To generate ideas, he cut and pasted clips at random from Radiohead's library of original samples, {{many of which were}} created on laptops in hotel rooms as the band toured. He would send sound fragments to Godrich, who identified passages that could become songs, edited them, and returned them to Yorke. Describing the collaborative process, Yorke said: [...] "'Black Swan', back in the day, was a ... nine-minute load of bollocks. Except for this one juicy bit, and [...] goes past and goes, 'That bit. <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> rest.' Usually it's something like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Ice-T {{referred}} to the album's final track, [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a protest song, stating that the song is [...] " [...] {{in the first person}} as a character who is fed up with police brutality." [...] The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and the black motorist Rodney King, whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song [...] " [...] a warning, not a threat—to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. Treat us accordingly.'" [...] In an interview for Rolling Stone, Ice-T stated that [...] "We just celebrated the fourth of July, which is really just national <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Police Day [...] I bet that during the Revolutionary War, there were songs similar to mine." ...|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the group's self-titled debut took place from September to December 1991. The album {{was released on}} March 31, 1992, on compact disc, vinyl, and audio cassette. Ice-T states that Body Count was intentionally different from his solo hip hop albums in that [...] "An Ice T album has intelligence, and at times it has ignorance. Sometimes it has anger, sometimes it has questions. But Body Count was intended to reflect straight anger. It {{was supposed to be}} the voice of the angry brother, without answers. [...] If you took a kid and you put him in jail with a microphone and asked him how he feels, you'd get Body Count: 'Fuck that. Fuck school. <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> police.' You wouldn't get intelligence or compassion. You'd get raw anger." [...] From the album, [...] "There Goes The Neighborhood" [...] was released as a single, while [...] "Body Count's in the House" [...] was featured in the film Universal Soldier.|$|E
500|$|The EP {{begins with}} [...] "Black Magic", with an {{extended}} introduction building alongside the audience's yelling. The song is performed faster, heavier, and more confident than its original recording in 1983. When {{the song is}} over, lead vocalist Tom Araya says, [...] "They say the pen is mightier than the sword. Well I say <b>fuck</b> <b>the</b> pen!", and the band begins playing [...] "Die by the Sword". The band then run-through [...] "Captor of Sin", [...] "The Antichrist", [...] "Evil Has No Boundaries", and [...] "Show No Mercy". [...] "Aggressive Perfector" [...] {{is dedicated to the}} Old Bridge Militia, a group of headbangers from Old Bridge, New Jersey. [...] "Aggressive Perfector" [...] is performed with more [...] "power", as described by author Joel McIver, who described the entire track listing as, [...] "a fearsome set, although the rest of the songs don't quite have the visceral power of the opening track. In fact, the Live Undead version of [...] "Black Magic" [...] established a career-long trend of Slayer's live songs being more powerful than the studio versions, with very few exceptions".|$|E

She released the limited-edition, preview EP Opheliac through her own label, Traitor Records, in spring 2006; while the Opheliac EPs were being shipped, Autumn claimed that her offices had been robbed, causing the delay in the album release and the shipping of the EPs. According to her, Opheliac [...] "was the documentation of a completely life-changing and life-ending experience". At one time, Autumn did have plans to film a music video for her song [...] "Liar", which included [...] "bloody bathtubs". Her song [...] "Opheliac" [...] later appeared on the 2007 albums 13th Street: The Sound of Mystery, Vol. 3, published by ZYX Music, and <b>Fuck</b> <b>the</b> Mainstream, Vol. 1, published by Alfa Matrix on June 19.
