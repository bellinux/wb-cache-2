5|$|The <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> was {{originally}} bred as a multipurpose farm dog for guarding property and driving animals to market. By {{the turn of}} the 20th century the <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> was being used as a watchdog at factories, breweries, butcheries, and stockyards throughout Bavaria. It was unknown outside Bavaria until it was used as a military dog in World War I and World War II. The first Giant Schnauzers were imported to America in the 1930s, but they remained rare until the 1960s, when the breed became popular. In 1962, there were 23 new Giant Schnauzers registered with the American Kennel Club; in 1974 this number was 386; in 1984 it was over 800 and in 1987 it was around 1000 animals. In 2012, there were 94 new dogs registered, down from 95 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|They have dense coarse {{coat that}} protects {{them from the}} weather and from vermin. Giant Schnauzers come in two color patterns: Solid black, and a color known as pepper and salt, with banded hairs of {{alternating}} white and black, appearing gray hairs at a distance. Where legal, they are shown with cropped ears and docked tails. Like other schnauzers, they have a distinct beard and eyebrows. Today, the <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. It is also used as a police dog.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat {{needs to be}} stripped every two to four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> have an allergy to shampoo.|$|R
5|$|Some <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, {{autosomal recessive}} hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.|$|R
5|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are also very energetic and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted and destructive behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> is {{a working}} breed of dog {{developed}} in the 17th century in Germany. It is {{the largest of the}} three breeds of Schnauzerthe other two breeds being the Standard Schnauzer and the Miniature Schnauzer. Numerous breeds were used in its development, including the black Great Dane, the Bouvier des Flandres, and the German Pinscher. Originally bred to assist on farms by driving livestock to market and guarding the farmer's property, the breed eventually moved into the city, where it worked guarding breweries, butchers' shops, stockyards and factories. It was unknown outside of Bavaria until it became popular as a military dog during World War I and World War II.|$|E
500|$|Giant Schnauzers {{are usually}} a quiet breed. Due to its breeding, the <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> is {{inherently}} suspicious of strangers {{and can be}} very territorial. Once introduced, it is usually accepting of novel people or situations. It {{has the potential to}} be aggressive, but Giant Schnauzers are usually reserved - they are [...] "amiable in repose, and a commanding figure when aroused" ...|$|E
500|$|Although the <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> {{is called}} 'Giant', {{this is not}} in {{comparison}} to other large dog breeds such as the Great Dane or the Rottweiler, but instead {{in comparison to the}} Standard and Miniature Schnauzers. The AKC breed standard calls for males to stand from [...] at the withers, and for females to stand from [...] Giant Schnauzers are square in shape, and should resemble a larger version of the Standard Schnauzer. The tail is long and the ears are small button ears carried high on the head. Where it is legal, it is possibly docked and the ears cropped.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> {{emerged from}} Swabia in the German state of Bavaria, and WÃ¼rttemberg in the 17th century. These {{original}} <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> were considered a rough-coated {{version of the}} German pinscher breeds, and their hair was thought to help them withstand the harsh German winters and bites from vermin. The origins of the breed are unclear, but sources speculate it originated through some combination of black Great Danes, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer.|$|R
5|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> {{come in two}} colors: solid black, and {{a pattern}} called pepper and salt, where banded hairs {{of black and white}} hairs cover the body, giving it the {{appearance}} of having been peppered and salted.|$|R
50|$|Cogg and Baz, {{also known}} as Pumpkin and Pumpkin, are two <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> and guard dogs that are never good fighters because they are always arguing with each other, but Furgul manages {{to get them to}} help him with the promise of bacon.|$|R
2500|$|A dog {{qualifying}} for a championship at a conformation show has the designation Champion or [...] "Ch."

50|$|Dogs of any breed, even mixes, {{can compete}} in Schutzhund today, {{but the most}} common breeds are German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois, Boxers, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Cane Corso, <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers,</b> Bouvier des Flandres, Dutch Shepherd Dogs, Beaucerons, American Bulldogs, Black Russian Terriers, Airedale Terriers, Australian Cattle Dogs, and the like.|$|R
500|$|The head is 1/2 {{the length}} of the dog's back, when the back is {{measured}} from the withers {{to the base of the}} tail. The cheeks are flat, but well muscled. The coat is dense, wiry, and weather resistant. The fur on the <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer's</b> face forms a distinct [...] "beard" [...] and eyebrows. Its stride is long and crisp.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 GMP {{had over}} 110 dogs. However, this has {{recently}} been reduced to only 35 dogs across the force, leaving many areas without a single dog available. The dogs are involved in important operational duties such as tracking, building searches, and other criminal work across Greater Manchester. The majority of general purpose police dogs are German Shepherds, but other breeds are also used, including Rottweilers, Belgian Shepherds and <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite its name, the Black Russian Terrier {{is not a}} true terrier: it is {{believed}} that about seventeen breeds were used in its development, including the Airedale, the <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer,</b> the Rottweiler, the Newfoundland, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog and other breeds.|$|E

5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers</b> {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|R
50|$|Many breeds of dog {{participate}} in skijoring. The only prerequisite is {{a desire to}} run down a trail and pull, which is innate in many dogs. Small dogs (less than 40 pounds) are rarely seen skijoring, {{because they do not}} greatly assist the skier; however, since the skier can provide as much power as is required to travel, any enthusiastic dog can participate. Athletic dogs such as Pointers, Setters and herding breeds take to skijoring with glee, as do the northern breeds, such as Siberian and Alaskan Huskies, Malamutes, Samoyeds, and Inuit dogs; however, any large energetic dog is capable of enjoying this sport. Golden Retrievers, <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzers,</b> Labs, and many cross-breeds are seen in harness. Pulling breeds work well also such as American Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Terriers, American bull dogs, and mastiffs.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} expand the range of {{diagnostic}} methods for determining diseases of the esophagus and {{to make them more}} present in everyday practise, it is desirable to work out in more detail the procedure of endoscopic and radiological examinations, determine their limitations and possibilities, describe the topographic-anatomical and morphological status of the esophagus in an endoscopic and radiological picture, as well as to define which diseases of this organ are most represented. The paper presents the results of six-month investigations of esophagus diseases in dogs of different breeds and ages. A total of 15 animals were examined: 2 golden retrievers, 2 rottweilers, 5 German shepherds, 3 <b>giant</b> <b>schnauzers,</b> 2 cross-breeds, and 1 dalmatian. Cases of chronic esophagitis were described, as well as the presence of a foreign body and megaesophagus, and the prescribed therapy for all these diseases...|$|R

50|$|Giant Schnauzers {{are around}} 2 ft tall at the {{shoulder}} and weigh between 55 and 80 lb. They are working dogs that were developed in Swabia in the 17th century, as a rough coated variant of the pinscher breeds. The <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer</b> was developed independently through crosses of black Great Danes, Munchener German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer.

5000|$|During the revolt, Furgul {{meets with}} Jodi, a dog whisperer, who offers {{that all the}} dogs in the revolt come live at Appletree Dog Sanctuary instead of going back. What makes Furgul agree is that she says he will be killed when they go back because he will be labeled a {{dangerous}} dog like his father. They all live at Appletree for a while until Furgul hears a whimpering pup. When he goes to help the pup, he gets captured by two thieves, Tattoo and Spotty, and finds out that the pup was only hurt {{for the sake of}} the trap and didn't know any better. He gets labeled [...] "dogmeat" [...] and is fed to Gremlin, Lunk, Freak, and Chopper. Dervla comes out of the shadows and kills them. Seeing the dogs dead, Tattoo and Spotty put him with Dervla, where she tells him their job is to distract guard dogs while the two humans go burglarizing. At the first house, Furgul meets with two <b>giant</b> <b>schnauzers</b> named Cogg and Baz and convinces them to attack Tattoo and Spotty with the bribe of bacon. After the attack, Cogg and Baz join Furgul and the others.|$|R
50|$|The German Pinscher (original name Deutscher Pinscher, FCI No. 184) is a {{medium-sized}} breed of dog, a Pinscher type that originated in Germany. The breed {{is included in}} the origins of the Dobermann, the Rottweiler, the Miniature Pinscher, the Affenpinscher, the Standard Schnauzer (and, by extension, the Miniature Schnauzer and <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer).</b> The breed is rising in numbers in the U.S., mainly due to their full acceptance to AKC in 2003.

50|$|Schnoodles {{are usually}} a cross {{of the smaller}} breeds of {{schnauzer}} and poodle. As such, the weight of an adult schnoodle can range from 20-80 pounds. Giant Schnoodles, the larger breed created by the pairing of a Standard Poodle and <b>Giant</b> <b>Schnauzer,</b> can weigh between 65 and up to 85 or 90 pounds for the largest of adult males. Schnoodles may possess the rough hair and strong body shape of the schnauzer, or the thinner shape and the curly hair of the poodle, or any combination of these characteristics.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} breeds: the giant, the standard, and the miniature. Toy and teacup are not breeds of schnauzer, but these common terms {{are used to}} market {{undersized}} or ill-bred miniature schnauzers. The original schnauzer was {{of the same size}} as the modern Standard Schnauzer breed, and was bred as a rat catcher, yard dog, and guard dog. The miniature schnauzer and the <b>giant</b> <b>schnauzer</b> were developed from the standard schnauzer and are the result of outcrosses with other breeds exhibiting the desirable characteristics needed for the schnauzer's original purpose.|$|E
