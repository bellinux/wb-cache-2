5|$|The storyline {{concerns}} Quatermass's {{investigation of}} reports {{of hundreds of}} meteorites landing only in the Winnerden Flats area of the UK. His inquiries lead him to a huge industrial complex, strikingly similar to his own plans for a moon colony. This top-secret facility {{is in fact the}} centre of a conspiracy involving the alien infiltration of the highest echelons of the British Government. Quatermass and his allies must now <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to defeat the alien threat before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|Janek (Idris Elba) is {{captain of}} the Prometheus. Following Holloway's suggestion, he lands the ship near the {{structure}} containing the Juggernaut. During the expedition Janek remains on the Prometheus, observing the schematics which Fifield's spectagraphs develop. He seduces Meredith Vickers while Sean Fifield and Rafe Milburn radio for direction. Vickers and Janek recognize the Juggernaut as an Engineer ship. While Shaw prepares to join Weyland on the expedition to awaken the Engineer, Janek says that the Engineers had nefarious intentions with the biological weapons and he will <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to protect Earth's interests. When Vickers orders Janek to bring the Prometheus home, Shaw tells him that the Engineer ship is headed to Earth to release the black liquid and annihilate the human race. Janek decides to steer the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, and orders everyone to leave. Assistant pilots Chance and Ravel refuse and help Janek run the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, crippling it, sacrificing themselves, and saving the human race.|$|E
25|$|While {{families}} will often {{try to protect}} their women from rape and may also put their daughters on contraception to prevent visible signs should it occur, there is rarely much social pressure to control young men or persuade them that coercing sex is wrong. Instead, in some countries, there is frequently support for family members to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> including murder to alleviate the shame associated with a rape or other sexual transgression. In a review of all crimes of honor occurring in Jordan in 1995, researchers found that in over 60% of the cases, the victim died from multiple gunshot wounds mostly {{at the hands of}} a brother. In cases where the victim was a single pregnant female, the offender was either acquitted of murder or received a reduced sentence.|$|E

50|$|Ho's forces rescued an American {{pilot in}} March. Washington ordered Patti to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to {{reestablish}} the intelligence flow, and the OSS mission was authorized to contact Ho. He asked to meet Gen.

500|$|Serving {{four years}} of his ten-year {{sentence}} for armed robbery, Carter [...] "Doc" [...] McCoy is denied parole in a Texas prison. When his wife Carol visits him, he tells her to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to make a deal}} with Jack Beynon, a corrupt businessman in San Antonio, to free him. Beynon uses his influence and obtains Doc's parole on the condition that he takes part in a bank robbery with two of his henchmen, Rudy and Frank. During the robbery, Frank kills a guard. Rudy attempts a double-cross, shooting Frank and drawing a gun on Doc, who beats him to the draw and shoots him several times. Doc leaves Rudy for dead, but Rudy, having secretly worn a bulletproof vest, is alive albeit wounded.|$|E
500|$|Stelter {{described}} Frank and Claire Underwood as a [...] "scheming" [...] couple. Michael Dobbs, {{the author}} of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots with her at night. He says, [...] "I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood." [...] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, [...] "My husband doesn’t apologize... even to me." [...] Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says [...] "The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in their pursuit and lust of power." [...] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series [...] "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good." [...] Willimon notes that [...] "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules {{than the rest of us}} typically do." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.|$|E

2500|$|Mary {{reflects}} on her youth in France with her companion, Anna (Cavatina: Oh nube! che lieve per l'aria ti aggiri / [...] "Oh cloud! that wanders light upon the breeze"). The {{sounds of a}} royal hunt are heard and, hearing the hunters cry out that the Queen is close by, Mary expresses her disgust (Cabaletta: Nella pace del mesto reposo / [...] "In the peace of my sad seclusion, she would afflict me with a new terror"). To her surprise, Leicester approaches and warns Mary of Elizabeth's imminent arrival, counseling her to behave humbly towards the Queen, who is then despondent (Duet: Da tutti abbandonata / [...] "Forsaken by everyone… my heart knows no hope"). But assuring Mary that he will <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to obtain her freedom, Leicester leaves her to meet Elizabeth. He then attempts to plead with the Queen for her forbearance.|$|E
2500|$|Also, the President-elect's name is {{typically}} added after the [...] "I", for example, [...] "I, George Washington, do...." [...] Normally, the Chief Justice of the United States administers the oath. It is sometimes {{asserted that the}} oath bestows upon the President the power to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to [...] "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution." [...] Andrew Jackson, while vetoing an Act for the renewal of {{the charter of the}} national bank, implied that the President could refuse to execute statutes that he felt were unconstitutional. In suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, President Abraham Lincoln claimed that he acted according to the oath. His action was challenged in court and overturned by the U.S. Circuit Court in Maryland (led by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney) in Ex Parte Merryman, 17 F. Cas. 144 (C.C.D. Md. 1861). Lincoln ignored Taney's order. [...] Finally, Andrew Johnson's counsel referred to the theory during his impeachment trial. Otherwise, few have seriously asserted that the oath augments the President's powers.|$|E
2500|$|Storm {{joins the}} {{reformed}} Astonishing X-Men (#25) because, she explains, Wakanda is {{a supporter of}} Mutantes Sans Frontieres and she believes she {{should be on the}} front line, however she is also somewhat bored of her life as queen. [...] The reemergence of the Shadow King later forces Storm to choose between her role as queen and her role as an X-Man. [...] Confronting the Panther God Bast, Storm asserts that she is not limited to being one or the other or anything else and that she is unafraid to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to fulfill those responsibilities. [...] Regaining Bast's favor, the two defeat the Shadow King and Storm decides that she will remain Queen of Wakanda and remain with the X-Men, refusing to choose between them. Seeking to re-learn his limitations, T'Challa later leaves Africa and takes a new role as the guardian of Hell's Kitchen following the events of Shadowland; Though the two remain a couple, Storm sadly but respectfully accepts T'Challa's request for temporary isolation so that he can find himself.|$|E

2500|$|The Communist Party’s {{campaign}} against Falun Gong {{was a turning}} point in the development of China’s legal system, representing a [...] "significant backward step" [...] in the development of rule of law, according to Ian Dominson. In the 1990s the legal system was gradually becoming more professionalized, and a series of reforms in 1996-97 affirmed the principle that all punishments must be based on the rule of law. However, the {{campaign against}} Falun Gong would not have been possible if carried out within the narrow confines of China’s existing criminal law. In order to persecute the group, in 1999 the judicial system reverted to being used as a political instrument, with laws being applied flexibly to advance the Communist Party’s policy objectives. Edelman and Richardson write that [...] "the Party and government’s response to the Falun Gong movement violates citizens’ right to a legal defense, freedom of religion, speech and assembly enshrined in the Constitution...the Party will <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to crush any perceived threat to its supreme control.

40|$|Sexual {{health is}} the ability to express one's {{sexuality}} without being burdened by infections, shame or regrets. The only way to enjoy one's sexuality is to practice safer sex. Safer sex <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> in order to reduce one's risks of acquiring infections and having unplanned pregnancies. Once sexual health risks are reduced one would be able to relax and enjoy one's sexuality.

50|$|In April 2008, Schecter {{published}} his first book, The Real McCain: Why Conservatives Don't Trust Him And Independents Shouldn't. The book controverted {{the image of}} Republican Presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain, as a maverick politician who worked assiduously in the public's interest. The book asserted instead that McCain was really animated {{by a desire to}} wreak vengeance upon his political foes, a desperate need to be liked by others, an all-consuming love affair with the spotlight, and a willingness to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to get ahead politically.|$|R
5000|$|The four police agents {{then decide}} to [...] "cross the red line": <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary,</b> even {{breaking}} the law, to clear Ryzhov's name.
