A <b>fortuitous</b> <b>case</b> {{of mistaken identity}} led to Ronnie and the Relatives making their debut - as dancers rather than a singing act - at New York City's hip Peppermint Lounge in 1961. It was {{the height of the}} Twist craze and the underage Nedra and Ronnie needed to disguise themselves to get in. The girls' mothers showed them how to put on make-up and fix their hair to make them look at least 23. When they arrived outside the club its manager mistook Ronnie, Estelle and Nedra for the trio supposed to dance behind house band Joey Dee and the Starliters. They followed him in, were brought up on stage, and performed in their place. During the show, Starliter David Brigati even handed the mic over to Ronnie when she started to sing Ray Charles's [...] "What'd I Say." ...|$|E
40|$|We present multifrequency light {{curves of}} BL Lacertae from February 2008 to October 2012. Lowenergy data (optical and millimetre) were {{acquired}} {{in the framework of}} a GASP-WEBT project. High-energy data (ultraviolet, X-ray, and γ-ray) come from observations of the Swift, RXTE, and Fermi satellites. After a period of moderate activity, in May 2011 the source suddenly started to flare at γ and optical-UV frequencies. Activity at millimetre wavelengths and X rays began 3 - 4 months later. This behaviour offered a good opportunity to study the correlation among flux variability in different bands, in particular between the best-sampled optical and γ-ray light curves. However, even in this <b>fortuitous</b> <b>case,</b> we can only define a general correlation with likely no time lag, but with a lag uncertainty of ± 1 day. Indeed, the data reveal a complex relationship between the γ and optical fluxes, which cannot be unveiled because of the small gaps in the sampling of this extremely variable source...|$|E
40|$|Planets {{can affect}} debris disk {{structure}} by creating gaps, sharp edges, warps, and other potentially observable signatures. However, {{there is currently}} no simple way for observers to deduce a disk-shepherding planet's properties from the observed features of the disk. Here we present a single equation that relates a shepherding planet's maximum mass to the debris ring's observed width in scattered light, along with a procedure to estimate the planet's eccentricity and minimum semimajor axis. We accomplish this by performing dynamical N-body simulations of model systems containing a star, a single planet, and a disk of parent bodies and dust grains to determine the resulting debris disk properties {{over a wide range}} of input parameters. We find that the relationship between planet mass and debris disk width is linear, with increasing planet mass producing broader debris rings. We apply our methods to five imaged debris rings to constrain the putative planet masses and orbits in each system. Observers can use our empirically-derived equation as a guide for future direct imaging searches for planets in debris disk systems. In the <b>fortuitous</b> <b>case</b> of an imaged planet orbiting interior to an imaged disk, the planet's maximum mass can be estimated independent of atmospheric models.

40|$|Amphibians are hosts for a {{wide variety}} of ecto- and endoparasites, such as protozoans and {{parasitic}} worms. Naididae is a family of Oligochaeta whose species live on a wide range of substrates, including mollusks, aquatic macrophytes, sponges, mosses, liverworts, and filamentous algae. However, some species are known as endoparasitic from vertebrates, such as Dero (Allodero) lutzi, which is parasitic of the urinary tracts of frogs, but also have a free-living stage. Specimens in the parasitic stage lack dorsal setae, branchial fossa, and gills. Here we report the occurrence of D. (A.) lutzi associated with anuran Scinax fuscovarius from Semi-deciduous Atlantic Rain Forest in southern Brazil. The study took place at the Caiu&# 225; Ecological Station, Diamante do Norte, Paran&# 225;, southern Brazil. Seven specimens of S. fuscovarius were examined for parasites but only one was infected. Parasites occurred in ureters and urinary bladder. Previous records of this D. (A.) lutzi include the Brazilian States of Santa Catarina, S&# 227;o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais, as well as Cuba and North America. This is a new locality record for this species in Brazil. Reports of Dero (Allodero) lutzi are rare, due to difficulty of observation, and such events are restricted only the <b>fortuitous</b> <b>cases.</b> It is important to emphasize the necessity of future studies, which are fundamental to the understanding of biological and ecological aspects of this species...|$|R

40|$|I T {{is not too}} {{uncommon}} {{to find in the}} literature cases first diagnosed as Guillain-Barre syndrome that eventually prove to be porphyria. This con-tingency usually occurs when an alert observer notices the dark urine character-istic of porphyria, or when, in spite of a normally colored urine, the symp-tomatology makes one suspicious and, on examining the urine, one finds the pathognomonic porphyrins or precursors. Although in the case herein reported porphobilinogen and uroporphyrin were found in the urine after a diagnosis of acute infectious polyneuritis had been made, it is held that acute infectious polyneuritis was the primary diagnosis, with the abnormal porphyrins repre-senting either a secondary change or a <b>fortuitous</b> finding. <b>CASE</b> REPORT A 14 year old white female entered The Brooklyn Hospital {{for the first time on}} March 20, 1958, complaining of weakness in her legs.

40|$|In {{the course}} of my {{research}} on the orientation of Romanesque churches in Tuscany, I came across a very interesting case. The entrance and the axis of two churches in Barga (St. Cristoforo's dome and St. Frediano's church in Sommocolonia - one of Barga’s boroughs) look at the same point on the horizon: the Monte Forato mountain, one of the peaks of the Apuan Alps which is characterized by an impressive natural rock arch. Strikingly, Monte Forato's profile reproduces the so called "face" of the “Omo Disteso” (literally “Lying man”), about which there are various legends. An astronomical sense has been indeed found about the geographic axis of the two churche, which are turned towards the same point. Observing the sunset at winter solstice, from St. Frediano's church in Sommocolonia, we can see that the sunset point coincides with Monte Forato. While from St. Cristoforo's dome, the moonset point coincides with Monte Forato at the minor southern standstill. We may further observe that the moonset point coincides with the Monte Forato, at the major southern standstill, looking from the pre-Romanesque church (of Longobard age) St. Michele a Perpoli (Gallicano). Is it a <b>fortuitous</b> <b>case?</b> In this paper I will try to demonstrate that this system, of astronomic and geographic coincidence, originates from a form of religious syncretism which envisaged the construction of the churches in the ancient holy sites of the Ligures Apuan. The alignment system is perfectly identical to the one found in the British Islands (Ruggles, 1999) and in Sardinia (Zedda 1992; 2009; 2013). We are in front of an ancient custom of building alignment clearly widespread among people in prehistoric ages. Once the prehistoric peaple found a natural reference point, well-characterized on the horizon, they chose and they marked the observation point (with a menhir, a stone circle, a dolmen or something else) from where they could observe the Sun and the Moon rising and setting at a chosen view point in their standstill points...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{sequestration}} {{is a rare}} {{congenital anomaly}} that consists of abnormal pulmonary tissue for which the arterial supply is usually derived from the aorta or its major branches. Considering clinical and anatomical aspects two types of sequestration, intralobar and extralobar, have been described. The definite diagnosis requires exact visualization of the anomalous feeding and draining vessels and this condition is essential when surgical treatment is necessary because of recurrent pulmonary infections. We report on 3 cases of intralobar sequestration successfully and extensively diagnosed in adults by spiral angioCT. Our series includes one symptomatic left case confirmed by surgery and two rare <b>fortuitous</b> asymptomatic right <b>cases.</b> In the three cases, the pulmonary abnormal tissue, the arterial supply and venous drainage were clearly identified. We conclude that, probably more than MRI, spiral angio-CT can presently be considered the first choice procedure to diagnose and evaluate pulmonary sequestration; the equal performance of spiral CT in imaging lung and vessels makes classical angiography unnecessary.

Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for EG when faced with gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral eosinophilia to avoid incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate treatments. A 24 -year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain and a laparoscopic appendectomy performed for a presumed diagnosis of an acute appendicitis. However, the procedure revealed bowel edema and a moderate amount of ascites without evidence of a suppurative appendicitis. Postoperatively, she showed persistent and progressive eosinophilia, exudative eosinophilic ascites, eosinophilic infiltration of the resected appendix wall, and eosinophilic infiltration of gastroduodenal mucosa. A punch biopsy of the abdominal skin also revealed inflammation with marked eosinophilic infiltration of the skin. She recovered after the treatment with a low dose of steroid for the EG with eosinophilic dermatitis. EG with eosinophilic dermatitis has not been reported yet and is considered <b>fortuitous</b> in this <b>case...</b>|$|R
40|$|Neurocisticercose (NC) é a parasitose mais comum do sistema nervoso central no nosso meio. Foram analisadas 3093 tomografias computadorizadas (TC) de 2554 pacientes neurológicos durante o período de um ano. A maioria dos pacientes era procedente de Curitiba (77, 3 %). 1821 (58, 9 %) das TC foram normais. Do total destes pacientes, 236 (9, 2 %) possuíam achados tomográficos compatíveis com NC; a proporção feminino:masculino foi 1, 6 : 1. Duzentos e dezenove casos (92, 8 %) apresentavam a forma inativa, 13 (5, 5 %) ativa, 3 (1, 3 %) ambas, e apenas 1 caso a forma racemosa. Calcificações intraparenquimatosas foram o achado mais comum (89 %). Cefaléia foi o achado clínico mais frequente (35, 5 %), seguida de epilepsia isolada (20, 9 %) ou associada a outros achados neurológicos (9 %). Achados tomográficos compatíveis com NC, especialmente a forma inativa, são achados relativamente comuns em uma população não selecionada de pacientes neurológicos. Com exceção parcial dos pacientes epilépticos, a relação destes achados com o quadro clínico neurológico deve ser cuidadosamente analisada individualmente, pois a presença casual de calcificações isoladas intraparenquimatosas ocorre em uma proporção significativa de pacientes com queixas ou doenças neurológicas sem relação com a NC. Neurocysticercosis (NC) is {{the most}} common {{parasitic}} disease of the central nervous system and accounts for a significant proportion of morbidity and mortality, in special epilepsy. The authors reviewed 3093 computed tomography scans out of 2554 randomized neurological patients evaluated during a one year period. Most patients (77. 3 %) were living in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil. 1821 (58. 9 %) CT scans were normal. NC was diagnosed in 236 patients based on tomographic criteria; the sex ratio was F:M 1. 6 : 1. 219 (92. 8 %) patients had the inactive form of NC: 195 (89 %) had only isolated intraparenchymal calcifications, and 24 calcifications plus hydrocephalus. Active forms were observed in 14 patients: 8 with degenerating cysts, 4 with viable cysts, 1 with intraventricular cyst, and 1 with racemose form. Three patients had both forms, active (cysts) and inactive (calcifications). The most common clinical finding among patients with tomographic diagnosis of NC was headache alone (35. 5 %), followed by epilepsy (20. 9 %). There is a potential role of NC as a causal factor of epilepsy in most of our patients, but surely not in all of them. On the other hand, the finding of inactive NC (calcifications without hydrocephalus and/or meningitic reaction) in patients with headache is probably <b>fortuitous</b> in most <b>cases.</b> In fact, the occasional finding of isolated calcifications in general population is not quite rare, as it was observed in 3. 3 % of another series of 973 patients with head trauma submitted to CT scan and without epilepsy previous history. The presence of CT findings compatible with NC, especially calcifications, must be carefully correlated with the clinical context in each case. Only then, an unequivocal cause-effect with all its medical and epidemiological implications role can be established...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore social-class {{processes}} within higher education through {{a study of the}} experiences of mature, largely working-class, Access entrants. It draws on data from a qualitative, longitudinal study of twenty-seven such entrants to a pre- 1992 university, a post- 1992 university and a college of further and higher education, all in the South Yorkshire region. The central finding is that, whilst all mature students entering higher education may experience some degree of disjunction, this is frequently more intense for those from working-class backgrounds, although factors of age, entry qualification and gender interact in complex ways to shape the experiences of mature entrants. It is suggested that, despite important differences between higher education institutions in terms of access strategies, ethos, student composition and levels of student support, the academic stance on which they are all premised, with its distanced and nuanced impartiality, may constitute a subtle source of disjunction for working-class students because it necessitates a detachment from, and symbolic re-ordering of, their social worlds. As a consequence, working-class students in higher education are likely to feel that they are entering an alien world. Drawing on Bourdieu's analogy of social life as game playing, it is contended that the working-class habitus provides resources for dealing with the experience of higher education but that participation in the academic `game' has important consequences for selfhood and relationships with significant others, marking a potential betrayal of working-class roots and a loss of the `sense of one's place'. The theoretical framework adopted in the thesis rests upon a reformulation of Bourdieu's concepts and the methodological stance is one of critical realism. It is argued that social class operates at a number of distinct but interwoven levels. At the structural level, class is viewed as a real economic and cultural phenomenon with generative mechanisms of which social actors may not be aware. Working-class students in higher education may therefore only partially recognise the class-based nature of their disadvantage. Indeed, the processes of misrecognition and symbolic violence may encourage such students to believe that they lack the necessary skills and qualities to cope in this sphere. At the level of social action, however, class processes are implicated in the struggles for distinction in social life - material, cultural and symbolic - of purposive and active social agents, although social classes at this level may now operate more as modes of differentiation than as forms of collectivity (Savage, 2000). It is contended in this thesis that the relationships between the structural and cultural dimensions of social class, and between each of these and social agency, are contingent upon historical and social circumstances; these relationships can therefore only be specified in concrete, empirical contexts. (This is clearly demonstrated by the contingent combination of structural context, individual motivation and, in many <b>cases,</b> <b>fortuitous</b> events that lay behind the entry to higher education of the working-class students in this study.) Following this, it is argued that the generative mechanisms of social class affect what happens in a contingent, rather than a necessary, way so that the outcomes of the struggles for distinction in social life are not fixed. For this reason, class processes may contribute to the reproduction of existing patterns of disadvantage but the potential is also there for change: {{in the context of this}} study, for a progressive demystification of higher education and an increasing awareness among working-class groups of its possibilities. </p...|$|R
