The collection includes more than 700 items, though many other items could not be accepted due to the low quality. The total collection included over 1000 items.

5|$|When Sabrina {{reached her}} teenage years, Day was persuaded by Edgeworth that his ideal wife {{experiment}} had failed {{and he should}} send her away, as it was inappropriate for Day {{to live with her}} unchaperoned.

Having seen changes in Sabrina, Day proposed marriage, though he soon called this off when she did not follow his strict instructions; he again sent her away, this time to a boarding house, where she later found work as a lady's companion.|$|E

25|$|Worth {{also changed}} {{the dynamic of}} the {{relationship}} between client and clothes maker. Where previously the <b>dressmaker</b> (invariably female) would visit the client's home for a one-to-one consultation, with the exception of Empress Eugénie clients generally attended Worth's salon in rue de la Paix for a consultation and it also became a social meeting point for society figures. His approach to marketing was also innovative – {{he was the first to}} use live mannequins in order to promote his gowns to clients. His wife was his early model in the 1850s, leading Lucy Bannerman to describe Vernet as the world's first professional model.|$|E

25|$|Nadezhda von Meck {{saw things}} very differently.

Neither did fulfilling all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken her energy in urging {{him to make a}} break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to see that a future for her husband lay there. She continually exerted pressure on him to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction.|$|E
