500|$|The {{battle was}} {{undoubtedly}} {{a victory for}} the British; four French ships of the line, a fourth-rate and a frigate were destroyed and much of the remainder of the Brest fleet badly damaged and requiring extensive repairs; Océan and Foudroyant were in a particularly poor state. French casualties in the engagement are not known with certainty, but are estimated at 150–200, while British losses were only 13 killed and 30 wounded. Allemand later wrote that most significant damage resulting from the battle was to the morale of the French fleet; he wrote that [...] "the greater part are disheartened; every day <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> lamenting their situation, and speaking in praise of their enemy." [...] another French commentator told a British officer that the French sailors [...] "had now no security from the English in their harbours, and they expected we should next go into Brest and take out their fleet". [...] No British ships suffered more than minor damage in the two weeks of combat, and the fleet could return to its blockade with the knowledge that the Brest fleet was neutralised {{for some time to come}} and confined to Rochefort, although a powerful squadron was still under construction at Rochefort, where the defences had been swiftly repaired. This was the last time during the Napoleonic Wars that a significant French fleet was able to put to sea from the Atlantic ports; historian Richard Woodman describes it as the [...] "biggest scare from a break-out French fleet in the post-Trafalgar period." [...] Without naval support, the French colonies in the Caribbean were isolated, blockaded, invaded and captured shortly afterwards.|$|E
