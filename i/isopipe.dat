40|$|The {{overflow}} fusion {{process was}} an important method for the manufacture of glass sheet that is currently used {{for the production of}} TFT/LCD display devices. The design of forming apparatus was critical for very high surface quality of glass to allow the successful application of semiconductor type material. However, there is only a little of researches had been presented in the literatures, because of difficulties and expansions in experiments. In this study, a numerical model for simulation of molten glass flow through the <b>isopipe</b> during overflow fusion process was carried out. The effect of temperature of forming apparatus and of molten glass on the flow patterns during overflow fusion process was investigated. It was found that the stability and flatness of sheet glass was influenced strongly by the temperature of forming apparatus and molten glass. A precise control of overflow temperature and temperature distribution of <b>isopipe</b> was needed for maintaining a stable flow and uniform thickness...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} model for simulation of molten glass flow with semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) and Volume of fluid (VOF) method during the overflow fusion process {{was carried out}} by using FLUENT software. The effect of the geometry parameters of the <b>isopipe</b> and flow rate of molten glass on the flow patterns during overflow was investigated. The results showed that the overflow trough depth only had an effect on the flow rate distribution of glass melt around the inlet point. The tilt angle {{at the top of the}} trough had a significant effect on flow rate distribution along the length of the trough, and the desired mass distribution was achieved at the tilt angle 4 °∼ 6 °. The flow rate had a large influence on the overflow of the molten glass, which had a directive significance to the overflow down draw sheet manufacturing process...|$|E
