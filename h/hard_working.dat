5|$|Brussels {{also has}} better {{transport}} links than Strasbourg, with lower pay for civil servants which reduce costs. Some commentators further underline that night-life in Strasbourg is comparatively lacklustre and that MEPs who'd wish to relax {{after a long}} and <b>hard</b> <b>working</b> day aren't offered many opportunities to do so. The position of Strasbourg suffered a minor blow in 2006, when allegations surfaced over charges {{by the city of}} Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament was renting. The controversy died down when the European Parliament decided to officially buy the buildings on 24 October 2006.|$|E

25|$|The American Dream is {{the belief}} that through hard work and determination, any United States {{immigrant}} can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice. According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, <b>hard</b> <b>working,</b> and inventive country, but the belief that anybody could get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard. This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.|$|E
25|$|He was an Indian {{with a white}} man's {{spirit of}} hatred and revenge {{for those who had}} wronged him and his.

And these, his conquerors, were marked in their dealings with his people by selfishness, falsehood and treachery.

What wonder that a fiery rage still burned within his breast and that he should seek every opportunity of obtaining vengeance upon his natural enemies.|$|E

25|$|Despite a {{rough terrain}} and a harsh climate, Sonora, {{like the rest}} of the {{northern}} Mexico, is rich in mineral resources. This has led to a history of self-reliance, and many see themselves as the heirs to a pioneering tradition. A large part of this is linked to the vaquero or cowboy tradition, as much of the state’s economy has traditionally been linked to livestock. Sonorans and other norteños (northerners) have a reputation for being <b>hard</b> <b>working</b> and frugal, and being more individualistic and straightforward than other Mexicans. Although most people in the state are employed in industry and tourism, the trappings of the cowboy, jeans, cowboy hats and pickup trucks, are still very popular.|$|E
