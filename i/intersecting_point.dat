500|$|Pinhole camera: The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{observed}} that the spaces between the leaves of trees acted as tiny pinholes which cast {{the image of a}} partial solar eclipse onto the ground. He also used a metal plate with a small pinhole to project an image of a solar eclipse onto the ground. The ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (c. 470 BC– c. 391 BC)—founder of Mohism during the establishment of the Hundred Schools of Thought—lived just before the time of Aristotle and it was in his Mojing (perhaps compiled by his disciples) that a pinhole camera was described. The Mojing stated that the [...] "collecting place" [...] (pinhole) was an empty hole [...] "like the sun and moon depicted on the imperial flags," [...] where an image could be inverted at an <b>intersecting</b> <b>point</b> which [...] "affects the size of the image." [...] The Mojing seems to be in line with the Epicurean theory of light traveling into the eye (and not vice versa like in Pythagoreanism), since the Mojing states that the reflected light shining forth from an [...] "illuminated person" [...] becomes inverted when passing through the pinhole, i.e. [...] "The bottom part of the man becomes the top part (of the image) and the top part of the man becomes the bottom part (of the image)." [...] In his Book of Optics (1021), Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) wrote of his experimentation with camera obscura, which was followed by Shen Kuo (1031–1095), the latter who alluded that the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Duan Chengshi (died 863)—in his Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang—described inverted images of Chinese pagodas.|$|E

They occupied the fifth floor of the Gotham Theatre on West Forty-second Street. As there was no lift in the building except the small private one used by the two members of the firm, Jill walked up the stairs, and found signs of a thriving business beginning to present themselves as early as the third floor, where half a dozen patient persons of either sex had draped themselves like roosting fowls upon the banisters. There were more on the fourth floor, and the landing of the fifth, which served the firm as a waiting-room, was quite full. It is the custom of New York theatrical managers--the lowest order of intelligence, {{with the possible exception of}} the limax maximus or garden slug, known to science--to omit from their calculations the fact that they are likely every day to receive a large number of visitors, whom they will be obliged to keep waiting; and that these people will require somewhere to wait.

There are many security checking parameters like pin code, password, finger print checking but signature recognition is the most popular because it is quite accurate and cost efficient too.

The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes.
