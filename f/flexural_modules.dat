40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) A {{provisional}} restoration must fulfill biologic, mechanical, and esthetic requirements. These prostheses {{should provide}} comfort, pulp protection, positional stability, occlusal function, hygiene access, esthetics, strength and retention. Methyl-methacrylate acrylic has assumed many appli¬cations {{in the field}} of restorative dentistry. However, the material still has deficiencies, such as polymerization shrinkage, pulpal damage associated with exothermic polymerization and susceptibility to fracture. Bis-GMA composites, Bis-acryl composites and visible light-cured urethane dimethacrylate resins have been developed to address these issues. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the mechanical properties of provisional restorations made from composite resins (Protemp Plus, Luxatemp Solar, Radica, Protemp Crown) to those made of the traditional methacrylate resins (Jet, Snap, High Impact). Six groups of samples, two groups from methacrylate and four groups from composite based materials, were fabricated. Samples from each group were evaluated for microhardness (n= 10), flexural strength and flexural modulus (n= 20) according to ISO 4049, and fracture toughness (n= 20) according to ISO 13586. From each of the six groups, ten samples were tested for flexural strength, flexural modulus and fracture toughness and 5 samples were tested for microhardness. These tests were done after storing at 37 °C in a distilled water solution for 7 days followed by thermal cycling (2500 cycles, 5 - 55 °C, 45 s. dwell). Identical sets of samples from each group were used as controls; these were tested after storing for 24 hours in dry conditions. The results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with material type and aging conditions as the two main variables. Significance level was set at p= 0. 05. For flexural strength and <b>flexural</b> <b>modules,</b> the higher values were obtained for Radica. Protemp plus (7 days) and Radica (24 h) had the highest fracture toughness value. Protemp crown showed the highest surface hardness. The mechanical properties of composite resin were superior...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} is to elaborate a method for determining the flexural modulus of a polymer material based on the solution of compression and tension problems by using the finite-element method in the finite element program ANSYS. To solve the nonlinear problem by the finite-element method, a macros-program was elaborated, which specifies the geometry, physical law, and properties of the material, boundary conditions, loading, division into finite elements, and the step scheme of the solution. The deformation of a thin polymer shell is characterized by great displacements and relatively low elastic deformations in a large range of movement of parallel planes. The solution obtained by finite element method allows making the universal loading diagram in dimensionless coordinates in the given range of thicknesses and elastic module. Equation of the universal loading diagram allows us to solve the inverse problem of determination of the elastic modulus according to experimental points on the loading diagram. The method of determination of the flexural modulus of thin polymer shells discussed above was successfully approved on a series of various kinds of thin PVC specimens by tension test. Than specimens was tested for vibration (modal) test in order to measure the eigenfrequencies and the corresponding modes. The <b>flexural</b> <b>modules</b> received by compressing a circular cylindrical were verified by comparing the experimentally measured eigenfrequencies with numerical results from ANSYS program. The method enables the use of a “single specimen principle”. For example, changes in the modulus caused by different processes affecting the structure and properties of polymer material, for example, different kinds of aging of polymer materials, absorption of liquids (water) and vapors by a certain material, and so on, can be studied on a solitary [on one and the same] specimen...|$|E
40|$|In sensor and {{actuator}} technology plane piezoelectric modules are {{suited for}} an active mechanical control of thin-walled structure components e. g. bender (and flexural actuators respectively) and vibration absorber. The present work concentrates on methodical examination of electromechanical properties of <b>flexural</b> actuator <b>modules.</b> Therefore screen printed PZT thick-film samples are produced on selected substrates used in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems - MEMS (e. g. aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3), Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics (LTCC) - plumbiferous/lead free, silicon (Si) - with thin films as diffusion barrier) and on steel with constant sinter conditions. The used thick-film paste {{is a special}} development of Fraunhofer IKTS. To compare {{the properties of the}} <b>flexural</b> actuator <b>modules,</b> measurements for determination dielectric constants Epsilon (f = 1 kHz) are accomplished before and after poling. The remanent polarisation Pr is measured at frequency f = 50 Hz and electric field strength of E = 2 and 3 kV/mm respectively. Mechanical parameters are presented by measurements of deflection and blocking force of <b>flexural</b> actuator <b>modules.</b> From a multiplicity of tested substrate materials Al 2 O 3 (99, 6 %), LTCC DuPont 951 and Heraeus "HeraLock® Tape - HL 2000 " and Si with SiO 2 - and ZrO 2 -thin films were exposed as suitable...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi analisar a viabilidade técnica do uso de resíduo {{industrial}} composto de resina fenólica, lignocelulose, carbonato de cálcio, talco, mica e negro de fumo como carga para o polipropileno (PP). Compósitos de PP com 10, 15 e 20 % em massa do resíduo foram processados em extrusora de rosca dupla e moldados por injeção. Os compósitos moldados foram caracterizados por microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV), análises térmicas (DSC e TGA), ensaios mecânicos (tração, flexão e impacto) e ensaio termo-mecânico (HDT). Os compósitos moldados apresentaram partículas do resíduo com tamanhos inferiores a 500 µm dispersas na matriz de polipropileno. As partículas do resíduo atuaram como agentes de nucleação da cristalização do PP. Os compósitos apresentaram maior resistência à degradação térmica, balanço de rigidez e resistência com aumento do módulo sob flexão e diminuição da resistência à tração, manutenção da resistência ao impacto sob entalhe, e aumento da temperatura de distorção ao calor (HDT). O desempenho dos compósitos demonstrou que o resíduo industrial de resina fenólica pode ser empregado como carga funcional para o PP. Além disso, os compósitos desenvolvidos representam uma alternativa para a reciclagem do resíduo industrial de resina fenólica. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the technical feasibility of using industrial waste composed of phenolic resin, lignocellulose, calcium carbonate, talc, mica and carbon black as filler for polypropylene (PP). Composites of PP with 10, 15 and 20 wt% of the waste were processed in a twin-screw extruder followed by injection molding. Molded composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analyses (DSC and TGA), mechanical tests (tensile, flexural and impact) and thermo-mechanical test (HDT). The composites showed residue particles with sizes less than 500 µm dispersed in the PP matrix. The residue particles acted as nucleating agents for PP crystallization. The composites showed greater thermal degradation resistance as compared to PP. The composites showed a balance of stiffness and mechanical strength with increase of the <b>flexural</b> <b>module</b> and decrease of the tensile strength. The notched impact strength was not altered and the heat distortion temperature (HDT) of the composites was increased as compared to PP. The performance of the composites developed here showed that the industrial waste based on phenolic resin can be used as functional filler for PP. Furthermore, these composites are an alternative for the recycling of the phenolic resin industrial waste...|$|R
