500|$|Crossing the Sahara was {{considered}} particularly perilous {{at the time}} because of guerilla forces hiding in the mountains. The medicines carried by the truck would have been valuable loot for these groups, {{and for the first}} part of the desert the expedition was accompanied by the French Foreign Legion. The instruction the men received was [...] "No stops, drive for your lives, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> flat tire." [...] The crossing passed without violent incidents, however, and greater problems were presented by the elements. There were no roads in the desert, and the truck was heavily loaded and not especially adapted to the conditions. Several times it got stuck in the desert sand; the crew had to place steel plates underneath for traction and spend hours digging out the sand from under the wheels. This took a great toll on the men, who had a limited supply of water, in temperatures approaching 50°C. The crew spent most nights in oases along the way, but on occasion also slept in sleeping bags in the sand.|$|E
500|$|According to Variety magazine, {{the script}} for Hannibal was: [...] "quite {{faithful}} to the Harris blueprint; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters, most notably Mason Verger's muscle-bound macho sister Margot, {{as well as the}} considerable fascinating academic detail, but will basically feel the book has been respected (yes, even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact, with the only surprise twists saved for its wake)." [...] Time Out noted: [...] "The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time's left for analysis or characterization." [...] Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: [...] "I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren't so vital." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Cocker contributed Born to Cry, (originally a Pulp song {{released}} on the Notting Hill soundtrack CD – though not {{featured in the}} film and co-written by Richard Hawley) to Tony Christie's album of songs by Sheffield-based songwriters, Made in Sheffield. Around 2008, Cocker also participated in a project that tackled the question, [...] "What is Music?", designed {{to enter into the}} debate over the future of the music industry. Cocker asked: [...] "Does this mean that music can now go back to being an art form again? Also, what happens <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> band to rehearse in an art gallery instead of a rehearsal space?" [...] Consequently, Cocker and his band installed themselves in an art gallery in Paris, France for five days. Each day, Cocker and his musicians performed a variety of different tasks. These included sound-tracking a relaxation class, inviting local musicians to join them in a jam and arranging activities with local school-children. Films of the exhibition remain accessible online in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013 {{a former}} News Editor at Al Jazeera, who was from Syria, {{and had been}} at Al Jazeera for [...] "nearly a decade" [...] was fired without cause given, but in an {{interview}} stated their belief that it was linked to his/her resistance of ongoing strong pressure to conform to biased coverage of the Syrian civil war. The former Editor stated that the Muslim Brotherhood was [...] "controlling the Syrian file at Al-Jazeera" [...] with both organizations biasing news coverage in favour of the Brotherhood ousting the Syrian government of Assad by force and warning the then-editor [...] "the majority [...] is with the Muslim Brotherhood and [...] is within our grasp" [...] so [...] "thank your god <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> pardon when we become the government." [...] The source named the names of several other former employees who resigned in protest, including director of the Berlin bureau Aktham Sleiman, a Syrian, [...] "who was, at the beginning, with the [...] opposition" [...] but resisted what the interviewee terms the [...] "lies and despicable [...] sectarianism" [...] and concluded that [...] "Al-Jazeera has lied and is still lying" [...] about Syria and in favour of armed overthrow and of the Muslim Brotherhood.|$|E
