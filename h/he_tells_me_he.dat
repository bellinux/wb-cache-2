2500|$|The wider U.S. {{economy was}} soon {{hit by the}} effects of the Trent crisis. On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock {{exchange}} fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent. On December 20, Salmon P. Chase's broker refused to sell some of the secretary's holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community [...] "trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough". A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25-15 to suspend specie payments. Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin. This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers. Though the crisis was resolved soon afterwards, these difficulties were not: on January 10, Lincoln asked Quartermaster General Meigs [...] "General, what shall I do? The people are impatient; Chase has no money, and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> can raise no more; the General of the Armies has typhoid fever. The bottom is out of the tub. What shall I do?" [...] The Treasury was eventually forced to issue fiat money in the form of [...] "greenbacks" [...] to meet its obligations.|$|E
60|$|As far as {{any idea}} of doing the delicately nurtured a bit of good went, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> was {{prepared}} to stand underneath and catch them in blankets, but no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did that}} before I left the homestead. There's {{nobody in the}} picture like the fellow who drove with Mr. Grant, and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> saw nobody else. Now I must be getting on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then <b>he</b> asks <b>me</b> who I {{was working}} for, and I shows him Rancho Chiquito, two miles away, {{in the shadow}} of a low hill, and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> a deputy sheriff.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really believe}} there's {{a lot of}} good in him," [...] he stammered; [...] "but, of course, I know very little, and from what <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> had a very curious life. I shouldn't like--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marshall Elliott!" [...] cried Anne. [...] "Oh, Captain Jim--it wasn't--yes, it WAS his voice--oh, Captain Jim, I didn't know him--and I {{was quite}} {{insulting}} to him! WHY didn't <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me?</b> <b>He</b> {{must have seen}} I didn't know him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Colonel Keith bought that, {{and some}} more of the solid books. My dear, {{he is going to}} settle here; <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> has {{actually}} bought that house he and his brother are in." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir ANTHONY Here's {{a pretty}} fellow; I catch him {{going to cut}} a man's throat, and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> serves his majesty!--Zounds! sirrah, then how durst you draw the king's sword against one of his subjects? ...|$|E
60|$|CONJURER. Yes. That was {{his first}} impression. He is an {{intimate}} friend of mine. I have known him all my life. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> has since discovered {{she is not a}} child. She does not fulfil the definition.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{so sorry}} for his situation. I wish I could help it in some way. <b>He</b> {{interests}} <b>me</b> so much." [...] She gave a sweet-sounding sigh. [...] "I wish I could have known him sooner--and better. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> but the shadow of what he used to be." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> lazy, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> slow,::Tell <b>me</b> I'm crazy (maybe I know) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I jump in a {{taxi and}} I say, Do you know of a gentleman called Lord Kitchener? I figure he popular and a taxi driver should know. <b>He</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> dead long time ago. Not that one (I said). This one is a calypsonian from the West Indies, Trinidad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And that," [...] said Edna, [...] "is all of {{the letter}} that I need read, except that <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> expects to write again before he starts, and that his address after he sails will be Wraxton, Fuguet & Co., American bankers in Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Job {{is feeling}} very well {{these days and}} is {{building}} a [...] new wing to the old house--going {{to put in a}} library of good [...] books <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> is as dear an old chap now as anybody [...] would want for an uncle.|$|E
6000|$|... "So Wainwright boils {{some more}} with indignation at the {{insensibility}} {{of people who}} are not corpulent to fill public positions; and then <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> is going out to the president's summer palace, which is four miles from Aguas Frescas, to instruct him in the art of running steam-heated republics.|$|E
6000|$|... "And that {{therefore}} <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> everything. <b>He</b> told <b>me</b> {{what took place}} in the wood,--and because of that he has gone away." ...|$|R
5000|$|Graham Bradley (2nd): [...] "He {{gave me a}} great ride. His {{ears are}} like {{antennae}} - <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> when <b>he</b> wants to be short and {{when he wants to}} be long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No, it hasn’t been as {{yet what}} your mother supposed! The man Longstraw {{wants to marry}} her and has made a formal proposal. I met him {{half an hour ago}} in Madison Avenue, and <b>he</b> asked <b>me</b> to come with him into the Columbia Club. There, in the billiard-room, which to-day is empty, he opened himself—thinking evidently that in laying the matter before <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was {{behaving}} with extraordinary propriety. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he’s</b> dying of love and that she’s perfectly willing to go and live in Arizona.” ...|$|R
6000|$|LAWSON. Ye see, it's this way. I had a crack wi' the laddie Leslie, inter pocula (he took a stirrup-cup wi' me), and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> has askit Mary, {{and she was}} {{to speak}} to ye hersel'. O, ye needna look sae gash. Did she speak? and what'll you have said to her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't {{be called}} upon to do that," [...] she said smiling; [...] "for this letter that I have just opened is from him, and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> is coming here at once to see you, for he thinks it would be too hard to ask me to spare you again so soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't dislike him, certainly, as you do. But how can I {{love him}} when <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> {{wants me to}} give up everything, all our work, our faith, our future, never to give another address, to open my lips in public? How can I consent to that?" [...] Verena went on, smiling strangely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> {{heard you}} <b>telling</b> {{a story in}} the {{twilight}} in the form-room, in a whisper. And Orrin said, just as he opened the door, 'Shut up, Beetle; it's too beastly.' Now then?" ...|$|R
60|$|I had lately the honour of {{a letter}} from Dr. Moore, where <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> has sent <b>me</b> some books; they are not yet come to hand, but I hear {{they are on the}} way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was only}} that I thought of Caldigate in prison that I didn't do it. Because I have been roaming about the world, not always quite as well off as himself, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> doesn't believe my word.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The Major {{answered}} with a groan, but added, [...] "And yet, even now, stained as <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> is, and cut off in the flower of his age, I thank my God and his Saviour, and after Him, you and yours, that I am happier about him than I have been these eight and twenty years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{know you}} not," [...] cried the shipmaster, [...] "that this {{physician}} here--Chillingworth he calls himself--is minded to try my cabin-fare with you? Ay, ay, {{you must have}} known it; for <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> is of your party, and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke of--he that is in peril from these sour old Puritan rulers." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton's {{face grew}} a trifle graver. [...] "He {{and more of}} the boys are sitting on the claim, and there's another crowd camped down with stakes ready right in front of him. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> finds it hard to keep his hands off them, and I'd have gone up only that I'm waiting for the Crown folks' decision." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My uncle knew him. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> {{asked him}} here to-night. I wish {{that he had}} come. And yet, I am not sure. Some of his {{writings}} I have hated. He, too, is a theorist, isn't he? I wonder--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down in Northamptonshire, {{staying at}} some inn from whence <b>he</b> hunts. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> is quite alone,--that he never dines out, never has any one to dine with him, that he hunts {{five or six}} days a week,--and reads at night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ye-es,' he answered, {{deliberately}} {{looking at}} me; {{and then a}} bright idea seemed to strike him - 'or <b>he</b> only <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> has. Perhaps {{that may be a}} new way of evading the matter. By Jupiter, I never thought of that!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, sir, I'm afraid not,' said Harry. 'I saw Captain Gordon at Portsmouth this morning, and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> {{is to go}} out in the Clio to the Pacific station, {{and would}} apply for me as his first lieutenant, if I liked to look up the islands again. So, if you have any {{commissions}} for Norman, I'm your man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Heart and soul," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Fyshe. [...] "He's very bitter {{over the}} way these rascals have been plundering the city on its coal supply. He says that {{the city has been}} buying coal wholesale at the pit mouth at three fifty--utterly worthless stuff, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> has heard it said that everyone of these scoundrels has been paid from twenty-five to fifty dollars a winter to connive at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A most {{remarkable}} thing, Bertie! I {{have just been}} speaking with Mr. Riggs on the telephone, and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> received my manuscript by the first post this morning. I cannot imagine what can have caused the delay. Our postal facilities are extremely inadequate in the rural districts. I shall write to headquarters about it. It is insufferable if valuable parcels are to be delayed in this fashion." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [coming to {{the back}} of the garden seat, into the light, with Mangan]. I think I shall. <b>He</b> keeps <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> has a presentiment that he is going to die. I never met a man so greedy for sympathy.|$|R
60|$|DORA. No; I am {{sure that}} when we are married he will be willing that you and Father should live with us; for, indeed, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> met you once in the old times, and was much taken with you, my dear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope your}} Ladyship is well to-day. I had {{a letter from}} Count Caumont this morning. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> has got the prettiest poodle from Paris that you can {{possibly}} conceive! waltzes like an angel, and acts proverbs on its hind feet." ...|$|R
