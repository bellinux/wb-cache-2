40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{validate}} {{a simplified}} estimate of <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> (SPP) against true (invasively measured) <b>peak</b> <b>instantaneous</b> <b>power</b> (TPP), {{to assess the}} feasibility of measuring SPP during exercise and to correlate this with functional capacity. DESIGN: Development of a simplified method of measurement and observational study. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre for cardiothoracic disease. SUBJECTS: For validation of SPP with TPP, seven normal dogs and four dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied. To assess feasibility and clinical significance in humans, 40 subjects were studied (26 patients; 14 normal controls). METHODS: In the animal validation study, TPP was derived from ascending aortic pressure and flow probe, and from Doppler measurements of flow. SPP, calculated using the different flow measures, was compared with <b>peak</b> <b>instantaneous</b> <b>power</b> under different loading conditions. For the assessment in humans, SPP was measured at rest and during maximum exercise. Peak aortic flow was measured with transthoracic continuous wave Doppler, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were derived from brachial sphygmomanometry. The difference between exercise and rest simplified <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> (Delta SPP) was compared with maximum oxygen uptake (VO(2) max), measured from expired gas analysis. RESULTS: SPP estimates using peak flow measures correlated well with true <b>peak</b> <b>instantaneous</b> <b>power</b> (r = 0. 89 to 0. 97), despite marked changes in systemic pressure and flow induced by manipulation of loading conditions. In the human study, VO(2) max correlated with Delta SPP (r = 0. 78) better than Delta ejection fraction (r = 0. 18) and Delta rate-pressure product (r = 0. 59). CONCLUSIONS: The simple product of mean arterial pressure and peak aortic flow (simplified <b>peak</b> <b>power,</b> SPP) correlates with <b>peak</b> <b>instantaneous</b> <b>power</b> over a range of loading conditions in dogs. In humans, it can be estimated during exercise echocardiography, and correlates with maximum oxygen uptake better than ejection fraction or rate-pressure product...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{there is}} {{considerable}} R&D activity {{in the field of}} fuel cell (FC) technology as an efficient and clean power source for both stationary and transport applications. This paper describes the development of a fuel cell/battery hybrid power source for a stationary domestic power application, details the control systems underpinning this system and describes some preliminary experimental results. The authors believe that the fuel cell/battery hybrid power system is the most cost-effective solution for domestic power applications. This recognizes that a typical domestic power profile can have a peak to average power ratio of between around 9 - 15, and hence a fuel cell only system would significantly over-rate the fuel cell to satisfy peak power and consequently suffer from poor utilisation.

The sample consisted of 12 volunteer college and high school students, {{ranging in age from}} 16 to 33 years (Male = 9, Female = 3) who evidenced the spastic condition in the lower extremeties. Subjects were assigned to either the Experimental Group, receiving isokinetic exercise, or a Control Group, receiving no exercise. The subjects were tested pretraining and post training in the non-dominant limb for knee extensor torque at six angular velocities, utilizing an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex II, Lumex, Inc., Bay Shore, New York). The Experimental Group trained three times per week for a period of six weeks. The exercise bout consisted of four sets of maximal knee extensions for a period of 20 seconds each. Both the right and left limbs were exercised. The Control Group abstained from any exercise of the knee extensors for the six week period. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was accepted as the statistical design for the study in order to adjust for significant pretest scores between the Experimental and Control Groups. The data indicated a final adjusted mean difference in favor of the Experimental Group, significant at the. 01 level of confidence. This represented a mean strength increase of 32 percent for the Experimental Group. Within the limitations to the present study, the null hypothesis regarding the effects of velocity-specific, isokinetic training was rejected.

40|$|Frogs' {{outstanding}} jumping ability {{has been}} associated with a high power output from the leg extensor muscles. Two main theories have emerged to explain the high power output of the frog leg extensor muscles, either (i) the contractile conditions of all leg extensor muscles are optimized in terms of muscle length and speed of shortening, or (ii) maximal power is achieved through a dynamic catch mechanism that uncouples fibre shortening from the corresponding muscle-tendon unit shortening. As in vivo instantaneous power generation in frog hind limb muscles during jumping has never been measured directly, it is hard to distinguish between the two theories. In this study, we determined the instantaneous variable power output of the plantaris longus (PL) of Lithobates pipiens (also known as Rana pipiens), by directly measuring the in vivo force, length change, and speed of muscle and fibre shortening in near maximal jumps. Fifteen near maximal jumps (> 50 cm in horizontal distance) were analyzed. High <b>instantaneous</b> <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> in PL (536 ± 47 W/kg) was achieved by optimizing the contractile conditions in terms of the force-length but not the force-velocity relationship, and by a dynamic catch mechanism that decouples fascicle shortening from muscle-tendon unit shortening. We also found that the extra-muscular free tendon likely amplifies the peak power output of the PL by modulating fascicle shortening length and shortening velocity for optimum power output, but not by releasing stored energy through recoiling as the tendon only started recoiling after peak PL power had been achieved...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents experimental studies of various non-thermal atmospheric pressure gas discharges generated using short pulsed excitation {{as an alternative to}} widely used sinusoidal excitation. Several pulse generators are detailed that provide high voltage pulses ranging from hundreds of microseconds to less than ten nanoseconds in duration. A key enabler to the generation of a stable discharge is a suitably high repetition rate; this prerequisite precludes many conventional pulsed power technologies. Fortunately, recent advances in semiconductor technology have made it possible to construct solid state switches capable of producing high voltage pulses with repetition rates of many kilohertz. Pulsed excitation introduces many opportunities to tailor the applied voltage and consequently enhance the discharge which are not possible with sinusoidal excitation sources. Through detailed electrical and optical analysis it is shown that pulsed excitation is not only more energy efficient than a comparable sinusoidal source but produces a higher flux of excited species that are essential in many applications. When pulse widths are reduced to a sub-microsecond timescale a novel barrier-free mode of operation is observed. It is shown that diffuse large area plasmas are easily produced at kilohertz repetition rates without the usually indispensable dielectric barriers. Experimental results show that a short pulse width prevents the onset of the undesirable glow-to-arc transition thus introducing an added degree of stability. A further benefit of pulsed excitation is the ability to produce gas discharges with a high <b>instantaneous</b> <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> yet low average power consumption, resulting in a high density plasma that exhibits roomtemperature characteristics. Finally, as an acid test to highlight the many benefits of pulsed excitation several real-world applications are considered. It is shown that in all cases pulsed gas discharges provide real benefits compared to their sinusoidal counterparts...|$|E

We used an in situ muscle-tendon preparation to examine the mechanical function of tendons during lengthening contractions, when muscles absorb energy. Force, length, and power were measured in the lateral gastrocnemius muscle of wild turkeys. Sonomicrometry {{was used to measure}} muscle fascicle length independently from muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length, as measured by a muscle lever system (servomotor). A series of ramp stretches of varying velocities was applied to the MTU in fully activated muscles. Fascicle length changes were decoupled from length changes imposed on the MTU by the servomotor. Under most conditions, muscle fascicles shortened on average, while the MTU lengthened. Energy input to the MTU during the fastest lengthenings was − 54. 4 J/kg, while estimated work input to the muscle fascicles during this period was only − 11. 24 J/kg. This discrepancy indicates that energy was first absorbed by elastic elements, then released to do work on muscle fascicles after the lengthening phase of the contraction. The temporary storage of energy by elastic elements also resulted in a significant attenuation of power input to the muscle fascicles. At the fastest lengthening rates, <b>peak</b> <b>instantaneous</b> <b>power</b> input to the MTU reached − 2, 143. 9 W/kg, while <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> input to the fascicles was only − 557. 6 W/kg.

40|$|Scan circuit {{generally}} causes excessive switching activity {{compared to}} normal circuit operation. The higher switching activity in turn causes higher <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> supply current which results into supply voltage droop and eventually yield loss. This paper proposes an efficient methodology for test vector re-ordering to achieve minimum <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> {{supported by the}} given test vector set. The proposed methodology also minimizes average power under the minimum <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> constraint. A methodology to further reduce the <b>peak</b> <b>power,</b> below the minimum supported <b>peak</b> <b>power,</b> by inclusion of minimum additional vectors is also discussed. The paper defines the lower bound on <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> for a given test set. The results on several benchmarks shows that it can reduce <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> by up to 27 %...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{forest roads}} {{interact}} with hillslope hydrology by intercepting and/or rerouting storm runoff will better enable land managers to reduce erosion related to forest roads. Watershed scale {{knowledge of how}} culvert runoff response varies across the landscape would provide valuable information to those individuals designing and maintaining forest road systems. In order {{to better understand the}} hydrologic interactions of the hillslope and the road, this study focused on all cross drain culverts in a 3 rd order watershed of Oak Creek located in the McDonald/Dunn Research Forest 3 miles west of Corvallis Oregon. Stage recorders measured runoff response for winter months from October to March 2001 to 2002 and data for the January 25, 2002 storm event were analyzed in detail. <b>Instantaneous</b> <b>peak</b> discharge was measured at all culverts with either a crest gauge or a capacitance rod. Those culverts with a capacitance rod measured water height data every 10 minutes and provided a runoff response hydrograph. Fifty-eight of 74 gauged road segments were used in the analysis. Measurable <b>instantaneous</b> <b>peak</b> discharge was received from all 58 cross drain culverts and total runoff volumes were measured at 40 of the road segments. Frequency distributions of the runoff response for both <b>instantaneous</b> <b>peak</b> discharge and total runoff volume follow a right skew distribution. This indicates {{that a majority of the}} culverts measured had lower amounts of runoff than the mean and that only a small fraction of the culverts had a large runoff response. Geographic Information System (GIS) coverage for McDonald/Dunn Forest was used to calculate road and hillslope characteristics. The correlation of <b>instantaneous</b> <b>peak</b> discharge for the cross drain culverts to road and hillslope characteristics indicates significant relationship at the 99...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the design of {{transmitting}} coils in weakly coupled magnetic induction communication systems. We propose several optimization methods that reduce the active, reactive and apparent power consumption of the coil. These problems are formulated as minimization problems, in which the power consumed by the transmitting coil is minimized, under the constraint of providing a required magnetic field at the receiver location. We develop efficient numeric and analytic methods to solve the resulting problems, which are of high dimension, and in certain cases non-convex. For the objective of minimal reactive power an analytic solution for the optimal current distribution in flat disc transmitting coils is provided. This problem is extended to general three-dimensional coils, for which we develop an expression for the optimal current distribution. Considering the objective of minimal apparent power, a method is developed to reduce the computational complexity of the problem by transforming it to an equivalent problem of lower dimension, allowing a quick and accurate numeric solution. These results are verified experimentally by testing a number of coil geometries. The results obtained allow reduced power consumption and increased performances in magnetic induction communication systems. Specifically, for wideband systems, an optimal design of the transmitter coil reduces the <b>peak</b> <b>instantaneous</b> <b>power</b> provided by the transmitter circuitry, and thus reduces its size, complexity and cost...|$|R
40|$|<b>Peak</b> <b>power</b> {{reduction}} in space-time coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is a challenging task. Most {{of the current}} <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> reduction schemes reduce the <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> by manipulating the signal at the final IDFT process. However, {{in the case of}} space-time coded OFDM, any processing at this stage would violate the space-time code structure, making its detection at the receiver impossible. The paper shows that selected mapping (SLM) reduces the <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> of space-time coded OFDM signals without violating the space-time code. Reduced <b>peak</b> <b>power</b> of the OFDM signal relaxes the strict dynamic range requirements of the transmitter...|$|R
