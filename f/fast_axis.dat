25|$|Using a thin slab of that {{material}} at normal incidence, one would implement a waveplate. In this case there is essentially no spatial {{separation between the}} polarizations, however the phase of the wave in the parallel polarization (the slow ray) will be retarded {{with respect to the}} perpendicular polarization. These directions are thus known as the slow axis and <b>fast</b> <b>axis</b> of the waveplate.|$|E
25|$|In the {{arrangement}} above, the transmission {{axis of the}} linear polarizer is at a positive 45° angle relative to the right horizontal and is represented with an orange line. The quarter-wave plate has a horizontal slow axis and a vertical <b>fast</b> <b>axis</b> and they are also represented using orange lines. In this instance the unpolarized light entering the linear polarizer is displayed as a single wave whose amplitude and angle of linear polarization are suddenly changing.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{birefringence}} Δn {{may vary}} slightly due to dispersion, this is negligible {{compared to the}} variation in phase difference according to the wavelength of the light due to the fixed path difference (λ0 in the denominator in the above equation). Waveplates are thus manufactured {{to work for a}} particular range of wavelengths. The phase variation can be minimized by stacking two waveplates that differ by a tiny amount in thickness back-to-back, with the slow axis of one along the <b>fast</b> <b>axis</b> of the other. With this configuration, the relative phase imparted can be, for the case of a quarter-wave plate, one-fourth a wavelength rather than three-fourths or one-fourth plus an integer. This is called a zero-order waveplate.|$|E

50|$|In {{comparison}} with Tiger 1, Challenger had sufficient gun performance against its intended targets, {{a much higher}} top speed and cross country mobility, but substantially less armour. This was driven by doctrine. Challenger {{was designed as a}} fast cruiser tank for British crews trained to fire on the move, and much of its protection was expected to come from its ability to move <b>faster</b> than <b>Axis</b> crews were able to effectively sight. This rendered it vulnerable to perforation or penetration by enemy rounds when hit.|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that <b>fast</b> phase <b>axis</b> orientation and primary eye position in rhesus monkeys are dynamically controlled by otolith signals during head rotations that involve a reorientation {{of the head}} relative to gravity. Because of the inherent ambiguity associated with primary otolith afferent coding of linear accelerations during head translation and tilts, a similar organization might also underlie the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) during translation. The ability of the oculomotor system to correctly distinguish translational accelerations from gravity in the dynamic control of primary eye position has been investigated here by comparing the eye movements elicited by sinusoidal lateral and fore-aft oscillations (0. 5 Hz +/- 40 cm, equivalent to +/- 0. 4 g) with those during yaw rotations (180 degrees/s) about a vertically tilted axis (23. 6 degrees). We found a significant modulation of primary eye position {{as a function of}} linear acceleration (gravity) during rotation but not during lateral and fore-aft translation. This modulation was enhanced during the initial phase of rotation when there was concomitant semicircular canal input. These findings suggest that control of primary eye position and <b>fast</b> phase <b>axis</b> orientation in the VOR are based on central vestibular mechanisms that discriminate between gravity and translational head acceleration...|$|R
25|$|The {{polarization}} {{of the incoming}} photon (or beam) can be resolved as two polarizations on the x and y axis. If the input polarization {{is parallel to the}} fast or slow axis, then there is no {{polarization of}} the other axis, so the output polarization {{is the same as the}} input (only the phase more or less delayed). If the input polarization is 45° to the fast and slow axis, the polarization on those axes are equal. But the phase of the output of the slow axis will be delayed 90° with the output of the <b>fast</b> <b>axis.</b> If not the amplitude but both sinus values are displayed, then x and y combined will describe a circle. With other angles than 0° or 45° the values in fast and slow axis will differ and their resultant output will describe an ellipse.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{quarter-wave plate}} {{is made of}} a {{birefringent}} material, when in the wave plate, the light travels at different speeds depending on the direction of its electric field. This means that the horizontal component which is along the slow axis of the wave plate will travel at a slower speed than the component that is directed along the vertical <b>fast</b> <b>axis.</b> Initially the two components are in phase, but as the two components travel through the wave plate the horizontal component of the light drifts farther behind that of the vertical. By adjusting {{the thickness of the}} wave plate one can control how much the horizontal component is delayed relative to vertical component before the light leaves the wave plate and they begin again to travel at the same speed. When the light leaves the quarter-wave plate the rightward horizontal component will be exactly one quarter of a wavelength behind the vertical component making the light left-hand circularly polarized when viewed from the receiver.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveplate}} {{works by}} shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization {{components of the}} light wave. A typical waveplate is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with {{the orientation of the}} cut chosen so that the optic axis of the crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the ordinary axis, with index of refraction no, and the extraordinary axis, with index of refraction ne. The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the optic axis. The extraordinary axis is parallel to the optic axis. For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, polarization component along the ordinary axis travels through the crystal with a speed vo = c/no, while the polarization component along the extraordinary axis travels with a speed ve = c/ne. This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When ne< no, as in calcite, the extraordinary axis is called the <b>fast</b> <b>axis</b> and the ordinary axis is called the slow axis. For nenbsp&> no the situation is reversed.|$|E

Both polarization rotators have modular design, that is, they are comprised of {{an array of}} half-wave plates rotated to a given angle. We show that the broadband and ultra-broadband performance of the polarization rotators {{is due to the}} adiabatic nature of the light polarization evolution. In this paper we experimentally investigate the performance of broadband and ultra-broadband polarization rotators comprising of ten multi-order half-wave plates or ten commercial achromatic half-wave plates, respectively. The half-wave plates in the arrays are rotated gradually with respect to each other starting from an initial alignment between the <b>fast</b> polarization <b>axis</b> of the first one and the incoming linearly polarized light, to the desired polarization rotation angle...|$|R

Then the complex horizontal and vertical signals are reconstructed by demodulation. By the Fourier transformation of the two interferograms, the full range images are obtained. Herein, the typical linear phase modulation is modified to sinusoidal phase modulation, which improves the system tolerance of sample movements and avoids sensitivity fall-off along the transverse scan. Furthermore, the images are obtained through the recombination of the horizontal and vertical polarization beam components acquired by a single camera, which avoids the problems of synchronous control and alignments in the situation of two cameras...|$|R
