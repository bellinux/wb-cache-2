25|$|Hooping (also called hula hooping or hoop dance) {{generally}} {{refers to}} manipulation of and artistic movement or dancing with a hoop (or hoops). Hoops {{can be made}} of metal, wood, or plastic. Hooping combines technical moves and tricks with freestyle or technical dancing. Hooping can be practiced to or performed with music. In contrast to the classic toy hula hoop, modern hoopers use heavier and larger diameter hoops, and frequently rotate the hoop around {{parts of the body}} other than the waist, including the hips, chest, neck, shoulders, thighs, knees, arms, hands, thumbs, feet, and toes. The hoop can also be manipulated and rotated off the body as well. Modern hooping has been influenced by art forms such as rhythmic gymnastics, hip-hop, freestyle dance, <b>fire</b> <b>performance,</b> twirling, poi, and other dance and movement forms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, the <b>fire</b> {{resistance}} <b>performance</b> of high-strength concrete columns {{was evaluated}} {{to see the}} influence of lateral confinement reinforcement with wire ropes for improving ductility, fire resistance reinforcement with fiber cocktail and load ratio. For this, loaded fire test was conducted under ISO 834 standard fire condition. The axial ductility of the 60 MPa high-strength concrete column reinforced with pre-stressed wire ropes was improved and its <b>fire</b> resistance <b>performance</b> was also improved by 23 % compared with its counterpart without wire ropes. The appropriate load for the 60 MPa concrete column reinforced with wire ropes {{was found to be}} 70 % of design load. The <b>fire</b> resistance <b>performance</b> of the 100 MPa high-strength concrete column reinforced with pre-stressed wire ropes and fiber-cocktail was improved as much as 4 times compared with that reinforced with tie bars only. The appropriate load for the 100 MPa columns was found to be less than 70 % of design load in order for the columns to secure required <b>fire</b> resistance <b>performance...</b>|$|R

It was shown that 120 minutes of <b>fire</b> resistance <b>performance</b> can be secured regardless of the length of the structure and loading. Among these factors, the resisting capability changes more sensitively with the live load rather than the thickness of cover.

40|$|With {{increasing}} interest in epoxy-based carbon fiber composites for structural applications, {{it is important}} to improve the fire resistant properties of these materials. The <b>fire</b> resistant <b>performance</b> of these materials can be improved either by using high performance epoxy resin for manufacturing carbon fiber composite or by protecting the previously used epoxy-based composite with some fire resistant coating. In this context, work is carried out to evaluate the <b>fire</b> resistance <b>performance</b> of recently emerged high performance polybenzimidazole (PBI) when used as a coating material. Furthermore, the effect of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on fire resistant properties of inherently flame retardant PBI coating was studied. Thermogravimetric analysis of carbon/epoxy composite, unfilled PBI and nano-filled PBI shows that the carbon/epoxy composite maintained its thermal stability up to a temperature of 400 °C and afterwards showed a large decrease in mass, while both unfilled PBI and nano-filled PBI have shown thermal stability up to a temperature of 575 °C corresponding to only 11 % weight loss. Cone calorimeter test results show that unfilled PBI coating did not improve the <b>fire</b> retardant <b>performance</b> of carbon/epoxy composite. Conversely, nano-filled PBI coating has shown a significant improvement in <b>fire</b> retardant <b>performance</b> of the carbon/epoxy composite in terms of increased ignition time, reduced average and peak heat release rate and reduced smoke and carbon monoxide emission. These results indicate that addition of carbon nanofibers to inherently flame retardant coating can significantly be helpful for improving the <b>fire</b> resistance <b>performance</b> of composite materials even with low coating thickness. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
