50|$|As {{a result}} of the Senate Drugs in Sport Inquiry held 1989-1990, the Australian Government {{established}} the Australian Sports Drug Agency through the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. On 14 March 2006, Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) replaced the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Besides education and testing, ASADA was given increased powers to conduct investigations, present cases at sporting tribunals, recommend sanctions, and approve and monitor sporting organisations' anti-doping policies. In June 2013, Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment Bill 2013 provided ASADA with increased investigation powers. The Bill provided ASADA the right to compel those it believes that have knowledge about <b>doping</b> <b>practice</b> or a specific doping violation to attend an interview and to produce related documents. Failure to cooperate will lead to civil penalties.|$|E

50|$|In {{the fifteenth}} stage, the entire Belgian team was weak. Most Tour {{followers}} {{thought it was}} due to a <b>doping</b> <b>practice</b> that went wrong, but officially it was attributed to food poisoning. Adriaensens lost more than nine minutes, which made Wout Wagtmans the new leader. During the seventeenth stage, there was yet another escape, which included leader Wagtmans and Walkowiak, in fifth position in the general classification. The riders in second, third and fourth place were not in the escape, so Walkowiak moved up to the second place, more than four minutes behind Wagtmans. The eighteenth stage was the last chance for the climbing specialists to win back time, and so Gaul, Bahamontes and Ockers were aiming to win back time. Gaul escaped, and won the stage alone, with Ockers in second place. During the last climb, Bahamontes dismounted and threw his bike down the ravine, wanting to stop the race. The Spanish team was able to retrieve the bike, and convince Bahamontes to continue. Bahamontes finished the race in the group behind Ockers. The surprise of the day was that Walkowiak had been able to remain with Bahamontes, whereas Wagtmans (normally a decent climber) lost eight minutes more. Walkowiak took the first place in the general classification, with a margin of almost 4 minutes to Gilbert Bauvin.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{begins by}} {{presenting}} {{a brief history}} of doping in sport. It was found that throughout history athletes have been known to seek advantages over their competitors and this has included doping practices. Societal trends occurring during the mid-nineteenth century saw an increase in <b>doping</b> <b>practice</b> and drug-related deaths in sport. It was during this time that governments and sporting organisations began to see the need for comprehensive action against drugs in sport. During this period, the policy developments of governments and sporting organisations did not lead to reductions in doping in sport. This is underpinned by the rationales for anti-doping policy being {{out of touch with the}} nature of contemporary sport as well as the ambiguity that surrounds the focus of anti-doping policies...|$|E
40|$|In {{the second}} part of twentieth century anabolic-androgenic steroids were {{introduced}} into <b>doping</b> <b>practice</b> and received continuously increasing significance. In order to prove the usage of doping substances, the determination of steroid profile in the urine came into practice. Several factors may be responsible for alterations in the normal steroid profile for example age, sex and diet. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out, whether the psychological stress may cause modifications in the steroid profile and T/Et ratio. The effect of physical activity was also considered. The steroid profile was determined in the group of 34 students being in non-stress conditions and under stress immediately before an important university exam. The intensity of stress was rated by self-reported questionnaire. The GC/MS method was applied to determine the steroid profile in the urine samples. The results of the experiment have shown that psychological stress may cause significant changes in the steroid profile, especially in females. Physical activity, independently of stress significantly modified the steroid profile. In summary, observed changes in steroid profile suggest, that major fluctuations of T/Et and A/E ratios under the influence of stressogenic factors and physical activity are unlikely...|$|E
40|$|Background: Social science {{studies of}} doping {{practices}} in sport rely predominantly on self-reports. Studies of psychoactive drug use indicate that self-reporting is characterised by under-reporting. Likewise <b>doping</b> <b>practice</b> {{is likely to}} be equally under-reported, if not more so. This calls for more sophisticated methods for such reporting and for independent, objective validation of its results. The aims of this study were: i) to contrast self-reported doping use with objective results from chemical hair analysis and ii) to investigate the influence of the discrepancy on doping attitudes, social projection, descriptive norms and perceived pressure to use doping. Methodology/Principal Findings: A doping attitudes questionnaire was developed and combined with a response latencybased implicit association test and hair sample analysis for key doping substances in 14 athletes selected from a larger sample (N = 82) to form contrast comparison groups. Results indicate that patterns of group differences in social projection, explicit attitude about and perceived pressure to use doping, vary depending on whether the user and non-user groups are defined by self-report or objectively verified through hair analysis. Thus, self-confessed users scored higher on social projection, explicit attitude to doping and perceived pressure. However, when a doping substance was detected in the hair of an athlete who denied doping use, their self-report evidenced extreme social desirability (negative attitude, low projection and low perceived pressure) and contrasted sharply with a more positive estimate of their implicit dopin...|$|E

40|$|Anti-doping {{has long}} been premised on the myth of clean sport, a {{consistent}} vision that has survived changes {{in the social and}} cultural environment. This article starts with a discussion of the meaning of clean sport focusing on the gap between this idealisation and practice. It then traces the historical emergence of this myth, briefly explaining its cultural foundations, and its influence on in-competition drug testing development in the 1960 s. It will be argued that clean sport only made sense when the focus was on in-competition use of stimulants. The emergence of drugs such as steroids, used out of competitions, created a conflict between the reality of <b>doping</b> <b>practices</b> and the mythical past and future idealisation of sport as clean. Nonetheless anti-doping leaders maintained their public position that testing systems could defeat <b>doping</b> <b>practices.</b> Due to the continuity of ethical ideas, the construction of health fears, and public scandals, the World Anti-Doping Agency pressed on with, and was empowered by, the absolutist clean sport vision leading to the conceptually flawed, contradictory, draconian and problematic policy environment we face today...|$|R
40|$|Blood doping {{practices}} in sports {{have been around}} for at least half a century and will likely remain for several years to come. The main reason for the various forms of blood doping to be common is that they are easy to perform, and the effects on exercise performance are gigantic. Yet another reason for blood doping to be a popular illicit practice is that detection is difficult. For autologous blood transfusions, for example, no direct test exists, and the direct testing of misuse with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) has proven very difficult despite a test exists. Future blood <b>doping</b> <b>practice</b> will likely include the stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor which leads to an increased endogenous erythropoietin synthesis. It seems unrealistic to develop specific test against such drugs (and the copies hereof originating from illegal laboratories). In an attempt to detect and limit blood doping, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has launched the Athlete Biological Passport where indirect markers for all types of blood doping are evaluated on an individual level. The approach seemed promising, but a recent publication demonstrates the system to be incapable of detecting even a single subject as 'suspicious' while treated with rhEpo for 10 - 12 weeks. Sad to say, the hope that the 2012 London Olympics should be cleaner in regard to blood doping seems faint. We propose that WADA strengthens the quality and capacities of the National Anti-Doping Agencies and that they work more efficiently with the international sports federations in an attempt to limit blood doping...|$|E
40|$|Stabilization of the Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) using prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors (PHI) {{leads to}} an EPO {{synthesis}} which is suspected {{to be used as}} a <b>doping</b> <b>practice.</b> Such a treatment is suspected to improve endurance performance by increasing oxygen transport. However the effects of a PHI treatment on heart morphology and function has never been investigated. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate whether potential effects of PHI on cardiac function could contribute to explain its beneficial effect on aerobic performance. We tested the effects of a 1 week treatment with a PHI (DMOG, 150 mg. kg– 1, I. P.) or a placebo (NaCl) on both sedentary (Sed) and trained rats (Ex; trained during 5 weeks before treatment started; 40 min at 25 m. min– 1 per day; 5 days/week). Our first result was that PHI increased running performance (+ 12 %, p< 0, 05) in both Sed and Ex groups. This increased performance was associated with a major increase in total hemoglobin in PHI-treated animals (+ 13 % p< 0, 05). However, regarding cardiac function and cardiac remodeling no beneficial effect of PHI was observed. Indeed, in hearts of sedentary as well as exercised rats no significal change in any morphological parameters (LVEDs, LVEDd, AWTd, PWTd and RWT) was found. Moreover, no change in systolic function likely to explain enhanced exercise performance was observed in PHI-treated hearts, when evaluated by intraventricular pressure probe (Millar®). Finally it is interesting to note that in sedentary rat hearts an impairment of diastolic function characterized by an altered E/A and dp/dtmin ratios was found when they were challenged with isoproterenol (0, 5 mg. kg- 1). These last results obtained in sedentary hearts could suggest that a more prolonged treatment with such PHI could have deleterious consequences on heart health and point out the danger of such a doping strategy; however, this point remains to be more precisely investigated...|$|E
