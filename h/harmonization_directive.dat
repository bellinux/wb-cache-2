A company located close to the lake {{registered}} the trademark “Chiemsee” as a picture mark to be used in connection with sportswear under German law. A competitor also using a picture mark with the designation “Chiemsee” took objection to this, arguing that because the mark consisted of the name of the lake, it was unregistrable under Article 3(1)(c) of the <b>Harmonization</b> <b>Directive</b> because it was a “geographically descriptive” mark. The case reached the national court of last resort, which referred the question whether any and all registrations for geographically descriptive marks must be refused under the First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of December 21, 1988, to the ECJ.|$|E

Currently, {{one of the main}} initiatives of the EU is to establish principles for a correct granting of credits, which should re-establish the financial and real estate market of the EU and EU member states. The <b>harmonization</b> <b>Directive</b> was issued in 2014. The goals of this paper are to assess its impact from a holistic Czech perspective and to conduct a comparison. The Meta-analysis of secondary and primary data, earned through direct inquiries offers suggestions for the efficiency of the financial market...|$|E
40|$|In {{the sector}} of {{economic}} copyrights the European legislator has made great effort {{to establish a}} substantial acquis communautaire. The opposite is, however, true as regards moral rights which have thus far entirely been left {{outside the scope of}} the various <b>harmonization</b> <b>Directives.</b> In a first section, this contribution will identify the reasons why it has proven too difficult to achieve a European standard of protection for moral rights. A second section will argue why, in the digital age more than ever before, retaining such clean dividing line in the harmonization process between moral rights (not harmonized) and economic rights (increasingly harmonized) is no longer sustainable. In a last section, possible avenues for harmonising moral rights in the EU are explored. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of maximum}} <b>harmonization</b> <b>directives</b> in EU private law in {{combination}} with open legal concepts is controversial. Due to differing legal cultures, {{it is likely that}} open legal concepts will be interpreted differently in the Member States. This seems to conflict with the aim of maximum harmonization as put forward by the European Commission: reducing legal fragmentation and increasing legal certainty among consumers and businesses. Although supporting the notion that national interpretations of open legal concepts are likely to differ, this article posits that this is not incompatible with the aim of maximum harmonization. It proposes a different understanding of the concept of maximum harmonization that allows for different national applications of the rules. This understanding is based on the distinction between harmonizing a legal framework (the written rules) and harmonizing the application of this legal framework. By acknowledging the importance of fully harmonizing the written rules without harmonizing the national applications of these rules, it demonstrates that maximum harmonization does not necessarily conflict with the use of open legal concepts...|$|R
40|$|Should {{the moral}} rights of authors be {{protected}} in works {{of new technology}} that are characteristic of the ‘Digital Age’? This question has not been widely considered in international copyright developments. The major processes of internationalization in copyright law, including the Berne Convention, TRIPs Agreement, EU <b>harmonization</b> <b>directives,</b> and WIPO Internet Treaties, all side-step the issue of moral rights in technological works. Instead, {{there appears to be}} a tacit consensus in the international community that moral rights are somehow inappropriate to technological creation — but this question has yet to be subjected to rigorous policy analysis. This paper examines the relevance of moral rights to two areas of new technology. First, it considers the applicability of moral rights to computer programs; secondly, it explores moral rights in new kinds of artistic works that make use of technological elements in their creation, performance, or exhibition. It suggests that some form of moral rights protection may well be appropriate to technological works. However, the moral right of the ‘Digital Age’ should not only reflect the special characteristics of technological creation; it should also accommodate the remarkable diversity of human creativity in the environment of new technology...|$|R

40|$|The {{direct tax}} law of Member States of the European Union is {{influenced}} by a vast body of judgments of the European Court of Justice applying either the Treaty of the European Community or the EC <b>harmonization</b> <b>directives.</b> One may now speak in that respect of a European tax law. This book, based on a report drafted {{at the request of}} the European Parliament, analyses the Court’s rulings and their influence on the domestic tax law of the Member States. It is divided in three titles. The first title describes the institutional framework of the EU and the legal context in which the Court decides on its cases. The basic elements of the international tax systems of the Member States are briefly recalled, as well as the EC Treaty provisions and secondary legislation relevant for direct taxation. In the second title, the Court’s judgments in the area of direct taxation are analysed. The cases have been divided in three main categories, viz. taxation of individuals, taxation of companies and taxation of company shareholders. This title includes also, for each type of cases, an attempt to describe implementation of the Court’s case-law by Member States. Particular attention is given to Member States whose legislations have been directly assessed by Court decisions as to their compatibility with EC law. In the third title, an overview of the existing secondary legislation concerning direct taxation (Directives and Regulations) – and the case-law pertaining to it – is given, as well as a presentation of the most important initiatives of the European Commission in this area. Finally, provisional conclusions are drawn on the manner in which the development of the Court’s case-law influences the direct tax systems of the Member States...|$|R
40|$|The 2008 {{proposal}} for a Directive on Consumer Rights (hereinafter: the Draft) aims at reorganizing the acquis of four specific European directives on consumer protection into a more coherent codification of consumer rights. Specifically, it contains rules on precontractual information duties, on withdrawal rights for distance and off-premises contracts, on consumer sales and on general contract terms in consumer contracts. In replacing the four directives with a minimum harmonization character, the Draft marks a further step towards full harmonization of consumer contract law in Europe. This is an unsettling step because the level of protection offered to consumers in the Draft hardly exceeds the level of protection offered by the four directives mentioned earlier. Instead, it diminishes this protection in some regards. In light of all this, the question arises whether the policy choices underlying the Draft are, in fact, convincingly underpinned by solid argumentation. This article addresses this issue by first analyzing the Draft's use of the generic concept of “contracts between consumers and traders”. It is argued that full harmonization of a badly delineated territory is ill-advised. Subsequently, the argumentative power of the policy considerations forwarded by the European Commission in its Regulatory Assessment Study is tested. The article concludes that the Commission’s assessment of expected {{costs and benefits of}} the Draft is waver-thin and geared towards persuading the reader of the aptness of choices already made. In some respects, the evidence presented by the Commission is outright unconvincing. At certain points, the Draft even fuels the reader’s suspicion of foregone conclusions. Overall, the need for reduction of the level of protection offered by the current minimum <b>harmonization</b> <b>directives</b> is poorly argued by the Commission and appears, in a number of important ways, not to reflect the socio-economic relationships that exist in {{at least some of the}} Member States...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{degree of}} {{internationalization}} and integration which has characterized the recent {{evolution of the}} worldwide economic system has determined an increasing need for standardization of the corporate accounting rules in order to guarantee a greater comparability, efficiency and informative transparency of the balances; this aim is pursued through the mediation of the demands and the convergence {{of the interests of}} the single States (process of accounting <b>harmonization).</b> Through <b>Directives</b> and Regulations, the European Union has moved in the aim of the homogenization of the accounting behaviours of the adherent countries through the adoption of accounting standards of common interpretation and application.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the global {{economic}} crisis, small and medium enterprises are most affected. That is why the problem that arises more frequently is the harmonization of national legislation with the European legislation. The necessity to implement specific standards for SMEs appeared in order to provide them a beneficial framework for better economic and financial market positioning. In this respect, the International Accounting Standards Board issued in 2009 IFRS for SMEs, a referential aiming to the simplification of accounting procedures, reconciliation and increase of confidence of potential investors (stakeholders). The question of compatibility of these standards with the European Accounting Directives appears in situations where they may choose to use IFRS for SMEs. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the incompatibilities between IFRS for SMEs and the European Accounting Directives and to analyze the results concerning the implementation of the IFRS for SMEs in Europe.

40|$|The study {{traces the}} process of Europeanization of Copyright Law, through which the {{framework}} of EU Countries' rights was outlined. The focus was set on the analysys of the two methods of coordination between the legislations of EU Contries, namely full harmonization and harmonization by rules which refer back (also here called conditional harmonization), an on the analysis of their correlation with the principle of subsidiarity. This principle restricts the discretionality of the EU Institutions in choosing ways and contents of centralised intervention, allowing <b>harmonization</b> by <b>Directives</b> only when it is followed by efficiency gains in comparison to national action. The study therefore identifies as good harmonization that one which corresponds with a correct use of legislative competence, {{in accordance with the}} principle of subsidiarity and of the objectives of the European Union. The harmonization process is analysed with regard to the two phasis of the process, that is to say negative harmonization – through the decisions of the EUCJ – and positive harmonization, that was achieved by the <b>Directives</b> on <b>harmonization</b> of Copyright, which were adopted in the period 1991 - 2012. The analysis take account of several elements that influenced methods and contents of the harmonization of Copyright law. In particular, specific consideration is given to the international Conventions to which the European Union takes part as a juridical subject (BUC, Wipo Cooperation Treaty, Wipo Performance and Phonograms Treaty); at the same time, the analysis observes the new structure of the EU Treaties, with Intellectual Property being aknowledged as one of the fundamental rights protected by the European Union, the emergence of culture as one of the EU objectives and the new perspective of a single European Copyright Title...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{reflexive}} {{forms of}} regulation is growing within the EU, in particular as the open method of coordination (2 ̆ 2 OMC 2 ̆ 2) {{is applied to}} {{a growing number of}} contexts including employment policy, social inclusion, enterprise promotion, environmental protection, energy policy, and fundamental human rights. Company law, however, seems to be an exception to this: recent activity has taken the form of 2 ̆ 2 hard law 2 ̆ 2 <b>harmonization</b> through <b>directives,</b> coupled with the stimulation of regulatory competition through judgments of the European Court of Justice in relation to freedom movement, stemming from the Centros case. There is a very limited 2 ̆ 2 company law OMC 2 ̆ 2 {{in the form of the}} deliberations of the European Corporate Governance Forum, but there is little evidence here of what proponents of the OMC call 2 ̆ 2 learning from diversity 2 ̆ 2, instead, the Forum appears to envisage the elimination of country-specific practices which it refers to as 2 ̆ 2 distortions of competition 2 ̆ 2. This paper argues that the lack of a meaningful company law OMC is likely to prove a more serious long-term obstacle to capital market integration than the persistence of inter-country variations in corporate governance practices. The example of labour law shows how functional convergence and a coordinated raising of standards can be achieved by the dovetailing of the OMC with social policy directives. By contrast, the recent failure of the Takeover Directive to impose a uniform model of takeover regulation indicates the limits of top-down modes of harmonization. At the same time, the case of labour law highlights the importance of placing the OMC within a wider framework of legal support for fundamental rights, of the kind which is capable of providing a countervailing force against court-led deregulation...|$|R
40|$|Capital {{markets and}} company law” is a {{connection}} that is not self-evident for many traditional European company lawyers and company law professors, at least in continental Europe. For decades company law was an area for itself, centered on the public company as an organization, concentrating {{on the structure of}} this organization and the relations between its various organs and shareholders, proud of its professionalism between theory and practice, and very much self-sufficient. Things have changed dramatically, though much later in Europe than in the United States. Today, company law and capital market law are widely recognized as two distinct but closely related areas that influence each other and partly overlap. The functional interrelationship between both company law and capital market law is best illustrated by the recent phenomenon of the corporate governance movement, which has taught us that internal corporate governance – much of which is company law – and external corporate governance – in particular the pressures of the capital markets, including the market of corporate control – supplement each other and to a certain degree can even substitute for deficiencies in the other. Therefore, corporate governance and shareholder value and the corporate governance recommendations make up a good part of this book (expressly in parts IV and VI, but also concerning disclosure in part III, the role of the institutional investor in part V, and in relation to conflicts of interest in part VII). Still, recent developments point beyond a mere interrelationship between company law and capital market law. This book is named Capital Markets and Company Law because the markets themselves, in particular the international securities markets, increasingly influence company law, national as well as European and international. The inverse relationship – the La Porta et al. thesis that company law is relevant for the capital and financial markets – has also been observed and is hotly debated, both on an empirical and a theoretical level, by Coffee and others. It is represented by a contribution on tunnelling in part VIII. An issue raised in many of the chapters and highlighted in the last two parts, IX and X, of the book is the tension between <b>harmonization</b> by <b>directive</b> and <b>harmonization</b> by the markets, between a top-down approach and a bottom-up drive for more comparable regulation, between convergence and divergence or path dependence. In Capital Markets and Company Law, the contributors attempt to investigate the relationship between company law, securities markets, and securities regulation, or “capital market law”. This is an interdisciplinary project, involving scholars and practitioners of law and economics, policy makers, and corporate finance and management specialists {{from both sides of the}} Atlantic. It illustrates the increasing competitive pressure under which regulatory systems are developing, driven by market forces and regulatory competition. As markets are increasingly moulding the framework, the question arises to what extent a global regulatory system is being developed. European company law harmonization will increasingly have to take account of these market forces...|$|R
