5|$|Lassie is an American {{television}} series {{that follows the}} adventures of a female Rough Collie dog named Lassie and her companions, both <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal.</b> The show {{was the creation of}} producer Robert Maxwell and animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax and was televised from September 12, 1954, to March 25, 1973. The fourth longest-running U.S. primetime {{television series}} after The Simpsons, Gunsmoke, and Law & Order, the show chalked up 17 seasons on CBS before entering first-run syndication for its final two seasons. Initially filmed in black and white, the show transitioned to color in 1965.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} humans {{must have}} had and passed on knowledge about plants and animals to increase their chances of survival. This may have included knowledge of <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> anatomy and aspects of animal behavior (such as migration patterns). However, the first major turning point in biological knowledge came with the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago. Humans first domesticated plants for farming, then livestock animals to accompany the resulting sedentary societies.|$|E
5|$|Various caves {{within the}} gorge were {{inhabited}} by neolithic people from which flint tools {{are held in}} the Wells and Mendip Museum.

5|$|Bone, both <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal,</b> {{was also}} sculpted; human bones {{may have been}} trophies, or relics of ancestors. The Maya valued Spondylus shells, and worked them to remove the white {{exterior}} and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior. Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs. In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest, the Maya began to use the lost-wax method to cast small metal pieces.|$|E

5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. <b>Human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E
5|$|In bold colors Geisel {{illustrated}} the surreal scenery and strange <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> {{characters of the}} book with the strong, loose, energetic line that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If I Ran the Zoo (1950).|$|E
5|$|Nearly 4,000 {{species of}} fungi, {{including}} lichen-forming {{species have been}} recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with {{the largest number of}} species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: bracket fungi, and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will be new to science.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian batik making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also brought}} out, {{for the first}} time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the {{dwelling}} units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and potsherds. Some of the human skulls found here had trepanning (bored hole) marks. In many pits, bones of dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. The skeletons of humans {{were found in the}} burial pits in a sitting position along with bones of animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the site was first {{brought to the attention}} of Professor Richard Daugherty in 1952 by a rancher named John McGregor. Excavations at the site were started by Daugherty and Roald Fryxell, a geologist, under the auspices of Washington State University (WSU)and the National Park Service in 1962, and continued until 1964. In 1965, Fryxell returned to the site along with Professor Carl Gustafson and students from WSU, and had Roland Marmes dig a trench in front of the rockshelter with his bulldozer, which turned up human and elk bones. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the human remains were about 10,000 years old. In 1968, Fryxell returned, this time with several WSU professors (including a visiting professor from Poland) and members of the United States Geological Survey, and found more <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> remains, along with bone tools. April 29 of that year, Washington Senator Warren Magnuson made a public announcement of the finds.|$|E

5|$|The museum {{contains}} information {{relating to}} the history of the site and some of the artefacts discovered during the excavations. These include carved coffin lids, medieval mosaic tiles, pottery, scribe's writing equipment and domestic items from the various buildings on the site such as buttons, combs and wig curlers. Two medieval skeletons recovered in the excavations are on display, including one showing signs of Paget's disease of bone. Standing in the museum is a reconstruction of the cloister arcade as it had been built following the fire of 1236. It consists of moulded pointed arches with springer blocks, voussoirs and apex stones, supported on triple shafts with foliate capitals and moulded bases. Above the capitals, at the bases of the arches, are sculptures that include depictions of <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> heads. The human heads consist of two canons with hoods and protruding tonsures, other males, and females with shoulder-length hair. In one spandrel is a seated figure with an outstretched arm holding a book. Other carvings depict such subjects as fabulous beasts, and an otter or a snake.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have also}} {{detected}} both EEHV1A and EEHV1B as being shed in trunk wash secretions by healthy asymptomatic Asian zoo elephant herdmates of calves that previously had disease. and similarly for EEHV5. Thus, similar to saliva for most <b>human</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> herpesviruses, the trunk secretions {{may be a}} source of transmission for EEHVs. Because of concerns about the origins of EEHV1 and evidence of cross-species transmission for EEHV3, long-term contact between Asian and African elephants has been discouraged, along with avoiding new contacts between young captive-born Asian elephants and wild-born Asian elephants, as the latter may be carriers of the disease. An analysis of a number of North American cases, which ruled out the direct transmission of the virus between any of the affected facilities studied, strongly supported the idea of a significant Asian carrier population. This is supported by {{the fact that some of}} the deceased calves had no possible contact with any African elephants. Artificial insemination is not believed to be a transmission factor, notes that when multiple calves of a single bull or cow elephant died at different times (even at the same facility) they nearly all had distinct strains of the virus, yet when two calves died or became infected at the same time at the same facility the pairs have always had identical virus strains. A program of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing began in 2005, aiming to test blood samples from around a thousand elephants for antibodies to the virus in order to help identify carriers and possible transmission patterns.|$|E
