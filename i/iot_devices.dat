25|$|In a post-Snowden {{world of}} global {{surveillance}} disclosures, consumers {{take a more}} active interest in protecting their privacy and demand <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> to be screened for potential security vulnerabilities and privacy violations before purchasing them. According to the 2016 Accenture Digital Consumer Survey, in which 28000 consumers in 28 countries were polled on their use of consumer technology, security “has moved from being a nagging problem to a top barrier as consumers are now choosing to abandon <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> and services over security concerns.” The survey revealed that “out of the consumers aware of hacker attacks and owning or planning to own <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> in the next five years, 18 percent decided to terminate the use of the services and related services until they get safety guarantees.” This suggests that consumers increasingly perceive privacy risks and security concerns to outweigh the value propositions of <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> and opt to postpone planned purchases or service subscriptions.|$|E

40|$|Department of Computer Science and EngineeringIoT {{devices are}} in general {{considered}} to be straightforward to use. However, we find {{that there are a}} number of situations where the usability becomes poor. The situations include but not limited to the followings: 1) when initializing an <b>IoT</b> <b>device,</b> 2) when trying to control an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> which is initialized and registered by another person, and 3) when trying to control an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> out of many of the same type. We tackle these situations by proposing a new association-free communication method, QuickTalk. QuickTalk lets a user device such as a smartphone pinpoint and activate an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> with the help of an IR transmitter and communicate with the pinpointed <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> through the broadcast channel of WiFi. By the nature of its association-free communication, QuickTalk allows a user device to immediately give a command to a specific <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> in proximity even when the <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> is uninitialized, unregistered to the control interface of the user, or registered but being physically confused with others. Our experiments of QuickTalk implemented on Raspberry Pi 2 devices show that the end-to-end delay of QuickTalk is supper bounded by 2. 5 seconds and its median is only about 0. 74 seconds. We further confirm that even when an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> has ongoing data sessions, QuickTalk can still establish a reliable communication channel to the <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> with little impact to the ongoing sessions. clos...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} protecting distributed IoT units from network based attacks while still having {{a high level of}} availability. In particular we suggest a novel method where the <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> execution state is modeled with a suitable high level application model and where the execution state of the application of the <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> is “mirrored” in a cloud executed machine. This machine has very high availability and high attack resistance. The <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> will only communicate with the mirror machine in the cloud using a dedicated synchronization protocol. All essential IoT state information and state manipulations are communicated through this synchronization protocol while all end application communication directed towards the IoT units is done towards the mirror machine in the cloud. This gives a very robust and secure system with high availability at the price of slower responses. However, for many non-real time IoT application with high security demands this performance penalty can be justified...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the implementation and deployment of a compute/memory intensive non-parametric Bayesian {{machine learning algorithm}} on a microcontroller unit (MCU) to estimate room occupancy in a Smart Room using a single analogue PIR sensor. We envisage an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> consisting of a resource-constrained MCU, PIR sensor and a battery running the occupancy estimation algorithm and operating over days or months without recharging or replacing the battery. Both hardware-independent and hardware-dependent optimizations are performed to reduce memory footprint and yet provide acceptable real-time performance while consuming less energy. We show {{a significant reduction in}} the on-chip memory usage in the MCUs by the algorithm through optimisation of the machine learning models and of the static memory footprint and dynamic memory usage. We also show that a low-end MCU does not meet the real-time requirements of the application without causing high average power consumption. However, a moderately high-performance MCU with a higher clock frequency and hardware floating-point unit provides 19 x improvement in the execution time of the algorithm, better meeting the real-time specification of the application and reducing power consumption. Further, we estimate the battery lifetime of the <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> if it operates continuously in a Smart Room. With a typical size battery, an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> consisting of a Cortex-M 4 F MCU and PIR sensor can operate {{for more than a month}} without replacement or recharging of the battery while running the compute-intensive Bayesian machine learning algorithm...|$|R
