40|$|Introduction: The {{advent of}} bracket bonding {{simplified}} {{the assembly of}} orthodontic braces, besides giving more comfort to the patient and decreasing the risk of decalcification. However, there is no first molar bracket with accessory tube and hooks in the market, except for the convertible type. Objective:To present a patent for utility model of a bracket Roth prescription, Straight-Wire technique for first molar, {{in order to facilitate}} orthodontic treatment where there is a need <b>for</b> <b>placing</b> accessories in second molars. Material and methods:This patent consists of a molar bracket for bonding, which contains a retentive base for this, similar to the bracket used in the Edgewise technique,with fins <b>for</b> <b>placing</b> alastic or metal ligature,but containing pre-angles and torques as the tubes of the molar Straight-Wire technique with Roth prescription. It also includes an accessory tube <b>for</b> <b>placing</b> arches or cantilevers and hooks <b>for</b> <b>placing</b> elastics. Results and conclusion:With this bracket design proposal it is possible to obtain an accessory that facilitates the inclusion of the second molar in the assembly of the orthodontic brace without the use of bands.

5|$|In 2001, Kaladze {{became the}} most {{expensive}} Georgian footballer in history when Milan paid €16 million {{to bring him to}} Italy. He cited an injury to Aleksei Gerasimenko as his reason for leaving. At first, Kaladze was tried in different positions and faced competition <b>for</b> <b>places</b> in defense from players such as Jaap Stam and Cafu. In the 2002–03 season, however, he made 46 appearances in all competitions, including 27 Serie A appearances. That year, Milan won the Champions League, where they beat Juventus on penalties in the final (despite Kaladze missing his penalty) and the Coppa Italia, where they beat Roma 6–3 on aggregate in the final. After Kaladze's double success, the Georgian postal service issued a special stamp bearing the player's image. He is the first Georgian player to win a Champions League title.|$|E
5|$|It is {{different}} <b>for</b> <b>places</b> with a Mediterranean climate. In the western United States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E

5|$|A naming {{exception}} was Huge Viking, {{which was used}} for a Boeing 747. Huge was the quickest being in Norse mythology, but the name also played on the words English meaning. SAS reuses the names from retired aircraft, except for those of crashed aircraft. Because of oversights, the name Agnar and Rane have however been reused. A similar naming convention, albeit using the full name of kings, was used by Braathens SAFE of Norway and Loftleiðir of Iceland. As Carlzon was opposed to the Viking references, he also proposed that the names be abolished. The executive management reverted its decision following massive protests from within the airline. Female aircraft names were introduced by Scanair in 1980, who gave them to all their Douglas DC-8s. SAS followed suit in 1989, when the entire series of Boeing 767 were named for prominent female Vikings. Scandinavian letters were introduced from the 1990s. SAS Commuter's Norwegian Fokker 50 aircraft were given names <b>for</b> <b>places</b> in Norway, such as Lakselv.|$|E
5|$|Barber {{was born}} on 18 April 1901 in Cleckheaton, Yorkshire. He did not appear for the Yorkshire Second XI until he was 25, in 1926, when he scored 600 runs, {{including}} a century, and averaged 40. The same season, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Worcestershire without playing a single innings. He was scheduled to bat later in the innings and was not needed to bat as Yorkshire completed an easy victory. In the next season, he was chosen to play three matches, with a top score of 18. For the next few years, {{he was unable to}} attain a regular spot in the Yorkshire side as there were many batsmen competing <b>for</b> <b>places.</b> In the 1928 season, Barber played 16 matches, mainly when other batsmen were required in representative matches, passing fifty {{for the first time in}} an innings of 98 against the West Indians, and followed this with two other fifties. Next season, he scored his maiden first-class century against the South Africans in an innings of 108, out of a team total of 335, with no other batsman reaching fifty. In total, he played on 22 occasions and scored 857 runs at an average of 30.60, including a second century, against Glamorgan. However, Barber was in and out of the side over the next two seasons. He did not play 20 matches or reach 500 runs in either season and passed fifty only four times in total.|$|E
