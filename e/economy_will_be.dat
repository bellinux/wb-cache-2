5|$|The Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 {{published}} in 2008 {{does not indicate}} how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive <b>economy</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> attained. Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity. It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from its one onshore field. The bulk of the country’s revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia. The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue {{the development of new}} industries. Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013.|$|E

In open economies, where human capital is nontradable, the gap in rates of return is small, as is the gap between the international interest rate (which is less than the closed economies return on physical capital) and the return on human capital.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} e¤ects of capital {{mobility}} on {{the speed of}} convergence and welfare. Using a two-sector endogenous growth model, the speed of convergence is determined primarily by the gap in rates of return between physical and human capital. In a closed economy, where we consider a typi- cal situation of having relatively less physical capital than in a steady state, the return on physical capital <b>will</b> <b>be</b> signi cantly large, while the return on human capital <b>will</b> <b>be</b> relatively small. Thus, this gap in rates of return is considerably large {{when the economy is}} not at its steady state. In an open economy, where human capital is non tradable, the gap in rates of return is small, as it is the gap between the international interest rate (which is less than the closed economy return on physical capital during transition) and the return on human capital. Hence, convergence in open <b>economies</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> relatively slow, and convergence in closed <b>economies</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> relatively fast, and therefore there is little welfare gains to nancial liberalization. More- over, the result on the speeds of convergence for closed and open economies reverses the conclusion given by the one-sector neoclassical growth model for the same experiment.

Finally, the richest specimens--especially those containing, as many do, a medley of metals--would be treated with the least expenditure, and the greatest advantage, at Swansea or in other parts of England, where there are large establishments which make such work their specialty.|$|E
