5000|$|Jerboas are nocturnal. During {{the heat}} of the day they shelter in burrows. At night they leave the burrows due to the cooler {{temperature}} of their environment. They dig the entrances to their burrow near plant life, especially along field borders. During the rainy season they make tunnels in mounds or hills to reduce the risk of flooding. In the summer, jerboas occupying <b>holes</b> <b>plug</b> the entrance to keep out hot air and, some researchers speculate, predators. In most cases burrows have an emergency exit that ends just below the surface or opens at the surface but is not strongly obstructed. This allows the jerboa to quickly escape predators.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{contrast}} to traditional coal separation, dry separation {{does not require}} water and does not cause water pollution. Dense phase gas–solid fluidized beds are used for dry separation. The <b>plugged</b> <b>holes</b> in the air distributor should be tested to ensure the stability of these beds for particle separation. The pressure fluctuation is sensitive to these <b>plugged</b> <b>holes.</b> This sensitivity can be tested and diagnosed by determining the standard deviation of the pressure fluctuation. In areas with partial blockage, that is the areas with weak fluidization, {{a decrease in the}} volume fraction of the particles and in the pressure differences in the transverse of the bed results in an increase of the standard deviation of the pressure fluctuation, thereby stimulating the lateral mixing of medium-sized particles. The standard deviation and the mixing intensity decrease axially. The value of sensitivity of the <b>plugged</b> <b>holes</b> in the air distributor decreases as the height of the bed increases. The features of air distributors affect the surrounding areas. The distribution law determining the influence of <b>plugged</b> <b>holes</b> on the beds is symmetrical. As the blockage of the fluidized bed distributor region increases, the mean square error of the pressure fluctuation in the related regions increases. The intensity of the effect is proportional to the distance to the <b>plugged</b> <b>holes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Self-lubricating plain {{bearings}} have a lubricant {{contained within}} the bearing walls. There are many forms of self-lubricating bearings. The first, and most common, are sintered metal bearings, which have porous walls. The porous walls draw oil in via capillary action and release the oil when pressure or heat is applied. An example of a sintered metal bearing in action {{can be seen in}} self-lubricating chains, which require no additional lubrication during operation. Another form is a solid one-piece metal bushing with a [...] groove channel on the inner diameter that is filled with graphite. A similar bearing replaces the figure eight groove with <b>holes</b> <b>plugged</b> with graphite. This lubricates the bearing inside and out.
