5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the <b>key</b> <b>market</b> of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived <b>key</b> <b>market</b> of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E

25|$|On 26 September 2000, {{the first}} order for the type was placed by Bristow Helicopters. The first {{preproduction}} helicopter flew on 3 February 2001 at Vergiate in Italy, with two further AW139s also participating in flying trials. The first production AW139 made its first flight on 24 June 2002. European JAA certification was received in June 2003, and its FAA type certificate followed in December 2004. By May 2005, the AW139 had received in excess of 100 orders worldwide. In the US, the type was marketed under the designation US139, and was entered into the US Army's Light Utility Helicopter competition. One <b>key</b> <b>market</b> for the AW139 was the oil & gas industry, which required helicopters of increased endurance for offshore operations. In 2005, AgustaWestland bought out Bell's 25% share in the program {{and all of its}} rights to the AW139 for $95 million.|$|E

2500|$|The Paris Bourse (or stock exchange) {{emerged as}} a <b>key</b> <b>market</b> for investors {{to buy and sell}} securities. It was {{primarily}} a forward market, and it pioneered the creation of a mutual guarantee fund so that failures of major brokers would not escalate into a devastating financial crisis. Speculators in the 1880s, who disliked the control of the Bourse, used a less regulated alternative, the [...] "Coulisse". However it collapsed {{in the face of the}} simultaneous failure of a number of its brokers in 1895–1896. The Bourse secured legislation that guaranteed its monopoly, increased control of the curb market, and reduced the risk of another financial panic.|$|E

2500|$|Bell/Agusta {{aimed the}} {{aircraft}} [...] "at {{the government and}} military markets". Another <b>key</b> <b>market</b> for the AW609 has been the expansion of offshore oil and gas extraction operations, which requires aircraft capable of the traversing the increasing distances involved. In 2001, Bell estimated a market for 1,000 aircraft. Bell/Agusta stated in 2007 that they intend for the BA609 to compete with corporate business jets and helicopters, and that the BA609 would {{be of interest to}} any operator that has a mixed fleet of fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. In 2004, Lt. Gen. Michael Hough, USMC deputy commandant for aviation, requested that Bell conduct studies into arming the BA609, potentially to act as an escort for V-22s. However, AgustaWestland's deal with Bell for taking over the BA609 program precludes the aircraft from carrying arms.|$|E

2500|$|As Nokia was {{the largest}} mobile phone and {{smartphone}} manufacturer worldwide at the time, it was suggested the alliance would help Windows Phone, but {{from the beginning of}} 2011, until 2013, Nokia fell from #1 to #10 in smartphone sales. In June 2011, Nokia was overtaken by Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume. In Q2 2011, amid falling sales, Nokia posted a loss of €368 million, after having realized a profit of €227 million in Q2 2010. In September 2011, Nokia announced it would cut another 3,500 jobs worldwide, including the closure of its Cluj factory in Romania, after having cut as many as 7,000 the previous April. In August 2011 Chris Weber, head of Nokia's subsidiary in the U.S., stated that [...] "The reality is if we are not successful with Windows Phone, it doesn't matter what we do [...] He further added, North America is a priority for Nokia [...] because it is a <b>key</b> <b>market</b> for Microsoft.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{identifies}} <b>key</b> <b>marketing</b> and SCM related {{capabilities and}} explores {{the nature of}} the linkages between these specific capabilities as shaped by the integrative mechanisms adopted by firms. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the findings from dyadic interviews with 26 marketing and supply chain management executives from business-to-business firms, we develop an empirically grounded conceptual framework. Findings: We identify innovativeness and market learning capability as <b>key</b> <b>marketing</b> capabilities and supply chain agility and relational capability as key supply chain management capabilities. We find that relationships between these strategic marketing and supply chain management capabilities follow a specific pattern. We also find that the application of unique integrative mechanisms can cultivate the potential tandem between marketing and supply chain management capabilities. Research limitations/implications: Our study informs theory with regard to two key areas: relationships among <b>key</b> <b>marketing</b> and supply chain management capabilities and integrative mechanisms that shape the underlying mechanisms of capability relationships. Practical implications-Application of organizational dynamics to <b>key</b> <b>marketing</b> and supply chain management provides a more nuanced understanding of the linkages among such capabilities. A better understanding and application of integrative mechanisms may help managers develop better tools and means to bundle their <b>key</b> <b>marketing</b> and supply chain management capabilities effectively. Originality/value: The qualitative and exploratory nature of the paper will be of significant interest to managers who would like to achieve greater synergy between marketing and supply chain management capabilities...|$|R
