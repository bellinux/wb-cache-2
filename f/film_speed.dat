5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a <b>film</b> <b>speed</b> of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E
5|$|The film {{had been}} in {{development}} since 1992, changing actors, writers, and directors until 2006, when producer Joel Silver and the Wachowskis collaborated to begin production on Speed Racer as a family <b>film.</b> <b>Speed</b> Racer was shot between early June and late August 2007 in and around Potsdam and Berlin, with an estimated budget of $120 million. Its score was composed by Michael Giacchino, and the film's soundtrack, which contains the sound effects and theme song from the original series, was released on May 6, 2008.|$|E

25|$|The {{absolute}} {{value for the}} exposure time required depends on how sensitive to light the medium being used is (measured by the <b>film</b> <b>speed,</b> or, for digital media, by the quantum efficiency). Early photography used media that had very low light sensitivity, and so exposure times had to be long even for very bright shots. As technology has improved, so has the sensitivity through film cameras and digital cameras.|$|E
25|$|One {{week before}} live action filming commenced, Visual Effects Supervisor Brian Johnson {{and his team}} began work on the visual effects {{sequences}} for the first episode at Bray Studios near Maidenhead, Berkshire on 5 November 1973. For the first six weeks, no usable footage resulted until the team discovered a dragging brake had affected <b>film</b> <b>speed.</b> Studio rehearsals commenced at Elstree Studios near Borehamwood, Hertfordshire on 12 November 1973. During filming of the first episode, {{it became apparent that}} the troubled Elstree was under the threat of imminent closure. One weekend, the company secretly relocated sets, props, costumes, etc., to the nearby Pinewood Studios at Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, resulting in a union blacklisting of the production.|$|E
25|$|Brodovitch {{released}} {{a book of}} these photographs in 1945, titled simply Ballet, through a small New York publisher. The book contains 104 photographs of several ballets and is divided into eleven segments, one for each ballet performance. On the contents page, Brodovitch introduces each chapter in a typographic style that emulates {{the feel of the}} dance it is describing. He photographed with a Contax 35mm camera, no flash, and with a slow <b>film</b> <b>speed.</b> The blurred figures of the dancers allow the viewer to not only feel the music, but also to follow the line of the dancer's limbs mid-step. The images beautifully capture the atmosphere on-stage, the frenzied behind-the-scenes action backstage, and the magical moments of the ballet. By bleeding the blurred, grainy pictures off the pages and into the gutters, he communicated the emotional impact of the dance without words.|$|E

Beta testers had their own statistics and {{have the ability to}} enter clan competitions. Beta access was private and thus could not be shared with other PlayStation Network accounts. Also, beta testers are tied with Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. by a non-disclosure agreement; therefore they were not allowed to reveal contents of the beta experience. A technical demo of one of Killzone 2's TV commercials, known as the [...] "Bullet" [...] trailer, was released on the PlayStation Store on April 2, 2009.

40|$|Films of spider {{locomotion}} {{taken at}} about 270 {{frames per second}} (f. p. s.) were reanalysed to give effective <b>filming</b> <b>speeds</b> of 100, 50 and 25 f. p. s. Reanalysis of the data shows that mean values and variance for phase lag, period, stepping frequency and protraction/retraction ratios depart from the control values (270 f. p. s.) at slower sampling rates. Guidelines are presented for filming arthropod locomotion with high stepping frequencies and high or low p/r ratios. Most film analysis of arthropod locomotion has had insufficient time resolution to examine resolution-sensitive parameters such as the p/r ratio. <b>Filming</b> <b>speeds</b> giving sampling rates greater than 40 frames per step do not increase accuracy...|$|R
50|$|Graham John Yost (born September 5, 1959) is a Canadian {{film and}} {{television}} screenwriter.

2500|$|During {{the first}} 20 {{years of his}} {{photography}} Weston determined all of his exposure settings by estimation based on his previous experiences and the relatively narrow tolerances of the film at that time. He said, [...] "I dislike to figure out time, and find my exposures more accurate when only [...] "felt"." [...] In the late 1930s he acquired a Weston exposure meter and continued {{to use it as}} an aid to determine exposures throughout his career. Photo historian Nancy Newhall wrote that [...] "Young photographers are confused and amazed when they behold him measuring with his meter every value in the sphere where he intends to work, from the sky to the ground under his feet. He is [...] "feeling the light" [...] and checking his own observations. After which he puts the meter away and does what he thinks. Often he adds up everything ‒ filters, extension, <b>film,</b> <b>speed,</b> and so on ‒ and doubles the computation." [...] Weston, Newhall noted, believed in [...] "massive exposure", which he then compensated for by hand-processing the film in a weak developer solution and individually inspecting each negative as it continued to develop to get the right balance of highlights and shadows.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the scenes, backgrounds, {{and visual}} {{effects in the}} film were created using more {{traditional}} techniques and a unique process known as [...] "backlit animation". In this process, live-action scenes inside the computer world were filmed in black-and-white on an entirely black set, printed on large format Kodalith high-contrast film, then colored with photographic and rotoscopic techniques {{to give them a}} [...] "technological" [...] appearance. With multiple layers of high-contrast, large format positives and negatives, this process required truckloads of sheet film and a workload even greater than that of a conventional cel-animated feature. The Kodalith was specially produced as large sheets by Kodak for the film and came in numbered boxes so that each batch of the film could be used in order of manufacture for a consistent image. However, this was not understood by the filmmakers, and as a result glowing outlines and circuit traces occasionally flicker as the <b>film</b> <b>speed</b> varied between batches. After the reason was discovered, this was no longer a problem as the batches were used in order and [...] "zinger" [...] sounds were used during the flickering parts to represent the computer world malfunctioning as Lisberger described it. Lisberger later had these flickers and sounds digitally corrected for the 2011 restored Blu-ray release as they were not included in his original vision of the film. Due to its difficulty and cost, this process of back-lit animation was not repeated for another feature film.|$|E
50|$|<b>Film</b> <b>speed</b> {{describes}} a film's threshold sensitivity to light. The international standard for rating <b>film</b> <b>speed</b> is the ISO scale which combines both the ASA speed and the DIN speed in the format ASA/DIN. Using ISO convention film with an ASA speed of 400 would be labeled 400/27°. A fourth naming standard is GOST, {{developed by the}} Russian standards authority. See the <b>film</b> <b>speed</b> article for a table of conversions between ASA, DIN, and GOST film speeds.|$|E
50|$|Instant film {{is notable}} for {{having had a}} wider range of <b>film</b> <b>speeds</b> {{available}} than other negative films of the same era, having been produced in ISO 4 to ISO 20,000. Current instant film formats typically have an ISO between 100 and 1000.|$|R
50|$|When a film's {{effective}} sensitivity {{has been}} varied, the resulting sensitivity {{is called the}} exposure index; the <b>film's</b> <b>speed</b> remains at the manufacturer's indication. For example, an ISO 200/24° film could be push processed to EI 400/27° or pull processed to EI 100/21°.|$|R
