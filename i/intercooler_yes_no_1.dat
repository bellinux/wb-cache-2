All variables {{that might affect}} lithium clearance and/or lithium serum concentration were included and analyzed by stepwise multiple linear regression to produce equations describing lithium clearance and daily dosage requirements for these patients. The validation of the developed equations was performed by application to another 60 psychiatric subjects in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. The bias and accuracy of the new methods were also compared to those set forth by the empirical method and the a priori methods developed by Zetin, Pepin, Jermain and Terao and colleagues. Results: The following prediction equations for lithium clearance (CLLi) were obtained: CLLi (inpatients) = 0. 932 + 0. 185 CL(Cr) and CLLi (outpatients) = 1. 021 + 0. 141 CL(Cr). The equations derived for daily dosage requirements were: daily dose (inpatients, mg) = 350. 15 + 289. 92 (desired lithium level, mmol/L) + 0. 84 (weight, kg) - 1. 76 (age, years) + 34. 43 [tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), <b>yes</b> = <b>1,</b> <b>no</b> = 0] + 62. 1 (CLCr, L/h) + 13. 1 [blood urea nitrogen (BUN), mmol/L] + 40. 9 (sex, male = 1, female = 0) and daily dose (outpatients, mg) = 784. 92 + 530. 22 (desired lithium level, mmol/L) + 8. 61 (weight, kg) - 12. 09 (age, years) - 11. 14 (TCA, <b>yes</b> = <b>1,</b> <b>no</b> = 0) - 7. 63 (CLCr, L/h) - 42. 62 (BUN, mmol/L) - 23. 43 (sex, male = 1, female = 0). In the present method, the prediction error for clearance was 10. 31 % and 6. 62 % for inpatients and outpatients, respectively, and the prediction error for daily dosage requirements was 3. 96 % and 2. 95 % for inpatients and outpatients, respectively.
