50|$|Along the Ardière {{there are}} many <b>fragile</b> <b>species,</b> {{including}} the martin-pêcheur bird, the Bouvière fish, and fresh-water mussels of the Anodonta genus. One can also find two families of dragonfly (Gomphidae and Aeshnidae) {{as well as a}} damselfly, the Mercury Bluet.|$|E
50|$|Forests of Canary Island pine (Pinus canariensis) occur from 1000-2100 m, {{covering}} the middle {{slopes of the}} volcano, and having an alpine timberline 1000 m {{lower than that of}} continental mountains of similar latitude. At higher altitudes, the Las Cañadas caldera provides sufficient shelter for more <b>fragile</b> <b>species</b> such as the Canary Island cedar (Juniperus cedrus), and the Canary Island pine (Pinus canariensis) to grow.|$|E

50|$|The Zempoaltépec vole is {{considered}} an endangered and <b>fragile</b> <b>species.</b> This is due to its very restricted geographic range and habitat modification {{in the state of}} Oaxaca. Unfortunately, the species lives in an unprotected area. In order to improve conservation efforts in Mexico, additional reserves including the area of M. umbrosus, should be added to additional reserves. Priority for this particular area should be considered as it is home to eight other species of interest.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{methods of}} {{synthesis}} and analysis {{have been some}} of the focal themes of his research. In a recent work, molecular ionization was demonstrated at 1 V from a carbon nanotubes-impregnated paper. This methodology was used to collect high quality mass spectra of diverse analytes. Besides the advantage of low internal energy of the ions, which preserves <b>fragile</b> <b>species</b> and intermediates, the methodology helps in miniaturising mass spectrometry. Ion-based chemistry is now used to synthesise structures such as metal grasslands, extending over cm2 areas.|$|E
50|$|Lewis Thomas {{published}} multiple books {{throughout his}} career, the first being The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher.

5000|$|Today, {{much more}} thought {{is put into}} {{introducing}} non-native species. Non-native species can severely damage the populations of <b>fragile</b> native <b>species.</b> Stocking is used to restore native species to waters {{where they have been}} overfished or can no longer breed. [...] "Give and take" [...] stocking practices are those where fish are stocked only to be fished, and then restocked. Practices today lean more towards sustainability.|$|R
50|$|Bats are {{one such}} <b>fragile</b> <b>species</b> of cave-dwelling animal. Bats which {{hibernate}} {{are most vulnerable}} during the winter season, when no food supply exists on the surface to replenish the bat's store of energy should it be awakened from hibernation. Bats which migrate are most sensitive {{during the summer months}} when they are raising their young. For these reasons, visiting caves inhabited by hibernating bats is discouraged during cold months; and visiting caves inhabited by migratory bats is discouraged during the warmer months when they are most sensitive and vulnerable. Due to an affliction affecting bats in the northeastern US known as white nose syndrome (WNS), the US Fish & Wildlife Service has called for a moratorium http://www.caves.org/WNS/USFWS-WNS_cave_advisory_news_rls_2009-03-26_final-1.pdf effective March 26, 2009 on caving activity in states known to have hibernacula (MD, NY, VT, NH, MA, CT, NJ, PA, VA, and WV) affected by WNS, as well as adjoining states.|$|E
50|$|Virunga is {{threatened}} by the U.K. oil company SOCO, which wishes to undergo oil exploration within the park. Seismic tests were carried out by SOCO, and confirmed the presence of oil. This announcement reignited the debate to the merits of exploring oil in the park. This could involve disruptive seismic testing, forest clearing, and deep underground drilling. This can put at risk hundreds of lesser known <b>fragile</b> <b>species</b> which are found in no other country. Also, if Lake Edwards is drilled, it can have a detrimental impact {{on the people of}} the region. 30,000 people benefit economically from fishing in the park. Another 20,000 benefit from commercial activities related to the fishing industry. In response, a joint plea was launched by International environment and right groups to the Ugandan government and Republic of Congo to prevent oil drilling in or around the Virunga National park. Regardless, the Ugandan government plans to receive bids on six new oil licenses. To this day, no oil exploration has occurred.|$|E
5000|$|The {{well-being}} of the near-shore area around South Maury Island is another concern. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is a habitat that protects developing anadromous fish, such as salmon, by providing cover from predation and food, which supports the growth of healthy salmon populations. [...] Eelgrass beds also protect developing species such as herring, which are a food source for juvenile salmon. The construction of the new dock by Glacier Northwest will detrimentally affect eelgrass, disrupting species within the habitat. Docks and their construction affect eelgrass from underwater noise which would disturb <b>fragile</b> <b>species,</b> while creating shade that would threaten eelgrass growth. Docks would also harm the eelgrass beds that harbor young salmon by dredging (scooping and suctioning water ways) {{in order to improve}} navigation between piers. With the threat of development comes the possibility of building bulkheads, or extensive walls in the water to aid in collecting sediment. This loss of sediment would threaten the livelihood of many fish including salmon, and the man-made walls make it impossible for salmon and other fish to navigate through the waters natural currents.|$|E
50|$|Forest dormice spend a {{great amount}} of time in trees. They are capable of {{climbing}} with excellent agility as well as leap to and from branches as great as 2 meters apart from one another. This species has a natural tendency to create temporary nests which are <b>fragile.</b> This <b>species</b> does not spend much time in these temporary nests because much more energy is placed in making the natal nests.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} rather {{similar to the}} {{widespread}} Amanita pantherina, with a brown cap covered with whitish remnants of the universal veil, but is generally smaller (cap diameter up to 6 cm, stem length up to 9 cm) and more <b>fragile</b> than that <b>species</b> with much more prominent striations around {{the margin of the}} cap.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the same}} time as Shuotheriidae, the infraclass Australosphenida first appeared. The family Henosferidae {{occupied}} in the southern hemisphere in Argentina and Madagascar with genera Henosferus, Ambondro, and Asfaltomylos. This suggests that this family could have been more widespread and diverse in Gondwana during that time, although due to their <b>fragile</b> state some <b>species</b> might have been destroyed due to geological events.|$|R
50|$|The Qax, naturally, panic {{a little}} at the escape to the past. A complex, unavoidably <b>fragile</b> <b>species</b> in their huge living Spline spacecraft, the few Qax present are {{somewhat}} at a loss. They decide {{to build their own}} Interface, with major human-collaborator assistance (headed by Ambassador Jasoft Parz), to create a link to their future to gain aid in resolving the problem - with more modern GUT-engine spacecraft they can make a 500-year link in just eighteen months. A startling high-technology future vessel (in truth, one of the legendary Xeelee nightfighters, an advanced and long-range fast scout ship), with a future Qax comes through the gate. Its first act is to execute the Qax Governor of Earth and gather up Parz, before passing through the original portal after the Friends and all humanity. The future Qax takes two Spline ships (presumably leaving behind the nightfighter; this might be the nightfighter that is discovered by the crew of The Great Northern millennia later in Ring) through the gate and on the journey reveals to Parz the reason behind its desire to completely destroy the human race.|$|E
5000|$|Jablaničko lake (Jablaničko jezero) {{is a large}} artificially formed lake on the Neretva river, {{right below}} Konjic where the Neretva briefly expands into a wide valley. River {{provided}} lot of fertile, agricultural land there, before lake flooded most of it. The lake was created in 1953 after construction of [...] Jablanica Dam near Jablanica in central Bosnia and Herzegovina.The lake has an irregular elongated shape. Its width varies along its length. The lake is a popular vacation destination in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Swimming, boating and especially fishing are popular activities on the lake. Many weekend cottages have been built along {{the shores of the}} lake.There are 13 types of fish in the lake's ecosystem. However, the lake suffered from poor management of water and fisheries. Without any scientific and management plans or research, local fisheries and angling management introduced, alien, non-indigenous or non-native species, either deliberately or accidentally, which did more harm and damage than good. As the Neretva has many endemic and <b>fragile</b> <b>species</b> of fish that are near extinction, introductions of this invasive species, Pike Perch (Stizostedion lucioperca L.), completely destroyed native endemic and highly endangered fish like Strugač (Leuciscus svallize svallize Heck. et Kn.) or (Squalius svallize) and Glavatica (Salmo marmoratus) (also known as Gonjavac).|$|E
40|$|The {{seemingly}} paradisical environments of Pacific Island {{countries with}} their coconut palms, coral reefs and white sand beaches are threatened with destruction. Why? Rapid population growth straining limited natural resources, industrial development and mining activities creating problems of non-biodegradable waste disposal, depletion of rare and <b>fragile</b> <b>species,</b> and large scale erosion are {{but some of}} the reasons Pacific environments are changing rapidly. The threat of the Pacific becoming a dumping ground for nuclear waste poses a further problem. The protection of the Pacific environment and the conservation of its natural resources underly recent developments which will benefit Pacific Islanders (SPREP, 1986). The activities of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) are aimed at helping the countries of the region study and solve their own problems (Dahl, 1983). One of SPREP's priorities is environmental education- both non-formal (e. g. clean-up campaigns) and formal (e. g. developing school curricula).

40|$|Abstract: Accelerated {{global warming}} is {{predicted}} by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC) due to increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The climate changes are anticipated to have a long-term impact on human health, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, water resources and vegetation. Due to rising sea levels, low lying coastal regions will be flooded, farmlands will be threatened and scarcity of fresh water resources will be aggravated. This will in turn cause increased human suffering {{in different parts of}} the world. Spread of disease vectors will contribute towards high mortality, along with the heat related deaths. Arid and hot climatic regions will face devastating effects risking survival of the <b>fragile</b> plant <b>species,</b> wild animals, and other desert ecosystems.

In the present work we present the results of a series of experiments on electron-impact ionization of helium clusters doped with thymine and 1 -methylthymine, where several interesting phenomena were observed, i. e., (i) electron impact ionization of molecular clusters inside the helium droplets leads predominantly to protonated clusters; (ii) the appearance energies are close to the ionization threshold of the helium atom but ionization efficiency curves in addition extend down by several eV; (iii) ionized molecular clusters can undergo metastable decay via the loss of one neutral monomer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. -A full-recovery {{technique}} {{was used in}} mortality experiments conducted with juveniles of American shad Alosa sapidissima and striped bass Morone saxatilis passed through Ossberger crossflow turbines to obtain antecedent information about their fish passage characteristics. Im-mediate turbine-induced mortality was 66 % for 85 -mm-long (total length) American shad. Turbine-induced mortality of striped bass {{was significantly related to}} the total length of the fish and ranged from l 6 Y 0 for 67 - 83 -mm-long fish to 39 % for 136 -mm-long fish immediately after passage; after 24 h, turbine-induced mortalities of these two size-groups were 61 and 72 %, respectively. The mortality of striped bass was not affected by power output (320 - 600 kW) of the turbine or by turbine size (650 versus 850 kW). Because of high mortality of control fish, the full-recovery {{technique was}} not fully adequate for obtaining reliable delayed-mortality estimates for these <b>fragile</b> fish <b>species.</b> Recent concerted efforts to rehabilitate runs of anadromous fishes in rivers of eastern North America have, by chance, coincided with a resur-gent interest in small-scale hydropower develop...|$|R
40|$|The {{leatherback}} turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is an endangered species, and world-wide populations are declining. To understand better the mating structure of this pelagic and <b>fragile</b> <b>species,</b> we investigated paternity in nearly 1000 hatchlings from Playa Grande in Parque Marino Nacional Las Baulas, Costa Rica. We collected DNA samples from 36 adult female leatherbacks and assessed allele frequency distributions for three microsatellite loci. For 20 of these 36 females, we examined DNA from hatchlings representing multiple clutches, {{and in some}} cases assessed up to four successive clutches from the same female. We inferred paternal alleles by comparing maternal and hatchling genotypes. We could not reject the null hypothesis of single paternity in 12 of 20 families (31 of 50 clutches), but we did reject the null hypothesis in two families (eight of 50 clutches). In the remaining six families, the null hypothesis could not be accepted or rejected with certainty because the number of hatchlings exhibiting extra nonmaternal alleles was small, and could thus be a result of mutation or sample error. Successive clutches laid by the same female had the same paternal allelic contribution, indicating sperm storage or possibly monogamy. None of 20 females shared the same three-locus genotype whereas there were two instances of shared genotypes among 17 inferred paternal three-locus genotypes. We conclude that both polyandry and polygyny are part of the mating structure of this leatherback sea turtle population...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} the historical and contemporary flora of the Arroyo Seco. This was accomplished by researching and compiling historical documentation relating to the botany of the Arroyo Seco from various sources such as the Herbarium collection at Rancho Santa Ana with thanks to Valerie Soza, The Flora of Pasadena and its Vicinity written by Alfred MaClatchie in 1895, the CALflora database and other sources. In addition to collecting this data, plants were collected throughout the summer at Switzer Picnic area and along the Gabrielino Trail to help establish the species composition of the current flora for the basis of comparison. This involved collecting, pressing and identifying plants thanks to the help of Dr. Gretchen North. In order to conduct this investigation, several weeks were spent obtaining background information. This included, but was not limited to, information regarding the Hahamongna tribe that once occupied the area, the invasion and conquest by the Spanish, the building of the freeway and dams and the subsequent changes in hydrology, and the ecology of the area provided by Dr. Elizabeth Braker and Dr. Marcus Renner. With this information, we can tell whether species composition has changed over time or has remained relatively stagnant. For example, the implementation of the cement flood channels of the lower Arroyo Seco which began in 1938 may have caused <b>fragile</b> <b>species</b> to become locally extinct, while allowing other invasive species to take over the area...|$|E
40|$|Bycatch of {{protected}} species in commercial fishing operations {{is a primary}} concern to fishery managers because it threatens the conservation, protection, and recovery of <b>fragile</b> <b>species,</b> such as the Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus). One potential solution {{to reduce the risk}} associated with commercial fishing operations is to design commercial fishing gear that is more selective in terms of interactions between Atlantic sturgeon and commercial fisheries. Given this conservation and management need, the overarching goal was to reduce Atlantic sturgeon fishery interactions and maintain southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) catch in North Carolina. The specific objectives of this study were to design and evaluate the effectiveness of a modified gillnet. Overall, the results proved that lowering the profile and amount of webbing had a beneficial impact at reducing Atlantic sturgeon incidental encounters and bycatch. The modified gillnet reduced bycatch and Atlantic sturgeon encounters by 39. 6 % and 60. 9 %, respectively. Our design entangled 51. 6 % fewer southern flounder, which corresponded to a 48. 9 % reduction in total weight; the modified gear entangled slightly larger southern flounder than the control gear. Our findings showed the number of Atlantic sturgeon encounters was positively associated with mean water depth, with more Atlantic sturgeon encountered in deeper (5. 1 – 6. 3 m) than shallower waters; 75 % were encountered at depths between 4. 6 and 6. 1 m. Most southern flounder (n = 518, 39. 7 %) were taken at a water depth between 3. 76 and 5. 0 m. This observation suggests that southern flounder prefer slightly shallower waters than Atlantic sturgeon...|$|E
40|$|Ilyphagus Chamberlin, 1919 {{includes}} abyssal, <b>fragile</b> benthic <b>species.</b> Most {{species have}} large cephalic cages but chaetae are brittle and easily lost {{which may explain}} why the original definition included species with a cephalic cage or without it. The type species, I. bythincola Chamberlin, 1919, together with another species (I. pluto Chamberlin, 1919) were described as lacking a cephalic cage whereas a third species (I. ascendens Chamberlin, 1919) was described with one. To clarify this situation, all available type and non-type materials were studied. Ilyphagus is redefined to include species with digitiform bodies, abundant filiform papillae and a thin body wall; their neurochaetae are thick, anchylosed aristate spines, and all species have a cephalic cage (in the type species the presence of a cage is inferred from the remaining chaetal scars). Ilyphagus pluto, which also lacks a a cephalic cage is determined here to be a holothurian). The redefined genus contains I. bythincola (incl.

40|$|Damage {{caused by}} Sambar, {{particularly}} browsing, antler rubbing and physical removal of particular plant species, is resulting in serious ecological consequences. Threatening processes instigated or maintained by Sambar include: loss of individual taxa, altered vegetation structure and massive widespread removal {{and prevention of}} regeneration, which is now resulting {{in the loss of}} plant communities in some areas. These observations are particularly disturbing, as it is apparent that Sambar are yet to reach their full ecological and population potential in south-eastern Australia. The destruction documented ill this article is now so widespread and so severe that in places it represents an ecological disaster for specific plant and animal species, ecological vegetation classes and floristic communities.

40|$|Arid environments are resource-limited, with {{scarcity}} of water the key limiting factor for plants and their associated fauna. Consequentially bottom-up forces often control food webs, influencing the whole system through high levels of competition. The Sinai Baton Blue butterfly, Pseudophilotes sinaicus, is Critically Endangered, with a tiny endemic distribution in the St Katherine Protectorate, South Sinai, an arid environment. Its range is restricted to that of its sole host plant, the near-endemic endangered Sinai Thyme, Thymus decussatus, leaving the butterfly in a highly fragmented distribution. This study looks into the spatio-temporal variations in quality and abundance of the host plant {{and its implications for}} the Sinai Baton Blue. Over the past decade the butterfly has exhibited severe population cycles, with the causes still unclear; it could be due to the fluctuating resource levels with large temporal variation in the quality of thyme and density of inflorescences. The number of flowers significantly influences the larval distribution, indicating that resources {{play a key role in}} offspring survivorship. Population viability analysis has also highlighted the importance of management techniques aimed at increasing the butterfly's survivorship. The butterfly population sizes are positively correlated with the total resource area and the number of host plants but not the distance between habitat patches. Population viability analysis also suggests that habitat area is more influential than connectivity in this system driving current dynamics. Overall this project has highlighted the urgent need for conservation focused on improving plant quality within patches in order to save this <b>fragile</b> <b>species...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} 8 pc x 5 pc {{resolution}} {{view of the}} central 200 pc region of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253, based on ALMA Band 7 (λ 0. 85 mm or ν 350 GHz) observations covering 11 GHz. We resolve the nuclear starburst of NGC 253 into eight dusty star-forming clumps, 10 pc in scale, for the first time. These clumps, each of which contains (4 - 10) x 10 ^ 4 M_sun of dust (assuming that the dust temperature is 25 K) and up to 6 x 10 ^ 2 massive (O 5 V) stars, appear to be aligned in two parallel ridges, while they have been blended in previous studies. Despite the similarities in sizes and dust masses of these clumps, their line spectra vary drastically from clump to clump although they are separated by only 10 pc. Specifically, one of the clumps, Clump 1, exhibits line confusion-limited spectra with at least 36 emission lines from 19 molecules (including CH 3 OH, HNCO, H 2 CO, CH 3 CCH, H 2 CS, and H 3 O+) and a hydrogen recombination line (H 26 α), while much fewer kinds of molecular lines are detected in some other clumps where <b>fragile</b> <b>species,</b> such as complex organic molecules and HNCO, completely disappear from their spectra. We demonstrate the existence of hot molecular gas (T_rot (SO 2) = 90 ± 11 K) in the former clump, {{which suggests that the}} hot and chemically rich environments are localized within a 10 -pc scale star-forming clump.

40|$|For {{the last}} 40 years or so, the {{coastline}} southeast of Norway {{has changed dramatically}} {{when it comes to}} biological diversity, public access and esthetic appearance. Many of these less fortunate changes reflect a changing society, which now focus on development and privatization. The coast is an enormous recreational resource, visited annually by tens of thousands, but as coastal development and growth continues, public access to these areas decrease. As a result, conflicts arise between coastal developers, private property owners, environmental organizations and the authorities were one side seeks to promote further development while the other fights for the protection of public access to the coastal shores and different <b>fragile</b> <b>species</b> that reside there. In 1965 the Norwegian Government passed a legislation which prohibited further building activities from the water line and 100 meters into the land (the 100 -meter belt). However, in order to uphold the individual municipality’s autonomy, it is possible to exempt from this law through dispensations or through regulations plans within municipality plans. The County Governor and the central government has the possibility to interfere with exemptions that conflict with Norwegian national guidelines and values, but research has led to believe that many county governors in Norway seldom use such measures. This master thesis seeks out to explore why and how there has been increased building activity since the national legislation against building within the 100 -meter belt in 1965 and furthermore explore the effects on biological diversity and public access. In order to investigate these issues the author has explored different pressure groups that either oppose or support such coastal development with attempts to determine their actual influential attributes by analyzing coastal legislations and institutions, and through relevant fieldwork. The Hvaler archipelago, {{one of the most popular}} cabin communities and coastal recreational areas in Norway has been used as a case for this thesis...|$|E

In the class Thaliacea, represented by <b>fragile</b> pelagic <b>species,</b> the few studies on their haemocytes go back to several decades ago and do not consider comparative aspects with ascidian haemocytes. In this study, we identified various haemocyte types and their distribution in the common salp Thalia democratica by comparative observations under light and electron microscopy and by histochemical, histoenzymatic and immunohistochemical techniques. By comparing specialisations with those of ascidian haemocytes, we detected an undifferentiated cell type (lymphocyte-like cell) and three categories with four cell types, i. e. i) phagocytic line (hyaline amoebocyte and amoebocyte with large vacuoles), ii) mast cell-like line (granular cell), and iii) storage cells (nephrocyte). Both phagocytes and granular cells appear to migrate in the tunic. Phagocytes adhere to the tunic which internally covers the oral siphon, where they probably function as sentinel cells of the pharynx.

The massive bosses on the skulls of Pachyrhinosaurus and Achelousaurus resemble those formed by the base of the horns in modern musk oxen, suggesting that they may have butted heads. Centrosaurines have frequently been found in massive bone beds with few other species present, suggesting that the animals might have lived in large herds.|$|R
