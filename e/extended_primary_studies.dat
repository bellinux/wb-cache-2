The author sought to determine what processes organization members experience as their churches change ministers, as well as how ministers attempt to guide those processes. To that end the researcher analyzed six case <b>studies.</b> One <b>primary</b> case <b>study</b> was explored in depth using process methodology (Poole, et al., in press) to uncover members' experiences. Process methodology calls for obtaining rich data on a continual basis as the process unfolds. This study started with one minister's retirement announcement and continued through the next minister's intentional program of taking charge and encouraging the church to reassess its vision, a total of eighteen months. Five additional case studies from a variety of denominations were examined to find how other members experienced transition and to <b>extend</b> the <b>primary</b> case <b>study's</b> conclusions. Organizational members were found to fit in a typology along three dimensions: commitment to the church, preference for the previous minister, and amenability to change. Many members experienced sincere grief processes while others were able to take leadership through the transition and move the church along. Ministers agreed that the primary way to lead was to communicate in caring, pastoral ways with congregants. Transitions can provide a time of testing for an organization, which can have negative outcomes for some members but can also strengthen the faith of others as they break their bonds with the individual leaders and strengthen their bonds to their churches and their faith in God...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} methodological quality of {{systematic}} reviews and meta-analyses regarding acupuncture intervention for stroke and the <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> within them. Methods: Two researchers searched PubMed, Cumulative index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Ovid Medline, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and Traditional Chinese Medical Database to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses about acupuncture for stroke published from the inception to December 2016. Review characteristics and {{the criteria for}} assessing the <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> within reviews were extracted. The methodological quality of the reviews was assessed using adapted Oxman and Guyatt Scale. The methodological quality of <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> was also assessed. Results: Thirty-two eligible reviews were identified, 15 in English and 17 in Chinese. The English reviews were scored higher than the Chinese reviews (P= 0. 025), especially in criteria for avoiding bias and the scope of search. All reviews used the quality criteria to evaluate the methodological quality of <b>primary</b> <b>studies,</b> but some criteria were not comprehensive. The <b>primary</b> <b>studies,</b> in particular the Chinese reviews, had problems with randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, dropouts and withdrawals, intent-to-treat analysis and adverse events. Conclusions: Important methodological flaws were found in Chinese systematic reviews and <b>primary</b> <b>studies.</b> It was necessary to improve the methodological quality and reporting quality of both the systematic reviews published in China and <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> on acupuncture for stroke...|$|R

40|$|Meta-analyses of {{diagnostic}} test accuracy are uncommon and {{often based on}} separate pooling of sensitivity and specificity, {{which can lead to}} biased estimates. Recently, several appropriate methods have been developed for meta-analysing diagnostic test data from <b>primary</b> <b>studies.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>studies</b> usually only provide binary test data, for which Moses et al. have developed a method to estimate Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves, thereby taking account of possible test threshold differences between studies. Several methods are also available for analysing multicategory and continuous test data. The usefulness of applying these methods is constrained by publication bias and the generally poor quality of <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> {{of diagnostic}} test accuracy.

40|$|Meta-analyses are {{typically}} {{triggered by a}} (potentially false-significant) finding {{in one of the}} preceding <b>primary</b> <b>studies.</b> We studied consequences of meta-analysis investigating effects when <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> that triggered such meta-analysis are also included. We analytically determined the bias of the treatment effect estimates obtained by meta-analysis, conditional on the number of included <b>primary</b> and false-significant <b>studies.</b> The type I error rate and power of the meta-analysis were assessed using simulations. We applied a method for bias-correction, by subtracting an analytically derived bias from the treatment effect estimated in meta-analysis. Bias in meta-analytical effects and type I error rates increased when increasing numbers of <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> with false-significant effects were included. When 20 % of the <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> showed false-significant effects, the bias was 0. 33 (z-score) instead of 0, and the type I error rate was 23 % instead of 5 %. After applying a bias-correction, the type I error rate became indeed 5 %. Inclusion of <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> with false-significant effects leads to biased effect estimates and inflated type I error rates in the meta-analysis, depending on the number of false-significant studies.

40|$|An {{interesting}} methodological {{aspect of}} secondary analysis {{is that it}} enables comparisons between constructions that constitute qualitative data analysis. This comparison is even more focused if a reanalysis is conducted, that means an analysis that reexamines both the <b>primary</b> <b>study's</b> data and the <b>primary</b> <b>study's</b> research question. In this article, a reanalysis is described that used interviews from the archive at the Special Collaborative Centre 186 (Sfb 186). One of the <b>primary</b> <b>study's</b> results was formulated as a hypothesis and subsequently "tested" by conducting a qualitative content analysis of the interviews. A comparison of <b>primary</b> <b>study</b> and reanalysis reveals critical decisions which may lead the data analyses to different results. These decisions are usually made implicitly and will show up only if contradictions between results are explained. As a second result of the comparison, typical threats to {{primary and secondary analyses}} are discussed. <b>Primary</b> <b>studies</b> seem to suffer from a "closure pressure", that it is a necessity {{to make sense of the}} data at all costs. This may stimulate researchers to close gaps in their data by speculation and to neglect contradicting evidence. Secondary analyses are thematically and methodically restricted by the <b>primary</b> <b>study's</b> data collection. Finally, the reanalysis confirmed that it is possible to use interviews from archives: The losses of information due to archiving and anonymisation seemed to have no significant influence on the reanalysis.

40|$|Many meta-regression {{analyses}} that synthesize estimates from <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> {{have now been}} published in economics. Meta-regression models attempt to infer the presence of genuine empirical effects even if the authors of <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> select statistically significant and theory-confirming estimates for publication. Meta-regression models were originally developed for the synthesis of experimental research where randomization ensures unbiased and consistent estimation {{of the effect of}} interest. Most economics research is, however, observational and authors of <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> can search across different regression specifications for statistically significant and theory-confirming estimates. Each regression specification may possibly suffer from biases such as omitted-variable biases that result in biased and inconsistent estimation of the effect of interest. We show that if the authors of <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> search for statistically significant and theory-confirming estimates, meta-regression models tend to systematically make false-positive findings of genuine empirical effects. The ubiquity of such search processes for specific results may limit the applicability of meta-regression models in identifying genuine empirical effects in economics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Graphical {{displays}} of results allow researchers to summarise and communicate the key findings of their study. Diagnostic {{information should be}} presented in an easily interpretable way, which conveys both test characteristics (diagnostic accuracy) {{and the potential for}} use in clinical practice (predictive value). Methods We discuss the types of graphical display commonly encountered in <b>primary</b> diagnostic accuracy <b>studies</b> and systematic reviews of such studies, and systematically review the use of graphical displays in recent diagnostic <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> and systematic reviews. Results We identified 57 <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> and 49 systematic reviews. Fifty-six percent of <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> and 53 % of systematic reviews used graphical displays to present results. Dot-plot or box-and- whisker plots were the most commonly used graph in <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> and were included in 22 (39 %) studies. ROC plots were {{the most common type of}} plot included in systematic reviews and were included in 22 (45 %) reviews. One <b>primary</b> <b>study</b> and five systematic reviews included a probability-modifying plot. Conclusion Graphical displays are currently underused in <b>primary</b> diagnostic accuracy <b>studies</b> and systematic reviews of such studies. Diagnostic accuracy studies need to include multiple types of graphic in order to provide both a detailed overview of the results (diagnostic accuracy) and to communicate information that can be used to inform clinical practice (predictive value). Work is required to improve graphical displays, to better communicate the utility of a test in clinical practice and the implications of test results for individual patients. </p...|$|R
30|$|For {{the threat}} of missing {{critical}} <b>primary</b> <b>studies,</b> we used two secondary studies {{as a source of}} <b>primary</b> <b>studies.</b> We obtained a set of 20 studies reporting evidence on Kanban, which is a high number in SE considering that they report the same effects (i.e., benefits and drawbacks of Kanban).

40|$|A {{systematic}} review is {{an overview of}} <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> that used explicit and reproducible methods.

30|$|In this step, {{the goal}} is to put the {{selected}} <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> under the same perspective so they can be aggregated. The idea is similar to the statistical meta-analysis, in which all <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> are represented by a numerical value called effect size and then aggregated by combining those values (Borenstein et al. 2009). In the case of SSM, each <b>primary</b> <b>study</b> is represented by an evidence model, which is denominated theoretical structure. The evidence models describe the primary studies’ contextual aspects and the effects/moderators expected from the object of study – Kanban, in this synthesis. These descriptions are used as input for determining the evidence compatibility and for the aggregation itself.|$|R

Also, one additional paper was excluded (Heikkilä et al. 2016), since the only challenge it reported, called “Setting up and maintaining Kanban”, has not been translated as it did not represent a moderator – more details about the benefits and challenges of using Kanban in SE considered in each <b>primary</b> <b>study</b> is shown in Table  1 (Section 4).

40|$|Background: Many {{prognostic}} {{models have}} been developed. Different types of models, i. e. prognostic factor and outcome prediction studies, serve different purposes, which should be reflected in how the results are summarized in reviews. Therefore {{we set out to}} investigate how authors of reviews synthesize and report the results of <b>primary</b> outcome prediction <b>studies.</b> Methods. Outcome prediction reviews published in MEDLINE between October 2005 and March 2011 were eligible and 127 Systematic reviews with the aim to summarize outcome prediction studies written in English were identified for inclusion. Characteristics of the reviews and the <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> that were included were independently assessed by 2 review authors, using standardized forms. Results: After consensus meetings a total of 50 systematic reviews that met the inclusion criteria were included. The type of <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> included (prognostic factor or outcome prediction) was unclear in two-thirds of the reviews. A minority of the reviews reported univariable or multivariable point estimates and measures of dispersion from the <b>primary</b> <b>studies.</b> Moreover, the variables considered for outcome prediction model development were often not reported, or were unclear. In most reviews there was no information about model performance. Quantitative analysis was performed in 10 reviews, and 49 reviews assessed the <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> qualitatively. In both analyses types a range of different methods was used to present the results of the outcome prediction studies. Conclusions: Different methods are applied to synthesize <b>primary</b> <b>study</b> results but quantitative analysis is rarely performed. The description of its objectives and of the <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> is suboptimal and performance parameters of the outcome prediction models are rarely mentioned. The poor reporting and the wide variety of data synthesis strategies are prone to influence the conclusions of outcome prediction reviews. Therefore, there is much room for improvement in reviews of outcome prediction studies. © 2013 van den Berg et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

In each study, standard error of prevalence of G 6 PD was calculated according to binominal distribution formula. Finally, heterogeneity index was determined among studies using Cochran's test. Prevalence of G 6 PD in Iran was estimated by STATA software ver 11 using fixed or random effect model based on heterogeneity results. 148916 subjects in 36 <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> which entered this meta-analysis were examined. G 6 PD deficiency prevalence was 6. 7 % in Iran (men: 8. 8 % and women: 2. 2 %). Also, this deficiency {{in the present study was}} four times higher in men than in women. Its prevalence was adjusted in different parts of Iran and it was shown that it was between 0. 8 and 15. 2 using Bayesian analysis. This meta-analysis showed that Iran is among countries with high frequency of G 6 PD deficiency and there is a significant difference in prevalence of G 6 PD in different parts of Iran. According to these results, screening newborn children seems very vital. Carrying out other <b>primary</b> <b>studies</b> regarding prevalence of G 6 PD seems unnecessary...|$|R
