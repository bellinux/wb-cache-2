5000|$|Many of the {{suspension}} {{differences between the}} standard Sierra and the Cosworth attributed their development to what was learned from racing the turbocharged Jack Roush IMSA Merkur XR4Ti in America and Andy Rouse's successful campaign of the 1985 British Saloon Car Championship. Much of Ford's external documentation for customer race preparation indicated [...] "developed for the XR4Ti" [...] when describing parts that were Sierra Cosworth specific. Roush's suspension and aerodynamics engineering for the IMSA cars was excellent feedback for Ford. Some production parts from the XR4Ti {{made their way into}} the Cosworth such as the speedometer with <b>integral</b> <b>boost</b> gauge and the motorsport 909 chassis stiffening plates.|$|E

This unit is designed to ingest 10 % vapor by volume, contamination free liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The final pump configuration and the predicted performance are included...|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{communications}} between posts and controls were made using former Army-issue head-and-breast communication sets via above-ground telephone lines, these being manually switched by telephone engineers prior to use. Army head-and-breast sets were replaced in 1964 by metal housed “Teletalk” units which only permitted one-way communications when the push-to-talk switch was depressed. The Teletalk units also used manually switched telephone lines, but with <b>integral</b> transistorisation to <b>boost</b> transmission and reception power. In 1981 a new design of Teletalk (AD8010) {{was introduced by}} British Telecom together with underground, permanently wired, landline connections that were hardened against the effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear bursts.|$|R
40|$|Information Technology {{does help}} {{people to get}} {{information}} promptly anytime and anywhere. Unfortunately, the information gathered from the Internet does not always come out positive. Some information can be destructive, such as porn images. To mitigate this problem, the study aims to create a desktop application that could detect parts of human body which can be expanded {{in the future to}} become an image filter application for pornography. The detection methodology in this study is Viola-Jones method which provides a complete framework for extracting and recognizing image features. A combination of Viola-Jones method with Haar-like features, <b>integral</b> image, <b>boosting</b> algorithm, and cascade classifier provide a robust detector for the application. First, several parts of the human body are chosen to be detected as the data training using the Viola-Jones method. Then, another set of images (similar body parts but different images) are run through the application to be recognized. The result shows 86. 25 % of successful detection. The failures are identified and show that the inputted data are completely different with the data training. </p...|$|R
50|$|Weird Al's success {{comes in}} part from his {{effective}} use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself {{and went on to}} direct for other artists including Ben Folds, Hanson, The Black Crowes, and The Presidents of the United States of America. With the decline of music television and the onset of social media, Weird Al used YouTube and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved <b>integral</b> helping to <b>boost</b> sales of his later albums including Mandatory Fun. Weird Al has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} SL(2,C) Clebsch-Gordan {{coefficients}} {{appearing in the}} lorentzian EPRL spin foam amplitudes for loop quantum gravity. We show how the amplitudes decompose into SU(2) nj-symbols at the vertices and <b>integrals</b> over <b>boosts</b> at the edges. The integrals define edge amplitudes that can be evaluated analytically using and adapting results in the literature, leading to a pure state sum model formulation. This procedure introduces virtual representations which, in a manner reminiscent to virtual momenta in Feynman amplitudes, are off-shell of the simplicity constraints present in the theory, but with the integrands that peak at the on-shell values. We point out some properties of the edge amplitudes which are helpful for numerical and analytical evaluations of spin foam amplitudes, and suggest among other things a simpler model useful for calculations of certain lowest order amplitudes. As an application, we estimate the large spin scaling behaviour of the simpler model, on a closed foam with all 4 -valent edges and Euler characteristic X, to be N^(X - 5 E + V/ 2). The paper contains a review and an extension of results on SL(2,C) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients among unitary representations of the principal series that can be useful beyond their application to quantum gravity considered here. Comment: 35 pages, many figures. v 2 : many improvements, in particular clarifications on different options for the phases of the CG coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Crowd {{counting}} {{and density}} estimation {{is still one}} of the important task in video surveillance. Usually a regression based method is used to estimate the number of people from a sequence of images. In this paper we investigate to estimate the count of people in a crowded scene. We detect the head region since this is the most visible part of the body in a crowded scene. The head detector is based on state-of-art cascade of <b>boosted</b> <b>integral</b> features. To prune the search region we propose a novel interest point detector based on gradient orientation feature to locate regions similar to the top of head region from gray level images. Two different background subtraction methods are evaluated to further reduce the search region. We evaluate our approach on PETS 2012 and Turin metro station databases. Experiments on these databases show good performance of our method for crowd counting. Figure 1 : Example detection result from our approach. The blue boxes represents the detected heads from the image. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To dosimetrically {{evaluate}} different breast SIB techniques {{with respect}} to target coverage and organs at risk (OARs) doses. Methods: Four IMRT techniques were compared in 12 patients. Three techniques employ tangential whole breast irradiation with either two coplanar fields (T- 2 F), or four non-coplanar fields (T-NC), or one Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (T-VMAT) for the boost volume. The fourth technique is a fully-modulated VMAT technique (f-VMAT). Dosimetric parameters were compared for the boost and breast target volumes as well as OARs. Delivery efficiency was analysed based on number of monitor units (MUs) and estimated delivery time. Results: T-VMAT and f-VMAT ranked highest {{with respect to}} <b>integral</b> assessment of <b>boost</b> and breast treatment quality measures. T-VMAT significantly outperformed f-VMAT with respect to ipsi-lateral lung and left-sided patients’ heart volumes[*]≥[*] 5  Gy (35  %[*]±[*] 5  % vs. 52  %[*]±[*] 6  % and 11  %[*]±[*] 5  % vs. 22  %[*]±[*] 6  %, respectively). f-VMAT significantly outperformed T-VMAT with respect to ipsi-lateral lung volume[*]≥[*] 20  Gy (13  %[*]±[*] 2  % vs. 15  %[*]±[*] 3  %) and heart volume[*]≥[*] 30  Gy in left breast cancer (0  %[*]±[*] 0  % vs. 1  %[*]±[*] 1  %). T-VMAT and f-VMAT needed 442 [*]±[*] 58 and 1016 [*]±[*] 152 MUs, respectively. Conclusions: The hybrid T-VMAT is considered the technique of choice due to its balance of quality, efficiency and dose to OARs...|$|R
40|$|Soft gamma-ray {{repeaters}} {{appear to}} be relatively young, strongly magnetized neutron stars embedded within plerions. The observationally inferred presence of teragauss fields and energetic outflows in these sources provides some support for a model in which the bursts results from crustal disturbances that load and energize the magnetosphere with the ensuing generation of sheared Alfven waves. We here determine accurately {{the structure of the}} particle efflux and calculate the spectrum of the resultant radiation, incorporating the key effects due to mildly relativistic magnetic bremsstrahlung, a frequency-dependent photospheric radius and angle-dependent boosting of the intensity for emitting elements at different inclinations. We find that the average photospheric radius during the transient event is approximately 4 stellar radii and that the particles attain a Lorentz factor approximately 13. 2 by the time the gas becomes optically thin. The calculated spectrum is a weighted <b>integral</b> over the <b>boosted</b> intensity determined from the physical conditions (i. e., magnetic field, particle density, and temperature) at the photospheric radius corresponding to the relevant frequency. When applied to SGR 1806 - 20, this procedure yields a distance D approximately equals 10 kpc to this source, which appears to be consistent with the range (approximately 8 - 17 kpc) inferred from its apparent coincidence with the supernova remnant G 10. 0 - 0. 3...|$|R
