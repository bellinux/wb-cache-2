500|$|Amy Phillips of Pitchfork Media commended Gaga's {{performance}} {{saying that}} it was [...] "amazing as usual– a master class in over-the-top theatrics, campy gender-bending, and cheeky fun... But it was almost beside the point. The whole Gaga machine, the whole Gaga world we were immersed in– that was the point. It was overwhelming, all consuming. Something even the best album promo cycles only dream of being." [...] Phillips wondered how Gaga would be able to [...] "top" [...] the ArtRave event and listed it as an unprecedented promotional tool for an artist's album release cycle. Billboard Andrew Hampp and Jason Lipshutz compared Gaga's outfit to a [...] "bizarro" [...] version of <b>Jack</b> <b>Box,</b> the mascot for Jack in the Box, and wrote that the lip-synched portion of her performance was [...] "more pop art than artistic pop music." [...] Hampp and Lipshutz summarized their experience by writing, [...] "Even if the 'ARTPOP' live show still needs a bit of tinkering to fully captivate, Lady Gaga showed on Sunday night that she knows how to meld low art and high art at a party." [...] Michael Baggs of Gigwise described the concert as [...] "sparse but impressive" [...] and wrote that Gaga appeared [...] "wide-eyed and slightly manic... but impressed with live vocals and a hugely energetic performance." ...|$|E

50|$|JBX Grill {{was a line}} of fast casual {{restaurants}} {{introduced in}} 2004 by <b>Jack</b> in the <b>Box</b> Inc. They featured high-quality, cafe-style food, avoiding most of the cheaper fast-food items typically served at <b>Jack</b> in the <b>Box.</b> The architecture and decor maintained an upbeat, positive atmosphere, and the customer service was comparable to most dine-in restaurants. Two of the <b>Jack</b> in the <b>Box</b> restaurants in San Diego, California (where <b>Jack</b> in the <b>Box</b> is headquartered) were converted to JBX Grill restaurants to test the concept. (The locations in Hillcrest and Pacific Beach still retain many of the JBX elements, including an indoor/outdoor fireplace and modern architecture.) There were also restaurants in Bakersfield, California, Boise, Idaho, and Nampa, Idaho. However, the concept later proved unsuccessful, and the last stores were reconverted to <b>Jack</b> in the <b>Box</b> in 2006.|$|R

But none of this is the [...] "big show," [...] to which Buddy happily welcomes all of his guests. We come to a two ring circus, where ringmaster Buddy precedes a kangaroo (or two) with a trumpet, and lions jump through smoke rings blown by a reclining clown. One performer subjects himself to being lifted by his teeth with a rope, which reveals them to be dentures, which come out of his mouth and the performer falls to the ground. A baby enjoys the show whilst munching Cracker Jack until he drops the box out of which he is eating into the stands. Endeavoring to retrieve the box, the child enters the underside of the seats and swings from patron's leg to patron's leg until he finds the ground, where he reaches for his found Cracker <b>Jack</b> <b>box,</b> all of whose spilled contents then are absorbed by a playful elephant, which then takes a merry baby onto its trunk.|$|E
