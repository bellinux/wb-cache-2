40|$|Baoguo Temple {{is located}} half way up Lingshan Mountain in Northern Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China. The main hall of Baoguo Temple is Song dynasty wooden structure. As the oldest wooden {{architecture}} in Jiangnan, China, it {{is a national}} major protective historical relic. In 2005, Baoguo Temple Ancient Architecture Museum was set up and opens to the outside world. From 2007, {{to be able to}} protect it more effectively and foreseeably, Baoguo Temple Ancient Architecture Museum began to build <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> systems towards historical architectures using modern information technology. After comparing correlated studies both at home and abroad, we found that: heritage protection abroad started earlier than us, and it has already established thorough protection system, relevant protection mechanism, and also issued relevant protection laws and regulations. The technology which was utilized in protection abroad was not only limited in RS, GIS, GPS, VR, but also included many emerging technology such as using a computational fluid dynamics model to simulate the condition of temperature and humidity. The main body of this paper are going to talk about four parts: the first one is existing information system. In this part, we’ll introduce the <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> system, which was preliminarily built in 2007 in Baoguo Temple Ancient Architecture Museum. Using the modern digital computer information technology, researchers can gradually check and acquire the information of the material of relics, the condition of the structure stress and the natural environmental information, which may probably affect the cultural architecture. And this part may be divided into information collection, information management and exhibition. The second part is update scheme design of original <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> equipment and technology. Original <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> system of microenvironment is relatively independent and data haven’t been included in the management of the system. The original sensors transmit signal by wire and it would be interfered each other when they work together, and then it may cause congestion sometimes. Otherwise, the original system has been working continuously for seven years and it can’t adapt to the new computer hardware and operating system. Then, this part may be divided into data integration of information collection, equipment upgrading and adding of <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> point, upgrade of information management and exhibition system. The third part is scheme design of newly added <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> projects. After understanding the exposed disadvantages before, the added projects may include real-time information collection of groundwater level and quantity, surface water quantity and velocity, mountain landslide, vibration of the main hall, material of wood construction of the main hall, structure of the main hall, the condition of key components of the main hall, air pollution such as the concentration of SO 2, PM 2. 5, O 2, CO 2 and information collection of insect pest such as termite. After <b>collecting</b> <b>information</b> by many ways, the fourth part is to talk about comprehensive application of <b>collecting</b> <b>information.</b> This part may include comprehensive analysis of <b>collecting</b> <b>information,</b> management application of <b>collecting</b> <b>information,</b> publishing of <b>collecting</b> <b>information</b> and exhibition of <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> system. Therefore, through this research, we want to develop <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> work more perfectly and entirely and protect historical heritages more scientifically and effectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> of local {{government}} (Japanese cities, towns, villages) in the policy for school construction and to consider factor of this behavior. Through the questionnaire and collecting of data of local governments, the following points are made clear. First, when a local government intends to construct a school, it tends to <b>collect</b> the <b>information</b> about the other local governments which have constructed distinguished school. The means of <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> are visitation of other local governments or reading magazines for experts and so on. And, it not only visits the local governments in the prefecture which it belongs to but also the ones of the other prefectures. Second, the factors of this behavior are financial capability and <b>information</b> <b>collecting</b> in ordinary period when the school construction is not actual issue. In short, the lower the financial capability of local government is, or the more eagerly the local government <b>collects</b> the <b>information</b> of other local governments, the more passively the local government <b>collect</b> <b>information</b> of other governments when school construction become actual issue...|$|R

5|$|To {{describe}} {{the details of}} the attack and its background, Dumont de Montigny and Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, the leading 18th-century historians of Louisiana, drew on <b>information</b> <b>collected</b> from French women taken captive during the massacre. They explained that the Natchez had conspired with other nations but had attacked a few days earlier than the date agreed upon and that they had used a system of bundles of sticks held by each of the conspiring tribes in order to count down the number of days remaining until the strike. The undetected destruction of a couple of the sticks in the Natchez Grand Village derailed the count, although the reason for the lost sticks differed in each historian's account. The other nations called off their participation in the plot because of the Natchez' premature attack, and therefore the very existence of the conspiracy remained conjectural.|$|E
5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release <b>information</b> <b>collected</b> from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} six months, the Mexican Armed Forces were trying to hunt down Antonio Ezequiel, nearly {{capturing}} him in two occasions. The drug lord managed to avoid capture in several occasions by relying on the armed squadron known as Los Escorpiones (The Scorpions), which served as his private army. Among the first operations to capture the drug lord occurred on 31 March 2010, when the Mexican military confronted Antonio Ezequiel's bodyguards at Tres Culturas neighborhood in Matamoros. On 7 April 2010, there were two shootouts in Matamoros between Mexican marines {{and members of the}} Gulf Cartel. The intelligence <b>information</b> <b>collected</b> in these shootouts allowed the Mexican Armed Forces to locate the domicile of Antonio Ezequiel on 14 September 2010 at Fraccionamiento Río in Matamoros. But heavily armed gunmen of the Gulf Cartel intercepted the raid and protected their leader, who escaped in an armored vehicle. Two military men were killed in the operation, but the government managed to gain more information on the logistics of the inner circle of Antonio Ezequiel. On 1 November 2010, the Mexican authorities learned once again that Antonio Ezequiel was spending the night in a safe house at the Expo Fiesta Oriente neighborhood in Matamoros. But before the authorities got to the location, the drug lord left and avoided his capture.|$|E

5|$|No {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Adams or its glaciers existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams {{to be the source}} of some of the Columbia River basalt flows. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous caldera that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the anticline ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley. Modern geology has since dismissed this theory. From <b>information</b> <b>collected</b> on an outing of the Mazamas in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896. Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted geologist/glaciologist Harry Fielding Reid to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant glaciers, Pinnacle, Adams, Lava, Lyman, and Rusk with suggestions from Rusk. He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte. Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the Little Ice Age. The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.|$|E
