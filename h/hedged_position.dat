40|$|Existing {{research}} on the hedging effectiveness of currency futures assumes that futures positions are continuously adjusted. This is an unrealistic assumption in practice. In this paper we study the hedging effectiveness for futures positions which are not adjusted during the hedge period. For this purpose an out-of-sample approach is used. Three models are used to determine hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness. These are the minimum-variance model of Ederington (1979), the "-t model of Fishburn (1977), which is a model in which the disutility of a loss is minimized, and the Sharpe-ratio model of Howard and D'Antonio (1984, 1987). For the minimum-variance model and the "-t model {{it is found that}} the naively <b>hedged</b> <b>positions</b> yield a higher effectiveness than the unadjusted model-based <b>hedged</b> <b>positions.</b> For the Sharpe-ratio model it is found that both naively and model-based <b>hedged</b> <b>positions</b> lead to a lower hedging effectiveness than unhedged position...|$|R
40|$|We {{solve the}} problem of pricing and hedging Asian-style options on energy with a {{quadratic}} risk criterion when trading in the underlying future is restricted. Liquid trading in the future is only possible up to the start of a so-called delivery period. After the start of the delivery period, the <b>hedge</b> <b>positions</b> cannot be adjusted any more until maturity. This reflects the trading situation at the Nordic energy market Nord Pool, for example. We show that there exists a unique solution to this combined continuous–discrete quadratic hedging problem if the future price process is a special semimartingale with bounded mean–variance tradeoff. Additionally, under the assumption that the future price process is a local martingale, the <b>hedge</b> <b>positions</b> before the averaging period are inherited from the market specification without trading restriction. As an application, we consider three models and derive their quadratic <b>hedge</b> <b>positions</b> in explicit form: a simple Black–Scholes model with time-dependent volatility, the stochastic volatility model of Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard, and an exponential additive model. Based on an exponential spot price model driven by two NIG Lévy processes, we determine an exponential additive model for the future price by moment matching techniques.

40|$|Procuring {{material}} from commodity spot markets can flexibly fulfil a forward production demand, but {{increase the risk}} of high procurement cost due to spot price volatility. In this paper, a dynamic stack-and-roll hedging approach using futures contracts is proposed. The approach aims at mitigating the procurement cost risk and optimising the terminal revenue received from the procurement and hedging activities. It separates the procurement planning horizon into multiple stages, along with varying <b>hedging</b> <b>positions</b> in the nearby futures contracts. <b>Hedging</b> <b>positions</b> are adjusted in response to commodity price behaviour and contemporary perceived information about forward production demand. Guided by the mean-variance criteria over the terminal revenue, dynamic programming is applied to derive a closed-form solution for optimal <b>hedging</b> <b>positions</b> in a discrete-time Markovian setting. Numerical experiments are carried out to assess the proposed approach with explicit solution in a realistic stochastic environment. The price processes are modelled by a fractal nonlinear regression model using real price data of China’s commodity market, while demand information process is modelled by Bayesian formula. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms naive hedging strategy, and effectively mitigates the procurement cost risk. postprin...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to distinguish among different option pricing models that consider stochastic volatility and/or jumps based on a cross-section of European option prices. This can result in model misspecification. We analyze the hedging error induced by model misspecification and show that it can be economically significant in the cases of a delta hedge, a minimum-variance hedge, and a delta-vega hedge. Furthermore, we explain the surprisingly good performance of a simple ad-hoc Black-Scholes hedge. We compare realized hedging errors (an incorrect hedge model is applied) and anticipated hedging errors (the hedge model is the true one) and find that there are substantial differences between the two distributions, particularly depending on whether stochastic volatility is included in the hedge model. Therefore, hedging errors can be useful for identifying model misspecification.

Recent literature suggests that some firms vary <b>hedging</b> <b>positions</b> relative to their optimal position in a selective attempt to beat the market.

The picture is, however, not uniform throughout our seven spot commodities as there is one instance (cotton) for which the modeling of higher moments decreases welfare out-of-sample relative to the simpler OLS.

Unfortunately, a practical implementation of Definition 23 could prove difficult, especially when dealing with a global valuation problem, since it would require to keep track of past cash flows from the contract and gains from the hedging strategy (of course, provided the hedging strategy was implemented by the hedger). We thus contend that the proxy for the exit value p^m_t (x,C) := - p^e_t(x,C) could be more suitable for most practical purposes when facing a global valuation problem. Since the equality p^g_t(x,C)=p^e_t(x,C) holds when the valuation problem is local, the issue of the choice of a marking to market convention is clearly immaterial in that case.|$|E

Recently, significant tools {{have been developed for}} transferring longevity risk to the capital markets, bringing additional capacity, flex- ibility and transparency to complement existing insurance solutions. In particular, hedging longevity risk with index-based longevity hedges can have several advantages. Nevertheless, the difference between the in- surer’s mortality experience based on annuitant mortality and the hedged standardized index based on reference population mortality give rise to the so-called basis risk.

40|$|The use of futures {{contracts}} as {{hedging instruments}} to reduce risk {{has been the}} focus of much research. Various risk measures have been developed and have subsequently been employed in an effort to create hedging strategies and to calculate optimal hedge ratios. This thesis proposes a more generalized risk model to measure the risk of hedged assets. The five-parameter model presented herein assumes that each investor has a different target return, level of risk aversion, and degree of sensitivity to lower and higher partial moments. The optimal hedging activity for each investor should then seek to minimize the unique generalized risk measure. This paper utilizes an out-of-sample test on a <b>hedged</b> <b>position</b> in the S&P 500 index in the period from December 1982 to December 2004. Tests are conducted to determine whether the change of target returns and sensitivity parameters will affect optimal hedge ratios.

Also, mean returns of hedged portfolios are compared for various models. This thesis makes three important contributions. First, this study is the first to implement both higher and lower partial moments in the determination of optimal hedge ratios. Second, an out-of-sample test is considered while most studies use only in-sample tests.
