However, in September 2015 Doctor Who Magazine confirmed that the much-delayed DVD, now scheduled for October 26, was instead to contain tele-snap reconstructions of the missing episodes 1 and 4.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombing of}} Wewak, in which 100 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{were lost in}} August 1943, caused Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ) in Tokyo to reconsider whether Eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands could be held. Concluding that it could not, IGHQ authorised {{the commander of the}} Japanese Eighth Area Army to conduct a fighting withdrawal to a new defensive position in Western New Guinea, which it <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ready in 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for what he}} <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the final attack on The Gully, Vokes shifted the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the 1st Brigade. Vokes planned for an attack by The Carleton and York Regiment {{to be the last}} of the frontal assaults against The Gully. Should this attack fail, the 1st Brigade's Seaforth Highlanders and the Royal Canadian Regiment would move through Casa Berardi and outflank German defences, forcing a withdrawal from The Gully.|$|E

5|$|Japanese website ITmedia {{reviewed}} the beta version in September 2004. The reviewer enjoyed the experience overall and found communication with other players easy, but {{found a few}} faults with the game that they <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> resolved later, and generally found the female characters less effective in battle. During its first day of operation, the game registered 200,000 users, making it the best-selling mobile game up until that time, and was accessed 1.6 million times. According to Ito, by 2006, the game was still highly popular in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} {{charge was}} preceded by what Lee <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a powerful and well-concentrated cannonade of the Union center, destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralizing the Union infantry. But a combination of inept artillery leadership and defective equipment doomed the barrage from the beginning. Longstreet's corps artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander, had effective command of the field; Lee's artillery chief, Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, played little role other than to obstruct the effective placement of artillery from the other two corps. Despite Alexander's efforts, then, there was insufficient concentration of Confederate fire on the objective.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the NHL's {{collective}} bargaining agreement (CBA) expiring in September, teams reassigned players on two-way or entry-level contracts to minor league affiliates. The Canucks assigned 27 players, including Christopher Tanev, Eddie Lack, Zack Kassian and 2012 second-round draft pick Alexandre Mallet to the Chicago Wolves, while first round pick Brendan Gaunce was sent to his junior team, the Belleville Bulls. When the CBA expired on September 15, the NHL enforced a lockout until a new agreement could be reached. Canucks management posted {{a message from the}} team to the fans stating that they would continue with community initiatives throughout the lockout, which they <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> resolved as soon as possible, and thanked fans for their loyalty and patience. They also reduced their employees work week to four days and instituted a 20% pay reduction.|$|E

5|$|The club {{decided on}} 4 October 2013 to lay {{artificial}} turf on the field, which it <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in place {{ahead of the}} 2014 season. The club was especially concerned with the poor surface during March, April, October and November. It also cited the possibility of hosting all trainings at the stadium and that the field could be used 2,000 instead of 130 hours per year. The stadium hosted its second international match on 19 November 2013, when Norway was defeated 0–1 Scotland in a friendly match watched by 9,750 spectators. It {{was the first time}} since 2002 that a home Norway game was not played at the national stadium, Ullevaal Stadion.|$|E
5|$|After {{a search}} {{that had taken}} several years, Wheeler was able to secure a {{premises}} for the Institute of Archaeology: St. John's Lodge in Regent's Park, central London. Left empty since its use as a hospital during the First World War, the building was owned by the Crown and was controlled by the First Commissioner of Works, William Ormsby-Gore; he was very sympathetic to archaeology, and leased the building to the Institute at a low rent. The St. John's Lodge premises were officially opened on 29 April 1937. During his speech at the ceremony, the University of London's Vice-Chancellor Charles Reed Peers {{made it clear that}} the building was only intended as a temporary home for the Institute, which it was <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to move to Bloomsbury, the city's academic hub. In his speech, the university's Chancellor, Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, compared the new institution to both the Institute of Historical Research and the Courtauld Institute of Art.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{frequently}} quarrelled {{with fellow}} inventors and engineering peers over steam {{technology in the}} mid-1800s. His increasing frustration led to his premature publication {{of what he had}} <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the equivalent of his earlier manual for millers—the petulantly titled The Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer's Guide. The Steam Engineer's Guide was significantly shorter than this first book and less structured in its approach. A third of the book is devoted to an ongoing argument between Evans and John Stevens (another prominent steam engineer of the day), much of which had previously appeared in the journal The Medical Repository and to which now Evans added various additional criticisms of Stevens' contentions. Evans concludes his book by renouncing inventing and any further work on his designs, complaining of the ingratitude of the public and the unprofitability of the endeavour, although this would prove to be just one of many such assertions by Evans over the coming years. Regardless, the Steam Engineer's Guide proved to be a popular work, though not on the same scale as his guide to milling, however it was the first book in the United States to make accessible to anyone ideas and techniques for steam engineering.|$|E

25|$|When Wright {{published}} Black Power in 1954, Padmore {{was finishing}} {{a book that}} he <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> both a history and blueprint for African independence: Pan-Africanism or Communism?

25|$|Christopher Awdry {{said that}} he had other material, which he <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> published. He narrated new stories about the narrow gauge engines on 'Duncan Days' at the Talyllyn Railway in Wales, but there is no {{indication}} that these will be published.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 May General Winkelman {{remained}} moderately optimistic. He still assumed a firm defence line could eventually be established in North Brabant {{with the help of}} the French and expected good progress could be made in eliminating the airborne forces, while not being aware of any special danger to the Grebbe Line. During the day his <b>hopes</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dashed.|$|R

The result was an allegory in the Renaissance fashion, with the bound personification of Hope reaching skyward despite her bars.|$|R
25|$|On September 7, 1191, {{after the}} Battle of Arsuf, the Crusader army {{proceeded}} from Arsuf to Jaffa, which the Crusaders took and fortified. Jaffa, they <b>hoped,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{the base of}} operations in a drive to reconquer Jerusalem itself. As the winter of 1191–1192 approached, sporadic negotiations between Richard the Lionheart and Saladin were taken up, though without any immediate result.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Bell hired Arthur M. Young, {{a talented}} inventor, to provide {{expertise}} for helicopter research and development. It was {{the foundation for}} what Bell <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a broader economic base for his company that was not dependent on government contracts. The Bell 30 was their first full-size helicopter (first flight December 29, 1942) and the Bell 47 became the first helicopter in the world rated by a civil aviation authority, becoming a civilian and military success.|$|E

The mammoth hotel was not completed until 1897. When finished, the hotel featured over five hundred rooms in a seven-story structure spanning five acres. Features included a theater for five hundred, where the chess tournament was held, a ballroom, a solarium, two gymnasiums, bowling alleys and an indoor pool. The hotel grounds were equally impressive, featuring a nine-hole golf course and a man-made lake.|$|E
25|$|In April 1947, de Gaulle made {{a renewed}} attempt to {{transform}} the political scene by creating a Rassemblement du Peuple Français (Rally of the French People, or RPF), which he <b>hoped</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to move above the familiar party squabbles of the parliamentary system. Despite the new party's taking 40% of vote in local elections and 121 seats in 1951, lacking its own press and access to television, its support ebbed away. In May 1953, he withdrew again from active politics, though the RPF lingered until September 1955.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} oversights of the entire system {{was the lack of}} {{adequate}} air-sea rescue organisation. The RAF had started organising a system in 1940 with High Speed Launches (HSLs) based on flying boat bases and at a number of overseas locations, but it was still believed that the amount of cross-Channel traffic meant that {{there was no need for}} a rescue service to cover these areas. Downed pilots and aircrew, it was <b>hoped,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> picked up by any boats or ships which happened to be passing by. Otherwise the local life boat would be alerted, assuming someone had seen the pilot going into the water.|$|E
