40|$|DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{occur at}} random upon {{genotoxic}} stresses and represent obbligatory intermediates during physiological DNA rearrangement {{events such as}} the V(D) J recombination in the immune system. DSBs, which are among the most toxic DNA lesions, are preferentially repaired by the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway in higher eukaryotes. Failure to properly repair <b>DSBs</b> <b>results</b> in genetic instability, developmental delay, and various forms of immunodeficiency. Here we describe five patients with growth retardation, microcephaly, and immunodeficiency characterized by a profound T + B lymphocytopenia. An increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation, a defective V(D) J recombination, and an impaired DNA-end ligation process both in vivo and in vitro are indicative of a general DNA repair defect in these patients. All five patients carry mutations in the Cernunnos gene, which was identified through cDNA functional complementation cloning. Cernunnos/XLF represents a novel DNA repair factor essential for the NHEJ pathway...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDNA {{double strand}} breaks (DSBs) are highly toxic to the cells and {{accumulation}} of <b>DSBs</b> <b>results</b> in several detrimental effects in various cellular processes {{which can lead}} to neurological, immunological and developmental disorders. Failure of the repair of DSBs spurs mutagenesis and is a driver of tumorigenesis, thus underscoring the importance of the accurate repair of DSBs. Two major canonical DSB repair pathways are the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways. 53 BP 1 and BRCA 1 are the key mediator proteins which coordinate with other components of the DNA repair machinery in the NHEJ and HR pathways respectively, and their exclusive recruitment to DNA breaks/ends potentially decides the choice of repair by either NHEJ or HR. Recently, Rap 1 interacting factor 1 has been identified as {{an important component of the}} DNA repair pathway which acts downstream of the ATM/ 53 BP 1 to inhibit the 5 ′– 3 ′ end resection of broken DNA ends, in-turn facilitating NHEJ repair and inhibiting homology directed repair. Rif 1 is conserved from yeast to humans but its function has evolved from telomere length regulation in yeast to the maintenance of genome integrity in mammalian cells. Recently its role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has been expanded to include the regulation of chromatin structure, replication timing and intra-S phase checkpoint. We present a summary of these important findings highlighting the various aspects of Rif 1 functions and discuss the key implications for genomic integrity...|$|E
40|$|An assay {{that allows}} {{measurement}} of absolute induction frequencies for DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs) in defined {{regions of the}} genome and that quantitates rejoining of correct DNA ends {{has been used to}} study repair of dsbs in normal human fibroblasts after x-irradiation. The approach involves hybridization of single-copy DNA probes to Not I restriction fragments separated according to size by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Induction of dsbs is quantitated from the decrease in the intensity of the hybridizing restriction fragment and an accumulation of a smear below the band. Rejoining of <b>dsbs</b> <b>results</b> in reconstitution of the intact restriction fragment only if correct DNA ends are joined. By comparing results from this technique with results from a conventional electrophoresis assay that detects all rejoining events, it is possible to quantitate the misrejoining frequency. Three Not I fragments on the long arm of chromosome 21 were investigated with regard to dsb induction, yielding an identical induction rate of 5. 8 X 10 (- 3) break per megabase pair per Gy. Correct dsb rejoining was measured for two of these Not I fragments after initial doses of 80 and 160 Gy. The misrejoining frequency was about 25 % for both fragments and was independent of dose. This result appears to be representative for the whole genome as shown by analysis of the entire Not I fragment distribution. The correct rejoining events primarily occurred within the first 2 h, while the misrejoining kinetics included a much slower component, with about half of the events occurring between 2 and 24 h. These misrejoining kinetics are similar to those previously reported for production of exchange aberrations in interphase chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|All genetic markers from phage T 2 are {{partially}} {{excluded from}} the progeny of mixed infections with the related phage T 4 (general, or phage exclusion). Several loci, including gene 56 of T 2, are more dramatically excluded, being present in only ∼ 1 % of the progeny. This phenomenon {{is referred to as}} localized marker exclusion. Gene 69 is adjacent to gene 56 of T 4 but is absent in T 2, being replaced by completely nonhomologous DNA. We describe SegF, a novel site-specific DNA endonuclease encoded by gene 69, which is similar to GIY–YIG homing endonucleases of group I introns. Interestingly, SegF preferentially cleaves gene 56 of T 2, both in vitro and in vivo, compared with that of phage T 4. Repair of the double-strand break (<b>DSB)</b> <b>results</b> in the predominance of T 4 genes 56 and segF in the progeny, with exclusion of the corresponding T 2 sequences. Localized exclusion of T 2 gene 56 is dependent on full-length SegF and is likely analogous to group I intron homing, in which repair of a <b>DSB</b> <b>results</b> in coconversion of markers in the flanking DNA. Phage T 4 has many optional homing endonuclease genes similar to segF, whereas similar endonuclease genes are relatively rare in other members of the T-even family of bacteriophages. We propose that the general advantage enjoyed by T 4 phage, over almost all of its relatives, is a cumulative effect of many of these localized events...|$|R

To determine whether mismatch repair acts on the template chromosome in a directed fashion to restore mismatches to the initial sequence, these experiments were repeated in mismatch repair-defective (pms 1, mlh 1, and msh 2) backgrounds.

40|$|Abstract Background Mammalian cells employ {{at least}} two subpathways of non-homologous end-joining for the repair of {{ionizing}} radiation induced DNA double strand breaks: The canonical DNA-PK-dependent form of non-homologous end-joining (D-NHEJ) and an alternative, slowly operating, error-prone backup pathway (B-NHEJ). In contrast to D-NHEJ, which operates with similar efficiency throughout the cell cycle, B-NHEJ operates more efficiently in G 2 -phase. Notably, B-NHEJ also shows strong and as of yet unexplained dependency on growth activity and is markedly compromised in serum-deprived cells, or in cells that enter the plateau-phase of growth. The molecular mechanisms underpinning this response remain unknown. Since chromatin structure or changes in chromatin structure are prime candidate-B-NHEJ-modulators, we study here the role of chromatin hyperacetylation, either by HDAC 2 knockdown or treatment with the HDAC inhibitor TSA, on the repair by B-NHEJ of IR-induced <b>DSBs.</b> <b>Results</b> siRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC 2 fails to provoke histone hyperacetylation in Lig 4 -/- MEFs and has no detectable effect on B-NHEJ function. Treatment with TSA that inhibits multiple HDACs causes efficient, reversible chromatin hyperacetylation in Lig 4 -/- MEFs, {{as well as in}} human HCT 116 Lig 4 -/- cells and the human glioma cell line M 059 K. The IR yield of DSBs in TSA-treated cells remains similar to that of untreated cells despite the expected chromatin relaxation. In addition, chromatin hyperacetylation leaves unchanged repair of DSBs by B-NHEJ in irradiated exponentially growing, or plateau-phase cells. Notably, under the experimental conditions employed here, chromatin hyperacetylation fails to detectably modulate B-NHEJ in M 059 K cells as well. Conclusions In summary, the results show that chromatin acetylation or deacetylation does not affect the kinetics of alternative NHEJ in all types of cells examined both in exponentially growing and serum deprived cultures. We conclude that parameters beyond chromatin acetylation determine B-NHEJ efficiency in the plateau-phase of growth. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleolus}} is {{the largest}} functional domain within the nucleus and {{is the site of}} ribosome biogenesis. It has a distinct structure and houses ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) transcription, pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing, and pre-ribosome assembly. The rDNA repeats encode the major rRNA species and are organized into large head-to-tail tandem arrays located at the nucleolar organiser regions (NORs). In humans, the ~ 300 rDNA repeats are distributed among five NORs on the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes. In most human cells a majority of NORs, but usually not all, are active, and coalesce to form between 1 and 3 nucleoli. Nucleoli are spatially isolated {{from the rest of the}} nucleoplasm by a shell of heterochromatin. The enormous demand for ribosomes by actively growing cells means that rDNA repeats are the most actively transcribed genes in all eukaryotic cells. The resulting vulnerability of rDNA combined with emerging roles for the nucleolus in stress sensing prompted us to investigate the response of nucleoli to the presence of double strand breaks (DSBs) in the rDNA. The 28 S rRNA coding sequences contain the 15 bp recognition sequence for the homing endonuclease I-PpoI. I have developed a broadly applicable mRNA transfection procedure that can efficiently introduce I-PpoI into a wide variety of human cell lines, thus inducing DSBs specifically within the rDNA repeats. Analysis of how nucleoli deal with DSBs in the rDNA has uncovered a complex response. The presence of <b>DSBs</b> <b>results</b> in activation of ATM and inhibition of transcription. As a direct consequence of transcriptional inhibition, rDNA repeats withdraw from the nucleolar interior to caps located at the nucleolar periphery. Importantly each cap represents the rDNA from a single NOR. Positioning of damaged NORs on the nucleolar surface renders their damaged rDNA accessible to repair factors, normally excluded from the nucleolar interior. Evidence suggests that repair is carried out by homologous recombination (HR), independently of the stage in the cell cycle. This complex nucleolar response highlights the fact that a spectrum of DSB repair mechanisms have evolved to maintain integrity of the genome...|$|E
40|$|The DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{are among}} the most {{cytotoxic}} types of DNA damage, which if left unrepaired can lead to mutations or gross chromosomal aberrations and promote the onset of diseases associated with genomic instability, such as cancer. One of the most discernible hallmarks of the cellular response to DSBs is the accumulation and local concentration of a plethora of DNA damage signalling and repair proteins {{in the vicinity of the}} lesion, initiated by the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of H 2 AX at Ser 139 (the phosphorylated H 2 AX protein being named γ-H 2 AX), the recruitment of the macromolecular complex made up of MRE 11, RAD 50 and nibrin (also named NBN) (MRN), and the generation of distinct nuclear compartments called ionizing radiation (IR) -induced foci (IRIF). The assembly of proteins at the DSB-flanking chromatin occurs in a highly ordered and strictly hierarchical fashion. To a large extent, this is achieved by regulation of protein-protein interactions triggered by a variety of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation. Nibrin is composed of three regions: the N-terminal region contains the FHA domain, and two BRCT tandem domains (tBRCT); the central region, contains Ser residues which are phosphorylated by ATM kinase in response to IR; and the C-terminal region, containing the MRE 11 -binding domain and the ATM-binding motif. The tBRCT domains, present in more than 50 proteins involved in the DDR and in cell cycle control, are important mediators of phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions in processes related to cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair functions. Mutations at the homozygous or compound heterozygous status within the nibrin coding gene (NBN) are responsible for the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS; OMIM # 251260), a rare genetic disorder characterized by an autosomic recessive inheritance, whose signs are, among others, microcephaly, immunodeficiency, spontaneous chromosomal instability, and sensitivity to IR. The majority of NBS patients are homozygous for the 657 del 5 hypomorphic mutation. This mutation splits up the tBRCT domain and determines the synthesis of two fragments with molecular weights of 26 and 70 kDa. The 26 kDa fragment includes the FHA and the BRCT 1 domains, while the 70 kDa fragment contains the BRCT 2 domain and the C-terminal region. A further pathogenic mutation localized within the nibrin tBRCT domains is the Arg 215 Trp substitution. Remarkably, both the 657 del 5 and Arg 215 Trp NBN mutations are responsible for cancer susceptibility both at the homozygous and heterozygous status. The aim of the first year of this PhD project was to shed light of the role of nibrin tBRCT domains in the DSB sensing and signaling. Results obtained indicated that both mutations, although not altering the assembly of the MRN complex, affect the MRE 11 IRIF formation and the DSB signaling impairing the phosphorylation of both ATM and ATM downstream targets (e. g., SMC 1 and p 53). We further demonstrated that the cleavage of the tBRCT domains of nibrin by the 657 del 5 mutation affects the DNA damage response less than the Arg 215 Trp mutation. Indeed, the 70 kDa NBN fragment, arising from the 657 del 5 mutation, maintains the capability to interact with MRE 11 and γ-H 2 AX, as well as to form IRIF. Overall, data obtained indicated that the tBRCT domains of nibrin are involved in the proper activation of the DDR, altering the localization of repair proteins at the DSB, as well as the DNA damage signaling. Furthermore, we observed that the Arg 215 Trp mutation impairs γ-H 2 AX binding, suggesting the presence of a direct interaction between nibrin tBRCT and γ-H 2 AX. However, data obtained by literature are in contrast with this result, suggesting that nibrin- γ-H 2 AX interaction is indirect, being mediated by MDC 1 protein. To further clarify this aspect, nibrin proteins carrying either naturaloccurring or artificial mutations (i. e., Arg 215 Trp and Lys 160 Met), all perturbing the relative geometry of the tBRCT domains, have been expressed, and spectrofluorimetric analyses have been performed. Results obtained seems to suggest that the mutations altering the putative tBRCT binding pocket also affect γ-H 2 AX binding, supporting the notion that the integrity of the tBRCT domains is pivotal for the proper interaction with the phosphorylated histone. Since nibrin has several important roles in the DDR, some of which resulting compromised by the pathogenic 657 del 5 homozygous mutation of NBN, during the second year of the PhD project an unsupervised proteomic approach, based upon strep-tag affinity chromatography, SDS-PAGE separation, and shotgun digestion of protein bands followed by MS/MS protein identification was performed. This allowed us to characterize the interactome of the full-length nibrin compared to that of the p 26 and p 70 fragments arising from the 657 del 5 mutation, both in presence and in absence of IR- induced <b>DSBs.</b> <b>Results</b> obtained indicate the occurrence of previously unreported protein interacting partners of the full-length nibrin and of the p 26 fragment containing the FHA/BRCT 1 domains, especially after cell irradiation. In particular, data shed light on new possible roles of nibrin in several biological processes as DSBs repair, cell cycle checkpoint activation, maintenance of chromosomal integrity, protein biosynthesis and antioxidant responses. Furthermore, we identified the interactors of the p 26 fragment, which results involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, in the DDR, and in protein folding and degradation. In particular, we demonstrate that p 26 interacts with PARP 1 after IR, and this interaction exerts an inhibitory effect on PARP 1 activity as measured by NAD+ levels. Furthermore, the p 26 -PARP 1 interaction seems to be responsible for the persistence of ROS, and in turn of DSBs, at long time from IR (i. e., 24 h). Since some of the newly identified interactors of the p 26 and p 70 fragments have not been found to interact with the full-length NBN, these interactions may somehow contribute to the key biological phenomena underpinning NBS. Both nibrin and MRE 11 are components of the PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), nonmembrane-bound organelles within the nuclei of mammalian cells involved in several biological processes relevant to tumor suppression (e. g., induction of apoptosis, cell cycle checkpoints control, transcriptional regulation, posttranslational modification, chromatin remodeling, DDR, and DNA repair). PML-NBs increase in number and change their sub-nuclear distribution in response to DNA damage, and this response is dependent upon early DNA break-sensing proteins. Many proteins involved in DDR localize to PML-NBs either constitutively or conditionally, including the DNA damage-sensing proteins ATM, ATR, BRCA 1, CHK 2, p 53, the MRN complex, and TopBP 1, as well as multiple proteins that participate in DSBs repair. It is known that the physical integrity of PML-NBs is affected by DNA damaging agents like IR, thus leading to the hypothesis that PML-NBs may act as DNA damage sensors, their physical disruption representing a mechanism of DNA damage signaling. The disruption of PMLNBs consequent to the expression of the oncogenic PML-RARa fusion protein is responsible for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) onset. The aim of the third year of this PhD project was to study the relationship existing between PML-NBs integrity and IR-induced DSBs sensing, signaling and repair using both in vitro and in vivo models. Results obtained suggested that the expression of the PML-RARα fusion protein in APL and APL-like human cell lines (i. e., NB 4 and U 937 /PR 9 cells, respectively), in human primary cells freshly established from APL patients, as well as in a pre-blastic PML-RARα knock-in mouse model, causes a delayed sensing and signaling of the IR-induced DSBs. This result supports the hypothesis that a PML-NBs loss of integrity causes a dispersion of the proteins involved in the DDR, determining inability to respond quickly and correctly to DSBs. Remarkably, the pre-blastic PML-RARa knock-in model allowed us to study the effect of PML-RARα in the absence of any epigenetic and/or genetic alteration responsible for the clonal expansion typical of leukemic cells. In conclusion, results obtained highlighted the key role played by nibrin and PML in several phases of the DDR. Notably, alterations in DNA repair pathways that arise during tumor development can make some cancer cells reliant on a reduced set of DNA repair pathways for survival. There is evidence that drugs that inhibit one of these pathways in such tumors could prove useful as single-agent therapies, with the potential advantage that this approach could be selective for tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatment strategies and this may be achieved by shading light on cancer biology in order to identify key pathways involved in the response to and repair of DNA damage...|$|E

30|$|DNA {{double strand}} breaks (<b>DSBs)</b> <b>result</b> as a {{consequence}} of the disassembly of the DNA double helix leading to the disruption of the stability of the genome. DSBs not only ensue from normal cellular metabolism, in the form of reactive oxygen species that can oxidize DNA bases [1, 2], but can also be generated during physiological processes like chromosome replication, meiotic recombination and DNA replication transcription collision [3 – 7]. Regardless of how DSBs are formed, faithful repair of these breaks are absolutely essential for maintenance of genome integrity. Failure to repair DSBs can lead to unwanted consequences, such as loss of genetic information, chromosomal rearrangements and even cell death. Cells have evolved with conserved recombination mediated genome editing pathways as a mean for repairing DSBs and restarting replication forks, thus allowing genome duplication to continue [8]. Recombination based mechanisms are crucial for both the repair and tolerance of DNA damage that vexes both strands of the double helix [9].|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are repaired in mammalian cells are unclear. Studies in bacteria and yeasts indicate that both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and recombination are required for their removal and that double-strand breaks are produced as repair intermediates in yeast cells. The role of NER and recombination in the repair of ICLs induced by nitrogen mustard (HN 2) was investigated using Chinese hamster ovary mutant cell lines. XPF and ERCC 1 mutants (defective in genes required for NER and some types of recombination) and XRCC 2 and XRCC 3 mutants (defective in RAD 51 -related homologous recombination genes) were highly sensitive to HN 2. Cell lines defective in other genes involved in NER (XPB, XPD, and XPG), together with a mutant defective in nonhomologous end joining (XRCC 5), showed only mild sensitivity. In agreement with their extreme sensitivity, the XPF and ERCC 1 mutants were defective in the incision or “unhooking” step of ICL repair. In contrast, the other mutants defective in NER activities, the XRCC 2 and XRCC 3 mutants, and the XRCC 5 mutant all showed normal unhooking kinetics. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{were found to be}} induced following nitrogen mustard treatment.

We analyzed patterns of genetic interactions uncovered during comprehensive genome-wide analyses in yeast to probe how histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) protein complexes interact. The genetic interaction data unveil an underappreciated role of HDACs in maintaining cellular viability, and led us to show that deacetylation of the histone variant Htz 1 p at Lys 14 is mediated by Hda 1 p.

40|$|INO 80 and SWR 1 are two {{closely related}} ATP-dependent {{chromatin}} remodeling complexes that share several subunits. Ino 80 {{was reported to}} be recruited to the HO endonuclease-induced double-strand break (DSB) at the budding yeast mating-type locus, MAT. We find Swr 1 similarly recruited in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation of H 2 A (γH 2 AX). This is not unique to cleavage at MAT; both Swr 1 and Ino 80 bind near an induced DSB on chromosome XV. Whereas Swr 1 incorporates the histone variant H 2 A. Z into chromatin at promoters, H 2 A. Z levels do not increase at DSBs. Instead, H 2 A. Z, γH 2 AX and core histones are coordinately removed near the break in an INO 80 -dependent, but SWR 1 -independent, manner. Mutations in INO 80 -specific subunits Arp 8 or Nhp 10 impair the binding of Mre 11 nuclease, yKu 80 and ATR-related Mec 1 kinase at the <b>DSB,</b> <b>resulting</b> in defective end-processing and checkpoint activation. In contrast, Mre 11 binding, end-resection and checkpoint activation were normal in the swr 1 strain, but yKu 80 loading and error-free end-joining were impaired. Thus, these two related chromatin remodelers have distinct roles in DSB repair and checkpoint activation...|$|R
40|$|DNA is {{packaged}} into chromatin, {{a highly}} compacted DNA-protein complex; therefore, all cellular processes {{that use the}} DNA as a template, including DNA repair, require {{a high degree of}} coordination between the DNA-repair machinery and chromatin modification/remodelling, which regulates the accessibility of DNA in chromatin. Recent studies have implicated histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes and chromatin acetylation in DNA repair; however, the precise underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the HAT cofactor Trrap and Tip 60 HAT bind to the chromatin surrounding sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vivo. Trrap depletion impairs both DNA-damage-induced histone H 4 hyperacetylation and accumulation of repair molecules at sites of <b>DSBs,</b> <b>resulting</b> in defective homologous recombination (HR) repair, albeit with the presence of a functional ATM-dependent DNA-damage signalling cascade. Importantly, the impaired loading of repair proteins and the defect in DNA repair in Trrap-deficient cells can be counteracted by chromatin relaxation, indicating that the DNA-repair defect that was observed in the absence of Trrap is due to impeded chromatin accessibility at sites of DNA breaks. Thus, these data reveal that cells may use the same basic mechanism involving HAT complexes to regulate distinct cellular processes, such as transcription and DNA repair...|$|R
40|$|Illegitimate {{recombination}} (IR) is {{the process}} by which two DNA molecules not sharing homology to each other are joined. In Kluyveromyces lactis, integration of heterologous DNA occurred very frequently therefore constituting an excellent model organism to study IR. IR was completely dependent on the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway for DNA double strand break (DSB) repair and we detected no other pathways capable of mediating IR. NHEJ was very versatile, capable of repairing both blunt and non-complementary ends efficiently. Mapping the locations of genomic IR-events revealed target site preferences, in which intergenic regions (IGRs) and ribosomal DNA were overrepresented six-fold compared to open reading frames (ORFs). The IGR-events occurred predominantly within transcriptional regulatory regions. In a rad 52 mutant strain IR still preferentially occurred at IGRs, indicating that DSBs in ORFs were not primarily repaired by homologous recombination (HR). Introduction of ectopic <b>DSBs</b> <b>resulted</b> in the efficient targeting of IR to these sites, strongly suggesting that IR occurred at spontaneous mitotic DSBs. The targeting efficiency was equal when ectopic breaks were introduced in an ORF or an IGR. We propose that spontaneous DSBs arise more frequently in transcriptional regulatory regions and in rDNA and such DSBs can be mapped by analyzing IR target sites...|$|R
40|$|Protein kinases of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase-like kinase family, {{originally}} {{known to}} act in maintaining genomic integrity via DNA repair pathways, {{have been shown to}} also function in telomere maintenance. Here we focus on the functional role of DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of the essential mammalian telomeric DNA binding protein TRF 2, which coordinates the assembly of the proteinaceous cap to disguise the chromosome end from being recognized as a double-stand break (<b>DSB).</b> Previous <b>results</b> suggested a link between the transient induction of human TRF 2 phosphorylation at threonine 188 (T 188) by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein kinase (ATM) and the DNA damage response. Here, we report evidence that X-ray-induced phosphorylation of TRF 2 at T 188 plays a role in the fast pathway of DNA <b>DSB</b> repair. These <b>results</b> connect the highly transient induction of human TRF 2 phosphorylation to the DNA damage response machinery. Thus, we find that a protein known to function in telomere maintenance, TRF 2, also plays a functional role in DNA DSB repair...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{lethality}} {{is largely}} attributed to radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). A range of structural complexity is predicted for radiation-induced DSBs. However, this lesion {{has never been}} analyzed in isolation at the molecular level. To address this problem, we have created authentic site-specific radiation-induced DSBs in plasmid DNA by triplex-forming oligonucleotide-targeted 125 I decay. No significant difference in DSB yield was observed after irradiation in {{the presence or absence}} of the radical scavenger DMSO, suggesting that DSB formation is a result of the direct effect of the radiation. A restriction fragment terminated by the DSB was isolated and probed with the Escherichia coli DNA repair enzyme endonuclease IV (endo IV), which recognizes apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. Enzymatic probing demonstrated clustering of AP sites within 10 bases of the 125 I-targeted base in the DNA duplex. Our results suggest scavengeable radicals may not play a large role in the generation of AP sites associated with DSB formation, because at least 30 % of all fragments have endo IV-sensitive sites, regardless of irradiation conditions. An internal control fragment recovered from the 125 I linearized plasmid did not exhibit endo IV sensitivity in excess of that observed for a similar fragment recovered from an undamaged plasmid. Thus, AP site clustering proximal to the <b>DSB</b> <b>resulted</b> from the 125 I decays responsible for DSB formation and was not due to untargeted background irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Etoposide is {{a cancer}} drug that induces strand breaks in {{cellular}} DNA by inhibiting topoisomerase II (topoII) religation of cleaved DNA molecules. Although DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II always produces topoisomerase II-linked DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), {{the action of}} etoposide also results in single-strand breaks (SSBs), since religation of the two strands are independently inhibited by etoposide. In addition, recent studies indicate that topoisomerase II-linked DSBs remain undetected unless topoisomerase II is removed to produce free DSBs. Methodology/Principal Findings: To examine etoposide-induced DNA damage in more detail we compared the relative amount of SSBs and DSBs, survival and H 2 AX phosphorylation in cells treated with etoposide or calicheamicin, a drug that produces free DSBs and SSBs. With this combination of methods we found that only 3 % of the DNA strand breaks induced by etoposide were DSBs. By comparing the level of DSBs, H 2 AX phosphorylation and toxicity induced by etoposide and calicheamicin, we found that only 10 % of etoposide-induced <b>DSBs</b> <b>resulted</b> in histone H 2 AX phosphorylation and toxicity. There was a close match between toxicity and histone H 2 AX phosphorylation for calicheamicin and etoposide suggesting that the few etoposide-induced DSBs that activated H 2 AX phosphorylation were responsible for toxicity. Conclusions/Significance: These results show that only 0. 3 % of all strand breaks produced by etoposide activate H 2 A...|$|R
40|$|Cells of {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae are delayed in the G 2 {{phase of the}} cell cycle {{following}} chromosomal DNA damage. This arrest is RAD 9 -dependent and suggests a signaling mechanism(s) between chromosomal lesions and cell cycling. We examined the global nature of growth inhibition caused by an HO endonuclease-induced double-strand break (DSB) at a 45 -bp YZ sequence (from MAT YZ) in a non-yeast region of a dispensable single-copy plasmid. The presence of an unrepaired <b>DSB</b> <b>results</b> in cellular death even though the plasmid is dispensable. Loss of cell viability is partially dependent on the RAD 9 gene product. Following induction of the DSB, 40 % of RAD+ and 49 % of rad 9 delta cells [including both unbudded (G 1) and budded (S plus G 2) cells] did not progress further in the cell cycle. The remaining RAD+ cells progressed to form microcolonies (< 30 cells) containing aberrantly shaped inviable cells. For the rad 9 delta mutant, {{the majority of the}} remaining cells produced viable colonies accounting for the greater survival of the rad 9 delta strain. Based on the profound effects of a single nonchromosomal DNA lesion, this system provides a convenient means for studying the signaling effects of a DNA lesion, as well as for designing strategies for modulating cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli dam mutants are {{sensitized}} to the cytotoxic {{action of}} base analogs, cisplatin and N-methyl-N 2 ̆ 7 -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), while their mismatch repair (MMR) -deficient derivatives are tolerant to these agents. We showed previously, using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), that MMR-mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{are produced by}} cisplatin in dam recB(Ts) cells at the non-permissive temperature. We demonstrate here {{that the majority of}} these DSBs require DNA replication for their formation, consistent with a model in which replication forks collapse at nicks or gaps formed during MMR. DSBs were also detected in dam recB(Ts) ada ogt cells exposed to MNNG in a dose- and MMR-dependent manner. In contrast to cisplatin, the formation of these DSBs was not affected by DNA replication and it is proposed that two separate mechanisms <b>result</b> in <b>DSB</b> formation. Replication-independent DSBs arise from overlapping base excision and MMR repair tracts on complementary strands and constitute the majority of detectable DSBs in dam recB(Ts) ada ogt cells exposed to MNNG. Replication-dependent <b>DSBs</b> <b>result</b> from replication fork collapse at O(6) -methylguanine (O(6) -meG) base pairs undergoing MMR futile cycling {{and are more likely to}} contribute to cytotoxicity.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} two different beamforming algorithms, the delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB) and the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer using both objective and subjective metrics. Simulations and measurements have been performed on near-field scenarios with an ad-hoc microphone array. Microphones from multiple smartphones are used to record the audio. Smartphone microphones are designed to have a distinct directivty gain pattern. In this research, the MVDR algorithm is extended to compensate for these directivity responses. In simulated scenarios, without the directivities of the microphones, the average improvement in segmental signal to noise ratio is 5. 3 dB for DSB and 11. 9 dB for MVDR. In all the simulated scenarios, the MVDR beamforming algorithm outperforms the <b>DSB</b> algorithm. <b>Results</b> from measurements in an office room scenario only showed an improvement when applying the <b>DSB</b> algorithm. The <b>results</b> from measurements in the anechoic chamber at the TU Delft show 1. 9 dB improvement for DSB and 2. 8 dB for MVDR.

They investigated the susceptibility of DNA bonds to radiation damage by irradiating pUC 18 circular plasmid DNA as a thin-film in an aqueous solution using a lamp emitting ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation. Based on the observation of intense bands associated with CH 2 /CH 3 and P-O-H bending modes, O-C cleavage was found to be {{the most common form of}} DNA damage. From the TERS spectra it could be confirmed that the <b>DSBs</b> mainly <b>resulted</b> from 3 '- and 5 '- bonds of deoxyribose upon UVC radiation exposure.|$|R
40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} (IR) triggers many signaling pathways {{stemming from}} DNA damage, and, independently, from extra-nuclear events. To generate radio-mimetic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) without and minimizing {{the effects on}} extra-nuclear radiation targets, human (p 53 +) glioma and carcinoma cells containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) - substituted DNA were treated with Hoechst 33258 followed by long wave-length UV (UV-A) (BrdU photolysis). BrdU photolysis resulted in well-controlled, dose-dependent generation of DSBs equivalent to 0. 2 - 20 Gy of IR, as detected by pulse-field gel electrophoresis, accompanied by dose-dependent H 2 AX phosphorylation at ser- 139 and ATM phosphorylation at ser- 1981, indicating ATM activation. Furthermore, BrdU photolysis increased phosphorylation of Chk 2 (at thr- 68) and p 53 (at ser- 15). p 53 phosphorylation was reduced by the ATM inhibitor caffeine, and H 2 AX phosphorylation was greatly reduced in AT cells, confirming that phosphorylation was primarily ATM-dependent. We also {{examined the effects of}} BrdU photolysis on the major cellular signaling ERK pathways. Interestingly, low-dose (≤ 2 Gy-equivalents) BrdU photolysis stimulated ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation whereas higher doses (≥ 5 Gy eq.) resulted in Em 1 / 2 dephosphorylation. ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation was ATM-dependent, whereas dephosphorylation was ATM-independent and DSBs dose-dependent. Thus ERK 1 / 2 appear to be both positively and negatively regulated by ATM depending on the severity of the insult to DNA. In summary, few DSBs trigger ATM-dependent ERK 1 / 2 pro-survival signals whereas more <b>DSBs</b> <b>result</b> in ERK 1 / 2 dephosphorylation consistent with a switch from pro-survival to anti-survival signaling that might affect DSBs repair...|$|R
40|$|Telomeres {{distinguish}} chromosome ends from double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{and prevent}} chromosome fusion. However, telomeres can also interfere with DNA repair, {{as shown by}} a deficiency in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) {{and an increase in}} large deletions at telomeric DSBs. The sensitivity of telomeric regions to DSBs is important in the cellular response to ionizing radiation and oncogene-induced replication stress, either by preventing cell division in normal cells, or by promoting chromosome instability in cancer cells. We have previously proposed that the telomeric protein TRF 2 causes the sensitivity of telomeric regions to DSBs, either through its inhibition of ATM, or by promoting the processing of DSBs as though they are telomeres, which is independent of ATM. Our current study addresses the mechanism responsible for the deficiency in repair of DSBs near telomeres by combining assays for large deletions, NHEJ, small deletions, and gross chromosome rearrangements (GCRs) to compare the types of events <b>resulting</b> from <b>DSBs</b> at interstitial and telomeric <b>DSBs.</b> Our <b>results</b> confirm the sensitivity of telomeric regions to DSBs by demonstrating that the frequency of GCRs is greatly increased at DSBs near telomeres and that the role of ATM in DSB repair is very different at interstitial and telomeric DSBs. Unlike at interstitial DSBs, a deficiency in ATM decreases NHEJ and small deletions at telomeric DSBs, while it increases large deletions. These results strongly suggest that ATM is functional near telomeres and is involved in end protection at telomeric DSBs, but is not required for the extensive resection at telomeric <b>DSBs.</b> The <b>results</b> support our model in which th...|$|R
