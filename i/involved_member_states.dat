40|$|In June 2009, a new EU {{directive}} on {{the promotion}} of renewable energy sources (RES) entered into effect. The directive 2009 / 28 /EC, provides for three cooperation mechanisms that will allow member states to achieve their national RES target in cooperation with other member states: statistical transfer, joint projects, and joint support schemes. This article analyses {{the pros and cons}} of the three mechanisms and explores design options for their implementation through strategic and economic questions: How to counterbalance the major drawbacks of each mechanism? How to reflect a balance of costs and benefits between the <b>involved</b> <b>member</b> <b>states?</b> The analysis identifies a number of design options that respond to these questions, e. g. long term contracts to ensure sufficient flexibility for statistical transfers, a coordinated, standardised joint project approach to increase transparency in the European market, and a stepwise harmonisation of joint support schemes that is based on a cost-effective accounting approach. One conclusion is that the three cooperation mechanisms are closely interlinked. One can consider their relation to be a gradual transition from member state cooperation under fully closed national support systems in case of statistical transfers, to cooperation under fully open national support systems in a joint support scheme.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present the {{phenomenon}} of posting workers within the EU {{in the context of}} the freedom to provide services. The author introduces the de lege lata legal framework in a complex and chronological manner, taking into consideration the motives and political pressure behind key modifications. Accordingly, the thesis examines relevant Treaty provisions, case law and its evolution, key secondary acts, as well as the relation of such sources to legal acts which address posting workers in an indirect manner. The author focuses on the analysis of existing key provisions, their practical impact and insufficiencies. However, she also approaches the topic from the de lege ferenda perspective by presenting the ongoing revision of the current legal framework and by considering other potential changes which could improve the regulation of posted workers in the future. Furthermore, the thesis demonstrates the complexity of posting workers by drawing attention to the colliding interests of <b>involved</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and parties, showing the sensitivity of the subject. This underlines the fact that the phenomenon cannot be separated from its political context and is condemned to a constant balancing of two colliding interests - the freedom to provide services and social protection of posted [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to examine three inter-connected themes which have emerged in the evolutionary development of the Union as an international actor. The first theme relates {{to the relationship between}} internal and external powers and policies. The degree to which the Union’s external powers reflect or mirror internal competence is not only a question of their extent; it extends to the objectives and content of the policies pursued by the Union internally and externally; the nature or fundamental legal characteristics of the external dimension to the Union legal order. To what extent are external powers an extension of internal powers and objectives? The expansion of the scope and extent of the Union’s external powers (whether express or implied) has of course reflected not only the expansion of areas of activity internally but also the changing preoccupations of the Union, in particular as regards its place in the world. It is also true that external commitments and activity are having an increasing impact on the development of internal policies. As always within the Community and Union systems, issues of competence are intimately connected with both the inter-institutional and the institution–Member State balance of power. The second theme of this chapter traces how the classic approach to pre-emption, whereby the occupation of a field of legislative activity by the Community legal order excludes concurrent Member State competence, has given way to a wide acceptance of shared powers in external and internal spheres of competence, as well as the legal principles and structural solutions by which shared competence is managed. The emergent international identity of the Union and the factors that shape it form the third theme. A number of factors are at play here, including constitutional constraints on Union competence, the essential autonomy of the Union legal order within the wider context of international law and legal relations, the raised profile (and raised expectations) of the Union especially through the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the complexity of relations between the ‘Pillars’ between 1993 and 2009 and the legacy of the Pillars present in the Union’s constitutional structure following the Treaty of Lisbon. The evolution of the Union as an effective international actor will depend on the emergence of sufficiently flexible and robust internal constitutional structures. Amid the angst over policy fragmentation, the failure of the Constitutional Treaty, and the lack of institutional cohesion, it is possible to see a process of integration in the formation of an international identity for the Union. The terms ‘integration’ and ‘identity’ are not, however, intended to imply a monolithic structure. Highly diverse patterns of decision-making, different power-structures between the actors <b>involved</b> (<b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> Commission, Council, European Council, European Parliament), the wide variety of (formal and informal, binding and non-binding) instruments used, the connections between external policies and between internal and external aspects of policies, are all elements of a complex multi-dimensional construction. The complexity and diversity are necessary but need to operate within a framework which manages to be both flexible and coherent, and this chapter will end by assessing some {{of the ways in which}} the most recent Treaty reform process responds to this need...|$|E

40|$|This is a reportThe {{notion of}} independence, as {{commonly}} used, is somewhat fuzzy. Some public bodies, {{such as the}} Federal Reserve System in the United States or the European Central Bank are independent. The Court of Justice of European Communities is also an independent and autonomous institution. These institutions have characteristics consistent with the formal definition {{of the notion of}} independence. They are independent, in the limits of their missions, because they are not subject to outside control. They are separate and do not take instructions from other public bodies. They are financially autonomous and the members of these institutions themselves are qualified and independent. In relation to the field of research, the meaning of independence does not seem excessively problematic. As for the central banks or the judicial institution, a certain amount of independence –independence of the entity, that of the researchers and of the research itself– would be vital for the impartiality {{and the quality of the}} research process and its results. Therefore, an independent accident investigation body should not be subject to outside control in the pursuit of its mission. It should be separate from other bodies, public or private, having financial or other interests in the results of its investigations. It should not take instructions from other bodies or outside personalities. It should have adequate control over the use of its investigation results. Finally, it should be financially autonomous and its members be qualified and independent themselves. In the United States, the contrast between National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is most interesting. While NTSB has a solid reputation as an investigation body, wearing several hats puts NHTSA in a somewhat uncomfortable position. In that particular case, the main problem seems to arise from the ties it has to the manufacturers as the authority responsible for the safety regulations and for the safety investigation. In Europe there are several Directives or Regulations, as well as a White Paper, a Communication from the Commission and a Work Programme, that concern transport safety. In the field of civil aviation, there are two specific European Directives: 1. Council Directive 94 / 56 /EC of 21 November 1994 establishing the fundamental principles governing the investigation of civil aviation accidents and incidents; and 2. Directive 2003 / 42 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2003 on occurrence reporting in civil aviation The purpose of a safety (or accident) investigation, the authorised methods and practices, as well as the definitions have been set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) since the 1944 Chicago Convention. Accident investigations in Europe and worldwide rely on the Chicago Convention Annex Bibliographical Analysis Project co-financed by the European Commission, Directorate-General Transport and Energy sn_inrets_wp 4 _d 4. 1 _ 14 / 11 / 2005 _final Page 5 13. The first version of the Annex 13 was drafted in 1951; the current version (9 th) was agreed upon in 2001. The European Directives’ focus is on the structural, financial and functional independence of the investigating body. National laws adapting the international and European requirements concerning the independence of the safety investigation and of the investigation body exist in all studied Member States, namely in Germany, France, Italy, Finland and United Kingdom. All these Member States have an independent civil aviation accident investigation body. In the field of maritime transport, there is one general European Directive: 1. Council Directive 1999 / 35 /EC of 29 April 1999 on a system of mandatory surveys for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high-speed passenger craft services The purpose of a safety (or accident) investigation, the methods and practices, as well as the definitions have been set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The accident investigation in Europe and worldwide tends to respect the IMO Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents, agreed upon by the Resolution A 849 / 20 from 1997. The European Directive structures the maritime transport in a quite general manner. It is not specific to accident investigation and does not require the Member States to establish an independent investigation body. However, the Directive’s aim is to ensure the harmonised enforcement of some principles agreed upon within the IMO, particularly the IMO Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents. The IMO Code states that ideally an investigation on a marine casualty should be separate from, and independent of, any other form of investigation. Therefore, while the Member States have no formal obligation to establish an independent investigation body for the investigation of marine casualties, this remains an objective. National laws adapting the international and European recommendations concerning the independence of the safety investigation and of the investigation body exist in Germany, France, Finland and United Kingdom. In the field of rail transport, there are three general Directives: 1. Council Directive 91 / 440 /EEC on the development of the Community's railways amended by the 2. Directive 2001 / 12 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2001; and 3. Directive 2004 / 49 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on safety on the Community's railways The purpose of a safety (or accident) investigation, the methods and practices as well as the definitions are set by the 2004 Directive. It requires the Member States to establish an independent accident investigation body. The European Directives’ structure the rail transport in a quite general manner. The International Union of Railways (UIC) uses the European definitions for its Bibliographical Analysis Project co-financed by the European Commission, Directorate-General Transport and Energy sn_inrets_wp 4 _d 4. 1 _ 14 / 11 / 2005 _final Page 6 Safety Data Base project. National laws adapting the European requirements concerning the independence of the safety investigation and of the investigation body exist or will shortly be acted in all studied Member States. In the field of road transport, there are no European Directives or Regulations nor any other international legal framework. National laws on safety (or accident) investigation and the investigation body exist in France and in Finland. Italy, Germany and United Kingdom have opted for separate investigation bodies for different transport modes. France has opted for separate investigation bodies for civil aviation and maritime, while all the land transports are investigated by one body. Finland has an investigation body for civil aviation and all major accidents, whether they involve a mode of transport or not, and another system for investigating road and cross-country accidents. It is clear that road accident investigations differ from the accident investigation in other transport modes. Only two of the Member States, whose accident investigation practices have been assessed, have a legal national framework applicable to road accident safety investigation. In France, the decision on opening a safety investigation on a road accident is taken by the Minister of Transport. In 2004, only three accidents involving road traffic vehicles were investigated. In Finland, all fatal road accidents and some non-fatal road accidents are investigated. On average, some 500 road accidents, of which 370 fatal, are investigated annually. The bulk of the research in road safety in all <b>involved</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> with the exception of Finland, is therefore made by research bodies that do not have the legal status of a body responsible for conducting safety (or accident) investigations...|$|E

The regional approach to market integration delivered important results in areas such as coordination among national transmission system operators, implementation of market-based mechanisms for cross-border transmission capacity allocation and transparency. Furthermore, the inclusive governance process lead by ERGEG gave voice to all relevant stakeholders. However, there are indications that the regional model reached its limit when faced with the objective of coordinating day-ahead and real-time markets. The unanimity approach at the regional level made the intra-regional decision-making process extremely slow. Further, inter-regional integration issues have not been solved yet and attempts to tackle them by prioritising projects in some Regions weakened the pluralistic attributes of the regional model. The Third Legislative Energy Package has the potential to overcome some of these shortcomings by empowering pan-European institutions (ENTSO and ACER) and by <b>involving</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in the decision making process. Some weaknesses of the second-package, though, persist in the new framework. First, there are no provisions ensuring that ENTSO will have appropriate incentives to act in the interest of European consumers. Second, the Third Package perpetuates the separation between within-country congestion management – which remains a national issue – and cross-border congestion management – to be dealt with at the EU level. This two-tier approach is inconsistent with the highly meshed nature of the European network and is likely to result in inefficient market design.

40|$|Regulation (EC) No 178 / 2002 {{establishes}} a {{rapid alert system}} for food and feed, as a network managed by the Commission and <b>involving</b> the <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority. It is necessary to have a complete view of the “system”. Inside the reg. 178 / 2002 you can see articles: 35 (Rapid alert system); in Chapter IV (Rapid alert system, crisis management and emergencies) : Section I (Rapid alert system), articles 50 - 52; Section 2 (Emergencies), articles 53 - 54; Section 3 (Crisis management), articles 55 - 56. Therefore, this “system” should not be reduced only into the articles 50 - 52 of the Reg. 178 / 2002, involving regulations, procedures, conditions, providing into a complex interaction about different subjects public and private. From some, or specific aspects of the question other regulations take off again, for example: Regulations No 852 / 2004; 853 / 2004; 854 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004, laying down hygiene rules; Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073 / 2005 of 15 November 2005, on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs; Regulation No 183 / 2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 January 2005, laying down requirements for feed; Regulation No 1829 / 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003, on genetically modified food and feed. Article 29 of Regulation No 183 / 2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 January 2005, laying down requirements for feed hygiene extends {{the aim of the}} RASFF to serious risks to animal health and to the environment; and Commission Regulation (EU) No 16 / 2011 of 10 January 2011, laying down implementing measures for the Rapid alert system for food and feed, in accordance with Article 51 of Reg. 178 / 2002 requires the Commission to establish implementing measures for Article 50 of that Regulation, <b>involving</b> the <b>member</b> <b>States</b> and Food Safety Authority, managed by the Commission, in particular as regards the specific conditions and procedures enforceable to the transmission of notifications and supplementary information...|$|R
40|$|The EU has {{considerably}} progressed {{in fostering}} a common {{vision for the}} European Security Strategy (ESS). It moved beyond the national priorities of individual <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to collectively consider {{the interests of the}} European Union (EU) as a whole, and to separately articulate its external (2003) [1] and internal (2010) [2] security priorities. At the same time, more challenging tasks still lie ahead, as highlighted by the High Representative report of June 2015. Primarily, they relate to: •facilitating a joined-up vision, merging external and internal dimensions of security; •developing a joined-up inter-institutional approach <b>involving</b> all <b>Members</b> <b>States</b> and EU institutions, and connecting policy instruments and geographical silos into a European Security Model (ESM); and •fostering sustainable partnerships (including of strategic interests) with regional and global actors. If implemented, the strategy has the potential to enable the EU to extend its security goals beyond its borders, and to move closer to its aspiration to become a global (rather than regional) security player. It therefore comes as no surprise that the Commission has been tasked by the Council to develop a comprehensive strategy review by June 2016, taking all institutional views and current developments of the very complex, contested and inter-connected world into account...|$|R
