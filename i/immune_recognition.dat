2500|$|Human {{sperm and}} eggs also lack {{molecules}} for the <b>immune</b> <b>recognition</b> of [...] "self". These immune markers are {{also known as}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens or more specifically in humans as human leukocyte antigens (HLA)). Therefore, a major question is how are human gametes recognized by immune effector cells. Specifically, their lack of MHC recognition markers should trigger the immune system, resulting in lysis of both sperm and eggs by leukocytes known as natural killer, or NK cells. These cells target and kill other cells lacking such MHC markers, a concept known as [...] "missing self". One distinct possibility is that sperm and eggs are recognized via oligosaccharides expressed on their surfaces. For example, human gametes are coated with carbohydrate sequences that have been implicated in the suppression of NK cell mediated responses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{boundaries}} of the potential to add and eliminate PNGSs are naively explored by growing viral populations following each new infection. While the transmitting host has developed a neutralizing antibody response to gp120, the newly infected host lacks <b>immune</b> <b>recognition</b> of the virus. Sequence data shows that initial viral variants in an immunologically naïve host have few glycosylation sites and shorter exposed variable loops. This may facilitate viral ability to bind host cell receptors. As the host immune system develops antibodies against gp120, immune pressures seem to select for increased glycosylation, particularly on the exposed variable loops of gp120. [...] Consequently, insertions in env, which confer more PNGSs on gp120 may be more tolerated by the virus as higher glycan density promotes the viral ability to evade antibodies and thus promotes higher viral fitness. [...] In considering how much PNGS density could theoretically change, {{there may be an}} upper bound to PNGS number due to its inhibition of gp120 folding, but if the PNGS number decreases substantially, then the virus is too easily detected by neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, a stabilizing selection balance between low and high glycan densities is likely established. A lower number of bulky glycans improves viral replication efficiency and higher number on the exposed loops aids host immune evasion via disguise.|$|E
2500|$|Glycosylation is {{the process}} by which a {{carbohydrate}} is covalently attached to a target macromolecule, typically proteins and lipids. [...] This modification serves various functions. [...] For instance, some proteins do not fold correctly unless they are glycosylated. [...] In other cases, proteins are not stable unless they contain oligosaccharides linked at the amide nitrogen of certain asparagine. The influence of glycosylation on the folding and stability of glycoprotein is twofold. Firstly, the highly soluble glycans may have a direct physicochemical stabilisation effect. Secondly, N-linked glycan mediate a critical quality control check point in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Glycosylation also plays a role in cell-cell adhesion (a mechanism employed by cells of the immune system) via sugar-binding proteins called lectins, which recognize specific carbohydrate moieties. Glycosylation is an important parameter in the optimization of many glycoprotein-based drugs such as monoclonal antibodies. Glycosylation also underpins the ABO blood group system. It is {{the presence or absence of}} glycosyltransferases which dictates which blood group antigens are presented and hence what antibody specificities are exhibited. This immunological role may well have driven the diversification of glycan heterogeneity and creates a barrier to zoonotic transmission of viruses. [...] In addition, glycosylation is often used by viruses to shield the underlying viral protein from <b>immune</b> <b>recognition.</b> A significant example is the dense glycan shield of the envelope spike of the human immunodeficiency virus.|$|E

50|$|The {{immune system}} senses {{pathogens}} and damage and subsequently initiates a response that effectively protects the organism from harm. Specific receptor systems evolved to detect distress {{early on and}} to initiate the appropriate responses. Different classes of receptors sense various molecular entities. While the immune system employs individually created receptors (recombination of genetic elements) to detect foreign proteins (adaptive immune system, e.g. T cell and B cell receptors and antibodies), the innate arm {{of the immune system}} applies germline-encoded receptors to detect microbial or damaged molecules including nucleic acid (DNA and RNA). Innate immune sensing of nucleic acids is essential for <b>immune</b> <b>recognition</b> of viruses and has been the scientific focus of the Hartmann group for more than 17 years.
