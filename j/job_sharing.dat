[...] Some of these options include educational classes, such as classes on the wellbeing of a newborn or family, put on by the company, that {{has been shown to}} be associated with less reported work–family conflict. [...] A room that would allow for breast milk pumping could be one of the most helpful work–family policies for a company and family. [...] A 1995 study found 86% of breastfed infants experienced no illness during the 1 year duration of the study [...] and another study found breastfeeding infants decreases the chances of acute infections. [...] Breastfeeding will help the company because breastfeeding has been linked to lower health care costs. [...] This prolonged breast feeding saved one company $240,000 in health care savings and $60,000 in reduced absenteeism. [...] Some other work–family policies that could help the family and company include various scheduling options, such as paid vacation, flex schedules, working from home, part-time work, and <b>job</b> <b>sharing.</b> [...] Employees who have this flexibility increase productivity and have less work–family spill over [...] and they are less likely to miss work due to family related issues.|$|E
50|$|EuropeThe United Kingdom has {{implemented}} <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> for a while.

50|$|<b>Job</b> <b>sharing</b> {{became even}} more {{prevalent}} during the 2000s, as women have succeeded professionally in greater numbers and proportionally seek out alternative work arrangements. in the early 2000s, two important factors began to push the <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> movement. The access to information became increasingly easy to access and the demographics in the workforce began to change. The birth of the World Wide Web {{made it easier for}} companies and job share participants to share information through web tools like email, instant messaging, web portals, online databases and multi-user domains, these web tools allowed employees to share work in a more collaborative environment and in an asynchronous manner. The ever-changing demographics in the United States also drove the <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> arrangement. With most of the baby boomer generation leaving the United States workforce and retiring, generation X and Y transitioned their lifestyles to an even better balance between family and work. Gender has also impacted the work force demographics: in 2004, women made up 59% of the workforce, with 50% of them in management professional positions. The banking, insurance, teaching and library professions are cited as more commonly using <b>job</b> <b>sharing.</b> Some companies that use <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> include New York Life Insurance Company, Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, and Walgreens drugstores.|$|E

50|$|DisadvantagesJob share can be {{conflicting}} if the job share participants/employees are {{not open}} to a mutual agreement to distribute everything from salary, workload and time off. <b>Job</b> <b>sharing</b> {{can also be a}} disadvantage if the employee cannot afford the part-time wages or benefits. It is also possible that <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> can make an employee feel less adequate over time and cause less productivity over time. If the job share arrangement is not effective, the transition period to finding another partner could be disruptive and detrimental to the remaining employee. If proper communication and effort does not happen between the job share participants, job share can be a negative experience because the coworkers can not be held accountable to the same expectations, shifting the delicate balance of the job share arrangement.|$|E
