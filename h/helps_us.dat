25|$|Traditional work {{in biology}} {{has focused on}} {{studying}} individual parts of cell signaling pathways. Systems biology research <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> to understand the underlying structure of cell signaling networks and how changes in these networks may affect the transmission and flow of information (signal transduction). Such networks are complex systems in their organization and may exhibit a number of emergent properties including bistability and ultrasensitivity. Analysis of cell signaling networks requires a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches including the development and analysis of simulations and modeling. Long-range allostery is often a significant component of cell signaling events.|$|E
25|$|The amygdaloid complex <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> {{interpret}} {{emotional experience}} and act appropriately. This {{is conducive to}} directing the individual's attention to the most pertinent stimuli in a potentially dangerous situation so that the individual can take self-protective measures. Proper amygdaloid complex function requires input from the thalamus, which creates a thalamoamygdala pathway capable of bypassing the intense scrutiny of incoming stimuli to enable quick responses in a potentially life-threatening situation. Typically, situations assessed as non-threatening are disregarded. In sleep paralysis, however, those pathways can become over-excited and move {{into a state of}} hyper-vigilance in which the mind perceives every external stimulus as a threat.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{and marine}} environments on Earth are {{favorable}} for fossil preservation, especially where the sediments {{they left behind}} are rich in carbonates or clays. Hundreds of highland craters on Mars have horizontally layered, sedimentary rocks that may have formed in lakes. CRISM has taken many targeted observations of these rocks to measure their mineralogy and how the minerals vary between layers. Variation between layers <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> to understand {{the sequence of events}} that formed the sedimentary rocks. The Mars Orbiter Camera found that where valley networks empty into craters, commonly the craters contain fan-shaped deposits. However it was not completely clear if the fans formed by sediment deposition on dry crater floors (alluvial fans) or in crater lakes (deltas). CRISM discovered that in the fans' lowermost layers, there are concentrated deposits of clay. More clay occurs beyond the end of the fans on the crater floors, and in some cases there is also opal. On Earth, the lowermost layers of deltas are called bottom set beds, and they are made of clays that settled out of inflowing river water in quiet, deep parts of the lakes. This discovery supports the idea that many fans formed in crater lakes where, potentially, evidence for habitable environments could be preserved.|$|E

25|$|The Alexandrian {{contribution}} to Christian mysticism centers on Origen and Clement of Alexandria. Clement {{was an early}} Christian humanist who argued that reason {{is the most important}} aspect of human existence and that gnosis (not something we can attain by ourselves, but the gift of Christ) <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> find the spiritual realities that are hidden behind the natural world and within the scriptures. Given the importance of reason, Clement stresses apatheia as a reasonable ordering of our passions in order to live within God's love, which is seen as a form of truth. Origen, who had a lasting influence on Eastern Christian thought, further develops the idea that the spiritual realities can be found through allegorical readings of the scriptures (along the lines of Jewish aggadah tradition), but he focuses his attention on the Cross and on the importance of imitating Christ through the Cross, especially through spiritual combat and asceticism. Origen stresses the importance of combining intellect and virtue (theoria and praxis) in our spiritual exercises, drawing on the image of Moses and Aaron leading the Israelites through the wilderness, and he describes our union with God as the marriage of our souls with Christ the Logos, using the wedding imagery from the Song of Songs. Alexandrian mysticism developed alongside Hermeticism and Neoplatonism and therefore share some of the same ideas, images, etc. in spite of their differences.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

500|$|Feminist {{economics}} often {{assert that}} power relations exist within the economy, and therefore, must be assessed in economic models {{in ways that}} they previously have been overlooked.

[...] No mention is made of the power inequities in the exchange which tend to give the employer power over the employee." [...] These power relations often favor men and there is [...] "never any mention made of the particular difficulties that confront women in the workplace." [...] Consequently, [...] "Understanding power and patriarchy <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> to analyze how male-dominated economic institutions actually function and why women are often at a disadvantage in the workplace." [...] Feminist economists often extend these criticisms to many aspects of the social world, arguing that power relations are an endemic and important feature of society.|$|E
500|$|In 1981 Daniel Dennett had {{formulated}} another {{argument against}} the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, {{on the basis of}} the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as [...] "It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left." [...] We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude [...] "I believe I can kick this guy's butt" [...] in Mentalese.

500|$|Morleigh Steinberg {{has been}} working {{together}} with Japanese choreographer and dancer Oguri since the early 1990s, documenting Oguri's severe, Butoh-derived style of dance in various environments, including Joshua Tree National Park and Los Angeles. She made her directorial debut in 1994 with the short subject Traveling Light, which featured the interpretive dance of Oguri and her sister Roxanne, {{who is also a}} modern dancer and choreographer and married to Oguri. A review of the film on DVD Talk said that [...] "Moreleigh Steinberg's dance-filled daydream about relationships in freefall will be difficult for some to appreciate (the mostly modern dance is very insular and odd), but the brilliant cinematic mood created by the director <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> over the slightly strange nature of it all." [...] (In 2006 the film was included in a DVD release of the Francis Ford Coppola-produced claymation film of William S. Burroughs' The Junky's Christmas.) Despite having no formal training in it, Steinberg also began working as a lighting designer, serving in that role for 1995 and 1997 productions of Oguri works.

500|$|Motivated {{by her own}} {{battle to}} gain {{credibility}} as {{a woman in a}} field dominated by male astronomers, [...] Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. She faced discouraging comments on her choice of study throughout her life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues. In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy. She and Burbidge advocated together for more women in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on review panels, and in academic searches. She said that despite her struggles with the NAS, she continued to be dissatisfied with the number of women who are elected each year, and called it [...] "the saddest part of [...] life". Rubin was Jewish, and saw no conflict between science and religion. In an interview, she stated: [...] "In my own life, my science and my religion are separate.

500|$|Shaw {{maintained}} a provocative and frequently self-contradictory attitude to Shakespeare (whose name {{he insisted on}} spelling [...] "Shakespear"). Many found him difficult to take seriously on the subject; Duff Cooper observed that by attacking Shakespeare, [...] "it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain." [...] Shaw was, nevertheless, a knowledgeable Shakespearian, and {{in an article in}} which he wrote, [...] "With the single exception of Homer, there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his," [...] he also said, [...] "But I am bound to add that I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespear. He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers, and will outlast a thousand more". Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare: undiscriminating [...] "Bardolaters", and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over-elaborate productions. He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare, and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes: The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, Cymbeline Refinished and Shakes versus Shav. In a 2001 analysis of Shaw's Shakespearian criticisms, Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw, who was no academic, saw Shakespeare's plays—like all theatre—from an author's practical point of view: [...] "Shaw <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> {{to get away from the}} Romantics' picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius, one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss, or with a specific staging and cast of actors." ...|$|E
