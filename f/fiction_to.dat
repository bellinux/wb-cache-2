5|$|Hamm {{acknowledged}} {{science fiction}} was a niche genre {{when the original}} film was made, and that it used science <b>fiction</b> <b>to</b> make topical issues more approachable. Hamm had the same feelings for this remake. Originally, Hamm's character was French and named Michel. Although he is interested in math and science, Hamm found his technical dialogue difficult and had to film his lines repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|The {{editorial}} work was largely done by Sloane, but Gernsback retained final say over the fiction content. Two consultants, Conrad A. Brandt and Wilbur C. Whitehead, were hired {{to help find}} <b>fiction</b> <b>to</b> reprint. Frank R. Paul, {{who had worked with}} Gernsback as early as 1914, became the cover artist; Paul had produced many illustrations for the fiction in The Electrical Experimenter. Amazing was issued in the large bedsheet format, 8.5 × 11.75 in (216 × 298mm), {{the same size as the}} technical magazines. It was an immediate success and by the following March reached a circulation of 150,000.|$|E
5|$|Three stages {{have been}} {{identified}} in the composition of the work. The first of these stages would have been based primarily on poems actually composed by Narihira, although the background details provided were not necessarily historical. The second saw poems added to the first layer that were not necessarily by Narihira, and had a higher proportion of <b>fiction</b> <b>to</b> fact. The third and final stage saw some later author adding the use of Narihira's name, and treating him as a legendary figure of the past.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the work}} of {{classical}} writers such as Plutarch, knowledge of the Osiris myth was preserved even after {{the middle of the}} first millennium AD, when Egyptian religion ceased to exist and knowledge of the writing systems that were originally used to record the myth were lost. The myth remained a major part of Western impressions of ancient Egypt. In modern times, when understanding of Egyptian beliefs is informed by the original Egyptian sources, the story continues to influence and inspire new ideas, from works of <b>fiction</b> <b>to</b> scholarly speculation and new religious movements.|$|E
5|$|Bruno Alfred Döblin (10 August 1878 – 26 June 1957) was a German novelist, essayist, and doctor, {{best known}} for his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929). A {{prolific}} writer whose œuvre spans {{more than half a century}} and a wide variety of literary movements and styles, Döblin is one of the most important figures of German literary modernism. His complete works comprise over a dozen novels ranging in genre from historical novels to science <b>fiction</b> <b>to</b> novels about the modern metropolis; several dramas, radio plays, and screenplays; a true crime story; a travel account; two book-length philosophical treatises; scores of essays on politics, religion, art, and society; and numerous letters—his complete works, republished by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and Fischer Verlag, span more than thirty volumes. His first published novel, Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lung (The Three Leaps of Wang Lun), appeared in 1915 and his final novel, Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of a Long Night) was published in 1956, one year before his death.|$|E
5|$|Children's author Alison Uttley (1884–1976) {{was born}} at Cromford; her {{well-known}} novel A Traveller in Time, set in Dethick, recounts the Babington Plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots, from imprisonment. Crichton Porteous (1901–91) set several books in specific locations in the Peak; Toad Hole, Lucky Columbell and Broken River, for example, are set in the Derwent Valley. More recently, Geraldine Brooks's first novel, Year of Wonders (2001), blends fact and <b>fiction</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the story of}} the plague village of Eyam, which also inspired Children of Winter by children's novelist Berlie Doherty (b. 1943). Doherty has set several other works in the Peak, including Deep Secret, based on the drowning of the villages of Derwent and Ashopton by the Ladybower Reservoir, and Blue John, inspired by the Blue John Cavern at Castleton.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, American novelists were expanding <b>fiction</b> <b>to</b> encompass both high and low life and sometimes connected to the naturalist school of realism. In her stories and novels, Edith Wharton (1862–1937) scrutinized the upper-class, Eastern-seaboard society in which she had grown up. One of her finest books, The Age of Innocence, centers on a man who chooses to marry a conventional, socially acceptable woman rather than a fascinating outsider.|$|E
