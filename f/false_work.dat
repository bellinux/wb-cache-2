[...] Khobragade was subject to prosecution {{at the time of her}} arrest because she had only consular immunity (which gives one immunity from prosecution only for acts committed in connection with official duties) and not the more extensive diplomatic immunity. After her arrest, the Indian government moved Khobragade to the Indian's mission to the United Nations, upgrading her status and conferring diplomatic immunity on her; as a result, the federal indictment against Khobragade was dismissed in March 2014, although the door was left open to refiling of charges.

5000|$|The first {{bridge was}} built in 1903. Chittenden {{describes}} the process in his 1915 history of Yellowstone: The Arch Bridge over the Yellowstone. Until 1903 there was no bridge across the Yellowstone {{in the vicinity of}} the Falls and the right bank of the Grand Canyon was practically inaccessible to the public. As some of the finest views were to be had from that side (Artist Point, for example, which Moran chose for his painting), it was considered desirable to provide means of getting across. This section of the river, immediately above the Upper Palls, presented numerous sites on which an ordinary bridge could be built at no great cost; but the remarkable scenic attractions of the rapids made any ordinary structure seem out of place. Accordingly it was decided to build something worthy of the situation and a single arch of slender profile was selected as the type of structure. The exact form was a matter of careful study in order to get the lines which would appeal to the eye as meeting the artistic requirements. The span of the bridge is 120 feet and the rise of the arch is 15 feet. The height of the roadway at the center is 43 feet above low water in the river. The abutments are natural rock. The arch contains ten steel girders, which give it great strength. The body of the structure is solid concrete. The forms for the ornamental railing were manufactured in St. Paul, but the railing itself was molded in rich Portland cement mortar in place. The most difficult feature of the work, and the only one involving serious risk, was the building of the <b>false</b> <b>work</b> to support the forms for the concrete while in plastic condition. It was necessary to build a temporary pier in the center of the stream in the swiftest part of the rapids with the Upper Falls of the Yellowstone only a little way below. There would be small chance of escape for any one falling into the stream; but the chance was taken by one man who fell from the work, but, providentially, was caught in an eddy a little way below the bridge site and carried into shallow water near the bank. The concrete work, contrary to usual practice at that time with such large masses, was placed in one continuous operation. This would have been simple enough with a mechanical mixer, but was much more difficult where the mixing was done by hand. Elaborate preparations were made. All the material—gravel, broken rock, sand, cement—was gathered and distributed at convenient points about the site. A date was chosen in full moon in August and a temporary electric lighting plant was installed. A force of 150 men was assembled from the various road crews and divided into three shifts. When all was ready, the concrete mixing was begun and continued without intermission in 8-hour shifts for 74 hours, or until the work was complete. Hiram M.

40|$|Self-Propelled Modular Transport (SPMT) {{vehicles}} {{were introduced to}} the bridge industry in 2008. They are used to transport super-heavy bridge decks from the prefabrication site to the construction site. SPMTs provide a wide range of functions including the ability to pivot 360 degrees, lift, carry and set large loads at walking speed. The use of SPMTs reduces traffic disruption and improves worker safety. Because of the heavy loads inherent in a bridge movement project, the dynamic effects on the bridge and <b>false</b> <b>work</b> must be taken into account. Up to this point, no conclusive research has been performed to standardize the design of a bridge deck and <b>false</b> <b>work</b> in order to compensate for the dynamic loads experienced during the transportation and installation processes. This project seeks to determine the “worst case” situation, and to represent the dynamic effects by equations in order to standardize the project design process. Experiments were conducted by testing SPMT machines under different loads and dynamic situations. Accelerometers were installed on the SPMT’s in order to quantify the dynamic forces on the bridge deck and <b>false</b> <b>work.</b> “Up-Down”, “Start and Stop”, “Rotation”, “Turn”, and “Long Run” scenarios were tested in order to discover the “worst case” scenario. Based on the results of these experiments, equations were developed to predict the dynamic forces experienced throughout the transportation and installation process. These equations, developed for the “worst case” scenario, will standardize the process of SPMT bridge construction and improve the safety and efficiency of future projects...|$|E

For this structure, the steel truss and concrete deck are constructed on the spanning cables.
