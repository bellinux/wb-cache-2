40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{architecture}} of any {{place and time}} is an outcome of many factors- religious doctrines, ritual focus, social set-up, resource availability, climatic impact and economic constraint. India offers a great variety {{in each of the}} above-mentioned factor. Yet if we closely analyse, more or less the social set-up is similar in all regions in a particular time period. The variation occurred due to the climate, resource availability and economics. If we analyse the traditional residences of various regions, we find similarities in their spatial <b>hierarchy</b> and <b>arrangement,</b> but each presents before us a unique example responding most innovatively to the local climate. In this paper we have tried to bring forth the climate responsiveness and appropriateness of the Havelis of Shekhawati, Rajasthan, India...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} systems exhibiting {{compositional}} patterning at the nanoscale, so far {{assumed to be}} due to some kind of ordered phase segregation, can be understood instead in terms of coherent, single phase ordering of minority motifs, caused by some constrained drive for uniformity. The essential features of this type of arrangements can be reproduced using a superspace construction typical of uniformity-driven orderings, which only requires the knowledge of the modulation vectors observed in the diffraction patterns. The idea is discussed in terms of a simple two dimensional lattice-gas model that simulates a binary system in which the dilution of the minority component is favored. This simple model already exhibits a <b>hierarchy</b> of <b>arrangements</b> similar to the experimentally observed nano-chessboard and nano-diamond patterns, which are described as occupational modulated structures with two independent modulation wave vectors and simple step-like occupation modulation functions.

40|$|Improving heat {{transfer}} in hybrid nano/microelectronic systems is a challenge, mainly {{due to the}} high thermal boundary resistance (TBR) across the interface. Herein, we focus on gallium nitride (GaN) /diamond interface—as a model system with various high power, high temperature, and optoelectronic applications—and perform extensive reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, decoding the interplay between the pillar length, size, shape, <b>hierarchy,</b> density, <b>arrangement,</b> system size, and the interfacial {{heat transfer}} mechanisms to substantially reduce TBR in GaN-on-diamond devices. We found that changing the conventional planar interface to nanoengineered, interlaced architecture with optimal geometry results in > 80 % reduction in TBR. Moreover, introduction of conformal graphene buffer layer further reduces the TBR by ∼ 33 %. Our findings demonstrate that the enhanced generation of intermediate frequency phonons activates the dominant group velocities, resulting in reduced TBR. This work has important implications on experimental studies, opening up a new space for engineering hybrid nano/microelectronics...|$|R

'A' (West End), 'D' (West London), 'G' (North West London) and 'J' (North London) mobilised from Wembley (the former Middlesex headquarters); 'B' (Central London south of the river), 'E' (South East London and Kent), 'H' (South London and Surrey) and 'K' (South West London south of the river and Surrey) mobilised from Croydon (the former Croydon County Borough headquarters); finally, 'C' (City and Inner East London), 'F' (East London including Docklands) and 'L' (North East London and South West Essex), mobilised from Stratford (the former West Ham County Borough headquarters).

40|$|Our goal is {{to detect}} all {{instances}} of a generic object class, such as a face, in greyscale scenes. The design of the algorithm is motivated by computational efficiency. The search is coarse-to-fine in both the exploration of poses and {{the representation of the}} object class. Starting from training examples, we recursively learn a <b>hierarchy</b> of spatial <b>arrangements</b> of edge fragments, graded by their size (sparsity). The arrangements have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. Instead, they are selected to be "decomposable": Each can be split into two correlated subarrangements, each of which can be further divided, etc. As a result, the probability of an arrangement of size k appearing on an object instance decays slowly with k. We demonstrate this both theoretically and in experiments in which detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of various sizes. 1 Introduction Starting with a training set of examples of a generic object class (e. g., "face"), our goal [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} Analytic Hierarchy Process-based {{structure is}} developed {{to capture the}} relationship between various levels of activities contributed by people to society. Physical objects have widespread extension and degrees of importance that often differ by many orders of magnitude. Similarly, mental thoughts and criteria occur in widely heterogeneous entities {{that have to be}} sorted and arranged into homogeneous groups of few elements in each group so that one can evaluate the relationships among them accurately, from the smallest to the largest. It is through such a framework for organizing factors with smooth transition {{that it is possible to}} derive reliable priorities from expert judgments. The proposed model enables one to make decisions and allocate resources in as detailed and fine a way as possible. In addition to the traditional approach of structuring criteria into multiple clusters, the alternatives of a decision are also organized into the lowest multiple levels of that <b>hierarchy.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> and evaluation of alternatives differs from one criterion to another, which adds to the complexity of the undertaking when the alternatives are heterogeneous. The coherent approach to structuring complex decisions with the Analytic Hierarchy Process enables one to transcend the complexity of dealing in a scientific way with the problem of widespread orders of magnitude of criteria and alternatives in a complex decision. When the magnitudes are actually very small or very large, the accuracy of rating alternatives one at a time instead of comparing them in pairs involves much guessing, and can lead to a questionable outcome. Alternatively, comparisons, which are necessary for the measurement of intangibles, have greater and better justified accuracy.

40|$|The EU {{is a major}} {{participant}} in the world sugar market, {{being one of the}} top producers, importers and exporters in the world. The reform of the EU sugar regime will affect not only the EU member states and candidates, but also countries that are associated with the EU through the preferential, regional and multilateral trade agreements. For several decades, the EU has supported and protected the EU sugar sector. Sugar from developing countries {{will not be able to}} enter the EU sugar market without preferential trade agreements. In the EU sugar regime, the unique features of the trade concessions are that sugar under preferential import quotas can enter the EU market duty-free and the price paid for sugar equals to the high EU price for sugar.

It compares the different trade agreements – including those achieved under the WTO – and explores the impact of these upon both the EU and the other countries involved. ...|$|R

The museum pays homage to the area in various ways. The towering memory boxes are clad in the same rusted corrugated metal sheets as the surrounding shacks of the shantytown (which give Red Location its name), and the overall form of the museum resembles that of a factory. This is a reference to the workers' unions and industrial unrest which was instrumental in bringing down the Apartheid government.|$|R
40|$|Recently, we {{reviewed}} the systematics of anoline lizards (Guyer and Savage, 1986) {{and found that}} some of the groupings pro-posed by Etheridge (1960) and Williams (1976 a, 1976 b), which had been accepted by most authors writing on anoles, were not monophyletic. Etheridge's original classification scheme involved the division of a single genus Anolis into an alpha and a beta section, each containing a number of clusters of related species called series. Williams retained the basic outline of this system but refined it by recognizing two principal divisions within the alpha sec-tion, the carolinensis and punctatus subsec-tions, and by further subdividing the sub-sections and the beta section into series, subseries, and species groups (in a de-scending <b>hierarchy).</b> This <b>arrangement</b> was called the Etheridge/Williams classifica-tion system in our earlier review, and that designation will also be used here. Our review of the characters used to de-limit these groupings indicated that the alpha section and the punctatus subsection are not monophyletic. We concluded that a rearrangement was necessary and that there was sufficient support from osteolog-ical, karyological, and immunological studies to undertake such a revision. We proposed an original hypothesis of phy-logenetic relationships for these lizards and a vicariance biogeography explanation for the distribution pattern of extant anoles. Our revision has been criticized on an-alytical and osteological grounds by Can-natella and de Queiroz (1989) and on tax-onomic and osteological grounds by Williams (1989). Here we discuss the major points of difference between our views and those of these critics who stand contra our proposed phylogeny and classification. In doing so, we hope to clarify our intent in undertaking this project and to establish the patterns that we believe reflect natural groupings among anoles. A discussion of our biogeographic theory will comprise a subsequent paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flexible working {{has been}} widely {{advocated}} as a social panacea, capable of resolving unemployment, maintaining economic competitiveness, and enhancing equal opportunities between women and men. Flexibility has neutral or even positive connotations for both employers and employees. These meanings are differentiated, and empirically explored, by reference to the British component of a qualitative, comparative six-country European study of flexible working in the retail sector. Specific {{attention is paid to}} the determination of flexibility; for example whether it is employer led, employee chosen, or a complementary combination, and whether flexible working facilitates equal opportunities, both within the workplace and in the wider sense of promoting long-lasting changes in parental roles and responsibilities as specified under the European Union's mainstreaming initiative. It is concluded that the introduction of flexible working has opened up a whole range of possibilities for differential engagement in the workplace. However, these arrangements need to apply to all levels of the occupational <b>hierarchy</b> and similar <b>arrangements</b> need to be introduced in relation to caring if the officially stated objectives for greater equality of opportunity are to be realised. To bring about gender equity it is necessary to consider social reproduction as a whole and modify the division of labour between women and men within, and between, paid and unpaid work...|$|R

In our theoretical framework, we use an adaptation of Becker’s Demand & Supply (D&S) model of marriage and a <b>hierarchy</b> of co-parenting <b>arrangements</b> [...] ranked in terms of degree of fathers’ involvement {{in the lives of}} mother or child [...] as an observable price measure for women’s work as mothers. We predict effects on co-parenting choice of factors such as welfare benefits, sex ratios, income, black versus white, or education, and black/white differences in these effects. We test our predictions with data from the Fragile Families and Child-Wellbeing Survey. Our findings include (1) the larger the grant amount in the state where the mother resides, the more it is likely that fathers will have some contact with their children, and the more it is likely that fathers will cohabit with the mothers; (2) fathers who have more children with other women are less likely to have contact with a given woman’s children, but this discouraging effect of men’s other children is smaller for blacks than for whites; and (3) employment in the last year reduces the likelihood that a white mother is married to her child’s father, while increasing that likelihood among black mothers. ...|$|R
40|$|Many food webs are {{so complex}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to distinguish the relationships between predators and their prey. We have therefore developed an approach that produces a food web which clearly demonstrates the strengths of the relationships between the predator guilds of demersal fish and their prey guilds in a coastal ecosystem. Subjecting volumetric dietary data for 35 abundant predators along the lower western Australia coast to cluster analysis and the SIMPROF routine separated the various species × length class combinations into 14 discrete predator guilds. Following nMDS ordination, the sequence of points for these predator guilds represented a 'trophic' hierarchy. This demonstrated that, with increasing body size, several species progressed upwards through this hierarchy, reflecting a marked change in diet, whereas others remained within the same guild. A novel use of cluster analysis and SIMPROF then identified each group of prey that was ingested in a common pattern across the full suite of predator guilds. This produced 12 discrete groups of taxa (prey guilds) that each typically comprised similar ecological/functional prey, which were then also aligned in a <b>hierarchy.</b> The hierarchical <b>arrangements</b> of the predator and prey guilds were plotted against each other to show the percentage contribution of each prey guild to the diet of each predator guild. The resultant shade plot demonstrates quantitatively how food resources are spread among the fish species and revealed that two prey guilds, one containing cephalopods and teleosts and the other small benthic/epibenthic crustaceans and polychaetes, were consumed by all predator guilds...|$|R
40|$|Apithology is {{the field}} of study that {{considers}} the generative dynamics of living systems. A distinguishing feature of apithological praxis is {{the inclusion of the}} effects of the system dynamics of human thought. This involves the depiction of systems of thought as complex inter-linked <b>hierarchies</b> in multi-spatial <b>arrangements.</b> This generates distinctive questions for the framing of its observations. One field which has considered the problems of epistemological choices in formulating similar observations is the discipline of systems ecology. The proposition of this paper is that the learnings gained from {{the field of}} systems ecology may inform a theory of praxis for apithological systems inquiries. Bateson (1972) proposed that deutero-learning (i. e. Learning II) occurs when there is a progressive change in the rate of proto-learning (i. e. Learning I) by adaptation of learning to different contexts. The presence of proto-learning within one field of thinking (i. e. ecological systems) provides the opportunity for deutero-learning in the field of thought (i. e. apithological systems). Extending from the study of ecological systems, five questions are noted as junctures for the selection of framing choices in the observation of complex systems. Using a criteria for philosophical coherence, a conjunction of natural and service systems is proposed. From this base, five category errors of thinking that change the quality of the results of those framing choices are identified. Within this premise, specific learnings gained from the study of ecological systems are applied as deutero-learning opportunities and adapted for the study of thought-ecologies. To conclude, apithological principles applying those learnings are proposed for the observation of systems of thought. From this analysis, five observational protocols are derived as requirements for the praxis of apithology. Reflections are provided on the systemic effect of coherency in the presence or absence of these five considerations on the human capacity for knowing and unknowing. This leads to a third-order insight in practice for the enablement of generativity in the ecology of human thought...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} effects of {{institutional}} arrangements for innovation in clusters. Clusters have {{become one of the}} most popular concepts in innovation policy studies in recent years. They have been ascribed as places with structures that reduce transaction costs, and enable innovation processes due to the prevalence of different types of externalities. The focus of this dissertation is on dynamic externalities that support innovation. Five types of externalities that were most frequently prevalent in the literature have been explored, intense competition, knowledge spill-over, specialisation, user-producer learning and joint action. Innovation takes place through interaction and this thesis has explored how cluster externalities can influence innovation depending upon the types of institutional arrangements that govern transactions. Four arrangements have been explored, market, network, quasi <b>hierarchy</b> and state <b>arrangements.</b> A comparative case study of the sugar and ethanol clusters in São Paulo, the North East of Brazil and Cuba has been carried out with the purpose to identify how the conceptual pieces relate to each other and whether cluster externalities have been behind the innovation that has taken place in the clusters. The dissertation has found that externalities influence innovation in various ways, which is enabled and influenced by the institutional arrangements and these influence the externalities differently. Arrangements have stronger connection to some externalities than others, e. g. intense competition is enabled by market arrangements and network arrangements are strongly connected to joint action. At the same time some arrangements can prevent externalities or reduce their impact. Of the explored clusters, São Paulo is the case where most innovation is taking place. It is the most diversified cluster with regard to specialisation, actors and arrangements and the case where the cluster externalities have been the most widespread, diversified and influential. In the North East of Brazil less innovation has taken place, the cluster is thinner with regard to actors, specialisation and scientific capacity. Innovation in the North East is to a lesser extent the outcome of cluster externalities. There are fewer local networks in place than in São Paulo and the ones that exist are less oriented towards enabling innovation. The Cuban cluster is dense with actors, strong competencies in science and technology and knowledge of derivate production. There is equipment and machinery in place, of which some is becoming dated though. The Cuban cluster is more the outcome of national state arrangements and international linkages than cluster externalities. The development of the cluster and innovation is hampered, by the lack of markets and network arrangements...|$|R
40|$|This research, {{which is}} {{grounded}} on Pierre Bourdieu's theoretical framework {{deals with the}} explanation of corporate governance as a social space and the practices of audit committee members, internal auditors and independent board members within a public listed corporation in Mexico. The theories of field and practice of Pierre Bourdieu helps us to understand the space of struggle within the corporate governance field in Mexico. The habitus a central concept in Bourdieu's theory focuses on the way of acting, feeling, thinking and being of actors in the corporate governance field. And the field {{as part of the}} on-going context in which the actors live, structures the habitus, {{while at the same time}} the habitus is the basis for social agents' understanding of their lives, including the field. The dialectical relationship between the field and the habitus overcomes the duality of structure and agency, because following Bourdieu the habitus mediates between the individual and the social collective. The analysis shows that the field of corporate governance is structured and structuring with the practices of participants in the social space. Hence, the habitus carries history to the present circumstances of audit committee members, internal auditors, independent board members, institutional actors, professional agents and all those participants in the corporate governance field in Mexico. It is through the habitus that the corporate governance field in Mexico is produced and reproduced. Corporate governance practices also reflect the culture of corporate actors in Mexico. The analysis also looked at patterns of social organization through the structural network of board interlocks. The analysis shows that corporate governance practices adopted in Mexico reproduce existing hierarchies of power and have created new objects of social organization that perpetuate the prevailing structures. That is, the practical knowledge of audit committee members, internal auditors and independent board members purports an independent authentication of the company's financial statements and internal control. But, the analysis shows that their inclusion in the corporate governance field is sustaining a particular power structure. In other words, majority shareholders control Mexican corporations and the analysis shows that corporate governance practices in Mexico are not neither neutral nor disinterested. Instead, it was found that corporate governance practices and the corporate instrumental discourse of control, accountability and corporate transparency are consolidating a particular corporate order and power relations. The analysis also shows that the positions corporate agents and institutional actors occupied in the corporate governance field in Mexico are political in the sense that they are characterized by institutional structures and <b>arrangements,</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> instruments of control and command and power systems. In this way, corporate governance in Mexico can be seen as a contested discursive terrain, within which there is a variety of voices engaged in a political process of claims for recognition, acceptance and dominance. Despite the importance of board interlocks, the role of audit committee, internal auditors and independent board members m the operation of effective corporate governance, researchers and policy makers paid little attention especially in emerging economies such as Mexico. This research fills this gap. I used data from in-depth interviews and corporate annual reports to understand the field of corporate governance in Mexico.
