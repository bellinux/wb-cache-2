The development of <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> {{can be attributed}} to the feeding regime. From birth to the age of 40  days old, tiger grouper were fed with live feed since their digestion system; particularly due to <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> which less developed.

Previous studies demonstrated that both the expulsion of nematode parasites and the associated muscle hyper contractility are dependent on CD 4 + T helper cells. Nevertheless, the precise immunological mechanism underlying changes in <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> function remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin 4 (IL- 4) and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 6 (STAT 6) {{in the development of}} <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> hypercontractility and worm expulsion by infecting IL- 4 and STAT 6 -deficient mice with Trichinella spiralis. Worm expulsion was almost normal in IL- 4 -deficient mice but substantially delayed in STAT 6 -deficient mice. Consistent with delayed worm expulsion, we also observed a marked attenuation of carbachol-induced muscle contraction in STAT 6 -deficient mice but only a moderate decrease in muscle hypercontractility in IL- 4 -deficient mice. In addition, we also observed severe impairment of T helper type 2 cytokine responses and intestinal mucosal mastocytosis in STAT 6 -deficient mice, although some degree of intestinal tissue eosinophilia was evident in these animals. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that STAT 6 -dependent changes in <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> function contribute to host protection in nematode infection...|$|E

40|$|Interstitial {{cells of}} Cajal (ICC) are the {{pacemakers}} that enable the oriented <b>intestinal</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> layers to contract rhythmically and autonomously.

The key challenges in current <b>intestinal</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> engineering are the rapid loss of functional ICC and smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the culture. The objective of this study was to engineer functional <b>intestinal</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> with proper alignment and spontaneous rhythmic contraction by overcoming those obstacles. This was achieved by 1) developing orthogonally oriented scaffolds with aligned fibers for engineering <b>intestinal</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> in vivo; 2) identifying a reproducible culture system for in vitro maintenance of isolated ICC with pacemaker activity; and 3) engineering <b>intestinal</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> constructs with directional rhythmic contractions by implementing the functional ICC culture system into aligned scaffolds. In summary, this research yielded reproducible practices using a simple feeder cell system for in vitro expansion of isolated ICC, which enabled the development of structurally desirable <b>intestinal</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> constructs exhibiting spontaneous membrane potential oscillations and contractions over 10 weeks in vitro.

In addition to detection and elimination of pathogens, intestinal macrophages {{play a role in}} maintaining homeostasis. By altering gene expression and cytokine production in the microenvironment, we hypothesized that Helicobacter infection altered the phenotype and inflammatory response of submucosal intestinal macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we examined macrophages within whole mounts of <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> as well as isolated macrophages from Helicobacter-infected or uninfected mouse intestine. Macrophages from the <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> of Helicobacter-infected mice showed increased expression of F 4 / 80 and CD 11 b, altered gene expression, and increased phagocytosis when compared to macrophages from uninfected mice.

A similar conductance was found in native intestinal myocytes using whole-cell patch-clamp conditions. The pH-sensitive current was blocked by local anaesthetics.

The effects of lidocaine were not blocked by tetraethylammonium chloride, 4 -aminopyridine, glibenclamide, apamin or MK- 499. However, depolarization by acidic pH was abolished by pre-treatment with lidocaine, suggesting that lidocaine-sensitive K+ channels were responsible for pH-sensitive changes in membrane potential. The kinetics of activation, sensitivity to pH, and pharmacology of the conductance in intestinal myocytes and the expression of TASK- 1 and TASK- 2 in these cells suggest that the pH-sensitive background conductance is encoded by TASK genes. This conductance appears to contribute significantly to resting potential and may regulate excitability of GI muscles...|$|R

40|$|Background: Fibrosis is {{a serious}} {{consequence}} of Crohn’s disease (CD), often necessitating surgical resection. We examined the hypothesis that IL- 13 may promote collagen accumulation within the CD muscle microenvironment. Methods: Factors potentially modulating collagen deposition were examined in intestinal tissue samples from fibrotic (f) CD and compared with cancer control (C), ulcerative colitis (UC) and uninvolved (u) CD. Mechanisms attributable to IL- 13 were analysed using cell lines derived from uninvolved muscle tissue and tissue explants. Results: In fCD muscle extracts, collagen synthesis was significantly increased compared to other groups, but MMP- 2 was not co-ordinately increased. IL- 13 transcripts were highest in fCD muscle compared to muscle from other groups. IL- 13 receptor (R) a 1 was expressed by <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> smooth muscle, nerve and KIR+ cells. Fibroblasts from <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> expressed Ra 1, phosphorylated STAT 6 in response to IL- 13, and subsequently down-regulated MMP- 2 and TNF-a-induced MMP- 1 and MMP- 9 synthesis. Cells with the phenotype KIR+CD 45 +CD 56 +/ 2 CD 32 were significantly increased in fCD muscle compared to all other groups, expressed Ra 1 and membrane IL- 13, and transcribed high levels of IL- 13. In explanted CD muscle, these cells did not phosphorylate STAT 6 in response to exogenous IL- 13. Conclusions: The data indicate that in fibrotic <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscle</b> of Crohn’s patients, the IL- 13 pathway is stimulated, involving a novel population of infiltrating IL- 13 Ra 1 +, KIR+ innate lymphoid cells, producing IL- 13 which inhibits fibroblas...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} whether migrating motor complexes (MMCs) are impaired or absent {{in the small}} intestine of W/Wv mutant mice, which lack pacemaker interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and electrical slow waves. The intracellular electrical and mechanical activities of the small intestines of wild-type (+/+) and W/Wv mutant mice were recorded. Electrical recordings from circular muscle cells confirmed the absence of slow waves in W/Wv mice, whereas slow waves were always recorded from +/+ muscle cells. Spontaneous phasic contractions were recorded from W/Wv muscles {{in the absence of}} slow waves, but these events occurred at a lower frequency than in +/+ tissues. MMC activity was recorded consistently from the ileum of +/+ mice, and normal MMCs were also recorded from W/Wv mice. MMCs in both +/+ and W/Wv mice were abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 μm), hexamethonium (300 μm) or atropine (1 μm), suggesting that the neural control mechanisms responsible for MMCs in +/+ mice are intact and are responsible for MMCs in W/Wv mice. Transmural nerve stimulation demonstrated intact inhibitory and excitatory neural regulation of W/Wv <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscles.</b> Prolonged trains of cholinergic motor nerve stimulation failed to activate slow waves in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>muscles</b> of W/Wv mice. Our findings show that the generation and directional propagation of MMC activity in mouse small intestine does not require slow-wave activity or an intact network of myenteric ICC.

We infected C 57 BL/ 6, athymic, CD 4 -deficient, CD 8 α-deficient, and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) -deficient (C 2 d) mice with Trichinella spiralis larvae. We examined intestinal worm numbers, longitudinal muscle contraction, and MHC II expression. Numerous MHC II-positive cells were identified within the muscularis externa of infected but not uninfected C 57 BL/ 6 mice. C 57 BL/ 6 and CD 8 α-deficient mice developed large increases in muscle contraction, expelling the parasite by day 21. Athymic and C 2 d mice exhibited much smaller increases in muscle contraction and delayed parasite expulsion. CD 4 -deficient mice exhibited intermediate levels of muscle contraction and delayed parasite expulsion. To further examine the role of MHC II and CD 4 T cells, we irradiated C 2 d mice and reconstituted them with C 57 BL/ 6 bone marrow alone or with C 57 BL/ 6 CD 4 T cells. C 57 BL/ 6 bone marrow alone did not affect muscle function or worm expulsion in recipient C 2 d mice. Partial CD 4 T-cell reconstitution was sufficient to restore increased muscle contraction but not worm expulsion.
