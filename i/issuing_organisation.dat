Its {{population}} {{is considered to}} be at critical status by the UK-based Rare Breeds Survival Trust, meaning that there are 300 or fewer breeding females registered in the world today. In 2006, there were believed to have been around 300 mares and 4 purebred stallions, and by 2009 this number had risen to around 420 ponies worldwide. It is possible that the Eriskay is the last surviving Hebrides pony breed. There are two breed registries that represent the breed. The first (the Eriskay Pony (Purebred) Studbook Society or Comann Each nan Eilean, formed in 1971 [...] has the goal of maintaining the purity of the Eriskay breed, and disallows all crossbreeding. The second (the Eriskay Pony Society, formed in 1986 [...] aims to produce ponies with desirable traits, which the registry feels will help promote their survival [...] this registry has considered the possibility of cross-breeding. The Eriskay Pony Society achieved legal recognition as a breed society and passport <b>issuing</b> <b>organisation</b> for the UK in 1995; Comann Each nan Eilean did not receive legal recognition until 2002.|$|E

50|$|Delegation of {{responsibilities}} between parties {{is important in}} real-world applications, such as {{the structure of the}} World Wide Web. Namespaces allow delegation of identifier assignment to multiple name issuing organisations whilst retaining global uniqueness. A central Registration authority registers the assigned namespace identifiers allocated. Each namespace identifier is allocated to an organisation which is subsequently responsible for the assignment of names in their allocated namespace. This organisation may be a name <b>issuing</b> <b>organisation</b> that assign the names themselves, or another Registration authority which further delegates parts of their namespace to different organisations.|$|E

In addition to the domesticated ponies there is a small herd of Eriskay ponies living in a feral state on the Holy Isle. These ponies are descended from a group of five ponies brought to the Holy Isle to when it was owned by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare in the 1970s to form a nature reserve. Today the island is owned by the Samye Buddhist Centre for World Peace and Health. They operate a policy of non-intervention, allowing the ponies to live without human interference.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the Manuscript- To {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} understanding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by analysing the issues that comprise CSR. Without this understanding {{it will not be}} possible for organisations to develop responsible brands. Approach – The paper draws on the existing business and marketing literature to define four aspects of issue complexity. It also draws on a range of real and hypothetical examples affecting local and global organisations to explain the four components. Limitations – The work is conceptual in nature and additional research needs to be undertaken to better understand how organisations define the CSR issues that they will integrate into activities and how the management of these issues can be undertaken to ensure system wide implementation. Practical Implications – The work suggests that by understanding the four components of <b>issues</b> complexity <b>organisations</b> will be {{in a better position to}} integrate CSR related branding. Without understanding these <b>issues,</b> <b>organisations</b> may potentially unintentionally exaggerate claims or set themselves up to be criticised that they are unfairly exploiting consumers’ interest in CSR issues. Value- Previous research has documented the value of CSR, but to date there have been only limited attempts to systematically examine how managers could know whether they have considered the issue completely and realistically. <br /...|$|R
