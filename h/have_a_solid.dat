5|$|The Singapura was {{accepted}} for registration by the CFA in 1982 and granted championship status in 1988. In between this period, breeders {{found that the}} occasional litter would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> colored kitten, caused by the recessive gene for solid color. In a desire for the Singapura to breed true, many breeders chose to do test matings to pinpoint and remove from their breeding programs individuals with the recessive gene.

5|$|Saturn is a gas giant {{because it}} is {{predominantly}} composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> core. Saturn's rotation causes it to have {{the shape of an}} oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268km versus 54,364km. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less. Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times the Earth's mass, and Saturn is 95 times the mass of the Earth. Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw an inherent contradiction in the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E

25|$|The eastern tiger {{swallowtail}} {{was formerly}} considered {{a single species}} with a vast range into northern Canada and the eastern United States. In 1991, the subspecies Papilio glaucus canadensis was elevated to species level, thus reducing the range of P. glaucus to south of Canada. In 2002, another closely related species, P. appalachiensis, was described by H. Pavulaan and D. M. Wright from the southern Appalachian Mountains. These two species can be separated from P. glaucus by size; P. canadensis is smaller and P. appalachiensis is larger. These two also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> yellow bar along {{the margin of the}} ventral forewing. P. canadensis females are not dimorphic, and P. appalachiensis females are rarely black.|$|E
25|$|Real Madrid {{use this}} style of play {{extremely}} well because they have very quick players in the likes of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema of whom can speed in behind the defence and take them on when on the break at a quick pace. They also have passing masters in Kroos and Modric of whom can play the killer through ball in the spaces created. And for effect, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> defence in Ramos and Varane to defend leads. Marcelo and Carvajal are also very quick full backs and so can get forward on the break too and put crosses in the box during attack, while being able to track back quick enough.|$|E
25|$|When he was {{appointed}}, {{all other}} justices {{had been appointed}} by Democrats, Franklin D. Roosevelt or Truman, and all were committed New Deal liberals. But they disagreed about {{the role that the}} courts should play in achieving liberal goals. The Court was split between two warring factions. Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson led one faction, which insisted upon judicial self-restraint and insisted courts should defer to the policymaking prerogatives of the White House and Congress. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas led the opposing faction; they agreed the court should defer to Congress in matters of economic policy, but felt the judicial agenda had been transformed from questions of property rights to those of individual liberties, and in this area, courts should play a more activist role. Warren's belief that the judiciary must seek to do justice placed him with the activists, although he did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> majority until after Frankfurter's retirement in 1962.|$|E

25|$|Since Reroute to Remain was {{released}} in 2002, In Flames fan base has been split because of the gradual change in style towards a more alternative metal sound. Still, In Flames <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> and growing worldwide fanbase. The stylistic changes include screamed and clean vocals, {{as opposed to the}} death growl on the early records, more prominent rhythm section and less guitar melodies and solos, more obvious use of synthesizers and electronics and a clear influence from modern American metal in especially the uplifting chorus melodies. This later style has been mostly described as alternative metal. Since Siren Charms, and more recently their latest studio album Battles, they have more extensively used clean vocals as opposed to screams and growls and have played a softer overall sound, putting more emphasis on a melodic alternative metal direction. Very minimal elements of their earlier Melodic death metal sound are utilized at this point. However, some very mild elements of this style can still sometimes be heard in their music. Anders' clean singing style has altered drastically as it is now more prominent and he has taken on a higher-pitched vocal range.|$|E

[...] The magazine praised Blommaert's acting, calling her [...] "juicily diabolical". Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping, {{in their book}} X-Treme Possibilities, gave the episode mostly positive reviews, although they criticized the ending. Day applauded the episode's themes of [...] "loss of faith … ritual abuse [...] repressed memories", along with the [...] "great set pieces", and the plot twists. However, he was slightly critical that the episode did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> conclusion, and that the identity of Mrs. Paddock was never revealed. Cornell was even more critical {{about the lack of}} closure, calling it [...] "a vast unanswered question" [...] and [...] "very troubling in a show that's concerned with seeing the truth". However, he too was also complimentary towards the set pieces, calling them [...] "groovy".|$|E

500|$|A film {{based on}} the Runaways went {{through a number of}} iterations. Brian K. Vaughan was {{originally}} hired to write a screenplay {{based on the}} property in May 2008. In April 2010, Marvel hired Peter Sollett to direct the film, and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May. The following October, development on the film was put on hold, with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the Runaways film had been shelved in favor of The Avengers, with the earliest it could release being Phase Three. In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without Runaways, Feige stated the project was [...] "still an awesome script that exists in our script vault", adding, [...] "We'd love to do something with Runaways some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> draft there. But again, we can't make them all." [...] In August 2016, Marvel Television announced Marvel's Runaways from the streaming service Hulu, with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017. It is scheduled to premiere in November 2017.|$|E
500|$|In the Wheatbelt {{and east}} of the Stirling Range, it is a stunted tree. Tree forms <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> trunk, {{generally}} wavy or bent, with [...] thick crumbly orange-grey bark which is a red-brown underneath. It regenerates from fire via lignotuber or epicormic buds from its fire-tolerant trunk. It has long narrow shiny green linear leaves [...] long and [...] wide. The leaf margins have v- or u-shaped serrations along their length. The new growth is a pale grey-green, and occurs mainly in the late spring and summer, often after flowering. The brilliant yellow inflorescences (flower spikes) occur from spring into summer and are up [...] wide and up to [...] tall. They {{are made up of}} many small individual flowers; a study at Mount Adams [...] north of Perth revealed a count of 1933 (± a standard error of 88) flowers per inflorescence, and another in the Fitzgerald River National Park yielded a count of 1720 (± 76) flowers. Anthesis proceeds up the flower spike over about 10 to 20 days, and is asynchronous. That is, a plant produces flower spikes over a several week period and will thus have spikes at different stages of development over the flowering season.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Screen Rant, Alex Leadbeater felt, {{regardless}} of the short's connections to Logan and Deadpool 2, it [...] "ultimately is a good slice of Deadpool fun." [...] Leadbeater also praised the alternate online release, as pirated versions of the theatrical showings had already appeared online and the extra scenes in the official online version were incentive for fans to watch the official release over the illegal ones. Trent Moore of Blastr called the short [...] "a fun little scene", and said that Leitch [...] "certainly seems to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> grasp of the irreverent tone that makes the character work so well." [...] Jacob Hall at /Film said the short was a [...] "fun little surprise" [...] and compared it to Marvel Studios' Marvel One-Shots. He added that there is [...] "not much to judge quite yet, but [...] does showcase a strong eye for comedy" [...] in the footage, and particularly noted the [...] "ridiculously depressing and dilapidated" [...] setting. Corey Chichizola of CinemaBlend said the short is [...] "certainly cool enough to the wet the palate for any X-Men fans", and particularly noted the [...] "strong blue tint, which is in stark juxtaposition to the very bright and yellow world of Deadpool. With a new director stepping behind the camera, perhaps this was a choice that we'll see in" [...] Deadpool 2.|$|E
