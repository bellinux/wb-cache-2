50|$|Taylor was {{especially}} busy in 1940, with three films in production. He also starred in MGM's <b>Escape</b> and Waterloo <b>Bridge.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the steamer}} {{attempted}} to <b>escape,</b> the <b>bridge</b> structure struck the vessel, destroying several staterooms and ripping {{up much of}} {{the right side of}} superstructure, including the pursers office, as well as tearing out hog posts, partitions and the upper deck. [...] Damage was estimated at $4,000.|$|R
5000|$|... "Vrbanja Bridge", a song by American singer/songwriter Jill Sobule, {{which tells}} of two religiously opposed lovers trying to <b>escape</b> over Vrbanja <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{stairway to}} Kampa Island {{was replaced by}} a new one in 1844. The next year, another great flood threatened the bridge, but the <b>bridge</b> <b>escaped</b> major damage. In 1848, during the revolutionary days, the <b>bridge</b> <b>escaped</b> unharmed from the cannonade, but some of the statues were damaged. In 1866, pseudo-gothic gas lights were erected on the balustrade; they were later replaced with electric lighting. In the 1870s, the first regular public-transport (omnibus) line went over the bridge (officially called [...] "Charles Bridge" [...] after 1870) later replaced by a horse tram. The bridge towers underwent a thorough reconstruction between 1874 and 1883.|$|R
50|$|Craufurd, {{realising}} {{his situation}} that the French were threatening his only <b>escape</b> (the <b>bridge</b> crossing the river Côa), ordered a withdrawal {{across the river}} Côa, with the British 52nd and 43rd foot {{as well as the}} 95th rifles protecting their retreat. For the British, matters only became worse. A supply wagon turned over and caused a traffic jam in the retreat across the bridge. The French were gradually driving back the British divisions protecting the withdrawal.|$|R
50|$|On September 7, 2008, {{the only}} bridge {{crossing}} the Argun River, connecting {{northern and southern}} territories of Chechnya, collapsed. Drivers caught on the <b>bridge</b> <b>escaped</b> without injury. A federal road administration representative linked the accident to abnormal stress from heavy military vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Although {{ordered to}} join Rall, {{the remains of}} the Knyphausen Regiment mistakenly marched in the {{opposite}} direction. They tried to <b>escape</b> across the <b>bridge,</b> but found it had been taken. The Americans quickly swept in, defeating a Hessian attempt to break through their lines. Surrounded by Sullivan's men, the regiment surrendered, just minutes after the rest of the brigade.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the largest}} {{construction}} projects of the interwar period was the rebuilding of the bridge over the Elbe in Meissen. Between 1925 and 1926, the Lauchhammer-Rheinmetall company rebuilt it with a new steel truss superstructure. The <b>bridge</b> <b>escaped</b> demolition in 1945, so the original bridge is now preserved, but it has only had a single track since 1946.|$|R
25|$|The Japanese {{could have}} {{wiped out the}} 17th Division, but they did not. They wanted to take Rangoon fast, and the delays {{involved}} in a mopping up operation were unacceptable; so they disengaged and headed north in search of another crossing-point. Later on 22 February, survivors of the 17th Division swam and ferried themselves over the Sittang in broad daylight. After smaller actions at the Battle of Pegu and Taukkyan Roadblock, the Japanese went on to take Rangoon unopposed, on 9 March. Fortunately for the survivors of 17th Division, they had dismantled their roadblocks, so those Indians who had <b>escaped</b> Sittang <b>Bridge</b> were able to slip away to the north.|$|R

50|$|They ran on, to a king's palace, or {{to a great}} farm. Their story {{impressed}} the king or farmer, but he said if she stole the giant's sword, {{from the back of}} his bed, he would marry his oldest son to her oldest sister. She went and hid under the bed. When the giant went to sleep, she stole it. It rattled when she went over the threshold, and the giant chased her, but she <b>escaped</b> over the <b>bridge</b> of one hair. The king married his oldest son to her oldest sister, and then told her if she stole the purse the giant kept under his pillow, he would marry his second son to her second sister. Once again she hid under the bed and stole it while he slept, but he woke and chased her, and she <b>escaped</b> over the <b>bridge</b> of one hair. Her second sister was married to the king's second son.|$|R
50|$|The Doctor <b>escapes</b> {{from the}} <b>bridge</b> {{and tries to}} find {{something}} to use against the reptiles. He discovers some cylinders of hexachromite gas, which is lethal to all reptile life. A Sea Devil discovers the Doctor's presence and attempts to shoot him. He misses the Doctor and hits one of the gas containers which sprays all over the warrior. As a result, the warrior begins to dissolve.|$|R
50|$|Edmund {{died at the}} age of {{seventeen}} either during or shortly after the Battle of Wakefield (30 December 1460) during the Wars of the Roses. He had fought in the battle at the side of his father. After the tide of battle turned against his father he attempted to <b>escape</b> over Wakefield <b>Bridge,</b> but was overtaken and killed, possibly by the Lancastrian Lord Clifford, in revenge for his father's death at St Albans.|$|R
50|$|Cross has notably {{performed}} {{upside down}} straitjacket escape stunts both on TV and at events. He was {{tied in a}} straitjacket and suspended by his ankles, upside down, from a crane over the Newport River in Wales at the Big Splash Festival and the following year performed another upside down straitjacket <b>escape</b> off the <b>bridge</b> itself over the river. He also performed at the Jongleurs/Highlight comedy clubs with Bob Slayer’s ‘Rock & Roll Circus’ in December 2010.|$|R
5|$|Much of Khalid's {{strategic}} and tactical genius lies in {{his use of}} extreme methods. He apparently put more emphasis on annihilating enemy troops, rather than achieving victory by simply defeating them. For instance his employment of the double envelopment maneuver against the numerically superior Persian army at the Battle of Walaja, and his maneuver at the Battle of Yarmouk where he virtually trapped the Byzantine army between three steep ravines by stealthily capturing their only <b>escape</b> route, a <b>bridge,</b> at their rear.|$|R
5|$|Despite Langdale's {{attempt to}} counter-charge, the Royalists were soon outflanked. With the Parliamentarian musketeers firing {{into the rear}} of Langdale's force, the Royalists broke, some <b>escaping</b> via Holt <b>Bridge</b> and others running towards Chester. On Hoole Heath these {{retreating}} soldiers met with part of Gerard's force and made an initially successful counter-attack before being forced back to the walls of Chester. There the retreating cavalry choked up the streets, allowing the Parliamentarian musketeers to fire into the confused mass of horsemen and leading to a rout.|$|R
60|$|And {{as the day}} {{advanced}} and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return to London, {{the pressure of the}} flight drove the people in an ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the northward-running roads. By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes, and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all <b>escape</b> over the <b>bridges</b> in its sluggish advance. Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape.|$|R
5000|$|Fellowship of the Ring: Collect {{all members}} of the {{fellowship}} (white inserts), then shoot Barad-Dûr, Gollum Cave, or The Shire to start the multiball. If enabled by the operator, the mode starts with a Cave Troll that must be defeated, otherwise the player directly starts with the second part: The Balrog. One must alternate between hitting the Balrog and shooting a ramp to make the members of the fellowship <b>escape</b> across the <b>bridge</b> (the last member Gandalf will not pass but rather end the second part and enable victory lap mode).|$|R
5000|$|The ship's {{biological}} officer, Tina Reeves, <b>escapes</b> to the <b>bridge</b> and rescues Sticks by spraying Mittenhand {{with liquid}} nitrogen. The only other surviving marine, Books, opens the airlock so the giant Leprechaun is sucked into space and explodes. Books joins the {{others at the}} helm and they deduce that the password is [...] "Wizard", since Dr. Mittenhand previously compared himself to the Wizard of Oz. After stopping the self-destruct sequence, Books and Reeves kiss, while Sticks {{looks out the window}} to see the Leprechaun's giant hand giving him the finger.|$|R
50|$|The ekonting is a four-string gourd instrument, {{the folk}} lute of the Jola. It has an {{internal}} pass through body dowel {{stick with a}} round gourd body and its sound box is made of a hemispherical calabash, with a nailed goatskin. Before the invention of nails, palm tree thorns or wood pegs were used as nails. The three strings, which are attached to a long neck, today are nylon fishing line. Before, {{they were made of}} palm tree roots (Jola language: kuhall kata kubekel). The neck is a bamboo stick (Mandinka language: bangoe) that passes through the calabash to the other side. A hole is made in the sound box to allow the sound to <b>escape.</b> The <b>bridge</b> of the ekonting is not fixed to its skin as many lutes are. It is free, and can be moved {{back and forth on the}} skin of the sound box and it is always held in position by the pressure of the strings when it is in playing position.|$|R
50|$|De Morville - {{if indeed}} he was {{responsible}} (there is no absolute proof) - set up his chapel at a riverside location, next {{to what is now}} the Swing Bridge but what was then a wooden affair and the only bridge across the Tyne at Newcastle. By 1248 both bridge and chapel were in the care of a Keeper, known only as Lawrence. In that year much of the town was destroyed by fire; the chapel <b>escaped,</b> but the <b>bridge</b> was badly damaged and Lawrence was given responsibility for raising money for rebuilding, which included the reconstruction of the bridge in stone.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, {{the bridge}} was badly damaged by {{historic}} flooding from Hurricane Irene in late August and Tropical Storm Lee in early September. Loyalsock Creek's flood waters swept debris into the bridge, removing much of the siding on the south side, washing out the approaches, damaging the structural beams, and leaving [...] "two trees lodged between the timber low chord and timber deck" [...] on the north side. While the Forksville covered <b>bridge</b> <b>escaped</b> serious damage, Hillsgrove and Sonestown were both closed, and Preservation Pennsylvania issued a report that questioned whether either bridge could be restored.|$|R
500|$|Santa Anna had {{successfully}} <b>escaped</b> towards Vince's <b>Bridge.</b> [...] Finding the bridge destroyed, he {{hid in the}} marsh and was captured the following day. He was brought before Houston, who {{had been shot in}} the ankle and badly wounded. Texian soldiers gathered around, calling for the Mexican general's immediate execution. [...] Bargaining for his life, Santa Anna suggested that he order the remaining Mexican troops to stay away. [...] In a letter to Filisola, who was now the senior Mexican official in Texas, Santa Anna wrote that [...] "yesterday evening [...] had an unfortunate encounter" [...] and ordered his troops to retreat to Béxar and await further instructions.|$|R

25|$|The Rheingrave {{managed to}} reach Kehl, where he entrenched his {{remaining}} men, and sent {{his family to}} Strasbourg across the town's bridge over the Rhine. On arriving there, Charles of Lorraine took the entrenchments by assault and the Rheingrave barely <b>escaped.</b> However, the <b>bridge</b> collapsed shortly after because of the excessive burden of his fleeing soldiers, {{and many of them}} were drowned. Charles of Lorraine wrotte a letter to the city council of Strasbourg, asking them to open the gates of the city, but the request was denied. The Rheingrave, still controlling {{the west bank of the}} Rhine, promptly retreated to Seltz, while the Catholics moved to Rastatt. As result of the battle, the village of Willstätt was burned.|$|R
2500|$|The bridge {{has also}} survived several major {{earthquakes}} since its completion. The first earthquake occurred during construction on April 13, 1949, and knocked the north cable's [...] steel saddle {{from the east}} tower. Another strong earthquake struck the region on April 29, 1965. In 1999 a series of moderate earthquakes struck the region, {{and the most recent}} earthquake is the 2001 Nisqually earthquake. Even though the <b>bridge</b> <b>escaped</b> damage in all of those earthquakes, the 1949 earthquake still has a lasting legacy hold on the span. As a result of the north cable saddle's plunge from the east tower, and resulting three-day stay in 135 feet of salt water, it now corrodes more than twice as fast as its counterparts.|$|R
60|$|Then {{came the}} two ships. The pilots {{as they neared}} the <b>bridge</b> <b>escaped</b> in boats, and the current carried them down, {{one on each side}} of the raft, towards the solid ends of the bridge. The Fortune came first, but {{grounded}} near the shore without touching the bridge. Just as it did so the slow match upon deck burnt out. There was a faint explosion, but no result; and Sir Ronald Yorke, the man who had handed over Zutphen, sprang on board with a party of volunteers, extinguished the fire smoldering on deck, and thrusting their spears down into the hold, endeavoured to ascertain the nature of its contents. Finding it impossible to do so they returned to the bridge.|$|R

500|$|... a horned boy, {{is taken}} {{by a group of}} warriors to an {{abandoned}} castle and locked inside a stone coffin to be sacrificed. A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across , a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. Later, as they try to <b>escape</b> on the <b>bridge,</b> it slips up and they get separated. Yorda tries to save Ico but the Queen prevents it. He ends up falling off the bridge and losing consciousness.|$|R
50|$|His son Edmund, Earl of Rutland {{attempted}} to <b>escape</b> over Wakefield <b>Bridge,</b> but was overtaken and killed, possibly by Clifford in revenge for his father's death at St Albans. Salisbury's second son Sir Thomas Neville also {{died in the}} battle. Salisbury's son in law William, Lord Harington and Harington's father, William Bonville, were captured and executed immediately after the battle. (The Bonvilles had been engaged in a feud with the Earl of Devon and the Courtenay family in Devon and Cornwall.) Salisbury himself escaped the battlefield but was captured during the night, and {{was taken to the}} Lancastrian camp. Although the Lancastrian nobles might have been prepared to allow Salisbury to ransom himself, he was dragged out of Pontefract Castle and beheaded by local commoners, to whom he had been a harsh overlord.|$|R
40|$|Chromospheric {{brighten}} and Hα surge are the evident {{and common}} phenomena along sunspot light bridge. In this paper, a coronal jet ejects from sunspot light bridge is presented. Using {{the data from}} the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Hinode satellites, it is confirmed that the jet has the root near light bridge, this suggests that the jet may be a result of reconnection between main sunspot and light bridge. Due to the processing of jet ejects, the intensity and width of light bridge have some changes at some extent. This also suggests that jet is related to the interaction between light bridge and umbra, possibly magnetic reconnection or heat plasma trapped in light <b>bridge</b> <b>escaping</b> and moving along field line. Comment: It has been accepted for publication in PAS...|$|R
50|$|At {{the railway}} station, just seconds {{before he can}} reach Hannay, Scudder is murdered by the agents. Hannay is mistaken by {{witnesses}} at the railway station as being the assailant. Hannay is arrested but is soon captured by the Prussians when transferred to jail. He then is allowed {{to escape from the}} Prussians in the hope that he can lead them to the secret notebook. Hannay manages to get Scudder's second notebook back at St Pancras, but this {{turns out to be a}} dummy, with only a three-word riddle in it that only Hannay could possibly understand to find his real book, which sends Hannay to Scotland. Hannay flees to Scotland on a train, but he is forced to make a daredevil <b>escape</b> on a <b>bridge</b> when police board.|$|R
60|$|After much {{consideration}} on the matter, Mrs. Woodward {{determined that}} she should ask Charley down to the Cottage. In the first place, she felt bitterly her apparent ingratitude to him. When last they had been together, the day after Katie's <b>escape</b> at the <b>bridge,</b> when his tale had just been read, she had told him, with the warmth of somewhat more than friendly affection, that henceforth they must be more than common friends. She had promised him her love, she had almost promised him the affection and care of a mother; and now how was she keeping her promise? He had fallen into misfortune, and she had immediately deserted him. Over and over again {{she said to herself}} that her first duty was to her own child; but even with this reflection, she could hardly reconcile herself to her neglect of him.|$|R
60|$|Now {{every living}} being whom {{they could find}} was slain, and the Romans drew back, bearing their spoil with them. But the {{remainder}} of the Jews, to the number of some thousands, <b>escaped</b> by the <b>bridges,</b> which they broke down behind them, across the valley into the Upper City, whence that piercing, sobbing wail echoed without cease. Miriam watched till she could bear the sight no longer. The glare blinded her, the heat of the incandescent furnace shrivelled her up, her white dress scorched and turned brown. She crouched behind the shelter of her pinnacle gasping for breath. She prayed that she might die, and could not. Now she remembered the drink that remained in the leathern bottle, and swallowed it to the last drop. Then she crouched down again against the pillar, and lying thus her senses left her.|$|R
