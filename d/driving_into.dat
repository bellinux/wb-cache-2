5|$|Da Matta, Andretti, and Franchitti contended {{for third}} {{position}} until the field closed {{up because of}} the presence of slower cars. The third caution was shown fourteen laps later when Adrián Fernández lost engine power <b>driving</b> <b>into</b> the second turn, and he went to the bottom of the track on the backstretch to retire. Oil was laid on the track heading into turn two, and marshals were required to clean it. It was announced on lap 90 that Kniefel had reduced the number of laps to be run from 168 to 140 because of the danger from fading sunlight. All of the leaders (including Bräck) chose to make pit stops for fuel and tyres under caution on lap 100. Castroneves passed da Matta and Andretti around the inside in the pit lane and Newman/Haas Racing believed he had committed an infraction. The team informed CART of Castroneves' passing, which was observed by their co-owner Paul Newman.|$|E
5|$|In Wilson's absence at ABDA Command Headquarters in Java, Scherger {{was acting}} AOC NWA on 19February 1942 when Darwin {{suffered}} its first aerial attacks by the Japanese. <b>Driving</b> <b>into</b> town to meet Air Marshal Richard Williams, {{who was in}} transit {{on his way to}} England, Scherger first became aware of the assault after he heard anti-aircraft fire and counted twenty-seven enemy aircraft in the distance. He arrived at the civil airfield to witness a Curtiss P-40 crash land on the runway, before his car was strafed by fighters. In a lull after the initial attack that day, he made contact with Williams before the two men were forced to take shelter in a makeshift trench that was straddled by falling bombs as a second raid got under way. Afterwards, Scherger began to restore order and launched a Hudson light bomber on a reconnaissance mission, though there was no further contact with Japanese forces.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Saipan, 50 power lines, 20 transformers, and 6 {{power poles}} were damaged or destroyed, leaving 25{{percent of the}} islands' {{residents}} without power and $300,000 in damages. An estimated 90 percent of the banana trees were knocked down, contributing to the $518,000 in crop losses. Property losses on the two islands was estimated at $1.6million. On the islands of Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan all private homes, a total of six, were destroyed, the food stores and crops were lost, and the water supply was contaminated.

Damages throughout the islands amounted to $11.2million.|$|E
5|$|Across Florida, Gordon's winds damaged {{power lines}} and knocked down trees and traffic signals; about 425,000people lost power due to the storm. The rains caused {{flooding}} in Dade and Collier counties, which damaged $275million worth of crops, mostly to vegetables and sugar cane. In some locations, the crop damage was worse than during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, due to fewer crops being planted when Andrew struck the state. Along Elliott Key, Gordon damaged the coral reef system {{to a greater extent}} than Andrew. Inland flooding damaged buildings due to fast-rising water and roof collapses. In Volusia County, floods entered 1,236buildings, causing $26million in damage. Flooding caused dozens of roads to close, some of which were washed out. In the Everglades, flooding killed several deer. Statewide, two people drowned in separate instances after <b>driving</b> <b>into</b> flooded areas. Three people drowned along beaches, including one man who died in a rip current while attempting to rescue his son. In Hillsboro Inlet, two people drowned after their boat was overturned by high waves. Throughout Florida, Gordon directly killed eight people, and injured 43people.

Panciatici heavily out-braked Cumming to claim fourth place while Piquet lost control of his car in an attempt to overtake the defensive Rossiter who kept eighth position.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Laura never approached land, and no damages or fatalities occurred. Since the storm remained over open waters {{for most of}} its life, several ships and oil platforms recorded tropical storm-force winds. The highest recorded winds were at an oil platform with the call sign VEP717 at 03:00UTC on October1. Winds were recorded up to 47knots (54mph; 87km/h). Despite the lack of impact, the storm's remnants were caught in an upper-level jet stream, and steered towards Europe. There, they contributed to heavy rainfall across portions of Britain on October5, causing localized accumulation of flood waters. As a result, Glebe Road near Windermere, England was closed in both directions, and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale, previously saturated soil, combined with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding. Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed due to poor driving conditions. One person had to be rescued from her car after <b>driving</b> <b>into</b> a flooded street. The UK Environment Agency issued 76 flood watches and 21 severe flood warnings {{as a result of the}} rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Buemi {{moved back}} ahead of Conway {{in the battle}} for fifth, while Lotterer was impeded by an LMP2 and LMGTE car at Becketts corner and Webber was delayed by the two {{vehicles}} at Stowe corner.

The Audi moved across the track at Becketts corner upon coming across more slower traffic. Webber caught Lotterer and after closing up to him through Club corner. While lapping Rossiter, Webber moved {{to the front of the}} race heading into Abbey corner. Webber began to pull away from Lotterer. Jarvis was delayed by Rossiter, allowing Dumas to attack but went into grass on the Wellington straight. After making contact Bruno Senna overtook Rusinov <b>driving</b> <b>into</b> Maggots corner for second place in LMP2. The first round of pit stops began after 37 minutes with Derani making a pit stop, promoting Senna into the LMP2 lead. Jarvis was the first of the overall leaders to make a pit stop for fuel and tyres and was followed by teammate Lotterer one minute later. Dumas and both Toyota cars made stops with Jani taking over from Dumas and Kamui Kobayashi switched positions with Conway. Webber stopped one lap later and Hartley climbed aboard the No. 1 Porsche.|$|E

Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks ago and that her immunity {{may lead to a}} cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected; believing in Ellie's importance, Tess sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill (W.

5|$|The two Ferrari {{cars and}} the Renault of Kubica became the first cars to queue up behind the safety car, {{while the rest of}} the field had enough notice to divert to the pitlane for their first stop. The {{significance}} of these events was that both Vettel and Hamilton were able to make their first stops before their advantage over the rest of the field was cancelled out by catching the safety car, while Alonso, Massa and Kubica fell down the order. Hamilton's stop was for a replacement front wing. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 14 and the cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel locked his tyres and ran deep <b>driving</b> <b>into</b> the final turn, and resisted Hamilton's attempt at overtaking him. Alonso immediately pushed hard and passed Hülkenberg for ninth place at turn 17 on the 15th lap. A line of cars formed behind Kobayashi while Vettel and Hamilton pulled away from the rest of the field, as the front two began trading the fastest lap time of the event. Button gained a large amount of top speed but remained behind both Sauber cars. Schumacher passed both Virgin cars to move into the 17th position by lap 17.|$|E
