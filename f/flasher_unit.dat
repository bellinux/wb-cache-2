40|$|In the Ahuachapán Geothermal Field the {{reinjection}} pipeline used {{to connect}} the <b>flasher</b> <b>unit</b> with the injection zone in Chipilapa has a total length of 6. 02 km. The main flow is carried by a 24 ” pipe diameter of 4647 length until the Ch- 7 bis pad where it is distributed into the injector wells Ch- 7, Ch- 7 bis and Ch- 9. Because the pipeline is operated by gravity “open channel ” the flow capacity {{is limited to the}} elevation between the flasher and any of the injector wells (dh). In this way using the wells Ch- 7 bis and Ch- 9 a dh of 18. 75 m give a maximum flow of 326 kg/s and if a residual water of 345 kg/s is operated 19 kg/s must be spilled into the waste channel. The use of the wells Ch- 7 and Ch- 9 decrease the dh to 11. 7 m given a maximum flow of 239 kg/s rising the spilling water to 106 kg/s. To overcome this problem the pipeline must be operated as “filled pipe ” by pressure gradient. Under this mode estimations of the pressure distribution along the pipeline give a maximum flow of 495 kg/s using by order the injector wells Ch- 7, Ch- 7 bis and Ch- 9...|$|E
40|$|The GCT is a dual-mirror Small-Sized-Telescope {{prototype}} {{proposed for}} the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Calibration of the GCT's camera is primarily achieved with LED-based <b>flasher</b> <b>units</b> capable of producing ∼ 4 ns FWHM pulses of 400 nm light across a large dynamic range, from 0. 1 up to 1000 photoelectrons. The <b>flasher</b> <b>units</b> are housed in {{the four corners of}} the camera's focal plane and illuminate it via reflection from the secondary mirror. These <b>flasher</b> <b>units</b> are adaptable to allow several calibration scenarios to be accomplished: camera flat-fielding, linearity measurements (up to and past saturation), and gain estimates from both single pe measurements and from the photon statistics at various high illumination levels. In these proceedings, the performance of the GCT flashers is described, together with ongoing simulation work to quantify the efficiency of using muon rings as an end-to-end calibration for the optical throughput of the GCT.

40|$|A unique safety flasher {{powered by}} {{photovoltaic}} cells and ultracapacitors has been developed. Safety flashers are used wherever there are needs to mark actually or potentially hazardous locations. Examples of such locations include construction sites, highway work sites, and locations of hazardous operations. Heretofore, safety flashers have been powered by batteries, {{the use of}} which entails several disadvantages: Batteries must be kept adequately charged, and must {{not be allowed to}} become completely discharged. Batteries have rather short cycle lives, and their internal constituents that react chemically to generate electricity deteriorate (and hence power-generating capacities decrease) over time. The performances of batteries are very poor at low temperatures, which often occur in the circumstances in which safety flashers are most needed. The disposal of batteries poses a threat to the environment. The development of the present photovoltaic/ultracapacitor- powered safety flasher, in which the ultracapacitors are used to store energy, overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages of using batteries to store energy. The ultracapacitors in this <b>flasher</b> are electrochemical <b>units</b> that have extremely high volumetric capacitances because they contain large-surface-area electrodes separated by very small gaps. Ultracapacitors have extremely long cycle lives, as compared to batteries; consequently, it will never be necessary to replace the ultracapacitors in the safety flasher. The reliability of the flasher is correspondingly increased, and the life-of-system cost and the adverse environmental effects of the flasher are correspondingly reduced. Moreover, ultracapacitors have excellent low-temperature characteristics, are maintenance-free, and provide consistent performance over time...|$|R
