5|$|Helena, knowing Ruiz is soon {{scheduled}} to testify, makes {{a deal with}} Juan Obregón (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over his partner's death. During a phone conversation between Ayala and Metzger, Ayala deduces that it was Metzger who originally informed on Ruiz. Evidently in a bid for power with another drug cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala organization's downfall. Ayala says that Metzger was planning on taking over Ayala's empire completely. As Ayala <b>hangs</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone, Metzger {{looks up to see}} two hit men entering his office. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration. Bodyguards wrestle him to the ground, but Gordon is able to surreptitiously plant a listening bug under Ayala's desk. Gordon is forced from the property, with the satisfaction of knowing that there is now a new opportunity to trap Ayala.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim <b>hangs</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and <b>hangs</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

Continuing, Lola runs alongside a cyclist who offers to sell her his bike, which she refuses; a flash-forward shows him being robbed on his bike but later marrying a nurse from the hospital in which he recovered. Lola then causes a car crash, which involves her father's colleague, Mr. Meier, and three men in a white BMW. As Lola arrives at the bank, she passes a banker shown later to be paralyzed in a car accident, then killing herself shortly after. She meets her dad, who dismisses her request for help; he reveals that he's not her biological father and that he plans to elope with his pregnant mistress, and then has Lola escorted out of the bank. A security guard who consoles her is shown to later suffer a heart attack.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the play}} the two theatre critics discuss things they may write about this typical whodunit, {{but they are}} often sidetracked by their soliloquies, Moon's {{concerning}} his professional jealousy of Higgs and Birdboot's concerning his newly found [...] "love", the actress playing Cynthia. As they talk, the telephone on stage begins to ring incessantly until Moon cannot stand it any more. He walks up on stage to answer it {{only to discover that}} Birdboot's wife, Myrtle, is on the line. Birdboot speaks to her and as he <b>hangs</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> play suddenly starts again and he gets trapped in it, mistaken for Simon, leading to his inevitable demise as he executes the role to its end, just after recognising the dead body onstage as Higgs, the first string critic who was unavailable that night. Moon ascends the stage to unravel Birdboot's death, taking on the role of Inspector Hound. Major Magnus accuses Moon of being the madman, since he is not the real Inspector Hound, and he tries to run but Magnus shoots him. As Moon lies dying on the floor, Magnus reveals himself to not only be the real Inspector Hound but also Cynthia's lost husband, Albert, who had disappeared ten years earlier. Moon, however, also recognises him as third-string critic Puckeridge, who will now become the first-string as both Higgs and Moon are out of the way.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, Lindsey {{is finally}} exposed as the Gloved Hand Killer. When Lindsey tries {{to hide from}} the police, Silas {{contacts}} her and helps her escape. She recognises him from the hospital, and he reveals his true identity to her. Silas tells her that he wants to help her as he, [...] "knew a Lynsey once before", and it is a beautiful name. He expresses a deep admiration for her work so far and offers her the chance to go into hiding with him as he feels that with the right tuition from him, the pair would make an unstoppable force. As Lindsey gives him a willing smile, the two serial killers drive off into the night. Lindsey later calls Silas in desperate need of his help after she attempts to convince Kim to steal her son, JJ from her ex-fiancé, Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan). Silas replies by saying that he knew she would return to him, and <b>hangs</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone with a sinister smile. Silas turns his attention to Kim, using a fake name [...] "Edward" [...] on social media, to lure her in. Believing that he has information on Lindsey's whereabouts, Kim inadvertently goes along with it. Silas tells her he is a retired policeman and uses her as a decoy so that the two killers can go ahead with their dastardly plans. Silas later meets Lindsey at a car park and tells her that he has Kim on side and that the plan is proceeding perfectly: that sooner or later, Lindsey will be reunited with her son and he will finally get another chance to claim the life of Mercedes.|$|E

60|$|It was a warm, dark {{winter day}} with the Sou'-West wind singing through Dallington Forest, and the woods below the Beacon.

The bright leaf Still clung to the beech coppice; the long chestnut leaves lay orange on the ground, and the rides were speckled with scarlet-lipped sprouting acorns.

60|$|The South-Eastern Railway is {{only one}} {{striking}} instance of the general unserviceableness of private ownership for public services. Nearly all the British railway companies, in greater or less degree, present now a similar degenerative process. Years of profit-sweating, of high dividends, have left them with old stations, old rolling stock, old staffs, bad habits and diminishing borrowing power. Only {{a few of these}} corporations make any attempt to keep pace with invention. It is remarkable now in an epoch of almost universal progress how stagnant the British privately owned railways are. One travels now-a-days if anything with a decrease of comfort from the 1880 accommodation, because of the greater overcrowding; and there has been no general increase of speed, no increase in smooth running, no increase in immunity from accident now for quite a number of years. One travels in a dingy box of a compartment that is too ill-lit at night for reading and full of invincible draughts. In winter the only warmth is too often an insufficient footwarmer of battered tin, for which the passengers fight fiercely with their feet. An observant person cannot fail to be struck--especially if he is returning from travel upon the State railways of Switzerland or Germany--by the shabby-looking porters on so many of our lines--they represent the standard of good clothing for the year 1848 or thereabouts--and by the bleak misery of many of the stations, the universal dirt that electricity might even now abolish. You dare not drop a parcel on any British railway cushion for fear of the cloud of horrible dust you would raise; you have to put it down softly. Consider, too, the congested infrequent suburban trains that ply round any large centre of population, the inefficient goods and parcel distribution that <b>hangs</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> trade of the local shopman everywhere. Not only in the arrested standard of comfort, but in the efficiency of working also are our privately owned railways a hopeless discredit to private ownership.|$|E
