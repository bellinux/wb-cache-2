Once again, as he ran on foot toward German lines, Stahlschmidt was fired on by an Allied truck convoy which he had just overflown. However he {{was picked up by}} a German {{reconnaissance}} unit. Back at Staffel HQ Stahlschmidt learned from Marseille and Homuth that the lead Kittyhawk had pulled up sharply and fired accurately. Both were of the opinion that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> shot. The Allied pilot was the leading Australian ace, Squadron Leader Clive Caldwell, CO of No. 112 Squadron RAF.|$|E
500|$|I deplore {{the fact}} that East Germans were shot while trying to flee westward, but the Berlin Wall served a useful purpose. It contributed to a {{polarisation}} between the two blocs, but it also gave a certain stability to their relationship. While the Wall was standing, there was peace. Today there's hardly a place that isn't in flames. Were you ever in East Germany? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> country! ...|$|E
500|$|Celia Imrie {{was also}} a long-standing friend of Wood, and had even been in the studio {{audience}} when Wood performed on the TV talent show New Faces in 1974. However, {{it was only when}} Wood saw her act in a show by BBC Scotland called Eighty-One Take Two that she was impressed enough to hire her friend for the show. Imrie played various roles throughout the run, like a co-presenter of McConomy (a spoof TV economy show), and most famously Miss Babs in Acorn Antiques. Imrie said in 2007, [...] "Miss Babs is still what I'm best known for, even though I don't go around with bright yellow hair." [...] During her run in As Seen On TV Imrie received a fan letter from playwright Alan Bennett. [...] "He wrote a card to me saying he adored Miss Babs. You can't imagine how thrilling that was. I still have that card today." [...] Imrie though believes that the praise should go to Wood's writing: [...] "Every word is of huge importance and crafted to perfection. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful,</b> happy accident that I met her." ...|$|E

2500|$|More drama {{occurred}} {{behind the}} scenes of the film, originally titled Deadlock. The Kay Lawrence role was originally intended to be Kristine Miller's breakout role, but Scott, ever competitive with all other actresses, grabbed the role for herself. Miller later recalled, [...] "(Wallis) planned to star me in 'I Walk Alone.' He tested me with Burt; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> test, but then Lizabeth Scott decided she wanted the role, and Lizabeth got whatever she wanted—from Hal Wallis! (Laughs) So, I got the second part instead." [...] Douglas, while working with Lancaster on the film, noted: ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} she would return in 2004, Benjamin said, [...] "I loved Lisa. She was a great {{character}} and I loved playing all those story lines. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> opportunity for me but all that angst and that drama can sometimes get to you. She hasn't been killed off. Loads of characters are revived and brought back but I don't know if it's something I'd want to do again at the moment. It still feels like only yesterday I was there and it's good to kind of recharge your batteries and {{get out there and}} do other things. But I love the show and I’d never say never! And I liked playing Lisa. I thought she was a great character so you just don’t know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst Rouvas was {{disappointed}} with his seventh-place finish, announcing to Greek media [...] "I am so sorry, I {{wanted us to}} win", there was still unanimous support towards the artist himself in the country. [...] "Seventh in Europe, first in our hearts" [...] many journalists reported on Greek television. The media and public pronounced their support for Rouvas, the general consensus being that the artist gave it his best even though this did not translate in enough votes in the contest. All criticism in Greece focused on {{the selection of the}} song itself, rather than the artist's performance. Rouvas stated that, overall, it has all been a wonderful experience for him: [...] "some win, some lose, personally, I gave everything I had. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> experience".|$|E

2500|$|Frank Tyson met {{his wife}} Ursula Miels (born in 1936) in Melbourne on the 1954–55 tour, and they married in a Melbourne church on 22 November 1957 with much publicity. They had three children, Philip (a non-Typhoon medium paced bowler), Sara and Anna, and eight grandchildren. He retired from first class cricket in 1960 and emigrated to Australia as a ten pound pom, as his hero Harold Larwood had done ten years earlier. [...] "It had struck me while I was over there that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> country to bring up a family, with the open spaces, the climate and the job opportunities". He became a {{schoolmaster}} at Carey Baptist Grammar School in Melbourne, teaching English, French and History, later becoming a housemaster {{and the head of}} languages.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{never would}} have {{amounted}} to anything in the theatre if it hadn't been for Orson Welles," [...] Lee recalled. [...] "The way I looked at acting, it was interesting and it was certainly better than going hungry. But I didn't have a serious approach to it until … I bumped into Orson Welles. He was putting on a Federal Theatre production of Macbeth with Negro players and, somehow, I won the part of Banquo. He rehearsed us for six solid months, but when the play finally went on before an audience, it was right—and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> sensation, knowing it was right. Suddenly, the theatre became important to me. I had a respect for it, for what it could say. I had the ambition—I caught it from Orson Welles—to work like mad and be a convincing actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} {{might have been the}} sheer size of Rubinstein's hands. They were huge, and many {{observers}} commented on them. Josef Hofmann observed that Rubinstein's fifth finger [...] "was as thick as my thumb—think of it! [...] Then his fingers were square at the ends, with cushions on them. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> hand." [...] Pianist Josef Lhevinne described them as [...] "fat, pudgy ... with fingers so broad at the finger-tips that he often had difficulty in not striking two notes at once." [...] The German piano teacher Ludwig Deppe advised American pianist Amy Fay to watch carefully how Rubinstein struck his chords: [...] "Nothing cramped about him! [...] He spreads his hands as if he were going to take in the universe, and takes them up with the greatest freedom and abandon!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> purpose that," [...] he cried. [...] "To see him hang--hang by the neck. Bah! What {{concern of}} yours, Joan, <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> I wonder?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Historians {{have been}} mixed in their {{evaluations}} of Charles and his reign. [...] One {{of the most critical}} has been Helmut Rumpler, the head of the Habsburg commission of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, who has described Charles as [...] "a dilettante, far too weak for the challenges facing him, out of his depth, and not really a politician." [...] However, others have seen Charles as a brave and honourable figure who tried, as Emperor-King, to halt World War I. An English writer, Herbert Vivian, wrote: [...] "Karl was a great leader, a Prince of peace, who wanted to save the world from a year of war; a statesman with ideas to save his people from the complicated problems of his Empire; a King who loved his people, a fearless man, a noble soul, distinguished, a saint from whose grave blessings come." [...] Furthermore, Anatole France, the French novelist, stated: [...] "Emperor Karl is the only decent man {{to come out of the}} war in a leadership position, no one listened to him. He sincerely wanted peace, and therefore was despised by the whole world. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> chance that was lost." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after Desert Fury, Wallis {{began work}} on Deadlock, the {{original}} project name for Beggars Are Coming to Town. Again Miller would be cast with Desert Furys Burt Lancaster and Wendell Corey. After weeks of rehearsals on the Modjeska Canyon location, {{under the direction of}} Byron Haskin, Miller suddenly became the second leading lady. Lizabeth Scott, ever competitive with all actresses, grabbed the Kay role for herself. Miller later recalled, [...] "(Wallis) planned to star me in 'I Walk Alone.' He tested me with Burt; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> test. But then Lizabeth Scott decided she wanted the role, and Lizabeth got whatever she wanted—from Hal Wallis! [...] So, I got the second part instead." [...] The 21-year-old Miller was recast as the slumming socialite divorcée, Alexis Richardson. Miller was afraid that playing a [...] "meanie" [...] role might typecast her. She was also forced to cut her 22-inch hair into a shorter chignon. In designing Miller's wardrobe, Edith Head was impressed by Miller's physique, describing it as [...] "the most exciting figure since Betty Grable." [...] The resulting film was renamed I Walk Alone (1948). Shooting took place early December 1946–mid-February 1947. The film was released January 16, 1948. She was 5th-billed after Kirk Douglas. Despite Miller's fears of being typecast as a femme fatale, film historians tend to typecast her [...] "as always playing the 'good girl.'" [...] Typecasting reflected real life as Miller's name seldom appeared in gossip columns and when it did, never involved scandal. Though Miller participated in the Hollywood dating circuit, the one name that invariably appeared in the press was William Haskel Schuyler, a television pioneer and consultant based in San Francisco. In late November 1947, it was announced that Miller and Schuyler would wed. But the marriage was postponed.|$|E
