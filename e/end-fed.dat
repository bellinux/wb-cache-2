Rather than being hard-wired to a junction box (which requires a feeder device to be snapped into the track, either in the middle or at one end), {{it can also be}} <b>end-fed</b> from a standard wall outlet. Outlets can also be snapped into line-voltage track.|$|E
5000|$|The J-pole antenna is an <b>end-fed</b> {{omnidirectional}} {{half-wave antenna}} that is matched to the feedline by a quarter wave parallel transmission line stub of Lecher system form. Matching to the feed-line {{is achieved by}} sliding the connection of the feedline back and forth along the stub until an impedance match is obtained. [...] Being a half-wave antenna, it provides a small gain over a quarter-wave ground-plane antenna.|$|E
50|$|An ATU will be {{inserted}} {{somewhere along the}} line connecting the radio transmitter or receiver to the antenna. The antenna feedpoint is usually high in the air (for example, a dipole antenna) or far away (for example, an <b>end-fed</b> random wire antenna). A transmission line, or feedline, must carry the signal between the transmitter and the antenna. The ATU can be placed anywhere along the feedline: at the transmitter, at the antenna, or somewhere in between.|$|E
50|$|The antenna of the FuG 224 was unusual, a four element Dielektrische Strahler or polyrod (British) array. Capture of the {{magnetron}} {{had allowed}} {{the development of}} the Naxos radar detector as a countermeasure to it. This had been the first equipment to use a polyrod antenna. Each rod is a tapering <b>end-fed</b> rod made of a polystyrene dielectric. The four array elements were 3 λ long and spaced 1.5 λ apart. Using this array, rather than a parabolic dish, gave an extremely compact antenna, with only a shallow protrusion, which was well-suited for aircraft carriage, particularly when needed to rotate. The array could rotate at the high speed of 400 rpm, fast enough that the PPI display did not require the usual long persistence phosphor.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, {{there were}} {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} service on the branch, and electrification took place in 1957. The low-cost nature of the electrification meant that although the branch could support eight-car trains as far as North Weald, a maximum of four cars could run to Ongar. The voltage drop along the <b>end-fed</b> line was too great to support full-length trains, and the short platforms were not long enough to support eight-car trains. Hence the Epping to Ongar branch was normally operated as an isolated extension of the Central line, with a few through workings south to Loughton. However, for two days every year through trains were run from London, terminating at North Weald for the North Weald airshow, on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening at the aerodrome almost adjacent to the station. The normal Epping to Ongar shuttle dovetailed with this service, passing the terminating trains on the adjacent line during its westbound journey. The through trains were operated as extra trains on the normal weekend Central line timetables, only four cars long due to the restricted platform length at North Weald.|$|E
40|$|Student Number : 0002066 T - MSc {{dissertation}} - School of Electrical and Information Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentInvestigations of uni-directional, horizontally polarized waveguide antennas with longitudinal slotted arrays {{operating at}} 2. 45 GHz and their applications to wireless local area networks (WLAN) {{are presented in}} this paper. Requirements, considerations, and limitations associated with the design process of this particular waveguide are discussed and presented. Various antenna parameters were simulated using MATLAB® and SuperNEC® software simulation programs, and were applied to a sensitivity analysis of antenna design. <b>End-fed</b> and center-fed antennas were designed, built, and measured at WLAN frequencies. Measured antennas had high gain above 15 dBi, broad beam around the azimuth, and high efficiency, but were limited by their impedance dependency and narrow bandwidth. The center-fed antenna had 3 dBi higher gain than the 18 dBi gain of the <b>end-fed</b> antenna. The VSWR ratio of both antennas was less than 1 : 1. 5 at the operating frequency. The center-fed antenna had broader azimuth and elevation patterns by 40 ° and 10 °, respectively. The end- fed antenna had more stable gain and VSWR, 50...|$|E
40|$|A {{composite}} nose radome, transparent at microwave frequencies, is {{analyzed for}} use as an isolated cap High Frequency antenna for the CL- 44 aircraft. The theories of asymmetrically-driven antennas are first outlined, and the antenna under investigation is shown to resemble most appropriately an <b>end-fed</b> antenna. The impedance behaviour of the antenna {{at the lower end}} of the HF range is explained qualitatively in terms of an equivalent circuit. Each design parameter in this circuit is then evaluated individually, assuming a wire grid type composite nose-cap, and an 'optimum' region of performance is established...|$|E

Elliott's technique {{was used to}} design a number of <b>end-fed</b> and center-fed planar arrays with different aperture distributions and different amounts overloading in terms of conductances of radiating slots and resistances of coupling slots. Subsequently these arrays were analyzed by employing a full wave method of moments to solve for the coupled integral equations for the slot aperture electric field. Results of a study of radiation pattern and return loss {{as a function of}} frequency for different amounts of overloading are presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{alternative}} configuration for {{an infinite}} coaxially endfed waveguide phased-array antenna is explored. In the proposed configuration, {{the integration of}} the <b>end-fed</b> launcher and the output waveguide, rather than the waveguide in itself, acts as a basic radiator. This allows the design of more compact antenna elements. In order to analyze and optimize the structure, an accurate full-wave simulation tool based on the multimode admittance matrix representation is developed. Results are validated against state-of-the-art commercial CAD software. Numerical simulations involving singly and doubly tuned configurations are presented and discussed to illustrate the potential convenience of the proposed configuration and of the CAD tool developed...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{open-ended}} waveguide {{cavity resonator}} for the microwave curing of bumps, underfills and encapsulants is described. The open oven {{has the potential}} to provide fast alignment of devices during flip-chip assembly, direct chip attach, surface mount assembly or wafer-scale level packaging. The prototype microwave oven was designed to operate at X-band for ease of testing, although a higher frequency version is planned. The device described in the paper {{takes the form of a}} waveguide cavity resonator. It is approximately square in cross-section and is filled with a low-loss dielectric with a relative permittivity of 6. It is excited by <b>end-fed</b> probes in order to couple power preferentially into the TM 3, 3,k mode with the object of forming nine 'hot-spots' in the open end. Low power tests using heat sensitive film demonstrate clearly that selective heating in multiple locations in the open end of the oven is achievabl...|$|E
40|$|The array {{factor of}} a both geometrically and {{electrically}} uniform array is the simple formula for the complex geometric progression sum. This fact, although {{results in the}} simplest of all possible analytical designs, obviously does {{not in the least}} simplify the complicated practical problem of feeding the array elements using multiple driving points. In order to begin the examination of uniform linear arrays with a single driving point, this short paper presents a compact study of the <b>end-fed</b> space arrays with application to geometrically uniform, self-standing linear arrays of parallel dipoles. A number of test array models were simulated, constructed and their radiation pattern was then measured. The experimental and computational results were found to be in good agreement. The developed software applications are available through the Internet as FLOSS Free Libre Open Source Software.

40|$|For mm-waves, {{two types}} of {{low-loss}} waveguide are analysed, designed and measured. One is the hollow substrate integrated waveguide (HSIW) in which the inner dielectric of a traditional substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is removed to resemble the propagation characteristics of a standard rectangular waveguide (RWG). The measured attenuation of a WR 28 -like HSIW is 2 Np/m or 17 dB/m throughout the Ka band. The second is the dielectric insular image guide (DIIG) in which an insular layer is added between the dielectric and the metallic ground to further reduce the conductor loss. The measured attenuation of a Ka band DIIG is 26 dB/m at 35 GHz. Based on the two waveguides, two high-gain antenna arrays operating in the Ka band are designed and measured. One is a 6 x 6 slot antenna array, centrefed by the HSIW. The Taylor-distribution technique is applied in two orthogonal directions to suppress the sidelobe level. The measured gain of this antenna array is 17. 1 dBi at the centre frequency of 35. 5 GHz. The other is a double-sided 10 - element dielectric insular resonator antenna (DIRA) array, <b>end-fed</b> by the DIIG. The Taylor-distribution technique is also applied here to achieve a gain of 15. 8 dBi at the centre frequency of 36 GHz. The great potential of these high-performance antennas {{is that they can}} be integrated with other microwave components (filters, power amplifiers, etc.) to form a complete front-end or transceiver in multi-chip module (MCM) technology...|$|E
