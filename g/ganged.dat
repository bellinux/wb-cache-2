25|$|There are two {{competing}} myths {{relating to the}} death of Orpheus. According to Eratosthenes, Orpheus failed to make a necessary sacrifice to Dionysus due to his regard for Apollo as the supreme deity instead. Dionysus then sent his followers to rip Orpheus apart.

At first, his music charmed them as well, but eventually their numbers and clamor overwhelmed his music and he was hit by the spears.

William was not ready to get involved so Tostig sailed from the Cotentin Peninsula, but because of storms ended up in Norway, where he successfully enlisted the help of Harold Hardrada. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle has a different version of the story, having Tostig land in the Isle of Wight in May 1066, then ravaging the English coast, before arriving at Sandwich, Kent.

25|$|The {{solar wind}} and {{magnetosphere}} consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It {{is well known}} (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs {{in a direction that}} the conductor cuts across (or is cut by), rather than along, the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors <b>ganged</b> together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process ("the dynamo effect"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.|$|E

At the party's leadership convention held on September 9, 1954, the Liberals appeared badly split along religious lines.

[...] "Unfortunately for the Liberals", historian Murray Beck writes, [...] "it appeared as if the delegates had <b>ganged</b> up to defeat the only Catholic among the contestants". Beck also notes that [...] "Nova Scotia governments have always been most vulnerable after a change in leadership". In the next provincial election held on October 30, 1956, Robert Stanfield and his Conservatives won 24 seats, the Liberals 18. The 23-year Liberal era, begun under Macdonald's leadership, had finally ended.|$|E

2500|$|The Bode {{equaliser}} can {{be converted}} into a constant resistance filter by using the entire Bode network as the Z branch of a Zobel network, resulting in a rather complex network of bridge T networks embedded in a larger bridge T.

[...] Note that the dual of a constant resistance bridge T network is the identical network. [...] The dual of a Bode network is therefore the same network except for the load resistance RL, which must be the inverse, RL', in the dual circuit.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Criminologists {{disagree}} {{on the level of}} organization present in street <b>gangs.</b> On one end of the spectrum, <b>gangs</b> are thought to be highly organized groups with formal rules and regulations. Conversely, some scholars argue that <b>gangs</b> are groups of loosely affiliated individuals. The present research will revisit this debate by looking at how <b>gang</b> organization, as perceived by individual <b>gang</b> members, affects the length of time an individual spends in a <b>gang.</b> This research also investigates how one’s identity as a <b>gang</b> member affects desistance from the <b>gang.</b> As a competing explanation, we examine the role of self-control theory in relation to desistance from <b>gang</b> membership. We use discrete-time event history models to evaluate whether perceived <b>gang</b> organization and an individual’s identity as a <b>gang</b> member impact desistance from street <b>gangs.</b> Results indicate that increased perceived <b>gang</b> organization is independently associated with longer length of time in the <b>gang.</b> Furthermore, the effect of one’s social identity on the length of time in the <b>gang</b> is mediated by whether the individual has peers outside the <b>gang</b> and how much time they spend with their <b>gang</b> peers...|$|R

2500|$|The Arrowplane was not {{intended}} for production or to be roadable, but its success in the Vidal competition encouraged Waterman to form the Waterman Arrowplane Co. in 1935 for production of a roadable version. [...] The resulting Arrowbile, referred to by Waterman as the W-5, was similar both structurally and aerodynamically to the Arrowplane, though the fins differed in shape, with rounded leading edges and swept-back rudder hinges. For road use the wings and propeller could be quickly detached. [...] The main other differences were in engine choice, the need to drive the wheels and to use conventional car floor-type controls on the road. The air-cooled Menasco {{was replaced by a}} water-cooled engine as used by most cars. [...] Waterman modified a 6-cylinder upright, 100hp (75kW) Studebaker unit and placed it lower down in the pod, driving the propeller shaft {{at the top of the}} fuselage via six <b>ganged</b> V-belts with a 1.94:1 speed reduction. The radiator was in the forward fuselage, fed from a duct opening in the extreme upper nose. On the ground the engine drove the main wheels through a differential gear, as normal, and the car was steered by its nosewheel. The wheels were enclosed in fairings, initially as a road safety measure. Instead of removing the propeller for the road, it could be de-clutched to prevent it windmilling the engine at speed.|$|E
2500|$|Cabinet {{table saws}} are heavy (using {{large amounts of}} cast iron and steel) to {{minimize}} vibration and increase accuracy. A cabinet saw is characterized by having an enclosed base (cabinet). Cabinet saws usually have induction motors in the 3 to 5 hp (2 to 4kW) range, single-phase, but motors in the 5 to 7 HP (4 to 6kW) range, three-phase, are common in commercial/industrial sites. For home use, this type of motor typically requires that a heavy-duty circuit be installed (in the US, this requires a 240 volt receptacle, or [...] "hard" [...] wiring and a dedicated branch circuit). The motor is enclosed within the cabinet and drives the blade with two to four parallel V-belts, often [...] "A" [...] belts as [...] "A" [...] belts may be <b>ganged</b> without having to be specially selected (otherwise, specially selected sets of light-duty [...] "4L" [...] belts are used). Cabinet saws are heavier and offer the following advantages over contractor saws: heavier construction for lower vibration and increased durability; a cabinet-mounted trunnion (the mechanism that incorporates the saw blade mount and allows for height and tilt adjustment); improved dust collection due to the totally enclosed cabinet and common incorporation of a dust collection port. Cabinet saws are designed for, and are capable of very high duty-cycles, such as are encountered in commercial/industrial applications. Where some {{of the advantages of}} a cabinet saw are desired in a home shop application, so-called [...] "hybrid" [...] saws have emerged to address this need.|$|E
