40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relations between the ICF components from a subjective perspective. Method: Data on <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> and perceived functioning were collected among 2941 individuals with at least one chronic disease or disorder. Path analysis was used with perceived level of participation as the final denominator. Three models were tested: one with the number of chronic diseases and disorders as an indicator of <b>health</b> <b>condition,</b> one with perceived health as indicator of <b>health</b> <b>condition,</b> and one with perceived health as part of the personal factors. Results: Although all models showed a good fit, the model with the best fit was that with perceived health as an indicator of <b>health</b> <b>condition.</b> Conclusions: From a patient's perspective, components of the ICF scheme appear to be associated with each other, with perceived health being the best indicator of the <b>health</b> <b>condition.</b> Implications for Rehabilitation The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a international accepted framework to describe human functioning from a health perspective. In research the ICF components are mostly operationalized using objective measures, for instance Performance tests. This large scale study shows that also with perceived measures and independent of a specific <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> relations between the ICF components can be found. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|R

In addition, we aimed to examine variables associated with work ability for workers with and without a chronic <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> separately. Methods: The data of this cross-sectional study were obtained from 5, 247 workers aged 45 years and older in five different work sectors. Work ability was assessed with the first item of the Work Ability Index. The presence of a chronic <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> was assessed by self-report. Independent variables in the multivariable linear regression analysis were work conditions, psychosocial factors and perceived health status. Results: The presence of a chronic <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> was negatively associated with work ability (B = - 0. 848). The strength of this association slightly attenuated after subsequently adding individual characteristics (B = - 0. 824), work conditions (B = - 0. 805) and more so after adding psychosocial factors (B = - 0. 704) and especially perceived health variables (B = - 0. 049) to the model. Variables associated with work ability for workers with and without a chronic <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> were similar. Conclusion: Perceived health and psychosocial factors, rather than work conditions, explained the association between the presence of a chronic <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> and work ability. Substantial differences in variables associated with work ability for workers with and without a chronic <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> were not found. Based on the lower mean scores for workers with a chronic <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> and work ability as well for predictors, these workers might have the most benefit by a policy focussing on enhancing these associated variables. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

During this expansion land was donated for the Old St. Louis County Courthouse.

The state constitutional convention and first General Assembly met in St. Louis in 1820. Shortly thereafter, St. Louis incorporated as a city, on December 9, 1822. The first mayor of the city was William Carr Lane, and a Board of Aldermen replaced the earlier Board of Trustees.

Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis. However, Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.|$|E
