Empanadas are individual sized and closed savoury pastries which may be fried or baked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> are generally eaten with the hands.|$|E

25|$|Yorishiro are, however, most {{numerous}} in people's homes. During the New Year's holidays people decorate their entrances with kadomatsu, {{which are}} the yorishiro of the new year's kami. Kamifuda, pieces of paper representing the kami, are hung above the door. There are kami who dwell in the toilet (benjō-gami) and in the well (suijin). The kamado-gami lives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> its function {{is to protect the}} house from fires. Other common yorishiro are the small altar called kamidana and the butsudan, which is an altar for the dead. (Butsudan were originally meant just for Buddhist worship, but now often contain also spirit tablets called ihai, which are yorishiro used to recall the spirits of one's dead ancestors). In shops one often sees clay cats with a raised paw called maneki-neko or rake-like bamboo objects called kumade supposed to attract good business.|$|E
25|$|Coordinated {{words are}} {{normally}} written separately (with a comma). If {{the meaning of}} the result is {{different from that of the}} two words together, but both elements take suffixes, they are written with a hyphen (e.g. süt-főz ‘cook’, consisting of words referring to cooking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> cooking in water, sütnek-főznek ‘they cook’). A hyphen is needed in cases when a phrase is only used with certain suffixes. Connections of words which are completely fused and thus take suffixes only at the end of the second element are written as one word (e.g. búbánat ‘sorrow and grief’, búbánatos ‘stricken with sorrow and grief’). However, there are phrases that only take suffixes at the end but their elements are still connected with a hyphen, as when words are contrasted (e.g. édes-bús ‘bittersweet’). Certain phrases can be suffixed either at the end of both elements or only at the end of the second element (e.g. hírnév ‘fame’: hírneve or híre-neve ‘his/her/its fame’).|$|E
25|$|The {{somewhat}} scanty biblical details {{concerning the}} shewbread are complemented by further information given by Josephus (a contemporary of Herod's temple), and, over the several centuries after the Temple's destruction, by classical rabbinical literature. According to Josephus, the cakes were unleavened and were baked on the Friday before the Sabbath, since the biblical regulations forbade work {{of any kind}} during the Sabbath. The Mishnah argues that the loaves were kneaded separately, but baked in pairs; the Mishnah also states that the loaves were moulded into shape by three different moulds (made from gold, according to Maimonides, who lived {{more than a thousand}} years after the burning of Jerusalem), with one being used while the loaves were just dough, another while the bread was being baked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> <b>and</b> a third after baking, to protect the shape. The Mishnah describes the loaves as being 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, with rims/horns that were 7 Etzba long; Maimonides gives the same figures but with Tefah as the unit rather than Etzba.|$|E

2500|$|Arriving on {{the wave}} of country rock {{following}} on from Gram Parsons, The Band, and the Eagles, Friedman originally found cult fame as a country and western singer. His break came in 1973 thanks to Commander Cody, who contacted Vanguard Music on his behalf. Friedman released Kinky Friedman in 1974 for ABC Records, then toured with Bob Dylan in 1975-6. His repertoire mixed social commentary ("We Reserve the Right to Refuse Service to You") and maudlin ballads ("Western Union Wire") with raucous humor (such as [...] "Get Your Biscuits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oven</b> <b>and</b> Your Buns in Bed"). His [...] "Ride 'Em Jewboy" [...] was an extended tribute {{to the victims of}} the Holocaust.|$|E

The Element of Freedom was scheduled to be released on December 1, 2009, to correspond with World AIDS Day, but was pushed back to December 15 for additional recording. According to the senior vice president of urban marketing for J Records, Keys [...] "had a couple of more things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>and</b> she wants this to be right [...] So we gave her the additional time she needed." [...] Keys pointed out that she felt the album was being rushed for no reason.

It was just two weeks' difference, but it made for an even better record".|$|E
60|$|Not a child complained after that, but ran about helpfully, {{bringing}} moccasins, {{heating the}} footstone, and {{getting ready for}} a long drive, because Gran'ma lived twenty miles away, and there were no railroads in those parts to whisk people to and fro like magic.

40|$|Support {{processes}} in industrial energy systems, such as heating, ventilation and cooling systems, are important {{processes in}} industrial premises {{as they are}} related to energy cost, product quality as well as <b>the</b> indoor environment. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> vehicle production process the paint shop is the most energy intensive part, and about 75 % of the energy is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>and</b> spray booths. <b>The</b> spray booth line, which includes paint application <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> uses large quantities of air {{in order to keep}} <b>the</b> air quality <b>in</b> an optimal range to achieve the desired paint quality. <b>The</b> approach used <b>in</b> paint shops has up to now been to keep as much of steady state conditions as possible to avoid paint defects due to disturbances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> balance. This means that these high air flows are used also at low and non production hours. There is thus a large potential to increase energy efficiency by controlling the air flow and heating without losing the critical balances. This paper will present an initial post-implementation evaluation of the energy efficiency potential and experiences after running this type of system. CFD has been used to investigate the control strategy. Deltagit i ett Vinnova projekt: Energieffektivt måleri</p...|$|R
