5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size. In oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG suitable for <b>further</b> <b>processing,</b> {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an anchoring point for linkers suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake <b>further</b> <b>processing.</b> The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground {{was built}} between 1995 and 2004 over the former Sai Tso Wan Landfill. During the construction, the former {{landfill}} underwent {{a series of}} restoration works. A final capping layer was added to prevent leakage; a landfill gas control system was used to deploy methane from the decomposed rubbish as fuel, and a leachate management system was built to collect leachate for <b>further</b> <b>processing.</b> The recreation ground started its operation on 30 April 2004.|$|E

5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects in a cloud. As many as 50 of these could be picked out for <b>further</b> <b>processing</b> in the Discrimination and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was able to run 100 different tests. For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to determine their mass.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} cells export {{proteins}} produced by ribosomes {{attached to the}} rough ER. The ribosomes assemble amino acids into protein units, which are carried into the rough ER for further adjustments. These proteins may be either transmembrane proteins, which become embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, or water-soluble proteins, which are able {{to pass through the}} membrane into the lumen. Those that reach the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum are folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation. Chemicals, such as carbohydrates or sugars, are added, then the endoplasmic reticulum either transports the completed proteins, called secretory proteins, to areas of the cell where they are needed, or they are sent to the Golgi apparatus for <b>further</b> <b>processing</b> and modification.|$|E

40|$|Noise {{reduction}} in images, {{also known as}} image smoothing, is an essential and first step before <b>further</b> <b>processings</b> are done on the image. The key to image smoothing is to preserve important features while removing noise from the image. Gaussian function is widely used in image smoothing. Recently {{it has been reported}} that exponential functions (value of the exponent is not equal to 2) perform substantially better than Gaussian functions in modeling and preserving image features. In this paper we propose family of exponential functions, that include Gaussian when the value of the exponent is 2, for image smoothing. We experiment with a variety of images, artificial and real, and demonstrate that optimal results are obtained when the value of the exponent is within a certain range. Image Smoothing 1...|$|R
