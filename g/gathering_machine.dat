In this domain the problem of integrating various Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms into a single intelligent system arises spontaneously. As part of our ongoing effort in automating media content analysis for the social sciences, we have built a modular system by combining multiple AI modules into a flexible framework {{in which they can}} cooperate in complex tasks. Our system combines data <b>gathering,</b> <b>machine</b> translation, topic classification, extraction and annotation of entities and social networks, as well as many other tasks that have been perfected over the past years of AI research. Over the last few years, it has allowed us to realise a series of scientific studies over a vast range of applications including comparative studies between news outlets and media content in different countries, modelling of user preferences, and monitoring public mood. The framework is flexible and allows the design and implementation of modular agents, where simple modules cooperate in the annotation of a large dataset without central coordination...|$|E

5000|$|By {{the dawn}} of the 1970s, Mabuchi had become one of the world's leading {{producers}} of original equipment motors for consumer electronics, toys and model aircraft. But a new problem arose: the [...] "custom made" [...] problem. Usually in the manufacturing industry, making small quantities of many products was the norm, in order to meet market needs. So Mabuchi was taking orders for motors with different specs from each customer and manufacturing motors customized to the client's specifications each time. When production volume was small, the company managed to handle it, but by the 1970s, volume had grown and it became hard to handle all those orders with slightly different specs. The company was oversupplied with a variety of machines and parts. From buying materials, <b>gathering</b> components, <b>machining</b> and assembly, to shipping the products, the production line grew disorderly and difficult to manage. Moreover, there was a time gap between production and the slack of business, with orders mainly centering on customers' Christmas sales campaigns. Because of this, the company had to hire extra seasonal workers every year before the holidays when the factories grew too busy and then discharge them when the period was over and production became slow.|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of powerful, always-on cloud utilities has transformed how consumers interact with information technology, enabling video streaming, intelligent personal assistants, and {{the sharing of}} content. Businesses, too, {{have benefited from the}} cloud, outsourcing much of their information technology to cloud services. Science, however, has not fully exploited the advantages of the cloud. Could scientific discovery be accelerated if mundane chores were automated and outsourced to the cloud? Leading computer scientists Ian Foster and Dennis Gannon argue that it can, and in this book offer a guide to cloud computing for students, scientists, and engineers, with advice and many hands-on examples. The book surveys the technology that underpins the cloud, new approaches to technical problems enabled by the cloud, and the concepts required to integrate cloud services into scientific work. It covers managing data in the cloud, and how to program these services; computing in the cloud, from deploying single virtual machines or containers to supporting basic interactive science experiments to <b>gathering</b> clusters of <b>machines</b> to do data analytics; using the cloud as a platform for automating analysis procedures, machine learning, and analyzing streaming data; building your own cloud with open source software; and cloud security.

40|$|Transportable {{agents are}} a {{relatively}} new technology for coordinating work within an organization. Transportable agents can migrate from <b>machine</b> to <b>machine,</b> <b>gathering</b> information, analyzing it and interacting with human operators if required. They allow unprecedented exibility in carrying out tasks by allowing essentially any distributed organizational scheme to be implemented. Much of the technology for implementing transportable agents is presently available and affordable but mathematical models and analysis techniques for understanding the properties of di erent organizational implementations of agents remains primitive. In this paper, we initiate study {{of one of the}} simplest coordination problems in a distributed system, that of resource allocation. We consider a hierarchical organization in which agents aggregate information at different stages and then act to disseminate it. The process of aggregation introduces noise or uncertainty into the combined information. In this paper, we model how the agent architecture affects the quality of the resulting solutions, demonstrating both analytic and simulation results. Our results show that the architecture of an agent implementation can have a signi cant impact on the accuracy of solutions and that this impact is not always straightforward or intuitive. Specifically, we explain quantitatively why higher levels of a decision structure should have better information integration technology and why agents should minimize the number of information integration steps they perform...|$|R
40|$|Multi-agent {{settings}} are quickly <b>gathering</b> importance in <b>machine</b> learning. Beyond {{a plethora of}} recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks and decentralized optimization can all be seen as instances of this setting. However, the presence of multiple learning agents in these settings renders the training problem non-stationary and often leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method that reasons about the anticipated learning of the other agents. The LOLA learning rule includes an additional term that accounts {{for the impact of}} the agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. We show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using an extension of the likelihood ratio policy gradient update, making the method suitable for model-free RL. This method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and nonlinear function approximators. Preliminary results show that the encounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma (IPD), while independent learning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order gradient-based methods. Applied to infinitely repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA agents can successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the IPD. We also apply LOLA to a grid world task with an embedded social dilemma using deep recurrent policies. Again, by considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to cooperate out of selfish interests...|$|R
40|$|Lapland Mustikanversojen keruu on keskitetty tiheÃ¤puustoisiin kuusikoihin, jotka eivÃ¤t ole hyviÃ¤ mustikan marja-alueita. Mustikanversojen koneellinen keruu poistaa noin 20 % maanylÃ¤puolisesta biomassasta. Versokasvuston biomassa uusiutuu leikkaamattomien mustikkakasvustojen tasolle jo seuraavan kasvukauden aikana. Marjasato putoaa keruun jÃ¤lkeen kahdeksi vuodeksi, mutta palaa leikkaamattomien kasvustojen tasolle kolmantena keruunjÃ¤lkeisenÃ¤ vuonna. Kataja toipuu versojen keruusta pÃ¤Ã¤sÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¶isesti hyvin. Toipumisnopeuden arviointi perustuu katajan keruualueilla suoritettuihin vuosittaisiin seurantoihin. Keruun vaikutusten havainnoimiseksi kÃ¤ytettiin verrokkeina kerÃ¤Ã¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶miÃ¤ katajikoita. Tutkimusten pohjaksi piti katajalle kehittÃ¤Ã¤ ensin sopiva inventointimenetelmÃ¤ ja toipumisen mittaristo. Katajan toipumista selvitettiin myÃ¶s kontrolloiduilla maastokokeilla. Kun kataja menettÃ¤Ã¤ versojaan, se usein lisÃ¤Ã¤ seuraavan vuoden kasvuaan, mikÃ¤ nopeuttaa toipumista. Karuilla kasvipaikoilla toipuminen on hidasta etenkin silloin, jos keruuta seuraavana kasvukautena olosuhteet kasvuun ovat huonot. Biologisesti aktiivisten fenolien pitoisuus on usein korkeampi kerÃ¤tyissÃ¤ kuin kerÃ¤Ã¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶missÃ¤ katajikoissa, mutta keruulla ei ole vaikutuksia terpeenien eli eteeristen Ã¶ljyjen pitoisuuksiin. Keruusuosituksilla varmistetaan katajan riittÃ¤vÃ¤n neulasbiomassan sÃ¤ilyminen ja turvataan toipuminen epÃ¤edullisissakin oloissa. Since late 1990 s, shoots of {{naturally}} growing bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and juniper (Juniperus communis) {{have been}} used as raw material for cosmetic and health-promoting products. During the 2000 s the consumption of these raw materials have reached an industrial scale. As the shoot gathering is increasing, it is necessary to determine the recovery of bilberry and juniper after shoot collection. During 2005 2009, a co-operative research project between Finnish Forest Research Institute, Agrifood and Lapland 4 H organization was conducted {{in order to determine the}} recovery rates of bilberry and juniper by monitoring the sites used for gathering and by controlled field experiments. The aim of the study was to determine whether shoot gathering has any harmful effects on bilberry and juniper, and at which rate the plants compensate for the lost biomass. In the case of bilberry, influences on berry yield were also determined. The shoot gathering is commonly practised in densely forested spruce forests, which generally do not have high berry yields and therefore do not have central role in berry collection. Shoot <b>gathering</b> by <b>machine</b> removes approximately 20 % of the aboveground bilberry biomass. The aboveground biomass renews itself to the uncut levels within one growing season. The berry yield is reduced for two years after shoot gathering and raises back to normal on the third year after the shoot gathering. Juniper most commonly recovers well from shoot gathering. The recovery rate was based on yearly monitoring of the gathering sites. Junipers subjected to shoot gathering were compared to controls with no shoot collection. In the beginning of the project, the investigation required developing suitable methods for inventory and indices for recovery. The responses of juniper to shoot collection were investigated also with controlled experiments. When juniper loses biomass, it often increases growth the next year and by this way, increases the recovery rate. In nutrient-poor and dry conditions, however, the recovery is slow if conditions are environmentally harsh in the following growing season. The concentrations of biologically active compounds, phenolics, are commonly higher in collected than uncollected junipers, but shoot collection does not influence the concentrations of terpenes. The recommendations for shoot collection will ensure the recovery of juniper even in unfavourable environmental conditions. vokSustainable gathering of juniper and bilberry shoots for natural product industr...|$|R
