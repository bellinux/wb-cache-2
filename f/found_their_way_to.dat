5|$|Because {{of their}} long {{association}} with humans, cockroaches are frequently {{referred to in}} popular culture. In Western culture, cockroaches are often depicted as dirty pests. In a 1750–1752 journal, Peter Osbeck noted that cockroaches were frequently seen and <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the bakeries, after the sailing ship Gothenburg ran aground and was destroyed by rocks.|$|E
5|$|Treasure {{hunters have}} {{sought out the}} Eshmun Temple since antiquity; around 1900 {{artifacts}} bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Beirutine antiquities markets where they stirred {{the interest of the}} Ottoman authorities and prompted a series of archeological digs.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} {{led me to}} patronize them. This {{was done}} through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the {{province}} of Trento, Italy provided sculpted wooden figures and animals as well as utensils to create depictions of daily life. The scene featured seventeen figures with nine depicting the Holy Family, the Magi, and the shepherds. The nine figures were originally donated by Saint Vincent Pallotti for the nativity at Rome's Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle in 1842 and eventually <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Vatican. They are dressed anew each year for the scene. The 2008 scene was set in Bethlehem with a fountain and a hearth representing regeneration and light. The same year, the Paul VI Audience Hall exhibited a nativity designed by Mexican artists.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis {{is found}} {{throughout}} the highly limited range of the Lundy cabbage, including sheer sea cliffs and further inland at Millcombe House. The insects also <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Lundy cabbages artificially seeded within the cabbage's range within a year. It had been hypothesised that P. luridipennis and Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes may help pollinate the Lundy cabbage, but observations of the taxa indicate that neither visit flowers. While there are no honey bees on Lundy, other species of winged insects are present. The plant may rely primarily upon pollen beetles of the genus Meligethes and the wind for pollination.|$|E
5|$|The DVD {{edition of}} Ed Wood {{initially}} had difficulty reaching store shelves in The United States and Canada due to unspecified legal issues. The initial release had a featurette on transvestites — not {{relating to the}} film or its actors in any way — which was removed from subsequent releases. An initial street date of August 13, 2002 was announced only to be postponed. A new date of February 3, 2003 was set, only {{for it to be}} recalled again without explanation, although some copies quickly <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> collectors' venues such as eBay. The DVD was finally released on October 19, 2004.|$|E

5|$|Three {{species of}} {{hippopotamus}}, the European hippopotamus (Hippopotamus antiquus), Hippopotamus major and Hippopotamus gorgops, ranged throughout continental Europe and the British Isles. All three species became extinct {{before the last}} glaciation. Ancestors of European hippos <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> many islands of the Mediterranean Sea during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene also saw a number of dwarf species evolve on several Mediterranean islands, including Crete (Hippopotamus creutzburgi), Cyprus (the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus, Hippopotamus minor), Malta (Hippopotamus melitensis), and Sicily (Hippopotamus pentlandi). Of these, the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus survived {{until the end of}} the Pleistocene or early Holocene. Evidence from an archaeological site, Aetokremnos, continues to cause debate on whether or not the species was encountered, and was driven to extinction, by man.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 70,000 Roman coins {{from all}} periods {{were found in}} Poland, starting with the 2nd century BC silver denarii. A treasure {{of these and other}} coins, some as early as the 1st century AD, was found in Połaniec, Staszów County, probably a booty captured around 19 AD from King Marbod of the Marcomanni. Greater waves of Roman money <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Poland throughout 1st and 2nd centuries and then again during 4th and 5th centuries, this time as bronze and golden solidi. The barbarians did not use them for commerce; they were being accumulated in dynastic treasuries of rulers and occasionally used for ceremonial gift exchange. The chiefs also kept large golden Roman medallions or their local imitations. The largest barbarian medallion, an equivalent of 48 solidii, {{is a part of the}} gold and silver treasure found in Zagórzyn near Kalisz.|$|E
5|$|However, Punjab CID {{successfully}} infiltrated {{the conspiracy}} {{at the last}} moment through a sepoy named Kirpal Singh. Sensing that their plans had been compromised, D-Day was brought forward to 19 February, but even these plans <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the intelligence. Plans for revolt by the 130th Baluchi Regiment at Rangoon on 21 January were thwarted. Attempted revolts in the 26th Punjab, 7th Rajput, 130th Baluch, 24th Jat Artillery and other regiments were suppressed. Mutinies in Firozpur, Lahore, and Agra were also suppressed and many key leaders of the conspiracy were arrested, although some managed to escape or evade arrest. A last-ditch attempt was made by Kartar Singh and V. G. Pingle to trigger a mutiny in the 12th Cavalry regiment at Meerut. Kartar Singh escaped from Lahore, but was arrested in Varanasi, and V. G. Pingle was apprehended in Meerut. Mass arrests followed as the Ghadarites were rounded up in Punjab and the Central Provinces. Rash Behari Bose escaped from Lahore and in May 1915 fled to Japan. Other leaders, including Giani Pritam Singh, Swami Satyananda Puri and others fled to Thailand.|$|E

50|$|Conservative Democrats were outraged; led by Al Smith, {{they formed}} the American Liberty League in 1934 and counterattacked.

5000|$|Some of Pius XII's nuncios in {{occupied}} Europe {{were forced}} to flee their nunciatures, including Clemente Micara in Belgium, internuncio Paolo Giobbe in The Netherlands, and Casimir Papée in Poland.

The Yugoslav and Romanian ambassadors also ended up in Rome but were told in 1944 {{to be ready to}} return at a moment's notice. The Baltic nuncios in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were forced out by Russian troops. Although the nuncios de jure retained their titles, their role was either terminated or de facto taken up by Cesare Orsenigo, the nuncio to Germany.|$|R

25|$|During the Akkadian period, the Akkadian {{language}} {{became the}} lingua franca of the Middle East, and was officially used for administration, although the Sumerian language remained as a spoken and literary language.
