40|$|AbstractMinK {{has neither}} the P region nor {{signature}} sequence that characterizes pore-forming subunits of all known K+ channels. A specific minK region {{has now been}} identified that affects external blockade by 2 common probes of K+ channel pores. When mutated to cysteine, residues in this region render minK susceptible to covalent blockade by methanethiosulfonate <b>ethylsulfonate</b> and alter reversible inhibition by tetraethylammonium. The 2 blockers are found to share overlapping binding site determinants and to interact. Since inhibition by external tetraethylammonium is sensitive to voltage and to the internal concentration of permeant ions, we argue that tetraethylammonium blocks by occluding the external end of a water-filled transmembrane pore. These findings {{support the view that}} minK is directly involved in forming a K+-selective ion conduction pathway...|$|E
40|$|The use of alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium {{alkylsulfonate}} ionic liquids {{for implementing}} aqueous biphasic systems is studied {{in this work}} for the first time. The ability of high charge density inorganic salts, such as K 3 PO 4, to promote phase segregation in aqueous solutions containing the ionic liquids 1, 3 -dimethylimidazolium methylsulfonate ([C(1) mim][C 1 SO 3]), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexylsulfonate ([C(2) mim][C 6 SO 3]), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium butylsulfonate ([C(2) mim][C 4 SO 3]), 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium methylsulfonate ([C(4) mim][C 1 SO 3]), 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfonate</b> ([C(4) mim][C 2 SO 3]), 1 -pentyl- 3 -methylimidazolium methylsulfonate ([C(5) mim][C 1 SO 3]), 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium methylsulfonate ([C(6) mim][C 1 SO 3]) and 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium <b>ethylsulfonate</b> ([C(6) mim][C 2 SO 3]) was experimentally determined at 298. 15 K and atmospheric pressure. In general, the hydrophobicity of the ionic liquids studied {{is affected by the}} increase of the alkyl chain length. However, the position of the alkyl chain, whether in the cation or in the anion affects in a different way the lipophilic effect of the ionic liquid. Two ionic liquids with the same number of carbon atoms, the one with a longer chain in the anion is the more hydrophobic. Furthermore, four ionic liquids were chosen to extract the aminoacid L-tryptophan from aqueous solutions. The chain lengths of the anion or cation were fixed and the partition coefficients compared. The extractions, carried out at 298. 15 K, showed the good extractive power of these ionic liquids and also that the less hydrophobic ionic liquids have the better extraction coefficients. Overall, the results from this work identify relations between the length and position of the alkyl chain with the hydrophobicity and also with the extractive power of the imidazolium-alkylsulfonate based ionic liquids.

40|$|Mutations in the {{extracellular}} M 2 -M 3 loop of the glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha 1 subunit {{have been}} shown previously to affect channel gating. In this study, the substituted cysteine accessibility method was used to investigate whether a structural rearrangement of the M 2 -M 3 loop accompanies GlyR activation. All residues from R 271 C to V 277 C were covalently modified by both positively charged methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET) and negatively charged methanethiosulfonate <b>ethylsulfonate</b> (MTSES), implying that these residues form an irregular surface loop. The MTSET modification rate of all residues from R 271 C to K 276 C was faster in the glycine-bound state than in the unliganded state. MTSES modification of A 272 C, L 274 C, and V 277 C was also faster in the glycine-bound state. These results demonstrate that the surface accessibility of the M 2 -M 3 loop is increased as the channel transitions from the closed to the open state, implying that either the loop itself or an overlying domain moves during channel activation...|$|E
40|$|Alkyl- and arylsulfonates {{were tested}} as sole added sources of sulfur {{for the growth}} of {{enrichment}} cultures under strictly anaerobic denitrifying or fermentative conditions. Cultures that utilized taurine, <b>ethylsulfonate,</b> the dyestuffs orange II and acid red I, tolylsulfonate, 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) butyrate (SPB), a dialkyltetralinesul-fonate, and 1 -(4 -sulfophenyl) octane were readily obtained. We chose to work with the simple aromatic com-pounds and isolated a fermentative bacterium, strain EV 4, which utilized SPB as the sole added source of sulfur in glucose-mineral medium. The organism was identified as a Clostridium sp. related to Clostridium beijerinckii. Clostridium sp. strain EV 4 utilized seven of seven tested arylsulfonates quantitatively. The growth yield was about 3 kg of protein per mol of sulfur, whether sulfonate or sulfate was utilized. A major product specific to each sulfonate could be observed. Although no product was identified, the existence of anaerobic desulfonation has been established. Sulfonated aromatic compounds are known to be biodegrad-able in pathways involving oxygenases (see, e. g., references 17 and 31). The idea that arylsulfonates could be degraded anaer-obically has been reviewed (13, 24), but no reproducible evi-dence for the anaerobic cleavage of the COS bond has bee...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{mechanism}} of action and the binding site of APETx 1, a peptide toxin purified from sea anemone, on the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel. Similar {{to the effects of}} gating modifier toxins (hanatoxin and SGTx) on the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) 2. 1 channel, APETx 1 shifts the voltage-dependence of hERG activation in the positive direction and suppresses its current amplitudes elicited by strong depolarizing pulses that maximally activate the channels. The APETx 1 binding site is distinctly different from that of a pore-blocking peptide toxin, BeKm- 1. Mutations in the S 3 b region of hERG have dramatic impact on the responsiveness to APETx 1 : G 514 C potentiates whereas E 518 C abolishes the APETx 1 effect. Restoring the negative charge at position 518 (methanethiosulfonate <b>ethylsulfonate</b> modification of 518 C) partially restores APETx 1 responsiveness, supporting an electrostatic interaction between E 518 and APETx 1. Among the three hERG isoforms, hERG 1 and hERG 3 are equally responsive to APETx 1, whereas hERG 2 is insensitive. The key feature seems to be an arginine residue uniquely present at the 514 -equivalent position in hERG 2, where the other two isoforms possess a glycine. Our data show that APETx 1 is a gating modifier toxin of the hERG channel, and its binding site shares characteristics with those of gating modifier toxin binding sites on other Kv channels...|$|E
40|$|P 2 X receptors are ion {{channels}} {{opened by}} extracellular ATP. The seven subunits currently known are encoded by different genes. It {{is thought that}} each subunit has two transmembrane domains, a large extracellular loop, and intracellular N- and C-termini, a topology which is fundamentally {{different from that of}} other ligand-gated channels such as nicotinic acetylcholine or glutamate receptors. We used the substituted cysteine accessibility method to identify parts of the molecule that form the ionic pore of the P 2 X 2 receptor. Amino acids preceding and throughout the second hydrophobic domain (316 - 354) were mutated individually to cysteine, and the DNAs were expressed in HEK 293 cells. For three of the 38 residues (I 328 C, N 333 C, T 336 C), currents evoked by ATP were inhibited by extracellular application of methanethiosulfonates of either charge (ethyltrimethylammonium, <b>ethylsulfonate)</b> suggesting that they lie in the outer vestibule of the pore. For two further substitutions (L 338 C, D 349 C) only the smaller ethylamine derivative inhibited the current. L 338 C was accessible to cysteine modification whether or not the channel was opened by ATP, but D 349 C was inhibited only when ATP was concurrently applied. The results indicate that part of the pore of the P 2 X receptor is formed by the second hydrophobic domain, and that L 338 and D 349 are {{on either side of the}} channel 'gate'...|$|E
40|$|Cys-scanning {{mutagenesis}} of putative transmembrane helix VIII in the lactose permease of Escherichia coli (Frillingos S. Ujwal ML, Sun J, Kaback HR, 1997, Protein Sci 6 : 431 - 437) indicates that, although helix VIII {{contains only}} one irreplaceable residue (Glu 269), one face {{is important for}} active lactose transport. In this study, the rate of inactivation of each N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) -sensitive mutant is examined in the absence or presence of beta, D-galactopyranosyl 1 -thio-beta,D-galactopyranoside (TDG). Remarkably, the analogue affords protection against inactivation with mutants Val 264 [...] >Cys, Gly 268 [...] >Cys, and Asn 272 [...] >Cys, and alkylation of these single-Cys mutants in right-side-out membrane vesicles with [14 C]NEM is attenuated by TDG. In contrast, alkylation of Thr 265 [...] >Cys, which borders the three residues that are protected by TDG, is enhanced markedly by the analogue. Furthermore, NEM-labeling {{in the presence of}} the impermeant thiol reagent methanethiosulfonate <b>ethylsulfonate</b> demonstrates that ligand enhances the accessibility of position 265 to solvent. Finally, no significant alteration in NEM reactivity is observed for mutant Gly 262 [...] >Cys, Glu 269 [...] >Cys, Ala 273 [...] >Cys, Met 276 [...] >Cys, Phe 277 [...] >Cys, or Ala 279 [...] >Cys. The findings indicate that a portion of one face of helix VIII (Val 264, Gly 268, and Asn 272), which is in close proximity to Cys 148 (helix V), interacts with substrate, whereas another position bordering these residues (Thr 265) is altered by a ligand-induced conformational change...|$|E
40|$|The TRP {{superfamily}} forms a functionally important {{class of}} cation channels {{related to the}} product of the Drosophila trp gene. TRP channels display an unusual diversity in activation mechanisms and permeation properties, but the basis of this diversity is unknown, as the structure of these channels has not been studied in detail. To obtain insight in the pore architecture of TRPV 6, a Ca(2 +) -selective member of the TRPV subfamily, we probed the dimensions of its pore and determined pore-lining segments using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. Based on the permeability of the channel to organic cations, we estimated a pore diameter of 5. 4 A. Mutating Asp(541), a residue involved in high affinity Ca(2 +) binding, altered the apparent pore diameter, indicating that this residue lines the narrowest part of the pore. Cysteines introduced in a region preceding Asp(541) displayed a cyclic pattern of reactivity to Ag(+) and cationic methylthio-sulfanate reagents, indicative of a pore helix. The anionic methanethiosulfonate <b>ethylsulfonate</b> showed only limited reactivity in this region, consistent with the presence of a cation-selective filter at the outer part of the pore helix. Based on these data and on homology with the bacterial KcsA channel, we present the first structural model of a TRP channel pore. We conclude that main structural features of the outer pore, namely a selectivity filter preceded by a pore helix, are conserved between K(+) channels and TRPV 6. However, the selectivity filter of TRPV 6 is wider than that of K(+) channels and lined by amino acid side chains rather than main chain carbonyls. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} metabolism of epoxypropane formed from propylene oxidation uses the atypical cofactor coenzyme M (CoM, 2 -mercaptoethanesulfonate) as the nucleophile for epoxide ring opening {{and as a}} carrier of intermediates that undergo dehydrogenation, reductive cleavage, and carboxylation to form acetoacetate in a three-step metabolic pathway. 2 -Ketopropyl-CoM carboxylase/oxidoreductase (2 -KPCC), the terminal enzyme of this pathway, is the only known member of the disulfide oxidoreductase family of enzymes that is a carboxylase. In the present work, the CoM analog 2 -bromoethanesulfonate (BES) is {{shown to be a}} reversible inhibitor of 2 -KPCC and hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase but not of epoxyalkane:CoM transferase. Further investigations revealed that BES is a time-dependent inactivator of dithiothreitol-reduced 2 -KPCC, where the redox active cysteines are in the free thiol forms. BES did not inactivate air-oxidized 2 -KPCC, where the redox active cysteine pair is in the disulfide form. The inactivation of 2 -KPCC exhibited saturation kinetics, and CoM slowed the rate of inactivation. Mass spectral analysis demonstrated that BES inactivation of reduced 2 -KPCC occurs with covalent modification of the interchange thiol (Cys 82) by a group with a molecular mass identical to that of <b>ethylsulfonate.</b> The flavin thiol Cys 87 was not alkylated by BES under reducing conditions, and no amino acid residues were modified by BES in the oxidized enzyme. The UV-visible spectrum of BES-modifed 2 -KPCC showed the characteristic charge transfer absorbance expected with alkylation at Cys 82. These results identify BES as a reactive CoM analog that specifically alkylates the interchange thiol that facilitates thioether bond cleavage and enolacetone formation during catalysis...|$|E
40|$|Two highly {{similar regions}} in the {{predicted}} first intracellular (ICL- 1) and third extracellular loop (ECL- 3) of the type IIa Na+/P(i) cotransporter (NaPi-IIa) have been shown previously to contain functionally important sites by applying the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM). Incubation in methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of mutants that contain novel cysteines in both loops led to full inhibition of cotransport activity. To elucidate further the role these regions play in defining the transport mechanism, a double mutant (A 203 C-S 460 C) was constructed with novel cysteines in each region. The effect of cysteine modification by different MTS reagents on two electrogenic transport modes (leak and cotransport) was investigated. MTSEA (2 -aminoethyl MTS hydrobromide) and MTSES (MTS <b>ethylsulfonate)</b> led to full inhibition of cotransport and increased the leak, whereas incubation in MTSET (2 -[trimethylammonium]ethyl MTS bromide) inhibited only cotransport. The behavior of other double mutants with a cysteine retained at one site and hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues substituted at the other site, indicated that most likely only Cys- 460 was modifiable, but the residue at Ala- 203 was critical for conferring the leak and cotransport mode behavior. Substrate interaction with the double mutant was unaffected by MTS exposure as the apparent P(i) and Na+ affinities for P(i) -induced currents and respective activation functions were unchanged after cysteine modification. This suggested that the modified site did not interfere with substrate recognition/binding, but prevents translocation of the fully loaded carrier. The time-dependency of cotransport loss and leak growth during modification of the double cysteine mutant was reciprocal, which suggested that the modified site is a kinetic codeterminant of both transport modes. The behavior {{is consistent with a}} kinetic model for NaPi-IIa that predicts mutual exclusiveness of both transport modes. Together, these findings suggest that parts of the opposing linker regions are associated with the NaPi-IIa transport pathway...|$|E
40|$|Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) {{channels}} underlie spontaneous rhythmic {{activities in}} the heart and brain. Sulfhydryl modification of ion channels is a proven approach for studying their structure-function relationships; here we {{examined the effects of}} the hydrophilic sulfhydryl-modifying agents methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium(MTSEA+). and methanethiosulfonate <b>ethylsulfonate</b> (MTSES-) on wild-type (WT) and engineered HCN 1 channels. External application of MTSEA+ to WT channels irreversibly reduced whole-cell currents (IMTSEA/IControl = 42 ± 2 %), slowed activation and deactivation kinetics (∼ 7 - and ∼ 3 -fold at - 140 and - 20 mV, respectively), and produced hyperpolarizing shifts of steady-state activation (V 1 / 2 (MTSEA) = - 125. 8 ± 9. 0 mV versus V 1 / 2 (Control) = - 76. 4 ± 1. 6 mV). Sequence inspection revealed the presence of five endogenous cysteines in the transmembrane domains of HCN 1 : three are putatively close to the extracellular milieu (Cys 303, Cys 318, and Cys 347 in the S 5, S 5 -P, and P segments, respectively), whereas the remaining two are likely to be cytoplasmic or buried. To identify the molecular constituent(s) responsible for the effects of MTSEA+, we mutated the three "external" cysteines individually to serine. C 303 S did not yield measurable currents. Whereas C 347 S channels remained sensitive to MTSEA+, C 318 S was not modified (IMTSEA/IControl = 101 ± 2 %, V 1 / 2 (MTSEA) = - 78. 4 ± 1. 1 mV, and V 1 / 2 (Control) = - 79. 8 ± 2. 3 mV). Likewise, WT (but not C 318 S) channels were sensitive to MTSES-. Despite their opposite charges, MTSES- produced changes directionally similar to those effected by MTSEA+ (IMTSES/IControl = 22 ± 1. 6 % and V 1 / 2 (MTSES) = - 145. 9 ± 4. 9 mV). We conclude that S 5 -P Cys 318 of HCN 1 is externally accessible and that the external pore vestibule and activation gating of HCN channels are allosterically coupled. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
