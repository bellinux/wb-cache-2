25|$|Long-term {{transfusion}} {{therapy to}} maintain the patient’s <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>level</b> above 9-10 g/dL (normal levels are 13.8 for males, and 12.1 for females). Patients are transfused by meeting strict criteria ensuring their safety. They must have: confirmed laboratory diagnosis of thalassemia major, and hemoglobin levels less than 7g/dL, {{to be eligible for}} the transfusion. To ensure quality blood transfusions, the packed red blood cells should be leucoreduced with a minimum of 40g of hemoglobin content. By having leucoreduced blood packets, the patient is at a lower risk to develop adverse reactions by contaminated white cells and preventing platelet alloimmunisation. Pre-storage filtration of whole blood offers high efficiency for removal and low residual of leukocytes; It is the preferred method of leucoreduction compared to pre-transfusion and bedside filtration. Patients with allergic transfusion reactions or unusual red cell antibodies must received “washed red cells” or “cryopreserved red cells.” Washed red cells have been removed of plasma proteins that would have become a target of the patient’s antibodies allowing the transfusion to be carried out safely. Cryopreserved red cells are used to maintain a supply of rare donor units for patients with unusual red cell antibodies or missing common red cell antigens. The transfusion programs available involve lifelong regular blood transfusion to main the pre-transfusion <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>level</b> above 9-10 g/gL. The monthly transfusions promote normal growth, physical activities, suppress bone marrow activity, and minimize iron accumulation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown {{benefits}} of delayed cord clamping: A meta-analysis showed that delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in full-term neonates {{for a minimum of}} 2 minutes following birth is beneficial to the newborn in giving improved hematocrit, iron status as measured by ferritin concentration and stored iron, as well as a reduction in the risk of anemia (relative risk, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40-0.70). A decrease was also found in a study from 2008. Although there is higher <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>level</b> at 2 months, this effect did not persist beyond 6 months of age. Not clamping the cord for three minutes following the birth of a baby improved outcomes at four years of age. A delay of three minutes or more in umbilical cord clamping after birth reduce the prevalence of anemia in infants.|$|E
25|$|The gradual loss {{of blood}} from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for anemia with blood tests repeated every three months in active disease and annually in quiescent disease. Adequate disease control usually improves anemia of chronic disease, but iron deficiency anemia should be treated with iron supplements. The form in which treatment is administered depends both on {{the severity of the}} anemia and on the guidelines that are followed. Some advise that parenteral iron be used first because patients respond to it more quickly, it is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and it is not associated with compliance issues. Others require oral iron to be used first, as patients eventually respond and many will tolerate the side effects. All guidelines advise that parenteral iron should be administered in cases of severe anemia (a <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>level</b> less than 100 g/L).|$|E
40|$|Normal <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> {{vary greatly}} {{according}} to genetic and acquired factors. As a consequence {{there is no}} general agreement on the definition of anemia in terms of <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels.</b> Here we compare the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> of subjects recruited from normal genetical-ly isolated Italian populations whose medical history, life style habits and results of laboratory tests are available. After the exclusion of pathological samples we analyzed the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> of 3, 849 subjects (1, 661 males and 2, 188 females) and evaluated the hemo-globin heritability. Normal subjects of different age groups from a northern Italian isolate have significantly higher <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> when compared to matched subjects of southern Italian isolates. The estimated heritability of <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> ranges from 0. 34 to 0. 42 in the different isolates.

40|$|Although {{differences}} in <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> {{between blacks and}} whites may be due in part to genetic influences, low <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> in black girls of childbearing age may nevertheless constitute a health hazard. To study this problem, <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> were examined in children of a biracial community not only before but also during and after puberty and menarche. At the same time, 24 -hour dietary recalls of a representative group of 13 -year-olds in the same population were examined with respect to the intake of iron and nutrients influencing iron absorption. In black girls, <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> dropped after menarche, accompanied by a diet marginal in iron and in iron-absorption-promoting nutrients. Questions as to <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> compatible with optimum health remain, and racial differences and genetic influences on levels should not be an excuse for failure to address this problem.

25|$|Historically, {{red blood}} cell {{transfusion}} was considered when the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>level</b> fell below 100g/L or hematocrit falls below 30%. Because each unit of blood given carries risks, a trigger level lower than that at 70 to 80g/L is now usually used {{as it has been}} shown to have better patient outcomes. The administration of a single unit of blood is the standard for hospitalized people who are not bleeding, with this treatment then followed with re-assessment and consideration of symptoms and hemoglobin concentration. Patients with poor oxygen saturation may need more blood. The advisory caution to use blood transfusion only with more severe anemia is in part due to evidence that outcomes are worsened if larger amounts are given. One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath. In cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin but are cardiovascularly stable, parenteral iron is a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety. Other blood products are given where appropriate, such as clotting deficiencies.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{pathophysiology}} of HUS {{involves the}} binding of Shiga-toxin to the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3; also called ceramide trihexoside which accumulates in Fabry disease) receptor {{on the surface}} of the glomerular endothelium. This action includes a cascade of signaling events leading to apoptosis and binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells. The Shiga-toxin-activated endothelial cells then become thrombogenic (clot-producing) by mechanism that is not fully understood, though they have been shown to induce the release of cytokines and chemokines that are implicated in platelet activation. Additionally, the binding action of Shiga-toxin inactivates a metalloproteinase called ADAMTS13, the deficiency of which causes the closely related TTP. Once ADAMTS13 is disabled, multimers of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) form and initiate platelet activation, causing microthrombus formation. The activation of platelets resulting from inhibition of ADAMTS13 is due to the hyperactivity of large multimers of uncleaved vWF. The arterioles and capillaries of the body become obstructed by the resulting complexes of activated platelets, which have adhered to the endothelium via large multimeric vWF. Through a mechanism known as microangiopathic hemolysis, the growing thrombi lodged in smaller vessels destroy red blood cells (RBCs) as they squeeze through the narrowed blood vessels, forming schistocytes, or fragments of sheared RBCs. The presence of schistocytes is a key finding that helps to diagnose HUS. Typically, this hemolysis results in a <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>level</b> of less than 80g/L.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Both low {{and high}} <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> lead to more {{physical}} diseases, and both are linked to mortality. Low hemoglobin, often classified as anemia, has also been linked to more depressive symptoms, but whether both hemoglobin extremes are associated with depressive disorder and potentially also with anxiety disorder has not been examined before. This study examines to which extent <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> are associated with depression and anxiety disorders in a large cohort. Methods: The study sample consisted of 2920 persons from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. <b>Hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> were determined after venipuncture. Depressive and anxiety disorders were determined according to a DSM-IV-based psychiatric interview. Clinical psychiatric characteristics included the severity of depression and anxiety, the duration of symptoms, the age of onset and the antidepressant use. Results: Higher <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> were found in those with current depressive and/or anxiety disorder S after sociodemographic adjustment and both higher, and lower <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>levels</b> were found in persons with higher depression and anxiety severity.
