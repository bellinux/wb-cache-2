40|$|The {{shipborne}} {{phased array}} radar {{must be able}} to compensate the ship’s motion and track the maneuvering targets automatically. In this paper, the real-time <b>beam</b> pointing <b>error</b> compensation mechanism of a planar array antenna for ship’s motion is designed to combine with the Kalman filtering. The effect of <b>beam</b> pointing <b>error</b> on the tracking performance of shipborne phased array radar is examined. A compensation mechanism, which can automatically correct the <b>beam</b> pointing <b>error</b> of the planar antenna array, is proposed for shipborne phased array radar in order to achieve the required tracking accuracy over the long dwell time. The automatic <b>beam</b> pointing <b>error</b> compensation mechanism employs the parallel fuzzy basis function network (FBFN) architecture to estimate the <b>beam</b> pointing <b>error</b> caused by roll and pitch of the ship. In the simulation, the models of roll and pitch are used to evaluate the performance of <b>beam</b> pointing <b>error</b> estimation mechanism based on the proposed parallel FBFN architecture. In addition, the effect of automatic <b>beam</b> pointing <b>error</b> compensation mechanism on the tracking performance of adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) implemented in ship borne phased array radar is also investigated.

40|$|Commissioning {{particle}} beam lines {{is usually a}} very time-consuming and labor-intensive task for accelerator physicists. To aid in commissioning, we developed a model-based expert system that identifies error-free regions, as well as localizing <b>beam</b> line <b>errors.</b> This paper will give examples {{of the use of}} our system for the SLC commissioning. Xntroduction To aid in the commissioningof the SLC beam lines, we have used a model-based trajectory simulation system, GOLD [I] (Generic Orbit and Lattice Debugger), to identify the <b>errors</b> in <b>beam</b> line elements and beam position monitors. This system wari designed to find <b>beam</b> focus <b>errors,</b> <b>beam</b> kick <b>errors</b> and <b>beam</b> launch <b>errors.</b> It is intended for finding <b>beam</b> kick <b>errors</b> and focus errors that produce large effects on the <b>beam</b> and launch <b>errors</b> that are outside of the operating range of the Feedback system to stabilize the launch condition of the beam. It is also useful for finding <b>errors</b> in the <b>beam</b> position monitors (BPM) that are large enough to confuse the SLC Automatic Beam Steering program. GOLD can be used either manually or automatically. The automatic use of GOLD is done with an expert system, ABLE [...] GOLD [Z] (FORTRAN version). The development of ABLG-GOLD was based on our experience in manual analysis of these problems, using the GOLD Method 131 to first identify the error-free regions and then to localize the <b>beam</b> line <b>errors</b> to a particular element. Numerous cases have been successfully an-alyzed using the GOLD Method to find errora in the Damping Rings [4], the LINAC and the beam transport system between the damping ring and the LINAC (RTL and LTR).

40|$|In a {{millimeter}} wave (mmWave) communication system with transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) beamforming antennas, small variation in device behavior or an environmental change can destroy beam alignment, resulting in power {{loss in the}} received signal. In this situation, the beam-tracking technique purely based on the received signal is not effective because both behavioral changes (rotation, displacement) and environmental changes (blockage) result in power loss in the received signal. In this paper, a motion sensor based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) {{as well as an}} electrical signal is used for beam tracking to identify the cause of <b>beam</b> <b>error,</b> and an efficient beam-tracking technique is proposed. The motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and geo-magnetic sensor are composed of an attitude heading reference system (AHRS) and a zero-velocity detector (ZVD). The AHRS estimates the rotation angle and the ZVD detects whether the device moves. The proposed technique tracks a beam by handling the specific situation depending on the cause of <b>beam</b> <b>error,</b> minimizing the tracking overhead. The performance of the proposed beam-tracking technique is evaluated by simulations in three typical scenarios...|$|R

40|$|When using a commonly-used quadri-wave lateral {{shearing}} interferometer wavefront sensor (QWLSI WFS) for {{beam size}} measurements {{on a high}} power CO 2 laser, artefacts have been observed in the measured irradiance distribution. The grating in the QWLSI WFS not only generates the diffracted first orders that are required for introducing the shear, but also diffracts significantly into higher orders. Consequently, in the few millimeters of free space propagation between the QWLSI WFS grating and its imaging device, the beam size may increase significantly (particularly for infrared wavelengths). This error is typically not accounted for in the subsequent processing of measurement data. To gain insight in this undesirable behavior, physical models of the QWLSI WFS using both complex wave propagation and analytic propagation of the D 4 sigma beam diameter (and its associated M 2) throughout the system have been developed. These models show excellent agreement to experimental data, and indicate that in typical situations the sensor-induced <b>beam</b> size <b>error</b> can easily be 40 % or more.

40|$|Through simulations, I have {{investigated}} the limitations imposed upon the image fidelity of interferometric observations by primary <b>beam</b> <b>errors.</b> Significant antenna surface and pointing errors lead to the greatest reduction in fidelity for most cases, but, when present, imaginary beam components dominate the degradation. <b>Beam</b> <b>errors</b> were addressed by optimizing the antenna surfaces and aligning the optics and then determining baseline based primary beams. Methods for applying these measured patterns to actual data were discussed. Pointing errors were reduced by improving the fit to the pointing model. Further reduction was achieved by integrating the use of optical pointing observations into standard radio observing. The greatest benefit was seen during daytime observations, but general reduction in pointing error was seen. The dense uv-coverage of the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) coupled with the techniques described above make it an ideal instrument for imaging extended regions with high fidelity. The NGC 7538 star-forming cloud contains dense peaks, many high-mass stars and associated accretion disks, and multiple outflows. I obtained CARMA images at the requisite fidelity, employing the above techniques. These mosaiced, spectral-line, and 3 -mm band continuum observations provide {{a clearer picture of}} the bulk morphology of the region and the fine-scale structures within it than has hitherto been possible. For {{the first time in the}} region, infall signatures were found towards two sources, allowing comparison of the infall and outflow mass and verifying that significant accretion (> 10 − 4 M ⊙ yr − 1) continues well into the stage where a massive protostar has formed.

Three outflows were found centered on sources that are separated by 10, 000 - 20, 000 AU in projection. The calculated energy injection rate provides constraints for models of outflow feedback.

Field investigations at 45 underground stone mines suggest that <b>excessive</b> <b>beam</b> sag or deflection is the principal unstable roof behavior characteristics associated with miner injuries. Laminated roof structures, common in most underground stone mines, allow the immediate roof to separate into distinct beams. The timely determination of roof beam deflection could provide stone miners with advanced knowledge of potentially hazardous roof. Existing methods to assess roof conditions consist of observational and monitoring techniques. Observational techniques include open drillholes, sounding, wedging, and borescopes. Monitoring techniques include scratch tools, extensometers, telltales, Miners Helpers, and Guardian Angels'. Miners have difficulty utilizing these techniques because roof beams are located an average of 8 m (26. 5 ft) above the miner's head in environments that are dark, dusty and noisy and these deflections are measured in millimeters of movement. To help mitigate the potential for falls of ground injuries to underground stone miners, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed the Roof Monitoring Safety System (RMSS) to aid in monitoring dangerous levels of roof beam deflection. If enough site-specific information is collected and placed on highly visible maps, individual mining operations could establish general guidelines for responding to specific roof beam deflection occurrences. This would help in implementing a pro-active, comprehensive roof control plan for reducing falls of ground injuries...|$|R

The least squares problem is described and analyzed along with the solution methods {{used to determine the}} model's parameters. Specifically studied are the rank degeneracy problems resulting from <b>beam</b> pointing <b>error</b> measurement sets that incorporate inadequate sky coverage. A least squares parameter subset selection method is described and its applicability to the systematic error modeling process is demonstrated on Voyager 2 measurement distribution...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to accurately align a laser beam through a plasma channel by minimizing the shift in laser centroid and angle at the channel outptut. If only the shift in centroid or angle is measured, then accurate alignment is provided by minimizing laser centroid motion at the channel exit as the channel properties are scanned. The improvement in alignment accuracy provided by this technique is important for minimizing electron <b>beam</b> pointing <b>errors</b> in laser plasma accelerators...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of dangerous materials entails a safety {{issue for the}} researchers. Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy offers the possibility to analyze these materials away from them using Stand-Off Set-ups. To optimize the plasma induction, the remote focalization of the laser beam is of paramount importance. A custom Fiber Bragg Grating sensor system able to correct the laser <b>beam</b> focalization <b>errors</b> is proposed and experimentally checked. The optical transducer architecture and the preliminary obtained results are reported in this paper...|$|R
