Method: This was an exploratory descriptive study, with retrospective data and quantitative approach, {{conducted in the}} ocular tissue bank from Rio Grande do Norte. The information was collected {{by means of an}} instrument containing: number of collected, transplanted, and discarded corneas; causes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>discards.</b> Results: Out of the 548 collected corneas, 78, 1 % were preserved and 21, 9 % discarded. The prevalent causes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>discards</b> were: stromal infiltrate, positive serology, and expired validity.

40|$|AbstractâIn this paper, {{we propose}} an {{energy-efficient}} error correction scheme {{to lower the}} power consumption of the ADCs in the OFDM system. The proposed opportunistic error correction scheme is based on resolution adaptive ADCs and fountain codes. The key idea {{is to reduce the}} dynamic range of <b>the</b> channel by <b>discarding</b> part of <b>the</b> channel in deep fading. Correspondingly, the power consumption in ADCs can be decreased. In our approach, each sub-carrier transports a fountain-encoded packet. The receiver only decodes fountain-encoded packets with high SNR. Others are <b>discarded.</b> To compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>discarded</b> packets, a high order modulation is used. The new error correction layer does not require perfect channel knowledge, so it can be applied in a real system.

To determine whether this practice reduced contamination rates (CR), we assessed {{the results of}} IVC-drawn blood cultures for adults. Thirty milliliters of blood was obtained aseptically. The first 10 ml, rather than being discarded, was inoculated into an aerobic culture vial. Using a second sterile syringe, 20 ml of blood was obtained and inoculated in 10 -ml aliquots to aerobic and anaerobic culture vials. Positive cultures were evaluated to assess clinical significance (true versus contaminant). Out of 653 IVC-drawn blood culture pairs, both vials were contaminated in 38 pairs (5. 8 %); only the âdiscardâ vial was contaminated in 33 (5. 1 %); and only the âstandardâ vial was contaminated in 31 (4. 7 %).

30|$|If the {{signaling}} {{structures are}} not known, windowing and filtering {{are the two}} primary designing principles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conventional OOBE suppression and ACI rejection approaches. However, when the signaling structures are known, new designs can be added into <b>the</b> conventional designs. <b>For</b> OFDM cognitive radio systems, precoding approaches can be employed to exploit the OFDM signaling structures before IFFT at the transmitter and after FFT at the receiver. In addition, a lot of non-trivial considerations need to be factored into <b>the</b> design. <b>For</b> example, <b>the</b> removal of CP at the receiver causes ACI regeneration if the truncation of interference signal due to the CP removal process is not properly taken into consideration by the adopted ACI rejection approach. On the other hand, effective OOBE is {{much larger than the}} estimated OOBE if there is a timing offset (TO) between PU and SU. Thus, among the two conventional approaches, windowing is more appropriate for ACI rejection since the windowing process is carried out on the portion that goes through the FFT and proper compensation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>discarded</b> portion has been made, and filtering is more appropriate for OOBE suppression since it is less sensitive to TO.|$|R
