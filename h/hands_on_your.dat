The resulting scar runs from the posterior axillary line (when placing your open <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> hips, the thumbs lie along the posterior axillary line.) The operation does all of the abdominal contouring of a complete abdominoplasty and allows further improvement of the flank (waist), as well as smoothing the contour of the upper lateral thigh.|$|E

2500|$|Kugel {{reported}} that modern scholars read Jacob's blessing of Judah in [...] {{to reflect a}} portrait of the Tribe of Judah's rise to power as epitomized by the career of King David, who came from the Tribe of Judah. In this reading, the words of [...] “Your <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> enemies’ neck,” laud David’s abilities as a fighter, first as the leader of a small, vicious guerrilla band, and eventually as the commander of the regular army that subdued Judah’s enemies. And the words, “Your father's sons shall bow down before you,” reflect that David caused the other tribes to submit to his authority. These scholars thus date the blessing to the time of David or Solomon.|$|E
