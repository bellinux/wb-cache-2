25|$|At {{the early}} Meiji period, such {{advertising}} was still unknown in Tokyo, and advertising was mainly done on curtains (noren), billboards (<b>kanban),</b> and flyers (hikifuda). Stalls also advertised for themselves by making noise and wearing colorful clothes, an {{at the time}} widely known example being the extremely colorful dressed pharmacist Iwashiya. During this time, newspapers and posters also started to appear in Japan and were used for advertising. The military also started to popularize western style marching bands, {{and at the same}} time public bands started to appear. In 1885 an advertising agency in Tokyo hiromeya(wide eyes) hired musicians for advertising. Hiromeya was founded by a former tozaiya from Osaka Akita Ryukichi. He soon found out that a one-person band was not as popular in Tokyo as in Osaka, and hired larger bands of more than 10 performers for advertising purposes, following the popularity of military and public bands. His band also provided entertainment at festivals and parties, and also created background music for silent films. He was also hired by the Kirin beer company, whose advertising campaign spread out to Osaka. In Osaka, this form of group bands was yet unknown, as only individual performers were hired for advertising. The police also had to stop some of the larger performances in Osaka, as they hindered traffic, partially also caused by the 2 meter tall beer bottle the group was equipped with. The Hiromeya business grew, and they were even asked to perform at the burial of Emperor Meiji in 1912. The business still exists nowadays, although they now do mainly decorations.|$|E

A multi-product, multi-stage manufacturing system was built and simulation was used to analyse the system behaviour.

INTRODUCTION The Just in Time (JIT) production philosophy is characterised by the attainment of the minimum levels of inventory required producing what is needed at just the right time. Typically achieved by a pull type approach to the flow of material through sequential production operations it uses circulating cards (<b>Kanbans)</b> to control the movement of work in progress between the different links of the internal process.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} effect of proposed management policies and related structures on the dynamics of value streams, particularly under demand instability. It relies on methods from the systems thinking and modeling literature and was designed to fulfill three main objectives.

Objective 3 : Propose and test alternative value stream management policies and structures. The achievement of objectives 1 and 3 required the fulfillment of both a hypothetical and a real case. The hypothetical case was designed to describe the problem and improvement alternatives in generic terms, whereas the real case served to contextualize the main generic modeling elements in a real world situation, thus serving as an illustrative example.
