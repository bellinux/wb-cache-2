25|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was designed}} and manufactured by Hughes on the HS-376 satellite bus. This spin-stabilized platform had two main sections. One, the spinning section, was kept rotating at 50 rpm to maintain attitude, and a <b>despun</b> section that {{was used by the}} payload to maintain radio coverage. The spinning section included the Star-30BP Apogee kick motor, most of the attitude control, the power subsystem and the command and telemetry subsystems. The <b>despun</b> section contained the communications payload, including the antennas and transponders.|$|E
25|$|Thus, total memory {{capacity}} {{available to the}} CDH subsystem was 176K of RAM: 144K allocated to the spun side and 32K to the <b>despun</b> side.|$|E
25|$|Every HLM and LLM {{was built}} up around a single 1802 {{microprocessor}} and 32K of RAM (for HLMs) or 16K of RAM (for LLMs). Two HLMs and two LLMs resided on the spun side while two LLMs {{were on the}} <b>despun</b> side.|$|E
25|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was controlled}} by six RCA 1802 COSMAC microprocessor CPUs: four on the spun side and two on the <b>despun</b> side. Each CPU was clocked at about 1.6MHz, and fabricated on sapphire (silicon on sapphire), which is a radiation-and static-hardened material ideal for spacecraft operation. This microprocessor was the first low-power CMOS processor chip, quite {{on a par with}} the 8-bit 6502 that was being built into the Apple II desktop computer at that time.|$|E
25|$|The <b>despun</b> section's {{instruments}} {{included the}} camera system; the near infrared mapping spectrometer to make multi-spectral images for atmospheric and moon surface chemical analysis; the ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases; and the photopolarimeter-radiometer to measure radiant and reflected energy. The camera system {{was designed to}} obtain images of Jupiter's satellites at resolutions 20 to 1,000 times better than Voyager best, because Galileo flew closer to the planet and its inner moons, and because the more modern CCD sensor in Galileo camera was more sensitive and had a broader color detection band than the vidicons of Voyager.|$|E

50|$|ATS-3 {{experiments}} included VHF and C-band communications, a color spin-scan camera (principally {{developed by}} Verner E. Suomi), an image dissector camera, a mechanically <b>despun</b> antenna, resistojet thrusters, hydrazine propulsion, optical surface experiments, and {{the measurement of}} the electron content of the ionosphere and magnetosphere.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stricken}} F4 did {{not remain}} a complete failure. Data from F4's failure permitted the saving of F1 from a premature failure. Since {{all of the}} Leasats are spin-stabilized, they have a bearing point that connects the non-rotating and rotating parts of the spacecraft. After F4's communication failure, it suffered a spin lock while attempting to jostle the communications payload: the spun and <b>despun</b> sections locked together. Remembering this second failure of F4, and with F1 beginning to wear out at the spin bearing, {{it was decided to}} [...] "flip" [...] F1 every six months to keep the payload in the sun. Thus F1 went on to operate smoothly for its remaining life and never encountered a locked <b>despun</b> section.|$|E
50|$|A half {{second after}} spin-up, the vehicle's Star 48B solid-fuel motor ignited, {{powering}} {{the vehicle to}} Mach 4 and an altitude of approximately 180000 ft. Immediately after rocket burn-out, four more rocket motors <b>despun</b> the vehicle. Upon slowing to Mach 3.8, the 20 ft tube-shaped Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD-R configuration) deployed. SIAD is intended to increase atmospheric drag on the vehicle by increasing the surface area of its leading side, thus increasing the rate of deceleration.|$|E

50|$|The main {{objective}} of the mission was to take UV images of the hydrogen corona for about 30 days before and after Comet Halley's descending crossing of the ecliptic plane. Solar wind parameters were measured for a much longer time period. The spacecraft is spin-stabilized at two different rates (5 and 0.2 rpm). Hydrazine thrusters are used for attitude and velocity control; star and sun sensors are for attitude control; and a mechanically <b>despun</b> off-set parabolic dish is used for long range communication.|$|E
50|$|Manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Company, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter {{was based}} on the HS-507 bus. The {{spacecraft}} was a flat cylinder, 2.5 m in diameter and 1.2 m long. All instruments and spacecraft subsystems were mounted on the forward end of the cylinder, except the magnetometer, which {{was at the end of}} a 4.7 m boom. A solar array extended around the circumference of the cylinder. A 1.09 m <b>despun</b> dish antenna provided S and X band communication with Earth. A Star-24 solid rocket motor was integrated into the spacecraft to provide the thrust to enter orbit around Venus.|$|E

5000|$|The five {{satellites}} of the 1980s Leasat (Leased Satellite) program (Leasat F1 through Leasat F5) were alternatively named Syncom IV-1 to Syncom IV-5 {{and called}} HS 381 by the manufacturer. These satellites were considerably larger than Syncoms 1 to 3, weighing 1.3 tonnes each (over 7 tonnes with launch fuel). At 4.26 m, the satellites {{were the first}} to be designed for launch from the Space Shuttle payload bay, and were deployed like a Frisbee. The satellites are 30 rpm spin-stabilized with a <b>despun</b> communications and antenna section. They were made with a solid rocket motor for initial perigee burn and hydrazine propellant for station keeping and spin stabilization. The communications systems offers a wideband UHF channel (500 kHz bandwidth), six relay 25 kHz channels, and five narrowband 5 kHz channels. This is in addition to the fleet broadcast frequency, which is in the military's X-band. The system was used by military customers in the US and later in Australia. Most of the satellites were retired in the 1990s, but one would remain operational until 2015. During the First Gulf War, Leasat would be used for personal communications between Secretary of State James Baker and President George H. W. Bush, but was more typically used by [...] "mobile air, surface, subsurface, and fixed earth stations of the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Army." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{delay in}} the {{launching}} of the Galileo spacecraft, {{which was to be}} launched aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis, caused by the Challenger accident resulted in a decrease in the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) power. A change to the Inertial Upper Stage from the more powerful Centaur G-Prime resulted in a trajectory that requires gravity assists, once by Venus and twice by earth. The resulting peak solar intensity of this roundabout trajectory is more than twice the previous design value for the direct trajectory. The resulting changes in solar intensity range and the RTG power output were substantial and forced major thermal design changes. This paper discusses the thermal design and redesign of the Galileo Spun and <b>Despun</b> sciences. Data are presented on the allowable temperatures for the Spun and <b>Despun</b> sciences, the energy balance calculated for the <b>Despun</b> science, and the <b>Despun</b> science test results...|$|E

40|$|Galileo is a dual-spin {{spacecraft}} {{designed to}} deliver a probe to Jupiter and then orbit the planet. The stator, or <b>despun</b> section, contains four flexible modes below 10 Hz and the <b>despun</b> actuator is separated from the inertial sensors by this flexibility. Control loop separation by bandwidth proved unacceptable due to performance requirements. To obtain the desired performance, a control scheme was devised which consists of three parts. First, flexibility damping and control notch filtering are accomplished by phase locked loop techniques. Second, slewing maneuvers are produced by torque profiles which are nonexcitatory to the structure. Finally, a low bandwidth perturbation controller is supplied to remove spacecraft disturbances...|$|E

40|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} design uses a dual-spin general configuration with spun and <b>despun</b> sections; {{the mechanical}} {{connection between the}} two sections is accomplished by means of a spin bearing assembly (SBA) whose electrical interfacing uses both slip rings/brushes and rotary transformers that are located within the SBA. Attention is presently given to the design features of the SBA, the electrical interface flight anomaly and investigation experience with Galileo to date, and the responses of the Galileo Flight Team to those anomalies...|$|E
40|$|The {{shape and}} spin of Neptune's {{outermost}} satellite Nereid are still unknown. Ground-based photometry indicates large brightness variations, but different observers report very different lightcurve amplitudes and periods. On the contrary, Voyager 2 images spanning 12 days show {{no evidence of}} variations greater than 0. 1 mag. The latter suggest either that Nereid is nearly spherical, or that it is rotating slowly. We propose that tides have already <b>despun</b> Nereid's rotation to {{a period of a}} few weeks, during the time before the capture of Triton when Nereid was closer to Neptune. Since Nereid reached its present orbit, tides have further <b>despun</b> Nereid to a period on the order of a month. For Nereid's orbital eccentricity of 0. 75, tidal evolution ceases when the spin period is still approximately 1 / 8 of the orbital period. Furthermore, the synchronous resonance becomes quite weak for such high eccentricities, along with other low-order spin orbit commensurabilities. In contrast, high-order resonances become very strong particularly the 6 : 1, 6. 5 : 1, 7 : 1, 7. 5 : 1, and 8 : 1 spin states. If Nereid departs by more than approximately 1 % from a sphere, however, these resonances overlap, generating chaos. Our simulations show that Nereid is likely to be in chaotic rotation for any spin period longer than about 2 weeks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{treats the}} {{dynamical}} {{evolution of a}} satellite orbiting a primary that is being <b>despun</b> by solar tidal friction. The results are then applied to Mercury and Venus. It is concluded that {{a wide variety of}} satellites would not have survived the solar tidal braking of these planets. Hence, the absence of satellites around Mercury and Venus is not a compelling reason for thinking that this has always been the situation. Satellites are lost by orbital decay and impact with the primary. It is likely that Mercury would retain a record of such an event on its surface...|$|E
40|$|The orbit {{profile for}} the Atmosphere Explorer {{requires}} a velocity adjust capability of 2000 ft/sec/sec and individual maneuvers {{of up to}} 24 ft/sec in magnitude. This requirement is met by a monopropellant hydrazine propulsion subsystem which also provides, {{by virtue of the}} tank arrangement, a means of adjusting the spacecraft center of mass in orbit, thereby minimizing external disturbance torques. The attitude control subsystem is of the momentum bias type. A large internal flywheel furnishes gyroscopic stiffness and permits rapid changes in operating mode (<b>despun</b> to spinning mode) by controlled interchange of momentum between the flywheel and the spacecraft main body...|$|E
