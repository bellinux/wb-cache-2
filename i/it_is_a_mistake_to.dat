5|$|Under the Kingdom, Sicily's {{products}} went to {{many different}} lands. Among these were Genoa, Pisa, the Byzantine Empire, and Egypt. Over {{the course of}} the 12th century, Sicily became an important source of raw materials for north Italian cities such as Genoa. As the centuries went on, however, this economic relationship became less advantageous to Sicily, and some modern scholars see the relationship as frankly exploitative. Furthermore, many scholars believe that Sicily went into decline in the late Middle Ages, though they are not agreed on when this decline occurred. Clifford Backman argues that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> see the economic history of Sicily in terms of victimization, and contends that the decline really began {{in the second part of}} the reign of Frederick III, in contrast to earlier scholars who believed that Sicilian decline had set in earlier. Where earlier scholars saw late medieval Sicily in continuous decline, Stephen Epstein argued that Sicilian society experienced something of a revival in the 15th century.|$|E

25|$|From a {{biological}} point of view, human behaviors are {{essentially the same}} during crises accompanied by stock market crashes and during bubble growth when share prices exceed historic highs. During those periods, most market participants see something new for themselves, and this inevitably induces a stress response in them with accompanying changes in their endocrine profiles and motivations. The result is quantitative and qualitative changes in behavior. However, this is only one example of where behavior affecting economics and finance can be observed and variably-contrasted using behavioral economics, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> think of its usefulness as only applying within such environments tested-in or -of conditions similar to stock exchanges specifically. Also, often selfish-reasoning, 'adult behaviors', and similar, can be identified within criminal-concealment(s), and legal-deficiencies and neglect of different types can be observed and discovered. Awareness of indirect consequence (or lack of), at least in potential with different experimental models and methods, {{can be used as}} well—behavioral economics' potential uses are broad, but its reliability need scrutiny. An underestimation of the role of novelty as a stressor is the primary shortcoming of current approaches for market research. So, it is necessary to account for the biologically determined diphasisms of human behavior in everyday low-stress conditions and in response to stressors.|$|E
500|$|The many {{unauthorised}} American {{productions of}} 1878–79 were of widely varying quality, {{and many of}} them were adaptations of the opera. One of the more [...] "authentic" [...] ones was the production by the Boston Ideal Opera Company, which was first formed to produce Pinafore. It engaged well-regarded concert singers and opened on 14 April 1879 at the 3,000-seat Boston Theatre. The critics agreed that the company fulfilled its goals of presenting an [...] "ideal" [...] production. The Boston Journal reported that the audience was [...] "wrought up by the entertainment to a point of absolute approval". The paper observed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> consider Pinafore a burlesque, [...] "for while irresistibly comical it is not bouffe and requires to be handled with great care lest its delicate proportions be marred and its subtle quality of humor be lost". The Journal described the opera as [...] "classical" [...] in method and wrote that its [...] "most exquisite satire" [...] lay in its [...] "imitation of the absurdities" [...] of grand opera. The company went on {{to become one of the}} most successful touring companies in America. The first children's version in Boston became a sensation with both children and adult audiences, extending its run through the summer of 1879. The Boston Herald wrote that [...] "the large audience of children and their elders went fairly wild with delight... shrieks of laughter were repeatedly heard".|$|E

2500|$|However, this {{interpretation}} {{of sexual misconduct}} {{is only applicable to}} lay Buddhists or Japanese Buddhism's secular married priests.

2500|$|In {{his book}} River out of Eden, Dawkins coins the phrase God's utility {{function}} {{to explain his}} view on genes as units of selection. He uses this phrase as a synonym of the [...] "meaning of life" [...] or the [...] "purpose of life". By rephrasing the word purpose {{in terms of what}} economists call a utility function, meaning [...] "that which is maximized", Dawkins attempts to reverse-engineer the purpose {{in the mind of the}} Divine Engineer of Nature, or the utility function of god. Finally, Dawkins argues that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> assume that an ecosystem or a species as a whole exists for a purpose. He writes that it is incorrect to suppose that individual organisms lead a meaningful life either; in nature, only genes have a utility function – to perpetuate their own existence with indifference to great sufferings inflicted upon the organisms they build, exploit and discard.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{influence}} of Dilthey, Hans-Georg Gadamer writes the following: [...] "As far as Dilthey is concerned, we all know today what I have {{known for a long}} time: namely that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> conclude {{on the basis of the}} citation in Being and Time that Dilthey was especially influential in the development of Heidegger's thinking in the mid-1920s. This dating of {{the influence}} is much too late." [...] He adds that by the fall of 1923 it was plain that Heidegger felt [...] "the clear superiority of Count Yorck over the famous scholar, Dilthey." [...] Gadamer nevertheless makes clear that Dilthey's influence was important in helping the youthful Heidegger [...] "in distancing himself from the systematic ideal of Neo-Kantianism, as Heidegger acknowledges in Being and Time." [...] Based on Heidegger's earliest lecture courses, in which Heidegger already engages Dilthey's thought prior to the period Gadamer mentions as [...] "too late", scholars as diverse as Theodore Kisiel and David Farrell Krell have argued for the importance of Diltheyan concepts and strategies in the formation of Heidegger's thought.|$|E
2500|$|By {{contrast}} Schami has {{a generally}} positive view of Germany. [...] In interviews and speeches he warns against undercurrents of intolerance but speaks optimistically of the Germans {{as a people}} well-placed precisely because of their history to embrace foreign elements. [...] Some stories dealing generally with intolerance and injustice could certainly be read {{in the context of}} migrant workers in Germany. [...] One commentator interprets the title story of Das Letzte Wort der Wanderratte (1984; The Itinerant Rat's Last Word) in this way: rats = guest-workers, humans = Germans, massacre of Hamelin rats = Holocaust; the interpretation is possible but not necessary. [...] Similarly the title story of Das Schaf im Wolfpelz (1982; Sheep in Wolf's Clothing) and many others which very obviously contain a social moral could certainly be taken to address the situation in Germany but could be equally applicable in Syria or elsewhere. [...] The story [...] "Vampire lieben Knoblauch" [...] ("Vampires Love Garlic") in Das Letzte Wort der Wanderratte tells how Günter with his crucifix and Ali with his crescent are equally helpless victims of the predator, Dracula; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> seek anti-German polemic in Schami's writing.|$|E
