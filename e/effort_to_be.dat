5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads {{from side to side}} as if in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
5|$|In France, the {{unilateral}} British {{decision to}} evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, {{and the perceived}} preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces {{at the expense of}} the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral François Darlan originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard. In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of 2nd Light Mechanized Division and the 68th Infantry Division. Their resistance allowed the evacuation <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.|$|E

5|$|The Leges Henrici Primi or Laws of Henry I is {{not merely}} a {{compilation}} of laws but an integrated legal treatise, the first such in the history of England, written in the Latin language about 1115. It records the legal customs of medieval England. It was part {{of a small group of}} similar writings devoted to legal procedures that were written for royal administrators. Besides the Leges, other works of this type produced at this time were the Quadripartitus, parts of the Leges Edwardi Regis, the Instituta Cnuti, and the Consiliatio Cnuti. It is possible the Leges Willhelmi was also written during this time period. It is the longest of the legal tracts from its time, and made some <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> comprehensive.|$|E
5|$|The way Caracalla {{wanted to}} be portrayed to his people can be seen through the many {{surviving}} busts and coins. Images of the young Caracalla cannot be clearly distinguished from his younger brother Geta. On the coins, Caracalla was shown with laureate after becoming Augustus in 197 while Geta is bareheaded until he himself became Augustus in 209. Between 209 and their father's death in February211, both brothers are shown as mature young men who were ready {{to take over the}} empire. Between the death of the father and the assassination of Geta towards the end of 211, Caracalla's portrait remains static with a short full beard while Geta develops a long beard with hair strains like his father. The latter was a strong indicator of Geta's <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen as the true successor to their father, an effort that came to naught when he was murdered. Caracalla's presentation on coins during the period of his co-reign with his father, from 198 to 210, are in broad terms in line with the third-century imperial representation; most coin types communicate military and religious messages, with other coins giving messages of saeculum aureum and virtues. During Caracalla's sole reign, from 212 to 217, a significant shift in representation took place. The majority of coins produced during this period made associations with divinity or had religious messages; others had non-specific and unique messages that were only circulated during Caracalla's sole rule.|$|E

In Stephen Booth's thorough criticism of Sonnet 60, he remarks {{that of the}} battle that the speaker attempts to wage against time in his <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> together with the youth. The words chosen by Shakespeare such as toil, transfix, fight, contend, glory, confound, and scythe all hint at a violent conflict to which the speaker finds himself irreversibly attached. The conflict of the speaker relates to how best {{to solve the problem}} of time, yet he initially sees no counter to time's devastating attacks.|$|E
25|$|Ball rarely, if ever, took {{a public}} role in politics.

Ball {{did not need to}} get his hands dirty or risk personal resources. Ball was a main (but not the only) financer of the defeat of Claude Pepper's <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reelected to the United States Senate in 1950. Pepper's liberalism and Ball's conservatism feuded through much of the 1940s and 1950s, prompting a book to be written in 2000: Claude Pepper and Ed Ball: Politics, Purpose, and Power.|$|E

General Henry Rawlinson was also ordered to plan an {{attack from the}} Ypres Salient on 4 February; {{planning}} continued but the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme took {{up the rest of}} the year. In November 1916, Haig, the French commander-in-chief Joseph Joffre and the other Allies met at Chantilly. The commanders agreed on a strategy of simultaneous attacks, to overwhelm the Central Powers on the Western, Eastern and Italian fronts, by the first fortnight of February 1917. A meeting in London of the Admiralty and the General Staff urged that the Flanders operation be undertaken in 1917 and Joffre replied on 8 December, agreeing to a Flanders campaign after the spring offensive. The plan for a year of attrition offensives on the Western Front, with the main <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made in the summer by the BEF, was scrapped by the new French Commander-in-Chief Robert Nivelle in favour of a return to a strategy of decisive battle.|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what is actually going on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> full-time parents. The episode also advocates against censorship and addresses the morality and ethics of euthanasia.|$|E

The incentive package was approved in the 1986 legislative session. State Attorney General David L.
