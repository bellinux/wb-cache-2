40|$|AbstractDespite {{intensive}} {{research has}} been carried out to understand the fatigue behaviour of steel notched geometries, under variable amplitude loading, no definite and general robust models have been derived so far. Therefore, any effort to increment the knowledge in the topic is welcome. Within this premise, it is proposed an assessment of existing variable amplitude data (spectrum block loading), which has been derived by authors for a notched geometry, made from a low carbon pressure vessel steel (P 355 NL 1), within the local approaches and linear damage summation framework, and supported by <b>elastoplastic</b> finite element analyses. Several blocks are analyzed using <b>elastoplastic</b> finite element analysis with Mises plasticity theory and Chaboche's nonlinear kinematic hardening. The predictions are assessed using available experimental fatigue data as well as with predictions made with simplified <b>elastoplastic</b> analyses. This paper highlights the difficulties on performing the <b>elastoplastic</b> analysis and compares the obtained results with those obtained using simplified classical tools for <b>elastoplastic</b> analysis. Fatigue predictions based on <b>elastoplastic</b> analysis made using the Chaboche's model with four parameters were more accurate than predictions based on simplified <b>elastoplastic</b> analysis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA micromechanical <b>elastoplastic</b> damage model {{considering}} a finite RVE is proposed {{to predict the}} overall <b>elastoplastic</b> damage behavior of circular fiber-reinforced ductile (matrix) composites. The constitutive damage model proposed in our preceding work (Kim and Lee, 2009) {{considering a}} finite Eshelby’s tensor (Li et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005) is extended to accommodate the <b>elastoplastic</b> behavior of the composites. On {{the basis of the}} exterior-point Eshelby’s tensor for circular inclusions and the ensemble-averaged effective yield criterion, a micromechanical framework for predicting the effective <b>elastoplastic</b> damage behavior of ductile composites is derived. A series of numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate stress–strain response of the proposed micromechanical framework and to examine the influence of a Weibull parameter on the <b>elastoplastic</b> behavior of the composites.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple method for symmetrising the asymmetric <b>elastoplastic</b> matrix arising from non-associated flow rules. The symmetrisation {{is based on}} mathematical transformation and does not alter the incremental stress–strain relationship. The resulting stress increment is identical to that obtained using the original asymmetrized <b>elastoplastic</b> matrix. The symmetrisation method is applied to integrate the Unified Hardening (UH) model where the <b>elastoplastic</b> matrix is asymmetric due to stress transformation. The performance of the method is verified through finite element analysis (FEA) of boundary value problems such as triaxial extension tests and bearing capacity of foundations. It is found that the symmetrisation method can improve the convergence of the FEA and reduce computational time significantly for non-associated <b>elastoplastic</b> models...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{robustness}} evaluation is proposed for an <b>elastoplastic</b> base-isolated high-rise building considering simultaneous uncertainties of structural parameters. Since {{it is difficult}} to evaluate the robustness of <b>elastoplastic</b> structures due to heavy computational load on the time-history response analysis including <b>elastoplastic</b> response, a double impulse input is used to provide a closed-form solution of the critical response of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) elastic–perfectly plastic structure under a near-field ground motion. Introducing an equivalent <b>elastoplastic</b> SDOF model of a base-isolated high-rise building, the worst combination of uncertain structural parameters, i. e., the stiffness and yield deformation at the base-isolation story and the stiffness of the superstructure, can be derived which leads to the upper bound of the critical <b>elastoplastic</b> response. It is shown that, by using the derived upper bound of the critical response, the robustness function, a measure of the robustness, of <b>elastoplastic</b> structures can be evaluated efficiently. In numerical examples, the robustness of a 30 -story base-isolated high-rise building is compared with those of other models with different yield deformations at the base-isolation story to find a preferable design with larger robustness...|$|E

40|$|A micromechanical damage {{constitutive}} model {{is presented to}} predict the overall <b>elastoplastic</b> behavior and damage evolution in aligned discontinuous fiber polymer composites (AFPCs). In an attempt to estimate the overall <b>elastoplastic</b> damage responses, an effective yield criterion is micromechanically derived based on the ensemble-volume averaging process and first-order (noninteracting) effects of eigenstrains stemming from the existence of (prolate) spheroidal fibers.

40|$|We {{study the}} lateral {{deformations}} of randomly folded <b>elastoplastic</b> and predominantly plastic thin sheets under the uniaxial and radial compressions.

In contrast to this, the lateral deformations of randomly folded predominantly plastic aluminum foils display the linear dependence on the axial compression with the universal Poissons ratio nu_e = 0. 33 pm 0. 01. This difference {{is consistent with the}} difference in fractal topology of randomly folded <b>elastoplastic</b> and predominantly plastic sheets, which is found to belong to different universality classes.

40|$|An {{earthquake}} resistant structure {{will suffer}} large plastic deformations under strong ground motions. This paper presents a practical method {{to evaluate the}} maximum plastic displacement of a structure, when the latter is modelled as an <b>elastoplastic</b> oscillator. The method exploits the results from a rigid-plastic model possessing the same ratio between yield strength and mass as the actual <b>elastoplastic</b> oscillator. The rigid-plastic model is shown to give a good estimate of the maximum plastic displacement of an <b>elastoplastic</b> oscillator when the natural period of the actual <b>elastoplastic</b> oscillator is comparatively short or comparatively high. For medium-period oscillators, however, the rigid-plastic approximation needs to be corrected. The present paper provides an empirical formula to calculate the required corrections, whatever the oscillator and the earthquake. This formula leads to a good –and almost always conservative– estimate of the seismic ductility demand and makes the rigid-plastic approach readily applicable to seismic design...|$|E

The performance of the new algorithm is tested by a deep drawing simulation of a rectangular product.

40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the geometrical similarity of heat conduction-elastioplastic structural problems. When the dimensions of a structure are geometrically scaled down/up, the similarity relations for both isolated heat conduction and <b>elastoplastic</b> structural problems are derived. For cases of thermo-structural coupled, it is concluded that heat conduction-static <b>elastoplastic</b> problems can be geometrically similarly scaled down/up and a set of similarity relations are drawn accordingly. As examples, a full-, half- and quarter-scale unilaterally-tensioned plate and internally-pressured cylindrical shell irradiated by a laser pulse are numerically analysed and the numerical results have confirmed this conclusion. However, heat conduction-dynamic <b>elastoplastic</b> problems are found not to comply compatibly with the geometrically similar scaling...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{nature of}} {{elastomeric}} material demands {{the consideration of}} finite deformations, nonlinear elasticity including damage as well as rate-dependent and rate-independent dissipative properties. While many models accounting for these effects have been refined over time to do better justice to the real behavior of rubber-like materials, the realistic simulation of the <b>elastoplastic</b> characteristics for filled rubber remains challenging. The classical elastic-ideal-plastic formulation exhibits a distinct yield-surface, whereas the <b>elastoplastic</b> material behavior of filled rubber components shows a yield-surface free plasticity. In order to describe this <b>elastoplastic</b> deformation of a material point adequately, a physically based endochronic plasticity model was developed and implemented into a Finite Element code. The formulation of the ground state elastic characteristics is based on Arruda and Boyce (1993) eight-chain model. The evolution of the constitutive equations for the nonlinear endochronic <b>elastoplastic</b> response are derived in analogy to the Bergström–Boyce finite viscoelasticity model discussed by Dal and Kaliske (2009) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} {{moment of}} inertia is developed for a rectangular, prismatic <b>elastoplastic</b> beam with elastic, linear-hardening material behavior. The particular solution for a beam with elastic, perfectly plastic material behavior is also presented in closed-form with applications for beam bending subjected to monotonic loading. Equations are presented for the direct application of the virtual work method for <b>elastoplastic</b> beams with concentrated and distributed loads. Comparisons are made between the virtual work method deflections and the deflections obtained by using the direct integration method and the approximate direct stiffness method using an average effective {{moment of inertia}} in the <b>elastoplastic</b> region. ^ <b>Elastoplastic</b> moment-curvature expressions are also developed for reducing rigidity of a rectangular beam with elastic, perfectly plastic material behavior and for use in determining <b>elastoplastic</b> deflections of beams subjected to cyclic loading. These new moment-curvature expressions are developed using updated stress states after each cycle where unloading and reloading occurs with alternating yield. Yield envelopes are used to delineate the type and extent of the stress states from the various bending moment histories at a cross-section. Both linear and quadratic approximation methods are used for determining the areas and centroids of the curvature diagram when with the virtual work method is used to obtain the loaded and unloaded deflections of a determinate beam. ...|$|E
40|$|Rigid-plastic models {{may well}} {{approximate}} the peak plastic response of igid enough <b>elastoplastic</b> oscillators. The more flexible the oscillator, however, the less reLiable the approximation {{is expected to}} be. Contrary to this expectation, the present paper shows thctt, under seismic conditions, a rigidplastic model may also give a good estimate of the peak plastic response of quite Jlexible <b>elastoplastic</b> oscillcttors. In particular, it is shown that the rigid-plastic approximation is even conservative when the natural period T of the <b>elastoplastic</b> oscillator falls within a particular range, the ends of which are marked by two characteristic values. A simple graphical procedure is pntvided to obtain these characteistic periods directly from the elastic respotlse spectrum of the earthquake, for a given value of the oscillator yield acceleration. It spots the range in which the simpler rigid-plastic model can be adopted to bound the plastic response of <b>elastopLastic</b> oscillators and the range where, on the contrary, such a model underestimates the same response. The procedure also gives {{the value of the}} peiod above which the earthquake is no longer able to produce plastic yielding in <b>elastoplastic</b> oscillators of a given yield accelerotion. These results can be useful to estimate the earthquake inelastic demand in a simple way...|$|E
