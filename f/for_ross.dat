5|$|As season one concludes, Rachel finally confesses {{her love}} <b>for</b> <b>Ross,</b> having learned of his {{feelings}} for her from Chandler, {{only to find}} that he has already begun dating another woman, whom she resents. However, Ross eventually chooses Rachel over his girlfriend Julie (Lauren Tom), and the couple dates {{for the remainder of the}} second season. However, their relationship rapidly begins to deteriorate towards the end of the third season after Rachel quits her job at the coffeehouse in favor of working in fashion. While Rachel becomes increasingly preoccupied with her new job, Ross grows jealous of her companionship with her coworker Mark (Steven Eckholdt), ultimately culminating in their break up on their one-year anniversary following a series of heated arguments and disagreements.|$|E

5|$|The Supremes' {{name change}} fueled already present {{rumors of a}} solo career <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> {{and contributed to the}} {{professional}} and personal dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross with Barbara Randolph as early as the fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in the group for several more years. Gordy's caution may have been sparked by an incident in early 1966 as the group prepared to make their second appearance at the Copacabana. Angered by erratic behavior from Florence Ballard, Gordy intended to replace her with Marlene Barrow, a member of the Motown in-house singing group the Andantes. However, when club management heard of this change, they threatened to cancel the group's appearance if Ballard was replaced, as they saw Ballard's banter with her group mates as a major part of their act's success.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} begins with Rachel {{waiting at the}} gate <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> to declare her love for him. However, she discovers that he is dating Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from {{graduate}} school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross she likes him mirror his failed attempts in the first season, although the characters eventually begin a relationship. Joey gets cast in a part in a fictional version of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, but his character is killed off after conflicts with the show's writers, claiming that he writes many of his own lines. Chandler gets back with Janice, his ex-girlfriend from season one. Monica begins dating Richard (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend and 21 years her senior. In the season finale, they end their relationship when they realize that unlike Monica, Richard does not want children.|$|E
25|$|John Ross was {{introduced}} to the Stapler family of Brandywine Springs, Delaware by Thomas McKenney in 1841. Ross had many common interests with John Stapler, a merchant and widower. His eldest daughter, Sarah, cared for her younger siblings and befriended Ross. However, her younger sister, Mary Brian Stapler, developed a real love <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> and initiated a romantic attachment in May 1844. As the time came <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> to return to the Indian Territory, their mutual love ripened. They married in Philadelphia on September 2, 1844.|$|E

25|$|A hat-trick {{occurs in}} {{association}} football when a player scores three goals (not necessarily consecutive) {{in a single}} game, whereas scoring two goals constitutes a brace. In common with other official record-keeping rules, goals in a penalty shootout are excluded from the tally. The extra time in a knockout cup match may also be calculated towards a player's potential hat-trick. The fastest recorded time to score a hat-trick is 70 seconds, a record set by Alex Torr in a Sunday league game in 2013. The previous record of 90 seconds was held by Tommy Ross playing <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> County against Nairn County on 28 November 1964.|$|E
25|$|Mark Webber was {{the early}} pace setter in this 15 minute knock-out, but an amazing lap by Nico Rosberg easily secured his place into Q3.

And with Barrichello having to drop 5 places down the grid after changing his gearbox before qualifying it wasn't looking to good <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> Brawn's team. Barrichello left it late and jumped from eleventh to sixth to book {{his place in the}} top 10 shootout.

Jayawardene entered a {{pressure}} situation, with Sri Lanka struggling at 134/4 in the run chase, but made an innings of 120 runs to win the match. The match is notable <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> Emerson's no-balling of Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing, which led the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga to lead his team {{to the edge of}} the field and consider walking out of the match, as well as physical shoulder-barging by some players.|$|E

Kemp and his crew spent 3 weeks with 5 SCOTS, arriving in Musa Qala on Sunday 17 August 2008, having recently finished filming in Belize <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> Kemp on Gangs. Despite being a Scottish Regiment, 5 SCOTS are based in Canterbury in the county of Kent, in the south east of England, and in a similar vein to the background of series 1 where Kemp had personal roots in East Anglia, Kemp had also previously lived in Maidstone, Kent, for five years from 1989.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 2011, {{while still}} {{shooting}} the film, Lionsgate {{announced that a}} film adaptation of the second novel in The Hunger Games trilogy, , {{was scheduled to be}} released on November 22, 2013. In November 2011, Lionsgate entered negotiations with screenwriter Simon Beaufoy to adapt the novel for screen, since the post-production schedule for The Hunger Games was too crowded <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> and Collins to adapt the next film as originally planned. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire began production in the summer of 2012. Gary Ross did not return for Catching Fire, and instead Francis Lawrence directed the film. On May 6, 2012, it was reported that Michael Arndt was in talks to re-write the script for Catching Fire. Arndt officially signed on as the new script writer on May 24, 2012. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire began filming September 10, 2012, and concluded December 21, 2012; it premiered in London on November 11, 2013, before premiering on November 22, 2013 in the US as was originally scheduled.|$|E
25|$|From the Cape {{they entered}} the {{southern}} ocean. Their first stop was the Crozet Islands where they set down on Possession Island to deliver coffee to sealers. They departed for the Kerguelen Islands where they would spend several days. Hooker identified 18 flowering plants, 35 mosses and liverworts, 25 lichens and 51 algae, including some that were not described by surgeon William Anderson when James Cook had visited the islands in 1772. The expedition {{spent some time in}} Hobart, Van Diemen's Land, and then moved on to the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island, and onward to Antarctica to locate the South Magnetic Pole. After spending 5 months in the Antarctic they returned to resupply in Hobart, then went on to Sydney, and the Bay of Islands in New Zealand. They left New Zealand to return to Antarctica. After spending 138 days at sea, and a collision between the Erebus and Terror, they sailed to the Falkland Islands, to Tierra del Fuego, back to the Falklands and onward to their third sortie into the Antarctic. They made a landing at Cockburn Island and after leaving the Antarctic, stopped at the Cape, St Helena and Ascension Island. The ships arrived back in England on 4 September 1843; the voyage had been a success <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> as it was the first to confirm the existence of the southern continent and chart much of its coastline.|$|E

25|$|The Nationals {{played their}} annual Independence Day contest at Nationals Park on July 4 against the {{division}} rival New York Mets, with Joe Ross starting {{for the home}} team. The Nationals won 11–4, marking yet another game <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> in which he received run support in the double-digits: his seventh in 12 starts on the season to that point. The win was also Washington's 50th of the season. The next day's game was postponed due to rain, while the game {{on the day after}} that — the opener of a series at Nationals Park against Washington's top division rival, the Atlanta Braves — was delayed for more than three hours due to a thunderstorm in the forecast, which never materialized, prompting some criticism of the Nationals for unnecessarily pushing back the start time until 10:10 p.m. EDT. The July 6 game, which actually finished early in the morning of July 7 due to the late start, was a 5–2 Braves win. Starting center fielder Michael A. Taylor was lifted midway through the game with an oblique strain, which manager Dusty Baker announced after the game would send him to the 10-day disabled list, with outfielder Chris Heisey being activated from the disabled list in a corresponding move. The Nationals struck back that evening, mounting a ferocious ninth-inning rally in the July 7 game to come back from a three-run deficit and force extra innings. In the tenth inning, the shortstop Sánchez lined a slider from former National Ian Krol, pitching in relief for Atlanta, up the middle for his first career hit. Three at-bats later, Sánchez came around to score on second baseman Daniel Murphy's walk-off single over the head of left fielder Matt Kemp, and the Nationals won 5–4. In the July 8 game, though, the Nationals suffered their first shutout of the year, losing 13–0 as the Braves pummeled starter Stephen Strasburg, who exited the game in the third inning after being hit on the hip with a line drive comebacker; usual starter Tanner Roark, in his first relief appearance of the season; and Solis, still working his way back from injury. The Nationals defeated Atlanta 10–5 to earn a split of the four-game series on July 9, in their last game before the All-Star Break. Ross again received double-digit run support, for the eighth time in 13 starts to begin the season, but exited in the fourth inning after exhibiting a marked decrease in velocity and struggling with his command. The team announced several days later that Ross would undergo Tommy John surgery, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season and beyond.|$|E

While many disaffected conservatives may have voted <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but of the voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important," [...] two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.|$|E
