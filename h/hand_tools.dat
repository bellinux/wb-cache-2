5|$|Vorotsov {{imported}} {{thousands of}} his serfs from the Moscow, Vladimir, and Voronezh governorates of the Russian Empire {{to construct the}} palace. These unpaid workers performed all the labour by hand, aided only by primitive <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> Masons were also brought in {{to help with the}} construction. The palace's ashlar blocks were made from a local greenish-gray tinge diabase, chosen for its unique colour to match the colours of the surrounding mountainous landscape and forest greenery. All other building materials were imported from outside the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines {{because of the high}} magnetic fields generated. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, it does seem probable that hominid brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well be grounded in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have only come later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the prefrontal cortex would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated behavior may then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks. According to the research team in Jebel Irhoud, the discovery means that Homo sapiens — not members of a rival or ancestor species (Homo heidelbergensis, Homo naledi) — {{were the ones who}} left behind Middle Stone Age <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> that have since been unearthed all over Africa.|$|E

5|$|Some {{passengers}} and crew members who called from the aircraft using the cabin airphone service and mobile phones provided details: several hijackers were aboard each plane; they used mace, tear gas, or pepper spray to overcome attendants; and some people aboard had been stabbed. Reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots, flight attendants, and one or more passengers. According to the 9/11 Commission's final report, the hijackers had recently purchased multi-function <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> and assorted Leatherman-type utility knives with locking blades, which were not forbidden to passengers at the time, but were not found among the possessions {{left behind by the}} hijackers. A flight attendant on Flight 11, a passenger on Flight 175, and passengers on Flight 93 said the hijackers had bombs, but one of the passengers said he thought the bombs were fake. The FBI found no traces of explosives at the crash sites, and the 9/11 Commission concluded that the bombs were probably fake.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth Helitack crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of high-resolution surface information by advanced documentation methods as short-range laser scanning or closerange photogrammetry can provide novel tool mark research perspectives {{in the field}} of archaeological sciences. For this reason, altogether eight different Bronze Age <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> replicas and their tool marks were surveyed and analysed in this study. The automatic identification of sliding tool marks was carried out in a GIS environment. Based on hydrological and aspect parameters, the various <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> impressions as watershed boundaries of the surface model could be determined in the developed workflow. After the segmentation of the single tool marks, slope and width values of the patterns were compared with the cutting edges of their replicas and the most used regions of the <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> heads could be defined by these tool mark characteristics. The variation of midline parameters along the sliding tool marks resulted in significant conclusions about the mounting techniques of the <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> heads on the handles. A smaller angular value between the replica and the handle produced different <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> impressions which had a major influence on the woodworking efficiency as well. Furthermore, in this paper presented methods should also help to understand other ancient wood manufacture processes...|$|R

Different types of calipers have different mechanisms for displaying the distance measured. Where larger objects need to be measured with less precision, a tape measure is often used.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduced}} the essential {{development of an}} innovative <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> harvester since harvesting the tuber of Dioscorea hispida is tedious and difficult while the existing <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> is heavy. The information of optimum force required from field experiment is used to model the simulation and practicability in Computer Aided Design (CAD) environment system. Several tests of maximum/minimum stress and displacement on different material of <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> were simulated by uploading the material characteristic on simulation program embedded in Solidworks software. Three materials which were commonly available in market namely Plain Carbon Steel, Aluminium Alloy and Cast Carbon Steel were chosen. This modeling software is very helpful to manage the model and simulate the workability of the designed equipment through stress and displacement mode analysis. The comparison between the tools {{that are based on}} the acquired land and tuber weight factor were also noted via Solidworks simulation. The end result of the simulation is based on visualization of analysis in Solidworks while producing the <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> for designing and fabrication from lighter and stronger material...|$|R

25|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> form of router is the {{original}} form. It is a specialized type of hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade projecting well beyond its base plate (gaining it the nickname old woman's tooth). Today the power tool form of router, with an electric-motor-driven spindle, is the more common form, and the <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> is now often called a router plane. Although the <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> has a few advantages over the power tool and retains favour with some workers, it has been mostly replaced by the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work.
