'Second mate of a banana steamer told me the natives were panning out enough from the beach sands to buy all the rum, red calico, and parlour melodeons in the world. The day I got there a syndicate named Incorporated Jones gets a <b>government</b> <b>concession</b> to all minerals from a given point. For a next choice I take coast fever and count green and blue lizards for six weeks in a grass hut. I had to be notified when I was well, for the reptiles were actually there. Then I shipped back as third cook on a Norwegian tramp that blew up her boiler two miles below Quarantine. I was due to bust through that cellar door here to-night, so I hurried {{the rest of the way}} up the river, roustabouting on a lower coast packet that made up a landing for every fisherman that wanted a plug of tobacco. And now I'm here for what comes next. And it'll be along, it'll be along,' said this queer Mr. Kearny; 'it'll be along on the beams of my bright but not very particular star.' ...|$|E

40|$|We treat <b>government</b> <b>concessions</b> as {{additions}} to an expected payoffs schedule {{rather than as}} being synonymous with it. <b>Government</b> <b>concessions</b> that add to terrorists' expected payoffs past some point on a positively sloped risk-reward trade-off schedule will not make all terrorists more risk seeking. Such concessions do not represent certain 'windfall gains' to terrorists {{of the kind that}} interact with relative and absolute risk aversion. Although the expected payoffs to higher risk actions may be augmented by the <b>government's</b> <b>concessions,</b> terrorists must still bear risk in order to attain them. Terrorist groups that were unwilling to bear that risk before will not be enticed to bear it after expected payoffs are enhanced. Conversely, negative concessions or penalties will make terrorists more averse to risk because penalties alter the risk-reward trade-off in ways that make lower-risk actions more desirable to risk-averse terrorists. Our paper also explores the risk-reward characteristics of new and innovative terrorist actions relative to the structure of an existing expected payoffs schedule. ...|$|R

40|$|When <b>governments</b> offer <b>concessions</b> to an ideologically {{heterogeneous}} {{terrorist organization}} the moderates within that organization {{are most likely}} to accept the concessions. Consequently, the terrorist organization is left in the hands of extremists following concessions, leading to an increase in militantism and potentially in terrorist violence. However, governments often also require former terrorists to collaborate in counter-terrorism efforts, which improves the governments chances of eradicating terror entirely.

50|$|The 1990s {{also saw}} KCSI expand into Mexico with the {{acquisition}} of partial interests in the Texas Mexican Railway (TM) and Grupo Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM). TFM was created when Kansas City Southern Industries and Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) purchased a <b>government</b> <b>concession</b> to operate a rail system in Mexico. It was the most sought after portion of the Mexican railroad concessions, called the Northeast Railroad, that was purchased by KCSI and TMM. The concession was also bid on by many other major companies, including the United States' largest railroad, Union Pacific Railroad. KCSI and TMM bid on, and won, the concession for $1.4 Billion USD, paying 49% and 51%, respectively. TMM already partially owned the Texas Mexican Railway through a previous concession from the Mexican government. TM was particularly important to KCSI because they held the link from KCSI tracks to TFM tracks via trackage rights over the Union Pacific line. Shortly after acquiring the Mexican government's concession, KCSI entered into another joint venture to purchase a <b>government</b> <b>concession.</b> On June 19, 1998 the government of Panama turned {{over control of the}} Panama Canal Railway to Kansas City Southern Railroad and the privately held Lanigan Holdings, LLC. This created the Panama Canal Railway Company (PCRC).|$|E

50|$|The Ministry of Transport took a {{legislative}} approach. A new act regarding aerodromes was passed on 16 December 1960, which required a <b>government</b> <b>concession</b> to build, operate or own an aerodrome. Although the law took effect in metropolitan Norway on 1 January 1962, {{it was decided}} that it would take effect from 9 March 1961. This resulted in Norrønafly applying for concession in March, followed by Norsk Polar Navigasjon shortly afterwards. The issue was discussed in the Cabinet of State on 13 April, with the outcome that the government would continue to only allow Air Force aircraft to deliver post and provide air ambulance services.|$|E
50|$|From {{the late}} 19th century, {{there had been}} {{proposals}} to build a bridge for Lisbon. In 1929, the idea advanced as a Portuguese engineer and entrepreneur, António Bello requested a <b>Government</b> <b>concession</b> for a railway crossing between Lisbon and Montijo (where the Vasco da Gama Bridge, the second bridge serving Lisbon, was later built in 1998). As a result, the Minister of Public Works, Duarte Pacheco, created a commission in 1933 to analyse the request. The commission reported in 1934, and proposed building a road and rail bridge. Bids were obtained. However, this proposal was subsequently put aside in favour of a bridge crossing the river at Vila Franca de Xira, 35 km north of Lisbon.|$|E

50|$|In 1990 the Brazilian Government {{partially}} deregulated {{the market}} and changed its airline concession policies, allowing {{the creation of new}} airlines. At this point Marcos Sampaio Ferreira decided to transform his air taxi company into a regular airline with operations independent from those of TAM Airlines. The leased Bandeirantes were returned to TAM and in 1992 the first Embraer EMB 120 Brasília was received. With new aircraft and a new logo identity, depicting a Jabiru locally known as tuiuiú, regular flights started on April 12, 1993. It became the first Brazilian airline to introduce the ATR 42 aircraft in December 1993. In 1995 it won a <b>government</b> <b>concession</b> for transportation of Petrobras employees and cargo through the Amazon region.|$|E
50|$|Planning {{began in}} 1860 {{on a new}} railway line from Osterath on the Cologne-Krefeld line over the Rhine to Essen and later on to Dortmund. Prior to the Austro-Prussian War, the Prussian {{military}} opposed {{the building of a}} fixed bridge across the Rhine for military reasons, except in fortified cities such as Cologne, Mainz, Koblenz and Düsseldorf. Therefore, a ferry was needed between the left bank in the current Duisburg districts of Rheinhausen and Hochfeld. The Prussian <b>government</b> <b>concession</b> for the railway was issued on 9 March 1863 and the concession for the ferry was issued on 16 July 1863. Construction of the railway commenced immediately. Before commencing work on the ferry, the Rhenish Railway waited for the completion of its Spyck-Welle train ferry so that it could use technology being tested there.|$|E
50|$|Kansas City Southern de México was {{originally}} formed in 1996 when Kansas City Southern Industries and Transportación Maritima Mexicana (TMM) purchased a <b>government</b> <b>concession</b> {{to operate on}} a rail system in Mexico. It was the Mexican President, Ernesto Zedillo who proposed the privatisation of the Mexican railways because the Mexican railway system had fallen {{into a state of}} disrepair and needed drastic work to become profitable. Since the late 1930s, Mexican trains and tracks were property of the government as Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México (Mexican National Railways). The nationalized railroad operated successfully for many years, yet, by the 1990s, the system was so poorly run, that US railways would not even send rail cars into Mexico, for fear {{that they would not be}} returned. When the decision to privatize the railroad was made, only 15% of freight was moved by rail in Mexico (versus 42% in the US).|$|E

Not only did the Government resist this call but it punished Atenisi for its advocacy by thenceforth refusing to employ its university graduates, a severe penalty in the developing world. The boycott was lifted after the accession of a commoner prime minister in 2006 and the <b>Government's</b> <b>concession</b> to democratic principle.|$|R

On 26 July 1833, Wilberforce heard of <b>government</b> <b>concessions</b> that guaranteed {{the passing of the}} Bill for the Abolition of Slavery.
