5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> through a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E

25|$|In France, cutlery {{is used in}} the {{continental}} manner (with the fork in the left hand, prongs <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> and the knife in the right hand). French etiquette prohibits the placing of hands below the table and the placing of elbows on it.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of a round, each player is dealt four <b>face</b> <b>down</b> cards side by side and four face up cards facing the center of the playing table, one in front of each <b>face</b> <b>down</b> card. The four parallel pairs of face up and <b>face</b> <b>down</b> cards form the player's four coops. A player may look at his own <b>face</b> <b>down</b> cards whenever he chooses, while his opponents may not look at them. The remainder of the deck is placed <b>face</b> <b>down</b> {{in the center of the}} playing table as the stock pile.|$|R
50|$|The deck {{is split}} evenly and each player is dealt four <b>face</b> <b>down</b> cards and eight hand cards. Each player chooses {{four of their}} hand cards to place face up over the <b>face</b> <b>down</b> cards: one <b>face</b> up card on each <b>face</b> <b>down</b> card.|$|R
5000|$|In both games {{each player}} is dealt {{a set of}} 10 [...] "Spit Cards", <b>face</b> <b>down,</b> and one card, <b>face</b> <b>down,</b> in their [...] "Spit Pile". (See middle row of the diagrams).|$|R
25|$|Broken faceplate. This {{is a real}} emergency, {{but very}} {{unlikely}} as the faceplate is usually a highly impact-resistant polymer and should not shatter. It can be mitigated by opening the free flow valve and holding the opening level, <b>facing</b> <b>down,</b> and breathing very carefully. a small hole or crack can be covered with a hand to slow the leak.|$|E
25|$|One {{group is}} {{formed by the}} four species with flowers of {{elongated}} segments, which generally are not widely open. These species present malleable inflorescences that leave the flowers slightly or very overthrown, frequently <b>facing</b> <b>down.</b> Almost all the species of this group have long leaves, of comparatively lighter tones, generally with smooth surfaces, that are longer than the inflorescences.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} rumours that the Communists were {{planning}} a massacre on 9 October, 70,000 citizens demonstrated in Leipzig that Monday, and the authorities {{on the ground}} refused to open fire. This victory of the people <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> the Communists' guns encouraged more citizens {{to take to the}} streets. The following Monday, 16 October, 120,000 people demonstrated on the streets of Leipzig.|$|E
50|$|This two-handed {{variant of}} Marjapussi {{is known as}} Avomarjapussi, Open Marjapussi. Each player is dealt four cards. Each player is also dealt a row of seven cards <b>face</b> <b>down</b> {{on the table and}} a row of seven cards face up {{on the top of the}} <b>face</b> <b>down</b> cards. To declare marriages and play cards to tricks, the players can use their own face up cards and their own hand cards. When a player plays a face up card in a trick and there is a card under it <b>face</b> <b>down,</b> the <b>face</b> <b>down</b> card is turned face up.|$|R
50|$|First player {{starts out}} by laying out a card face up (row 1). Below that card, place another <b>face</b> <b>down</b> {{followed}} by one face up {{right next to}} it (row 2). Below that row, place 1st and 2nd card <b>face</b> <b>down</b> and 3rd card face up (row 3). Below that row, place the 1st, 2nd and 3rd card <b>face</b> <b>down,</b> 4th card <b>face</b> up (row 4). This is laid out on players right side. Below 4th row, count out 12 cards <b>face</b> <b>down</b> making a stack with the 13th card face up. Remaining cards, <b>face</b> <b>down</b> in a stack {{to the left of}} the stack of the 13 (make sure there is a big space (two hands width in between for a discard pile, cards in discard pile are face up)).|$|R
50|$|As {{drawings}} are completed, {{they are}} placed <b>face</b> <b>down</b> {{in the center}} of the play surface. All remaining players must place their drawings <b>face</b> <b>down</b> on the play surface when the timer expires.|$|R
25|$|In 1968, {{following}} {{the occupation of}} Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union, Tito added an additional defense line to Yugoslavia's borders with the Warsaw Pact countries. Later in 1968, Tito then offered Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubček that he would fly to Prague on three hours notice if Dubček needed help in <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> the Soviet Union which was occupying Czechoslovakia at the time.|$|E
25|$|All tiles {{are placed}} {{face down on}} the table and are shuffled. By {{convention}} all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> as soon as possible to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{has been}} described as inspiring others to take personal initiative and act decisively in a crisis. Newsagent and former policeman Mohammed Afzah cited Smeaton as inspiration for his <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> and repelling a would-be armed robber. In late July, Smeaton returned to his old job as a baggage handler at the airport. Later in the year he accepted a job as head of security at a nearby company.|$|E
5000|$|Anyone at {{any time}} may offer to buy any number of <b>face</b> <b>down</b> cards from another player. Cards {{purchased}} in this fashion are placed <b>face</b> <b>down</b> {{at the bottom of}} the purchaser's stack.|$|R
50|$|To {{supplement}} the Staple Resources, players may play any card from their hand <b>face</b> <b>down</b> as a Resource; however, cards played <b>face</b> <b>down</b> {{in this manner}} will not count towards the Resource threshold.|$|R
50|$|Each {{player is}} dealt five cards {{to form a}} hand, and each player is dealt 15 cards <b>face</b> <b>down</b> to form a draw pile. If playing with jokers, they are used as wild cards and give each draw pile 16 cards. Two stacks of five cards, placed <b>face</b> <b>down</b> on each side between the players, serve as {{replacement}} piles. Finally, two cards are placed <b>face</b> <b>down</b> in the center between the replacement piles.|$|R
25|$|The rise in {{popularity}} of katana amongst samurai came about {{due to the}} changing nature of close-combat warfare. The quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on short response times. The katana further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (obi) with the sharpened edge facing up. Ideally, samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved tachi had been worn with the edge of the blade <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> and suspended from a belt.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} {{on this position}} is to secure the wrists to either the spreader bar or to a securing point between their ankles forming a hogtie, resulting in {{what is called a}} suspension bow. In this position, if the subject is a female and <b>facing</b> <b>down,</b> her breasts would be pointing almost straight down depending on the strictness of the position, and nipple clamps and weights can be added for painful stimulation. The clamps may alternatively be secured to a point on the floor, limiting the subject's ability to struggle or move at all without causing pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{test method}} {{consists}} of pushing an instrumented cone, {{with the tip}} <b>facing</b> <b>down,</b> into the ground at a controlled rate (controlled between 1.5 -2.5cm/s accepted). The resolution of the CPT in delineating stratigraphic layers {{is related to the}} size of the cone tip, with typical cone tips having a cross-sectional area of either 10 or 15cm², corresponding to diameters of 3.6 and 4.4cm. A very early ultra-miniature 1 cm² subtraction penetrometer was developed and used on a US mobile ballistic missile launch system (MGM-134 Midgetman) soil/structure design program in 1984 at the Earth Technology Corporation of Long Beach, California.|$|E
50|$|Another {{version of}} the game also makes <b>face</b> <b>down</b> 4’s {{entitled}} to an additional card. There are variations as to when the player must announce they have a <b>face</b> <b>down</b> 4, and also whether the additional card should also be <b>face</b> <b>down</b> as a result. Football is an alternative version of Baseball Poker where 3’s and 6’s are wild and an additional card is drawn if a player is dealt a 2.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} {{that may}} change the strategy is that the cannon can not use a <b>face</b> <b>down</b> piece for a screen but can capture multiple pieces in a single turn. The cannon can not capture <b>face</b> <b>down</b> pieces in this variant.|$|R
50|$|Capture the 5 of cups {{using the}} 5 of swords, and place both cards <b>face</b> <b>down</b> {{in front of}} him;#Capture the 6 of swords and ace of coins using the 7 of clubs, and place all three cards <b>face</b> <b>down</b> in front of him.|$|R
25|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis in the Autumn of 1962, {{in which}} the United States {{blockaded}} a Soviet attempt to put nuclear missiles on Cuba, created widespread public anxiety about imminent nuclear war and CND organised demonstrations on the issue. But {{six months after the}} crisis, a Gallup Poll found that public concern about nuclear weapons had fallen to its lowest point since 1957, and there was a view (disputed by some CND supporters) that U.S. President John F. Kennedy's success in <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev turned the British public away from the idea of unilateral nuclear disarmament.|$|E
25|$|Bench {{planes are}} {{characterized}} by the cutting iron bedded with the bevel <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> and attached to a chipbreaker. Most metal bench planes, and some larger wooden ones, are designed with a rear handle known as a tote. Block planes {{are characterized by}} the absence of a chipbreaker and the cutting iron bedded with the bevel up. The block plane is usually a smaller tool that can be held with one hand and is used for general purpose work such as taking down a knot in the wood, smoothing small pieces, chamfering edges, and making the end of a sawed board square and smooth.|$|E
25|$|As first {{explained}} by Maximilian Schuler in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital {{period of a}} hypothetical satellite orbiting just above {{the surface of the}} earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called Schuler tuning, is used in inertial guidance systems in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the control system that keeps the inertial platform containing the gyroscopes stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.|$|E
50|$|One deck {{of cards}} (minus jokers) is used. The deck is shuffled and twelve piles of four cards each are laid out, <b>face</b> <b>down,</b> in a circle. The {{remaining}} four cards are placed, also <b>face</b> <b>down,</b> in a pile {{in the center of}} the circle.|$|R
50|$|The 106 tiles {{are placed}} <b>face</b> <b>down</b> {{on the table}} and {{thoroughly}} mixed. Then the players set them up into 21 stacks of five tiles, the tiles in each pile being <b>face</b> <b>down.</b> One tile is left over - this is temporarily kept by the dealer.|$|R

25|$|With the schism in {{internal}} party politics came a new {{threat to the}} mines that brought South Africa its wealth. A small-scale miners' dispute flared into a full-blown strike, and rioting broke out in Johannesburg after Smuts intervened heavy-handedly. After police shot dead twenty-one strikers, Smuts and Botha headed unaccompanied to Johannesburg to resolve the situation personally. <b>Facing</b> <b>down</b> threats to their own lives, they negotiated a cease-fire. But the cease-fire did not hold, and in 1914, a railway strike turned into a general strike. Threats of a revolution caused Smuts to declare martial law. Smuts acted ruthlessly, deporting union leaders without trial and using Parliament to absolve him {{and the government of}} any blame retroactively. This was too much for the Old Boers, who set up their own National Party to fight the all-powerful Botha-Smuts partnership.|$|E
25|$|The army led by Alexander the Great {{into the}} Persian Empire {{included}} Greek heavy infantry {{in the form}} of allied contingents provided by the League of Corinth and hired mercenaries. These infantrymen would have been equipped as hoplites with the traditional hoplite panoply consisting of a thrusting spear (doru), bronze-faced hoplon shield and body armour. In appearance, they would have been almost identical to the hypaspists. In battle, the Greek hoplites had a less active role than the Macedonian phalangites and hypaspists. At Gaugamela, the Greek infantry formed the defensive rear of the box formation Alexander arranged his army into, while the Macedonians formed its front face. Nevertheless, they performed a valuable function in <b>facing</b> <b>down</b> attempts by the Persian cavalry to surround the Macedonian army and helped deal with the breakthrough of some Persian horsemen who went on to attack the baggage.|$|E
25|$|After the Dissolution of the monasteries at the English Reformation, the retable {{panel was}} made into the lid of a chest, with the main painted side <b>facing</b> <b>down.</b> The chest was used to store wax funeral effigies of English monarchs, and the {{painting}} was not rediscovered until 1725, when it was drawn by Vertue (British Library). In 1778 serious damage was caused when the chest was modified into a cupboard or display case to show the funeral effigy of Pitt the Elder. Not until 1827, when the Retable was seen by the architect Edward Blore, then Surveyor of the Abbey, published in The Gentleman's Magazine and removed from the chest and set in a glazed frame, was it regarded {{as anything other than}} a curiosity by the Abbey. Since its rediscovery, the piece has been further damaged by attempted restoration efforts, which included a coating of glue intended to hold together painted layers. Watercolours of the Retable were made for the Society of Antiquaries of London; a conjectural restoration was included in Viollet-le-Duc's Dictionnaire raisonné du mobilier français, and plates accompanied William Burges's essays on painted objects at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
