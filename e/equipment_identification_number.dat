40|$|This manual is {{intended}} to provide a user with enough detailed instruction to guide them through the Master Equipment List Phase 1 (MEL Phase 1) application system operations. The MEL Phase 1 application is a database system that stores <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> (EIN) information to support equipment tracking in the 200 E and 200 W Tank Farms for the Tank Waste Remediation System Division. The MEL Phase 1 application supports both the user application and administrative control functions. The user application functions include: viewing by Folder, reporting, performing queries, and editing specific data. The administrative control functions include: maintaining valid user identifications, passwords, privileges, defining drop-down lists, and review of the change log relating to EIN data entries, additions, deletions, and editing. The scope of this User`s Manual is to discuss these functions and {{is intended}} to guide users and answer questions regarding the MEL Phase 1 application...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to define the system requirements for the Master Equipment List (MEL) Phase 1 project. The intended audience for this document includes Data Automation Engineering (DAE), Configuration Management Improvement and Control Engineering (CMI and CE), Data Administration Council (DAC), and Tank Waste Remedial System (TWRS) personnel. The intent of Phase 1 {{is to develop a}} user-friendly system to support the immediate needs of the TWRS labeling program. Phase 1 will provide CMI and CE the ability to administrate, distribute, and maintain key information generated by the labeling program. CMI and CE is assigning new <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Numbers</b> (EINs) to selected equipment in Tank Farms per the TWRS Data Standard ``Tank Farm <b>Equipment</b> <b>Identification</b> Number``. The MEL Phase 1 system will be a multi-user system available through the HLAN network. It will provide basic functions such as view, query, and report, edit, data entry, password access control, administration and change control. The scope of Phase 1 data will encompass all Tank Farm Equipment identified by the labeling program. The data will consist of fields from the labeling program`s working database, relational key references and pointers, safety class information, and field verification data...|$|R
2500|$|An {{early use}} of {{one type of}} barcode in an {{industrial}} context {{was sponsored by the}} Association of American Railroads in the late 1960s. [...] Developed by General Telephone and Electronics (GTE) and called KarTrak ACI (Automatic Car Identification), this scheme involved placing colored stripes in various combinations on steel plates which were affixed to the sides of railroad rolling stock. [...] Two plates were used per car, one on each side, with the arrangement of the colored stripes encoding information such as ownership, type of <b>equipment,</b> and <b>identification</b> <b>number.</b> [...] The plates were read by a trackside scanner, located for instance, at the entrance to a classification yard, while the car was moving past. [...] The project was abandoned after about ten years because the system proved unreliable after long-term use.|$|R
25|$|Every {{piece of}} {{railroad}} rolling stock operating in North American interchange service {{is required to}} carry a standardized set of reporting marks. The marks {{are made up of}} a two- to four-letter code identifying the owner of the equipment accompanied by an <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> and statistics on the equipment's capacity and tare (unloaded) weight. Marks whose codes end in X (such as TTGX) are used on equipment owned by entities that are not common carrier railroads themselves. Marks whose codes end in U are used on containers that are carried in intermodal transport, and marks whose codes end in Z are used on trailers that are carried in intermodal transport, per ISO standard 6346). Most freight cars carry automatic <b>equipment</b> <b>identification</b> RFID transponders.|$|R

40|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} worldwide have unique aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> on the rooves {{for ease}} of identification for aerial support, particularly if the individuals crewing the vehicle need exigent assistance. Drawing on an actual event from the 2013 Blue Mountains Wildfire, this paper highlights how aerial support from a water bombing aircraft was unable to read the existing black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> of a fire appliance because the black <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> coalesced with the black plumes of smoke emitted by the wildfire. Given the extensive technological development {{in the application of}} high visibility markings over the past twenty-one years, the current black and aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> used by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service on their fire appliances is far from adequate, doing little to provide optimum safety for fire ground crews in a wildfire. This paper concludes that the current black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> should be replaced with high visibility aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> markings because these have greater visibility for aerial support in a wildfire particularly in the colours of red, lime, yellow, orange or blue. 15 page(s...|$|R
