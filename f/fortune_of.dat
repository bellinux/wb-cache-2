Those educated or given religious training were only by the <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> their owner's interests. King's stories tell of children in domestic, farm, and industrial work, who spent their free time in celebrations, dances, games, folk rituals, and hunting.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolution}} {{destroyed a}} colonial administration ruled {{from the other}} side of the world, and dismantled with it the raja, seen by many as obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> the population’s poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.|$|E
5|$|There are oft-repeated {{historical}} {{claims that}} Joshua Norton arrived in San Francisco {{on a specific}} vessel, the Franzeska, on 23 November 1849; that he arrived with $40,000, {{in whole or in}} part a bequest from his father's estate; and that he parlayed this into a <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> $250,000. None of this is substantiated by contemporaneous documentation. What is known is that, after Norton arrived in San Francisco, he enjoyed a good deal of success in commodities markets and in real estate speculation, and that by late 1852, he was one of the more prosperous, respected citizens of the city.|$|E
5|$|John was {{the eldest}} child of Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol. He was distant from his father, who treated him harshly, {{and did not}} get on well with him, though {{he was close to}} his first stepmother, Lady Juliet. After {{spending}} time in London, Monte Carlo, Paris and New York in the 1970s, he settled in part of the family seat, Ickworth House in Suffolk, becoming the 7th Marquess in 1985. Despite inheriting a large <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> up to £35 million, the Marquess spent most of it during his lifetime. He struggled with addiction to cocaine and other drugs, serving several jail sentences for possession, and was known for his flamboyant lifestyle and homosexuality. His brief marriage in the mid-1980s did not last because of this, and he became increasingly depressed as he lost money and faced bankruptcy, culminating in the sale of the remainder of Ickworth House to the National Trust. He died in early 1999 of complications resulting from his drug addiction, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol.|$|E
