25|$|N scale {{locomotives}} are {{powered by}} DC motors which accept {{a maximum of}} 12 V DC. In traditional DC control, {{the speed of the}} train is determined by the amount of voltage supplied to the rails. The direction of the train is determined by the polarity of the power to the rails. Since the end of the 20th century, an increasing number of enthusiasts have started using digital train control systems to determine the speed and direction of their trains. This has in part been made possible by surface mount technology and new motors that draw very little current (typically 0.2 amps). The most popular <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> used in N scale model railways are NMRA-DCC and Selectrix.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{intended}} {{to provide a more}} efficient mechanism for controlling industrial operations, the development of <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> allowed for flexibility in integrating distributed sensors and operating logic while maintaining a centralized interface for human monitoring and interaction. This ease of readily adding sensors and logic through software, which was once done with relays and isolated analog instruments, has led to wide acceptance and integration of these systems in all industries. However, these <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> have often been integrated in phases to cover different aspects of an industrial operation, connected over a network, and leading to a complex interconnected and interdependent system. While the control theory applied is often nothing more than a digital version of their analog counterparts, the dependence of <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> upon the communications networks, has precipitated the need for cybersecurity due to potential effects on confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. To achieve resilience in the next generation of control systems, therefore, addressing the complex control system interdependencies, including the human systems interaction and cyber security, will be a recognized challenge.|$|E

30|$|The design {{principles}} of the <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> include single failure criterion, independence, common cause failure criteria, and capability for testing and calibration. In-depth defensive features and defense should be designed for the safety software system. To prevent software instability, limit checks, logic check for error input date, and assigned default values should also be included. Therefore, the <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> software is vast and complex. The source codes of the <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> can reach hundreds of thousands lines. However, design flaws or insufficient requirements, which may result in software failures, are unavoidable during software development. Failures of the digital system software are difficult to intuitively check, classify, and correct, which may affect performance.

40|$|In this exam thesis an {{analogue}} <b>control</b> <b>system</b> for {{a module}} {{consisting of two}} half-bridge converters {{has been replaced by}} a <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> derived in this thesis. The <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> has been derived using the existing analogue <b>control</b> <b>system</b> as a reference to find the important functions that has to be included in the <b>system.</b> The <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> should be able to handle parallel and serial connected converters as well as single converter operation. The analogue <b>control</b> <b>system</b> has been analysed in the beginning of the thesis and the important functions has been listed to serve as a guideline of how the <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> should function. After listing the functions of the analogue <b>control</b> <b>system</b> a <b>digital</b> component has been chosen that can perform some of these functions, the digital components studied in this thesis are FPGAs and microcontrollers. The chosen component to replace some of the functions of the analogue <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is a microcontroller, a XC 164 CM from Infineon. This component has been programmed in assembler and C and the complete program has been tested on the module, to be able to connect the microcontroller to the module, a new PCB has been designed and constructed. Before connecting the <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> to the module the system has been tested with the help of a step-down converter, constructed during the thesis work, to avoid damaging the module.
