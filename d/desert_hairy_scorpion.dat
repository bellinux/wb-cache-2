The young are born one by one, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one moult. The young generally resemble their parents, requiring between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Scorpions have quite variable lifespans and the lifespan of most species is not known.

50|$|Even {{though the}} {{majority}} of captive beetles are wild-caught, blue death feigning beetles suit very well in captivity, being common and even popular in zoos and insectariums. These insects are becoming increasingly popular as pets. They require little to no additional heat or humidity, and only require dry sand as substrate as well as something to hide in. They cannot climb on smooth surfaces (plastic or glass). No water dish is required, {{and they can be}} fed foods such as apples, carrots, dog and cat foods, and etc. Crickets or mealworms that have recently died can be given on occasion.

50|$|Hadrurus arizonensis is {{distributed}} throughout the Sonora and Mojave deserts. In Mexico, the species range flanks the Gulf of California in Sonoran and Baja California Norte.

Arizona <b>Desert</b> <b>hairy</b> <b>scorpions</b> are a warm-desert species, specially adapted to hot and dry conditions. They are usually found in and around washes or low-elevation valleys where they dig elaborate burrows (up to 2.5 m) and emerge at night to forage for prey and mates.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The giant <b>hairy</b> <b>desert</b> <b>scorpion,</b> Hadrurus arizonensis, is a {{long-lived}} {{species of}} North American scorpion that is presented here {{as an important}} model for research in mating systems evolution and sexual selection. Many behaviors found in this species were undocumented and are described {{here for the first}} time. This thesis includes studies of the following aspects of H. arizonensis behavior: 1) a description of courtship and mating behavior, 2) an empirical study of variance in courtship success among males and females as an indicator of mate choice in both sexes, 3) a descriptive and empirical study of aggression and agonistic behaviors in non-reproductive inter- and intrasexual interactions, and 4) an observational study of intrasexual competition over mates in both males and females. Experiments were performed in the laboratory and behaviors observed were videotaped for data collection and analysis. All subjects used in this study were field-captured prior to use in behavioral experiments. This species exhibits both reproductive and aggressive behaviors that are stereotyped and can be quantified, either by ranking their intensity, or measuring in terms of time. H. arizonensis is a polygamous species with external sperm transfer (via a spermatophore). Both males and females appear to exhibit mate choice. Large females elicit more intense courtship behavior from males, and males may preferentially court larger females to increase their own reproductive success. Furthermore, both males and females interfere in the courtship of conspecific pairs, indicating that both sexes potentially compete intrasexually for mates. Such findings may be attributable to the substantial contributions each sex makes in reproduction. This species also exhibits complex aggressive behaviors during agonistic interactions that may function in both species recognition and competition...|$|R

50|$|Commonly {{known as}} the black-back scorpion, it can be {{differentiated}} from the giant <b>desert</b> <b>hairy</b> <b>scorpion</b> by its completely black prosoma or cephalothorax.

This scorpion and its close relative Hadrurus arizonensis make good pets for a beginner, as they are quite large, very active and typically eat a lot.|$|E
