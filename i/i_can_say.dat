Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E

I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E

25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, writing [...] "There {{is hardly a}} thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that I was not bored and {{sometimes}} I was unreasonably pleased." [...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E

Eric Stoltz directed the episode, his third this season following [...] "The Purple Piano Project" [...] and [...] "Mash Off", and it was written by Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk. Morrison was questioned about Will's rumored proposal to Emma, and said, [...] "It's the most spectacular proposal I've ever seen."

We then used superior electronic devices which enabled us to [...] "blind" [...] or neutralize the missile sites' ground-to-air radar. We rendered them ineffective to take reliable fixes on our aircraft aloft. But in advance of direct aerial attacks, we used long-range artillery".|$|E
500|$|In a 2001 Interzone essay, author Gene Wolfe defended Brooks' {{derivation}} {{of material}} from Tolkien: [...] "Terry Brooks {{has often been}} disparaged for imitating Tolkien, particularly by those reviewers who find his books inferior to Tolkien's own. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> only that I wish there were more imitators -- we need them -- and that all imitations of so great an original must necessarily be inferior."

In the film, Carl Hanratty is also divorced from his wife, who lives with their daughter in Chicago. [...] "Some of my films have had to do with broken homes and people on the run from their sad pasts", Spielberg stated.

[...] The Ferrari drivers expressed no opinion in the matter, leaving the decision to Todt, who was not present.

He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink.
