25|$|By the {{government}} decree of July 1998 the polytechnics started {{to offer a}} two-stage curriculum (the first three years conferring a bacharelato degree, the following two years a licenciatura bietápica degree); both are undergraduate degrees, but the universities were offering a single licentiate degree (licenciatura) of four to five years. This was changed with the Bologna process with {{a new system of}} three years for a bachelor's degree (licenciatura). Two additional years grant a master's degree (mestrado) which is conferred by the polytechnic institute under protocols with a partner university or alone when the polytechnic institution is in full compliance with the necessary requirements (proper research activity, doctoral teaching staff, and budget). The doctoral degree (doutoramento) is conferred only by the universities, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been.</b> By the time of the implementation of the Bologna Process (2006) in Portuguese higher education, 9.5% of the state-run polytechnic teaching staff had a doctorate degree in 2005 - 15% in 2007 after the Bologna Process.|$|E

Although the band has changed, we’ve lost Layne, we’ve added Will, {{and there was no}} master plan. Playing again in 2005 felt right, so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It’s more than just making music, and <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been.</b> We’ve been friends a long time.

In it she said [...] "I look back on my life like a good day's work, it was done and I feel satisfied with it.

The scene they always cut {{out is the}} scene when Heathcliff digs up Catherine's body and dances in the {{moonlight}} and on the beach with it. I think you can't get much more operatic or passionate than that. I was trying to write a song about dead things coming to life. I was trying to write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love, not just enchanted and happy with it. It was about {{the dark side of}} love; about the ability to be resurrected by it... I just tried to put everything I could into it, and I'm real proud of it.|$|E

The untameable, Ishmaelitish thing that Egdon now <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>been.</b> Civilization was its enemy; {{and ever since}} the beginning of vegetation its soil had worn the same antique brown dress, the natural and invariable garment of the particular formation. In its venerable one coat lay a certain vein of satire on human vanity in clothes. A person on a heath in raiment of modern cut and colours has more or less an anomalous look. We seem to want the oldest and simplest human clothing where the clothing of the earth is so primitive.|$|R

2500|$|In 2005, the Pope listed {{several ways}} to combat the spread of HIV, {{including}} chastity, fidelity in marriage and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms. The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms {{to protect against the}} spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS. However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur. [...] TIME also reported in its edition of 30 April 2006 that the Vatican's position remains what <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> with Vatican officials [...] "flatly dismiss reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use." ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor Carl C. Taylor, {{also the}} Texas track coach, assumed {{basketball}} head coaching responsibilities for the 1913 season. Taylor {{arranged for the}} rental of the theater of the Ben Hur Temple and its conversion into a miniature basketball court and arena so that his team would have an indoor venue for home games and practice, with UT paying the Shriners and Scottish Rite Freemasons a sum of $75 for the season. Taylor came to UT with a strong reputation for basketball expertise, acquired during his years at Drake University. His Texas team finished with an overall record of 8–4 and, beginning with a 70–7 rout of Southwestern in San Marcos, contributed the first three victories to what would become a national-record winning streak. At {{the conclusion of the}} 1912–13 academic year, the UT's Cactus yearbook declared, [...] "Basketball is no longer a minor sport at the University of Texas. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> so considered until this year Prof. Carl Taylor took charge of the work and infused new life into it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Long vowels could arise {{by other}} mechanisms. One {{of these is}} known as [...] "compensatory lengthening"; this {{occurred}} when consonants formerly present were lost: maid is the modern descendant of Old English mægde. In this example, the g actually became a glide , so in a sense, {{the length of the}} consonant stayed where <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> and there was no [...] "compensation." [...] The silent [...] rule became available to represent long vowels in writing that arose from other sources; Old English brŷd, representing *bruʒd-i-, became Modern English bride.|$|R
2500|$|Flanders {{returned}} to the family home in Hampstead Garden Suburb. He directed and produced plays with a local amateur theatre group and arranged small musical gatherings with other amateurs of music, including Gerard Hoffnung and Frank Hauser. A stage acting career being no longer possible, he found work as a radio broadcaster and wrote a few song lyrics. At the same time, Swann began composing music for revues. He recalled in 1974, [...] "We wrote our first song {{in the summer of}} 1948. I'd gone over to Michael's home near Hampstead Heath {{to see if he could}} think of some words for a tune I'd written … 'It all sounds a bit like Gilbert and Sullivan, don't you think? … It must be terribly boring in the D'Oyly Carte Company, having to do everything exactly as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> done – Idea!" [...] The resulting trio, [...] "In the D'Oyly Cart" [...] , for three disgruntled Savoyards, was accepted by the producer Laurier Lister for his new show Oranges and Lemons. The revue and the trio were highly successful, and Lister commissioned further work from the pair for his next production, Penny Plain (1951). [...] Among their contributions to the latter were [...] "Prehistoric Complaint", a solo for Max Adrian, [...] "dressed in bits of fur as a sort of mis-fit caveman", and [...] "Surly Girls", with Adrian, Desmond Walter-Ellis and Jimmy Thompson as a trio [...] of appalling St Trinian's schoolgirls.|$|E

Mars was a great delight to him, and they were always together. But I bided my time, and one day, when opportunity was ripe, lured the animal away and settled for him with strychnine and beefsteak. It made positively no impression on John Claverhouse. His laugh was as hearty and frequent as ever, and his face as much like the full moon as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>been.</b>|$|R
