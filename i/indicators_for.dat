5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a {{detailed study of}} the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus was incapable of pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further <b>indicators</b> <b>for</b> a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E

5|$|The ribs were {{connected}} to the dorsal (trunk) vertebrae with two joints, acting together as a simple hinge joint, which has allowed researchers to reconstruct the inhaled and exhaled positions of the ribcage. The difference in volume between these two positions defines the air exchange volume (the amount of air moved with each breath), determined to be approximately 20L for a P.engelhardti individual estimated to have weighed690kg, or 29mL/kg bodyweight. This is a typical value for birds, but not for mammals, and indicates that Plateosaurus probably had an avian-style flow-through lung, although <b>indicators</b> <b>for</b> postcranial pneumaticity (air sacs of the lung invading the bones to reduce weight) {{can be found on}} the bones of only a few individuals, and were only recognized in 2010.
