5000|$|Organotin oxides and <b>hydroxides</b> {{are common}} {{products}} from the hydrolysis of organotin halides. Unlike the corresponding derivatives of silicon and germanium, tin oxides and <b>hydroxides</b> often adopt structures with penta- and even hexacoordinated tin centres, especially for the diorgano- and monoorgano derivatives. The group Sn-O-Sn is called a stannoxane. Structurally simplest of the oxides and <b>hydroxides</b> are the triorganotin derivatives. A commercially important triorganotin <b>hydroxides</b> is the acaricide Cyhexatin (also called Plictran), (C6H11)3SnOH.

5|$|The <b>hydroxides</b> {{themselves}} {{are the most}} basic <b>hydroxides</b> known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides. They easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates, or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides, and {{may be used to}} separate thiols from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead react with the alkali metal <b>hydroxides</b> to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal <b>hydroxides</b> can also attack silicate glass.|$|R
5|$|Barium <b>hydroxide</b> ("baryta") {{was known}} to alchemists, who {{produced}} it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium <b>hydroxide,</b> it absorbs very little CO2 in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium <b>hydroxide</b> (LiOH) is the only alkali metal <b>hydroxide</b> that is not deliquescent.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{substantial}} research done on adsorption of metals/metalloids by Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides,</b> little is known regarding the adsorption of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides,</b> especially those formed {{in the presence of}} organic acid. This paper investigated the adsorption of phenanthrene on Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides</b> formed with initial tannate/Al molar ratios (MRs) 0, 0. 001, 0. 01, and 0. 1 (referred to MR 0, MR 0. 001, MR 0. 01, and MR 0. 1, respectively) through batch adsorption experiments and FTIR study. The results showed that Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides</b> were important sorbents for phenanthrene. The adsorption kinetic data were fitted well with the pseudo-second-order equation. According to a modified Freundlich model, the adsorption capacities of Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides</b> followed a descending order of MR 0. 1 > MR 0 ≥ MR 0. 01 > MR 0. 001, which was inconsistent with the organic carbon content in the Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides.</b> Adsorption capacity correlated with the specific surface area, micropore area, and micropore diameter of Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides,</b> yet the relationships were not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). FTIR results showed that physical interaction was essential in phenanthrene adsorption onto the Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides,</b> which could be explained by an entropy-driven process. Surface hydrophobicity of Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides</b> {{played a key role in}} phenanthrene adsorption. Additional π–π electron donor–acceptor interaction of phenanthrene (acting as electron donor) with aromatic ring of tannic acid (electron acceptor) could be also important in phenanthrene adsorption by high MR Al (oxy) <b>hydroxides,</b> yet it needs further study. The findings obtained in the present study are of fundamental significance in understanding the mechanism of immobilization of PAHs in low organic matter but oxide-rich soils...|$|R

40|$|Iron (Fe) and {{aluminum}} (Al) <b>hydroxides</b> are highly reactive components in environmental processes, such as contaminant fate and trans-port. Phosphorus (P) sorption by these components can decrease environmental {{problems associated with}} excess accumulation of P in soils. The long-term stability of P sorbed by Fe/Al <b>hydroxides</b> is of major concern. Synthetic Fe and Al <b>hydroxides</b> coprecipitated with P (1 : 1 metal:P molar ratio) were incubated at 70 ◦C for 24 months to simulate natural long-term weathering processes that could influence the stability of sorbed P. Heat incubation (70 ◦C) of the untreated (no P) Al <b>hydroxides</b> resulted in drastic decreases (within {{the first month of}} incubation) in oxalate–Al extractability, specific surface area (SSA), and micropore volume with time. These changes were consistent with the formation of pseudoboehmite. Untreated Fe <b>hydroxides</b> showed no formation of crystalline components following heating (70 ◦C) for 24 months. Much smaller changes in oxalate-Al, P extractability, and SSA values were observed in the P-treated Al particles when compared with the untreated. Phosphorus treatment of both Fe and Al <b>hydroxides</b> stabilized the particle surfaces and prevented structural arrangements toward a long-range ordered phase. Slight reduction in SSA of the P-treated particles was related to dehydration phenomena during heating at 70 ◦C. Monitoring of physicochemical properties of the solids after heating at 70 ◦C for 2 years showed that sorbed P may be stable in the long-term.
