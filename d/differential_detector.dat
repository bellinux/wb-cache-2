40|$|Abstract-The error {{probability}} achieved by a differential de-tector with a bandpass limiter preceding the receiver is ana-lyzed for a slow-frequency-hopped CPFSK diversity waveform transmitted over a partial-band noise jamming channel, and {{is compared to}} the system’s performance without the bandpass limiter. The system’s thermal noise is not neglected in the anal-ysis. In principle, each bit is repeated on L different hops and for the FHlCPFSK system analyzed, these repetitions are com-bined to yield a soft decision. The main result of the paper is that a diversity gain for error rate improvement in worst-case partial-band jamming is realized for the <b>differential</b> <b>detector</b> preceded by a limiter, {{but not for the}} <b>differential</b> <b>detector</b> with-out a limiter.

The maximum-likelihood decision statistic is derived for the detector, and its performance is demonstrated by analysis and simulation. Under the Gaussian assumption for the aggregate interference plus noise, an exact expression for the symbol pairwise error probability is developed for-ary differential phase-shift keying modulation over a diversity, slow-fading Rayleigh channel {{in the presence of}} an interference source. A simpler expression of the pairwise error probability is developed for the asymptotic case of large signal-to-noise ratio and small signal-to-interference ratio.
