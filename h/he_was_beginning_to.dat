5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had hoped}} that being the author of an ongoing comic strip would improve his job prospects, for at the time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> develop a {{reputation}} as a designer of postcards, stationary, and advertisements. Rather than representing an example of a comic as the medium would come to be understood in the following decade, The Adventures of Totor consisted of square boxes containing illustrations with the captions written separately underneath, as was the style found in French comic creator Christophe's works La Famille Fenouillard (The Fenouillard Family) and Sapeur Camembert (Sapper Camembert). Initially using four boxes per page, as the series progressed this was increased to six and then eight, with each page ending on a cliffhanger.|$|E

25|$|Alfred Munnings was {{a painter}} specialising in horses. He {{served as a}} {{civilian}} war artist with Canadian cavalry during the war, having been judged unfit to fight {{due to lack of}} sight in one eye. In 1919, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship. The work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the Jockey Club for a sculpture of the racehorse Brown Jack at Epsom Downs Racecourse.|$|E
25|$|Early in the offseason, {{there were}} talks of trading Demeter. Near {{the end of}} November, there was a six player offer between Los Angeles and the Washington Senators, where Washington wanted Don in place of Sandy Amorós. The Dodgers were {{reluctant}} to lose their 24-year-old hitter, offering outfielder Ron Fairly to the Senators in Demeter's stead. Washington continued to hold out on the trade for Demeter until Los Angeles officially killed the deal on December 2. The Dodgers had confidence in Don, believing that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> overcome the many weakness in his hitting game that plagued him in previous seasons.|$|E

25|$|The Deux arabesques is {{an example}} of one of his {{earliest}} works, already developing his musical language. Suite bergamasque (1890) recalls rococo decorousness with a modern cynicism and puzzlement, and contains one of his most popular pieces, Clair de Lune. His String Quartet in G minor (1893) paved the way for his later more daring harmonic exploration, using the Phrygian mode as well as less standard scales such as the whole-tone, which creates a sense of floating, ethereal harmony. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> employ a single, continuous theme, breaking away from the traditional A–B–A form with its restatements and amplifications, which had been a mainstay of classical music since Joseph Haydn.|$|E
25|$|With {{his newfound}} intellect, Doc Green {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that the world was in danger by Gamma Mutates and thus needed to be depowered. He developed a serum made from Adamantium nanobites that absorbed gamma energy. He used these to depower the Leader, the Red Hulk, and A-Bomb, but decided to 'spare' She-Hulk as he concluded that she was the one gamma mutation whose life had been legitimately improved by her mutation. At the close of the storyline, Doc Green discovered that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> disappear as the result of the Extremis serum wearing off. He ultimately allowed himself to fade away, returning to his normal Hulk form, as he feared that remaining at his current intellectual level would lead to him becoming the Maestro.|$|E
25|$|The 1992 season saw Lathwell in the Second XI, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{break through}} into the First XI in one-day cricket. He opened the batting in two matches against the Netherlands (scoring 52 in the second). Lathwell top {{scored in the}} first Sunday League match of the season against Kent {{to set up a}} {{comfortable}} 4 wicket win. Two days later, Somerset played Kent again in the Benson & Hedges Cup, succumbing to a heavy defeat, Lathwell inexplicably batting at number 9. After another half-century for the Second XI, Lathwell was now firmly in the first team {{for the remainder of the}} season. It was an excellent debut season for Lathwell, scoring eleven half-centuries and one century (114 against Surrey) in first-class cricket. There was a lean spell in the middle of the season with consecutive scores of 1, 2, 3, 0 and 4, but Lathwell responded well with five innings between 45 and 72 and finished with a highly respectable average of 36.75 in first-class cricket. Lathwell was now established as an opening batsman, and was seldom used as a bowler, only taking wickets in for the season. He scored well in List A cricket too, but failed to convert any scores into centuries (his highest being 85, 93 and 95). Lathwell was rewarded with his Somerset County Cap, and was called into the England A touring squad to Australia.|$|E

500|$|Beebe's second book, The Bird, Its Form and Function, was {{published}} in 1906. This book was a reworking of a manuscript that Beebe had submitted to Henry Holt in 1902, but which Holt {{had asked him to}} expand into a major work on birds. In its finished form it represented a new kind of nature writing in that, although it presented technical information about bird biology and evolution, it did so in a way meant to be accessible to a general audience. It also represented an important turning point for Beebe, because in contrast to his youthful fascination with adding animals to his collection, in this book <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> emphasize the importance of wildlife conservation. Regarding the killing of animals {{for the sole purpose of}} collecting, the book states: ...|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Boston College, Paul {{worked as a}} case worker at an inner city school in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston, working with {{children}} with behavioral problems and also worked {{as a social worker}} in Boston with clients who were drug dealers, rapists, and other kinds of criminal offenders. [...] His work experiences opened his eyes to see the world in a broader, more open-minded way and provided material for the songs <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> write. [...] Early in his career Paul promised himself that he would always write about the things he knew well. In her review of Ellis Paul Live for the Folk and Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, [...] "His finely honed songs tell stories filled with images that sparkle like jewels. [...] His is a poet's heart, and a romantic's soul. [...] He is an optimist who believes in people and possibilities." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{still at}} Truth, Levin {{was invited to}} write a column in The Manchester Guardian about ITV, Britain's first {{commercial}} television channel, launched in 1955. Mooney describes his television reviews as [...] "notably punchy" [...] and The Times wrote, [...] "Levin took out his shotgun and let loose with both barrels". Levin gave the opening programmes a kindly review, but by the fourth day of commercial television <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> baulk: [...] "There has been nothing to get our teeth into apart from three [...] different brands of cake-mix and a patent doughnut". Thereafter, he did not spare the network: [...] "cliché succeeded to cliché"; [...] "a mentally defective aborigine who was deaf in both ears would have little difficulty in leaving 'Double Your Money' £32 richer than when he entered"; and after the network's first hundred days he attributed its viewing figures to the [...] "number {{of people who are}} sufficiently stupid to derive pleasure from such programmes".|$|E
500|$|For So Beautiful or So What, Simon {{reunited with}} record {{producer}} and former collaborator Phil Ramone, who previously {{worked with him}} on Simon & Garfunkel's 1982 live album The Concert in Central Park. According to Simon, the reunion came casually; he told Ramone when they met each other that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> work on a new album and, as Ramone lived in the next town, they {{decided it would be}} easy to work together again. Simon recorded the album at his small cottage in New Canaan, Connecticut. The recording sessions often consisted solely of Simon, Ramone, and engineer Andy Smith. Throughout the production of the record, the album’s engineers would gradually make upgrades to the space during months off. As it was not acoustically designed or soundproofed, Smith often employed iZotope RX software to rid the recordings of extra noise, such as an oak tree above the home from which acorns fell, interrupting recordings. Keeping in line with his experimental attitude, Simon decided to record the acorns, remarking, [...] "All sounds are musical once you start to listen." [...] Occasionally, Simon would record in the control room instead. Like all of Simon’s output from his 1997 effort Songs from The Capeman onward, the album was recorded digitally using Pro Tools.|$|E

500|$|In 1921 Wood {{was awarded}} the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first English {{conductor}} to receive the honour. By now <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> find his position as Britain's leading conductor under challenge from rising younger rivals. [...] Thomas Beecham had been an increasingly influential figure since about 1910. He and Wood did not like one another, and each avoided mention of the other in his memoirs. Adrian Boult, who, at Wood's recommendation, took over some of his responsibilities at Birmingham in 1923, always admired and respected Wood. Other younger conductors included {{men who had been}} members of Wood's orchestra, including Basil Cameron and Eugene Goossens. Another protégé of Wood was Malcolm Sargent, who appeared at the Proms as a composer-conductor in 1921 and 1922. Wood encouraged him to abandon thoughts of a career as a pianist and to concentrate on conducting. Wood further showed his interest in the future of music by taking on the conductorship of the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music in 1923, rehearsing it twice a week, whenever possible, for the next twenty years. In the same year, he accepted the conductorship of the amateur Hull Philharmonic Orchestra, travelling three times a year until 1939 to rehearse and conduct its concerts.|$|E
2500|$|That music which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> use for Ernani was {{transferred}} to La Sonnambula is not in doubt, and as Weinstein comments, [...] "he was as ready as most other composers of his era to reuse in a new situation musical passages created for a different, earlier one".|$|E

6000|$|Nor {{can it be}} denied. The {{evidence}} is with him. The previous centuries, and more notably the nineteenth, have marked {{the rise of the}} common man. From chattel slavery to serfdom, and from serfdom to what he bitterly terms [...] "wage slavery," [...] he has risen. Never <b>was</b> <b>he</b> so strong as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> today, and never so menacing. He does the work of the world, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> know it. The world cannot get along without him, and this also <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> know. All the human knowledge of the past, all the scientific discovery, governmental experiment, and invention of machinery, have tended to his advancement. His standard of living is higher. His common school education would shame princes ten centuries past. His civil and religious liberty makes him a free man, and his ballot the peer of his betters. And all this has tended to make him conscious, conscious of himself, conscious of his class. He looks about him and questions that ancient law of development. It is cruel and wrong, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> declare. It <b>is</b> an anachronism. Let it be abolished. Why should there be one empty belly in all the world, when the work of ten men can feed a hundred? What if my brother be not so strong as I? He has not sinned. Wherefore should he hunger--he and his sinless little ones? Away with the old law. There is food and shelter for all, therefore let all receive food and shelter.|$|R
