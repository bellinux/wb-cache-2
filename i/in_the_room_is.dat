5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> far {{older than the}} house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.|$|E
5|$|The sad elephant, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the elephant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>is</b> a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant {{for a short period}} of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.|$|E
25|$|The centre {{consists}} of a semicircular sandstone structure with tall windows attached {{to the north of}} the church and approached through the north door. On the walls are descriptive panels giving information about Charles Dodgson, Lewis Carroll, and other members of the family. Hanging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> the meeting bell that formerly called canal people to worship in the floating mission church at Preston Brook on the nearby Bridgewater Canal. The centre also serves as a meeting room for schools and other groups. The church and centre are open every day, and there is no admission charge.|$|E
5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and logic, a vacuous truth {{is a statement}} that asserts that {{all members of the}} empty set have a certain property. For example, the statement [...] "all cell phones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned off" [...] will be true whenever there are no cell phones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>In</b> this case, <b>the</b> statement [...] "all cell phones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on" [...] would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: [...] "all cell phones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on and turned off".|$|R

25|$|Very {{nearly as}} {{visually}} evocative are the scenes involving Astor, {{almost all of}} which suggest prison. In one scene she wears striped pajamas, the furniture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> striped, and the slivers of light coming through the Venetian blinds suggest cell bars, as do the bars on the elevator cage {{at the end of}} the film when she takes her slow ride downward with the police, apparently on her way to prison and possible execution. Huston and Edeson crafted each scene to make sure the images, action and dialog blended effectively, sometimes shooting closeups of characters with other cast members acting with them off camera.|$|E
25|$|The Frick Auditorium is {{a lecture}} hall in room 324 of the Cathedral of Learning. Originally {{conceptualized}} as the Fine Arts Lecture Room intended {{to complement the}} Fine Arts Department then located on the seventh floor, the room was completed in 1939 and features stone mullions, chambranle, and other trim as well as wooden lecture seating and a coffered ceiling. A centerpiece element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> a Nicholas Lochoff reproduction of The Resurrection by Piero della Francesca that was purchased for the lecture hall by Helen Clay Frick. Frick would later donate a large collection of Lochoff reproductions to the university which are {{on display in the}} Nicholas Lochoff Cloisture in the university's Frick Fine Arts Building.|$|E
25|$|Although Kent {{intended}} the First Lord {{to use this}} space as his study, it has rarely served that purpose; it has almost always been the Cabinet room. There {{have been a few}} exceptions. Stanley Baldwin used the Cabinet Room as his office. A few Prime Ministers, such as Tony Blair, occasionally worked at the Cabinet Room table. Painted off-white with large floor to ceiling windows along one of the long walls, the room is light and airy. Three brass chandeliers hang from the high ceiling. The Cabinet table, purchased during the Gladstone era, dominates the room. The modern boat-shaped top, introduced by Harold Macmillan in the late 1950s, is supported by huge original oak legs. The table is surrounded by carved, solid mahogany chairs that also date from the Gladstone era. The Prime Minister's chair, the only one with arms, is situated midway along one side in front of the marble fireplace, facing the windows; when not in use, it is positioned at an angle for easy access. The only picture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> a copy of a portrait of Sir Robert Walpole by Jean-Baptiste van Loo hanging over the fireplace. Each Cabinet member is allocated a chair based on order of seniority. Blotters inscribed with their titles mark their places.|$|E

500|$|To {{the east}} of the Portico Room is the Drawing Room. [...] This was {{designed}} by Carr as the dining room, and contains a white marble chimneypiece designed by Carr. [...] The plasterwork is again by Oliver. [...] The furniture and paintings are original to the house. [...] The paintings include one of John, 1stBaron Byron by William Dobson, one of his wife as SaintCatherine by Peter Lely, and two paintings by John Opie. [...] The most important painting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> Tabley, the Seat of SirJ.F.Leicester, Bart: Windy Day, by J.M.W.Turner. [...] Also in the room are two still life paintings by Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale, a cousin of the Leicesters.|$|E
500|$|The visual {{opens with}} Suzuki's name, {{and the title}} [...] "Free Free", {{superimposed}} on several LED lights. It follows with the singer standing in the room, but only dim-lit to show her figure {{in front of the}} lights. The first verse has the singer laying down on a large platform, covering a screen of LED lights, and sings to the camera. She dances and sings the track in the room—taken with long shot and face-up directions—whilst posing next to a couple of TV screens that features Nakata's face. As the chorus plays, the scene with her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> digitally manipulated, showcasing several overlapping techniques to show a blurry-like vision. She returns to lying on the ground during the bridge section, and the final chorus has her dancing in the room.|$|E
500|$|To {{the south}} of the Long Hall is the Dining Room, which is little changed since the Tudor era. [...] Its {{contents}} include a 16th-century refectory table, an oak escritoire from about 1650, and items of Wedgwood majolica ware made in about 1830. [...] The Dining Room leads to the small Guard Room, which contains two 17th-century chairs and an 18th-century blunderbuss. [...] To the west of this is the Drawing Room, the principal living room of the hall which has been little altered since the middle of the 16thcentury. [...] To {{the south of}} the Drawing Room is a small room known as the Gold Room. [...] This room has retained a frieze dating from the early 16thcentury, including carvings of Tudor roses, flowers and birds. [...] Also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> a bust of Charles Gerard. [...] In the southeast corner of the hall is the Green Room. [...] This contains a painting of Gawsworth Rectory by Charles Tattershall Dodd, and a complete set of a dinner service by Minton, comprising 120pieces.|$|E

500|$|The room to {{the north}} of the Drawing Room was {{originally}} the common parlour, and is now known as the Octagon Room. [...] It provided a link between the public rooms on the south of the house and the more private rooms on the north side. [...] Again designed by Carr, its canted corners contain china cabinets. It also contains a set of five paintings of Tabley by Anthony Devis. [...] The ceiling has Rococo plasterwork by Oliver. [...] This room leads to the Dining Room on the north side of the house, which contains paintings of the Leicester family. [...] These include 3rdLord Tabley by Frank Holl, Colonel Sir John Leicester, Bart., and the King's Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry exercising on the Sands at Liverpool by George Jones, Portrait of 2ndLorddeTabley by Margaret Carpenter, a full-length Portrait of 2nd Lord de Tabley as Colonel Commandant of the Earl of Chester's Yeomanry Cavalry by Francis Grant, Hilda, Mrs Cuthbert Leicester Warren by Simon Elwes, Lt. Colonel John Leicester Warren by Graham Rust, and Margaret Leicester Warren by Philip de László. [...] Also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> Extensive Picturesque Landscape, with Gypsies by Francis Bourgeois and, over the sideboard, is the Portrait of the Prince Regent, later George IV by Thomas Lawrence and his studio. [...] The fireplace in the Dining Room is made from Anglesey marble and was designed by George Bullock.|$|E
2500|$|As far as {{the person}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> concerned, the symbols are just {{meaningless}} [...] "squiggles." [...] But if the Chinese room really [...] "understands" [...] what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about intentionality, symbol grounding and syntax vs. semantics.|$|E
2500|$|Searle's reply is {{to suppose}} that, unbeknownst to the {{individual}} in the Chinese room, some of the inputs came directly from a camera mounted on a robot, {{and some of the}} outputs were used to manipulate the arms and legs of the robot. Nevertheless, the person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> still just following the rules, and does not know what the symbols mean. Searle writes [...] "he doesn't see what comes into the robot's eyes." [...] (See Mary's room for a similar thought experiment.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The two {{load bearing}} beams bear eight {{inscriptions}} from skeptic authors, mostly from Sextus Empiricus. The forty-six joists, distributed on three rows, are inscribed {{with a total}} of sixty-seven sayings taken in their majority from the Bible and from classic authors (including Horace, Lucretius, Menander, and Sophocles). Many of these are mentioned in the Essays, either verbatim, in translation, or in paraphrase. Alain Legros argues that the order in which Montaigne would have encountered the quotations while walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> perceptibly influential on the structure of some essays, notably the [...] "Apology for Raymond Sebond." [...] Later authors such as Grace Norton, Pierre Villey, Michel Butor and George Hoffmann have also discussed these quotations.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of the Japanese {{pavilion}} at the Venice Biennale in 1993, a dazzling mirrored room filled with small pumpkin sculptures in which she resided in color-coordinated magician's attire, Kusama went on to produce a huge, yellow pumpkin sculpture covered with an optical pattern of black spots. The pumpkin came to represent for her a kind of alter-ego or self-portrait. Kusama's later installation I'm Here, but Nothing (2000–2008) is a simply furnished room consisting of table and chairs, place settings and bottles, armchairs and rugs, however its walls are tattooed with hundreds of fluorescent polka dots glowing in the UV light. The result is an endless infinite space where the self and everything <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> obliterated.|$|E
2500|$|Behind the portico on {{the south}} {{front of the house}} is the Library. [...] The {{furniture}} in this room is practical rather than decorative, most of it again having been made by Gillows. [...] The bookcases date from 1811–12. [...] The pair of globes, terrestrial and celestial, were made by the Cary family. [...] On top of the bookcases are Dutch Delft vases and jars from the 17th–18th centuries. [...] The room contains over 8,000 books, many in their original covers and in mint condition. [...] The earliest book is dated 1513. [...] Some of the books are unbound and in their original paper covers, including first editions of two novels by Jane Austen. [...] Other than a portrait of Charles II, all the paintings in the library are portraits of members of the Egerton family. [...] To the west of the Library is the Dining Room. [...] This is a survival from the original house and is decorated in rococo style. [...] The white marble fireplace dates from 1840 and was designed by Richard Westmacott. [...] Most of the furniture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> made in mahogany by Gillows. [...] The paintings in the room are all portraits of the Egerton family.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 2004 <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} once more, {{this time}} {{as part of the}} general restoration of the entire building.

2500|$|Tobias {{has stayed}} up all night, and is making himself a morning cocktail. Agnes comes down from her room. [...] She tells Tobias that it is his role {{to make all the}} {{decisions}} with regards to what to do about Edna and Harry. She reminds Tobias of the time when he prevented her from getting pregnant after the death of their son. Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are there and what they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> drinking. Edna announces that Harry wants to talk to Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t think they would allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house, {{in spite of the fact}} that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” [...] Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that because they are friends, Harry and Edna have the right to be there. [...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} entrance {{was formerly}} through the porch {{on the south}} front, but its large doors caused too many draughts. In 1862 an entrance {{was created in the}} west front, leading to the West Hall, which contains panelling from the old house. [...] The West Hall in turn leads into the Library, which has one of Latham's most elaborate ceilings. The windows contain French stained glass, designed and made in Paris by M. Lusson. [...] The Library leads to the former Front Hall, which was transformed into the Dining Room when the original dining room was demolished in 1968. [...] In the Dining Room is a portrait of a noblemen, attributed to Cornelis Jonson. [...] The Gallery was the family's principal sitting-room during the 19th century. The overmantel of the fireplace contains sculptures depicting St George slaying the dragon and, on each side, personifications of Hope and Patience, with appropriate inscriptions. [...] The Drawing Room is in a different style from the other rooms on the ground floor, being plastered rather than panelled, and it contains much gilding. [...] The room is devoted to the memory of Rowland Egerton-Warburton and contains a number of family portraits. [...] Its coved ceiling, also designed by Latham, has a frieze depicting birds eating grapes. [...] The final room on the ground floor open to the public is the Small Dining Room. [...] It has a barrel-shaped ceiling, again designed by Latham. [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> a virginal dated 1675 by Stephen Keene, {{and is one of the}} oldest surviving English keyboard instruments. Its front is decorated with portraits of Charles II and Queen Catherine. [...] The Grand Staircase is considered to be Latham's finest work in the house. The staircase itself and the doorways are made of oak, and the decoration is in plasterwork and strapwork. Above the staircase is a glass-walled domed ceiling.|$|E
