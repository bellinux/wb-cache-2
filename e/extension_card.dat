40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{application}} of computer controlling and displaying {{system of the}} technological recycling process of both liquid and solid wastes from the tanning industry. The chrome tannery wastes are potentially dangerous to the environment. A proposal for chrome recycling technology, realization of the laboratory equipment and programming possibility are likewise presented. The idea of recycling technology lies in using reaction of non - environmentally friendly chrome liquid and solid wastes and creating new products that are not toxic {{and can be used}} in the other industrial applications. Described mathematical model for the recycling technology is based on the chemical - physical engineering description of a heterogeneous kinetics. The method of regressive analysis was used for determining of parameters for each kinetic equation from the experimental data. The proposed model was used for a simulation test and an optimum calculation in the connection with minimum procedural costs of recycling technology. The real process presentations are built with laboratory equipment for a closed recycling technology of real chrome liquid and solid wastes taken from the tanning company TAREX. The computer controlling and displaying system has two levels. The technological level is composed on a PC with the technological <b>extension</b> <b>card</b> Advantech PCL- 812 PG ensuring the direct control over the real process. The software for this level was created in the C language with the real time library RTMON.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} <b>extension</b> to JAVA <b>CARD</b> Dynamic Logic, a program logic for {{reasoning}} about JAVA CARD programs, to handle JAVA CARD’s so-called non-atomic methods. Although JAVA CARD DL already supports the atomic transaction mechanism of JAVA CARD, non-atomic methods present an additional challenge: state updates triggered {{by such a}} non-atomic method are not subjected to any transaction that may possibly be in progress. The semantics of a non-atomic method itself seems to be simple and straightforward to formalise, however experimental studies showed that non-atomic methods affect the whole semantics of the JAVA CARD transaction mechanism in a subtle way, in particular, it affects {{the notion of a}} transaction roll-back. In this paper we show how to adapt JAVA CARD DL to accommodate this newly discovered complex transaction behaviour. The extension completes the formalisation of all of JAVA CARD in Dynamic Logic. ...|$|R
5000|$|On Microsoft Windows, {{it appears}} that the timing of {{commands}} to hardware is not exact. Empirical data suggest that Windows (using the Windows sleep timer which accepts millisecond sleep times) will schedule on a 1024 Hz clock and will delay 24 of 1024 transitions per second to make an average of 1000 Hz for the update rate. This can have serious ramifications for discrete-time algorithms that rely on fairly consistent timing between updates such as those found in control theory. The sleep function or similar windows API were at no point designed for accurate timing purposes. Certain multimedia-oriented API routines like [...] and its siblings provide better timing consistency. However, consumer- and server-grade Windows ( [...] those based on NT kernel) were not to be real-time operating systems. Drastically more accurate timings could be achieved by using dedicated hardware <b>extensions</b> and control-loop <b>cards.</b>|$|R

40|$|The Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) is {{developing}} a model to examine land use changes and their associated environmental and economic implications for the Southeast region of the United States. The model will be built {{as if there were}} two regions in the U. S. One region is the Southeast with the other region containing the remainder of the 48 contiguous states. The driving force within the model will be assumed levels of demand for, or prices of, various agricultural and silvicultural products on a market region and national level. The CARD southeast model will be a cost minimization linear program. It will allocate the land resources of the nation to alternative uses to produce the specified levels of crop, forest, and pasture/range products. The model will also incorporate constraints such as allowable erosion levels, regional shifts in production, and levels of government policy variables. The basic hypothesis of this research is that future change sin national, including exports, and regional demand levels will cause substantial acreages of land in the Southeast to be converted to an alternative use. Such conversions could also occur as a result of government policy decisions. The land use conversions {{to be included in the}} Southeast are all directions between forest, crop, orchard, idle and pasture or range, and dryland to irrigated. In the remainder of the nation allowable conversions will be forest and pasture to crop and dryland to irrigated. The model will be an <b>extension</b> of current <b>CARD</b> national models by including for the Southeast the land conversions noted above. Also the crops of apples, citrus, peaches, pecans, sweet-corn, tomatoes, tobacco, sugarcane, rye, rice, and sweet and Irish potatoes will be included in the endogenous rather than exogenous crop sector for selected states as shown in Appendix 1.

40|$|Village {{extension}} {{has been}} pursuant to Article 2 of 2005 No. 73 Government Regulation and 2000 No. 129 Government Regulation. Both mention about village establishment including the compilation of several villages or the nearby parts of village, or the extension from one village into {{two or more}} villages. The formation, extension, elimination and compilation should be aimed at improving public welfare because these consider the improvement to public service, the acceleration of local economic development implementation, the acceleration of area management, the improvement of security and orderliness, and the improvement of compatible relationship between central and local. This phenomenon produces the author’s interest to reveal this condit ion in research titled with Rural Area Extension Process based on 2003 No. 4 Local Regulation of Banjarbaru City. Research aims to examine the process of extension {{and its impact on}} Guntung Payung Village (host village) and Guntung Manggis (village as extension result) after extension, related to this public service. Research locates at Guntung Payung and Guntung Manggis Villages. Research sample includes 3 persons, Sub-Division Head of Banjarbaru City Development and Agrarian, Chief of Guntung Payung Village and Chief of Guntung Manggis Village. Data collection method involves primary and secondary data. Data analysis technique concerns with qualitative measure. Results of research indicate that Guntung Payung Village extends into Guntung Payung Village and Guntung Manggis Village pursuant to 2000 No. 129 Local Regulation in considering administrative fundamental and technical requirement of an extension. Socialization takes 2 or 3 months before the extension and involves all public components in addition to public representation, leader of neighborhood association, and religious figure of Guntung Payung. Socialization involves a meeting to invite all related representative figures of Guntung Payung. The realization of new area extension seems ended in 2004 and it relates to technical and administrative requirements. The idealist of area extension for Guntung Payung Village will be the government of Banjarbaru City, executive or legislative in Sub-Division of Area Development and Agrarian, Chief of Guntung Manggis Village, Chief of Guntung Payung Village, public figure and religious figure. The implementation of area extension complies with 2004 No. 32 Act, and Banjarbaru’s Article 3 of 2003 No. 4 Local Regulation. Name establishment involves some public figures instead of the community. The selection and establishment for Guntung Manggis name consider the history and the location in south of Jalan Ahmad Yani, previously recognized as Guntung Manggis. The impact on Guntung Payung Village ensures the facilitation for administration in which public service seems optimized because the community don’t have to wait too long in the bureaucracy of local government and don’t have to go distant. Administration process gets faster to complete. Public access to government’s public service gets closer and indeed, benefits the community. Government’s public management of development becomes more effective because of the narrower management scope and more optimized governmental program plan to realize. The negative impact emphasizes on the old village in which the employment volume decreases. The yet updated data on <b>extension,</b> ID <b>Card,</b> Post Code, etc, just make it worse...|$|R
