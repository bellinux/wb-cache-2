The influence of urban areas around and adjacent to commercial centers were studied for the province of Gorgan.

5000|$|In forestry, <b>high</b> <b>grading</b> is a {{selective}} type of timber harvesting that removes the <b>highest</b> <b>grade</b> of timber (i.e. the most merchantable stems [...] ) {{in an area}} of forest. The stunted, slow growing or poorly formed trees that are left as residuals will, if ecological conditions permit, reseed the space that has been created.

50|$|Lister {{soon came}} to {{understand}} {{the urgent need for}} growing exotic timbers which would reduce the pressure on indigenous species, and started by establishing at Worcester in 1876 a plantation of fast-growing Eucalypts to supply fuel for the railways. De Beers bought the Worcester plantation in 1892, and this sale resulted in a profit of some ₤60/acre, stimulating a wave of afforestation. Lister also planted the Tokai Arboretum against the slopes of Constantiaberg outside Cape Town in 1885 - an experimental stand of some 1555 trees representing 274 species of commercially promising trees including oaks, eucalypts and Californian Redwood. Between 1902 and 1903 he organised Forest Departments for Zululand and Natal, and for the Orange River Colony. In 1906 he established the South African Forestry School at Tokai in order to train men for the <b>higher</b> <b>grades</b> of <b>forest</b> service, and in 1912 the School started training foresters. Twenty years later in 1932 the training of foresters was moved to Saasveld Forestry College near George and was known as the 'Saasveld College for Foresters'. In 1910 Lister became the first Chief Conservator of Forests for the newly constituted Union of South Africa.|$|R

40|$|Estimation of <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> {{parameters}} such as aboveground biomass in a {{large area}} using remotely sensed data has considerable significance for sustainable management and utility of natural resources. In practice, selecting suitable image data for such purposes remains difficult due to a poor understanding of <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> parameters and remote-sensing spectral response relationships, particularly in moist tropical regions. This paper explores relationships between <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> parameters and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral responses through analyses of three study areas in the eastern Amazon basin (Altamira, Bragantina, and Ponta de Pedras). Six TM bands and many vegetation indices are examined through integration of spectral responses and field vegetation inventory data. Pearson’s correlation coefficients are used to interpret relationships between <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> parameters and TM data. This study concludes that single band TM 5 and linear transformed indices such as PC 1 (the first component in a principal component analysis), KT 1 (brightness of the tasseled cap transform), and albedo are most strongly correlated with <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> parameters, somewhat independent of biophysical environments. Many vegetation indices that use TM 4 and TM 3 data, such as the atmospherically resistant vegetation index, the atmospheric and soil vegetation index, and the normalized difference vegetation index, are weakly correlated with selected <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> parameters.

Scanning {{was carried out in}} the Rožnava Forest enterprise zone, Slovakia, with a mean laser point density of 1 point per 3 m 2. Data were processed in SCOP++ using the hierarchic robust filtering technique. Two DTMs were created from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and contour data and one DSM was created using ALS data. For <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> height, two normalised DSMs (nDSMs) were created by subtraction of the DSM and DTM. The <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> heights derived from these nDSMs and the application of maximum and mean zonal functions were compared with those contained in the current Forest Management Plan (FMP). The <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> heights derived from these data and the application of maxima and mean zonal functions were compared with those contained in the current Forest management plan. The use of the mean function and the contour-derived DTM resulted in <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> height being underestimated by approximately 3 % for stands of densities 0. 9 and 1. 0, and overestimated by 6 % for a stand density of 0. 8. Overestimation was significantly greater for lower <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> densities: 81 % for a stand density of 0. 0 and 37 % for a density of 0. 4, with other discrepancies ranging between 15 and 30 %. Although low point density ALS should be used carefully in the determination of other <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> parameters, this low-cost method makes it useful as a control tool for felling, measurement of disaster areas and the detection of gross errors in the FMP data.

40|$|A mixed {{tree species}} {{composition}} is frequently proposed {{as a way}} to increase habitat heterogeneity and support greater biodiversity in commercial forests. However, although international forest policy is increasingly advocating stands of mixed tree species, there is evidence to question the biodiversity benefits conferred by such forests. Using active ground-dwelling spiders and carabid beetles as biodiversity indicator taxa, we investigated the effect of <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> composition on spider and carabid beetle community structure and composition. We conducted pitfall trapping in the summer of 2011 in 42 plantation <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> across three different geographical regions in the UK and Ireland. Three common plantation <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> types were examined: oak monocultures, Scots pine monocultures, and intimate Scots pine and oak mixtures (oak ⩽ 60 % cover). <b>Forest</b> <b>stand</b> type had a weak effect on spider and beetle species richness, with no significant differences in mixed stands compared with monocultures. There were few differences in species composition between the stand types in each region and indicator species analysis found few species specifically affiliated with any of the <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> types. Land use history is hypothesised to have contributed, at least in part, to the observed important regional differences in spider and beetle assemblages.

Studying natural forest thinning, we describe the consecutive stages of modeling: selection of the appropriate parametric model, parameter estimation and generation of point patterns in accordance with the selected model, the selection of statistical functions to describe the horizontal structure of <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> and testing of statistical hypotheses. We show the possibilities of a specialized software package, spatstat, which is designed to meet the challenges of spatial statistics and provides software support for modern methods of analysis of spatial data.

In territory Habrůvka, forest district Borky, were created gaps in following <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> types: beech (BK), mixed (MIX) and spruce (SM). Measurement {{took place on}} area of size 0, 04 ha called small (S) and large (B) with size 0, 1 ha. With concentration on locations: centre (C), mature stand (P), border east (T/E) and border west (T/W). It was measured moisture in all big gap locations (B). Continuous measurement was under way during all the year. From the obtained data was evaluated soil moisture and then compared with soil hydrolimits: wilting point (BV), point of decreased availability (BSD), point of decreased availability of water (LB) and capillary maximum capacity (MKK). Altogether, {{it was found that}} location centre (C) contains the highest soil moisture value. This thesis is focused on evaluation of NO 3 -, NH 4 +, C/N, Cox and mineral nitrogen. It was found out that spruce <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> type (SM) has the highest concentration of NO 3 -, NH 4 +, C/N, Cox and mineral nitrogen. On the contrast, it has the lowest C/N ratio. <b>Forest</b> <b>stand</b> type beech (BK) had the lowest NO 3 - value, C/N ratio and Cox. When evaluating of location, it was found that mixed forest type (MIX) and beech forest type (BK) are observed values higher on location centre (C). Spruce <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> type (SM) had no as accurate values as those previous ones. In comparison between the big gap (B) and the small gap (S), there was found lower C/N ratio in the small gaps (S). Cox values were balanced.

40|$|Invasive species pose {{a threat}} to aquatic and {{terrestrial}} ecosystems by decreasing biodiversity (Didham et al. 2005). Amur bush honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) has typically reduced native plant diversity and altered animal communities by influencing animal abundance and activity (Collier and Vankat 2002). This study was intended to determine whether honeysuckle density or other characteristics of <b>forested</b> <b>stands</b> influence avian diversity, whether impacts are seasonally dependent, and whether correlations exist between attributes of <b>forested</b> <b>stands</b> and honeysuckle density. In order to test the hypotheses, thirteen <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> within the Louisville Metropolitan Area were selected.

The availability and use of cavities were examined on Tony Houseman State Park and Wildlife Management Area at Blue Elbow Swamp (HWMA), Orange County, Texas, during 1999. Random 0. 25 -ha plots were used to inventory cavities by size and estimate cavity use by vertebrates. Tree species, number of cavities by entrance size, stems per ha, basal area, and total cavities were recorded in 23, 15, and 15 plots in the cypress-tupelo (Taxodium distichum-Nyssa aquatica), mixed hardwood, and pine-oak (Pinus spp. -Quercus spp.) <b>forest</b> <b>stands,</b> respectively. Cavities with entrance dimensions suitable for entry by wood ducks (Aix sponsa) were inspected for suitability as wood duck nesting sites. Total cavity densities were similar between <b>forest</b> <b>stands,</b> but cypress-tupelo contained significantly (P = 0. 000) more large-size cavities and mixed hardwoods produced the greatest density of small cavities. Tree species important for cavity production varied by <b>forest</b> <b>stand.</b> Regardless of species or stand, larger diameter and dead trees provided cavities in greater proportions than their availability in <b>forest</b> <b>stands.</b> Suitable wood duck nesting cavities were found at densities (0. 0 - 26. 7 cavities/ 100 ha) comparable to other <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> at similar latitudes. Wood ducks were captured using grain-baited, swim-in traps. Backpack (n = 13) and implant (n = 20) radio-transmitters were attached to wood duck hens in 1999 and 2000, respectively. A combined total of 404 hen locations was obtained over 1, 352 days. No active nests were located at HWMA during this study and hens used <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> differently between years.

40|$|Since two decades, {{the use of}} {{terrestrial}} laser scanning (TLS) and Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) has become very prominent in analysing 3 D forest structures (AKAY et al. 2009). The potential of full waveform analysis of high density Airborne LiDAR data (ALS) for the detection and structural analysis of multi-layered <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> is not yet well investigated (JASKIERNIAK et al. 2011), although ALS data provide exact information on tree heights of multi-layered <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> using particular laser pulse characteristics (GAULTON & MALTHUS 2010). Since the mid- 19 th century, managed forests in Brandenburg have been dominated by Scots pine monocultures. In the last fifteen to twenty years many <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> were converted into multi-layered mixed forests by silvicultural conversion of forests and natural succession (MLUR 2004). Today, the majority of <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> in the federal state of Brandenburg remain dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in the canopy layer, while European beech (Fagus sylvatica) or Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) are predominant in the understorey. In this study, we investigate and discuss the potential of full waveform high density airborne LiDAR data (ALS) for detecting, classifying, and stratifying discrete vegetation layers at <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> level, based on 0. 1 ha investigation plots. Full waveform high density ALS data on each 5 th percentile level was used in combination with binary logistic regressions to discover the structural layer type of multi-layered <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> from normalized discrete ALS pulses. The results of the descriptive statistics of ALS point clouds and binary logistic regression models produce particular forest layer profile indices of understorey vegetation and canopy layer. Such parameters can further be used as variables for forest structure analysis algorithms, and can be empirically tested against stand characteristics. The validation of ALS data and model results is tested against empirical forest mensuration data of the “Datenspeicher Wald 2 (DSW 2 -Forest inventory data) ” and field survey reference points using error matrices. We demonstrate that binary logistic regression analyses are functional for establishing a prediction model. The model was applied successfully on larger <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> and <b>forest</b> areas, and can become useful for identifying and separating single from multi-layered <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> using percentiles of total amounts of ALS return pulses on a 10 x 10 m raster size with a high overall accuracy of 90 %.
