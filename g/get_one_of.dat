5|$|On 21 May 1809, Napoleon {{crossed the}} Danube {{not far from}} Vienna and {{attacked}} Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would have a hard time just holding out. Nansouty could only <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne charging, as they had done all day long, in a desperate attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.|$|E
5|$|Prior to his marriage, Cooper had {{a series}} of romantic {{relationships}} with leading actresses, beginning in 1927 with Clara Bow, who advanced his career by helping him <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his first leading roles in Children of Divorce. Bow was also responsible for getting Cooper a role in Wings, which generated an enormous amount of fan mail for the young actor. In 1928, he had a relationship with another experienced actress, Evelyn Brent, whom he met while filming Beau Sabreur. In 1929, while filming The Wolf Song, Cooper began an intense affair with Lupe Vélez, which was the most important romance of his early life. During their two years together, Cooper also had brief affairs with Marlene Dietrich while filming Morocco in 1930 and with Carole Lombard while making I Take This Woman in 1931. During his year abroad in 1931–32, Cooper had an affair with the married Countess Dorothy di Frasso, while staying at her Villa Madama in Rome.|$|E

'If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, but we will <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> our own. We have no other choice'. 'In October 1965, Bhutto visited Vienna to attend the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting. While there, he met with Munir Ahmad Khan, and other Pakistani scientists working at IAEA. Pakistani IAEA scientists briefed Bhutto on the rapid development of Indian nuclear programme. According to Munir Ahmad Khan, the nuclear facility at Trombay consisted of a plutonium production reactor, a reprocessing plant, and other facilities associated to weapon production. Bhutto quickly arranged a meeting with Ayub Khan. After this meeting, Ayub Khan remained unconvinced, and rejected the proposal made by Munir Ahmad Khan.

25|$|A {{campaign}} {{by the local}} newspaper, the Blackpool Gazette in 2006 to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the illuminated trams, The Western Train, back on track, resulted in a £278,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to restore the two tramcars in the Western Train set which first ran in 1962. They had been withdrawn in 1999 and stood derelict at Rigby Road depot. The tramcars returned to service during the 2009 Illuminations Switch-On. In January 2008 {{it was revealed that}} another iconic illuminated tram, the Rocket, which had been in service between 1961 and 1999 but which had since then stood idle, was also due to be restored for the Illuminations in 2012 {{at a cost of about}} £150,000 and with the help of a newly created Friends of the Illuminations group. The full restoration did not occur but it was cosmetically restored in 2012 and used as a static display as part of the Illuminations for 2012 and 2013. The Frigate was rebuilt in 2004 and the Trawler was created from Brush car 633 in 2001.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in Ties That Bind, as in the original game, concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations often involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will hear the voice of Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will hear the voice of Blackmore, the game's antagonist, urging him to kill them. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three endings based on Torque's final morality level. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act, and Blackmore, who will praise him if he does something evil. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both his own physical appearance (he will begin to look less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality. If the photo is dirty, crumpled and covered in blood, his morality is moving towards evil. There is also a morality gauge in the menu, which shows exactly where Torque's morality is currently positioned.|$|E
25|$|An NBA interstate rivalry, both in Texas {{linked by}} I-45, {{as well as}} both Dallas and Houston fans {{traditionally}} having a disdain for each other's city, the rivalry started when the Mavericks were the last Texas team to join the NBA. This {{is also known as}} the I-45 rivalry because they both lie on Interstate 45. In the Mavs' inaugural season in 1980–81, the Rockets won all six meetings including a 116-68 blowout win. In the playoffs, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets in the 1988, and 2005 playoffs, the latter of which was plagued with allegations of game fixing. and the Rockets swept several season series with the Mavericks during the 1990s during the Rockets' championship years. On April 11, 1995 the Mavericks were able to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their most superb victories against the Houston reigning champion for 156–147 scoring 23 points in the first overtime. Two years later, the Rockets and Mavericks have clashed in their first ever regular season's game played in Mexico City and won by the Rockets 108–106. In recent years the rivalry has once again flourished with Dallas owner Mark Cuban and Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey taking shots at each other on social media, as well as Houston fan favorite Chandler Parsons signing an offer sheet to leave the Rockets to sign with the rival Mavericks for $46M, while making negative statements about the city of Houston upon leaving, causing massive backlash among Rockets fans. Finally, longtime Mavericks' player Jason Terry, who was a starter on the Mavs' 2011 championship team, joined the Rockets for the 2015 season, and both teams met {{in the first round of}} the 2015 NBA Playoffs, with the Rockets as the 2nd seed and Mavericks the 7th seed, and the Rockets got the best of them 4-1.|$|E

25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in The Suffering concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will hear the voice of Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will hear the voice of a demon urging him to kill them. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act and chastise him if he does something evil. Often, when Torque saves an NPC, they fight alongside him for a time. However, not every choice presents the player with all three possibilities. For example, when Torque finds the controls to the electric chair, he can turn the chair on to torture an inmate strapped to it (bad morality), or simply ignore the controls (neutral morality). There is no good morality choice available here. Another example is when Torque finds a guard who has had his limbs removed and is slowly dying. He can kill the man to relieve him of his misery (good morality), or ignore him (neutral morality). Here, there is no bad morality choice. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three endings based on Torque's final morality level.

500|$|That same year, Cooper {{made two}} films with {{director}} and good friend Howard Hawks. In the biographical film Sergeant York, Cooper portrays war hero Alvin C. York, {{one of the}} most decorated American soldiers in World War I. The film chronicles York's early backwoods days in Tennessee, his religious conversion and subsequent piety, his stand as a conscientious objector, and finally his heroic actions at the Battle of the Argonne Forest, which earned him the Medal of Honor. Initially, Cooper was nervous and uncertain about playing a living hero, so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his home, and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered they had much in common. Inspired by York's encouragement, Cooper delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune called [...] "one of extraordinary conviction and versatility", and that Archer Winston of the New York Post called [...] "one of his best". After the film's release, Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the Veterans of Foreign Wars for his [...] "powerful contribution to the promotion of patriotism and loyalty". York admired Cooper's performance and helped promote the film for Warner Bros. Sergeant York became the top-grossing film of the year and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards. Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend James Stewart, Cooper said, [...] "It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award. Shucks, I've been in the business sixteen years and sometimes dreamed I might <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these. That's all I can say ... Funny when I was dreaming I always made a better speech." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{stopover}} in Bombay, India, {{during the}} band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies {{to write the}} song [...] "See My Friends", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of crossover music, {{and one of the}} first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written [...] "See My Friends" [...] with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was [...] "extremely influential" [...] on Davies' musical peers: [...] "And while much has been made of the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." [...] In a widely quoted statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: [...] "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.|$|E
500|$|Roger Newcomb and Matt Richenthal, {{writing for}} {{websites}} We Love Soaps and TV Fanatic respectively, both described {{the decision to}} replace Russ with Nichols as surprising.

Gwen Morrett of About.com said that Nichols joining The Young and the Restless was [...] "truly their gain" [...] from Days of Our Lives (where the actor had previously portrayed Steve Johnson). Upon Nichols' debut, Megan Lynn of SoapNet wrote: [...] "Stephen certainly has soap experience — he's previously played Steve Johnson on Days of our Lives and Stefan Cassadine on General Hospital, but then again — we were kind of warming up to William." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps wrote of the decision to hire Nichols onto the series: [...] "This week, daytime fans <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their wishes, to see Stephen Nichols back on daytime. From his role as Stefan on GH to Patch on DAYS, you know that Stephen Nichols is going to play Tucker for all he is worth, and then some." [...] In August 2010, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News wrote of Nichols' portrayal, saying: [...] "Now going into the 21st century, Stephen has reinvented another part of himself and inhabits Genoa City as the town’s newest and most handsome billionaire on CBS’s number-one daytime drama The Young and the Restless." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a three-year}} hiatus, in 1999 he paired with Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, which {{was brought to}} theatres by {{much of the same}} team that was {{responsible}} for Four Weddings and a Funeral. This new Working Title production displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363million worldwide. As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, [...] "Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds." [...] Reactions to Grant's Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, [...] "Grant's performance stands as an emblem of what's wrong with Notting Hill. What's maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap. He's become one of those actors who's all shambling self-caricature, from his twinkly crow's feet to the time-lapsed half century it takes him to actually <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his lines out." [...] The film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety, most noted of which was Grant's turn as a faux-journalist who sits through a dull press junket with, what the New York Times called, [...] "a delightfully funny deadpan." [...] Grant also released his second production output, a fish-out-of-water mob comedy Mickey Blue Eyes, that year. It was dismissed by critics, performed modestly at the box office, and garnered its actor-producer mixed reviews for his starring role. Roger Ebert thought, [...] "Hugh Grant is wrong for the role [...] strikes one wrong note and then another," [...] whereas Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said, [...] "If he'd been on the Titanic, fewer lives would have been lost. If he'd accompanied Robert Scott to the South Pole, the explorer would have lived to be 100. That's how good Hugh Grant is at rescuing doomed ventures." ...|$|E
