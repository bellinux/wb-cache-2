2500|$|In the episode's {{emotional}} last moments, Jeff {{has returned}} to the Miller farmhouse and waits anxiously on the doorstep with his mother and grandfather for Lassie to join him. [...] Lassie remains at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> gazing down the road as if contemplating a return to her old home. [...] Then she turns and bounds happily to Jeff. [...] "She's mine now, isn't she, Gramps?" [...] Jeff cries joyously to his grandfather. [...] "Yes, she's all yours," [...] Gramps replies, [...] "She done her deciding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Entering the 1973 season, Stewart {{had decided}} to retire. He {{nevertheless}} won at South Africa, Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands, and Austria. His last and then record-setting 27th victory came at the Nürburgring with a 1–2 for Tyrrell. [...] "Nothing gave me more satisfaction than to win at the Nürburgring and yet, I was always afraid." [...] Stewart later said. [...] "When I left home for the German Grand Prix I always used to pause at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and take a long look back. I was never sure I'd come home again." [...] After the fatal crash of his teammate François Cevert in practice for the 1973 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Stewart retired one race earlier than intended and missed {{what would have been}} his 100th Grand Prix. Stewart had already won the Drivers' Championship at the Italian Grand Prix two races previously; this was a race where Stewart had to come into the pits to change a flat tyre, and he drove from 20th to finish 4th.|$|E

50|$|There is a Grade II listed {{dovecote}} {{built in}} the 18th century and still standing in <b>the</b> grounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall. The dovecote was originally sited as the main focus at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grand entrance <b>driveway.</b>|$|R
50|$|The site is {{accessed}} via Parker Avenue {{which runs}} alongside the show reserve from the Ipswich Boonah Road. <b>The</b> planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site {{is divided into}} distinct male and female areas separated by administration/recreation/service area which is sited at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrance <b>driveway.</b> A feature is the radial planning which facilitated development on the ridge line and allowed buildings to be positioned {{to provide the best}} views for patients. Roadways follow this radial planning.|$|R
2500|$|Zoe Nelson was a seventeen-year-old {{motor vehicle}} repair student at Motherwell College, {{who lived with}} her mother, {{stepfather}} and younger sister at Crindledyke Crescent, Newmains, on {{the eastern edge of}} Wishaw. Both Nelson and her 16-year-old sister Laura Anne were involved in relationships with the same man, 20-year-old Robert [...] "Rab" [...] Bayne, who lived with his grandparents in Harper Crescent, Cambusnethan, although the elder sister was also dating another local man, Ross Hemphill. Marieann Nelson, the girls' mother, described how the sisters had argued about Bayne outside the family home at around 5pm on 22 May. She said: [...] "Laura Anne ran out and flicked Zoe's hair and tried to slap her face {{and the two of them}} ended up having a fight at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> I split it up. I said 'Go away you cow and don't come back'. She said she wouldn't come back." [...] Isobel Park, Nelson's stepsister, said Zoe and Bayne seemed [...] "a bit intoxicated" [...] and that Laura Anne had been upset as [...] "she was supposed to be seeing Rab as well." [...] Zoe walked off with Bayne, who was drinking from a bottle of tequila, and was not seen alive by her family again. At 5pm on 24 May, after police had announced the discovery of a body, Mrs. Nelson reported her daughter as a missing person.|$|E

50|$|The only pre WWII {{outbuilding}} is a {{small timber}} building to <b>the</b> south-west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brick cottage, adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> <b>The</b> function <b>of</b> this building, which is in poor condition is unknown. A second building, an interwar dwelling (fibro house/pavilion) identified in 2004, was demolished in c. 2005 and replaced on the same site by dwelling now at <b>the</b> west <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrance <b>driveway</b> on <b>the</b> south side. Other buildings are corrugated iron-clad sheds and a brick building, all dated from the post WWII period.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> short section <b>of</b> {{woodland}} on <b>the</b> right beyond Castleton {{heading towards}} Stewarton {{is known as}} Peter's Brae or Peter's Planting on the 1779 estate map and the 1858 OS. <b>The</b> identity <b>of</b> Peter is unknown. Just beyond this point is an entrance gate with sandstone gateposts and a short wall either side, which was <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>driveway</b> down from Lochridge House. Later it branched off next to Peacockbank (previously Pearcebank) Farm from {{what is now the}} main road, but which didn't exist. One branch went to Stewarton and the other to the Irvine road. <b>The</b> OS map <b>of</b> 1911 clearly shows the routes taken and the 1779 map shows only the old entrance onto the Irvine road.|$|R

5000|$|J.R. {{initially}} drove a green 1978 280SE Mercedes-Benz, later {{replaced by}} a 1979 Reseda Green Mercedes Benz 450SEL. In 1981, he drove the [...] "new" [...] W126 380SEL, also in Reseda Green. In 1983 when his wife Sue Ellen wrecked the car at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southfork <b>driveway,</b> J.R. replaced it with another 1983 Mercedes Benz 380SEL. In 1984, Mercedes-Benz changed the flagship S-Class model to the 500SEL, J.R. then replaced the 380 with one of these. Finally, J.R. drove a facelifted W126 560SEL beginning the 1986 season. J.R. also occasionally drove a Cadillac Allanté convertible from 1987-91. In [...] "J.R. Returns", J.R. drives the 500SEL yet again for <b>the</b> first portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film. However, this vehicle is totaled and replaced with an updated silver 1996 Mercedes-Benz W140 S420 sedan. In [...] "War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ewings", J.R. is driving a silver 1998 SL500 Roadster. All of J.R.'s vehicles had the personalized license plate [...] "EWING 3".|$|R

50|$|The {{electric}} overhead {{garage door}} opener was invented by C.G. Johnson in 1926 in Hartford City, Indiana. Electric Garage Door openers did not become popular until Era Meter Company of Chicago offered one after World War II where the {{overhead garage door}} could be opened via a key pad located on a post at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> or a switch inside the garage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{steel door}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> giving access to the back yard, was locked.

[...] she told De Oliveira, who {{instructed}} her not to worry; he would sort the matter out.|$|E

5000|$|The area became {{something}} of a German tourist attraction during the mid-1930s. [...] Visitors gathered at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> or on nearby public paths {{in the hope of}} catching a glimpse of Hitler. This led to the introduction of severe restrictions on access to the area and other security measures. A large contingent of the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler were housed in barracks adjacent to the Berghof. Under the command of Obersturmbannführer Bernhard Frank, they patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone that encompassed the nearby homes of the other Nazi leaders. With the outbreak of war extensive anti-aircraft defences were also installed, including smoke generating machines to conceal the Berghof complex from hostile aircraft.|$|E
