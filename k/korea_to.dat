5|$|After the {{location}} filming, production {{went back to}} soundstages for interiors. Some scenes were shot against a green screen background for second unit footage of other locations to be substituted, allowing the use of crane shots. With the photography done, Moore took the film to South <b>Korea</b> <b>to</b> edit to prevent Disney from finding out; he also refused to tell most of his close friends what he was doing. Visual effects were done by the same company there that had done them for the 2006 South Korean monster film, The Host.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from <b>Korea</b> <b>to</b> Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age, but, like the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1951 the Korean War {{had entered}} {{a period of}} {{relative}} stalemate. With the resignation of Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in June 1952, General Matthew Ridgway of the United Nations Command was transferred from <b>Korea</b> <b>to</b> Europe as Eisenhower's replacement.

5|$|In 1950, the Korean War broke out, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to <b>Korea</b> <b>to</b> support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization Missouri was called up from the Atlantic Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces on the Korean peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In January 1952, the 24th Infantry Division, which {{suffered}} over 10,000 {{casualties in}} 18 months of fighting, was redesignated as the Far East Theater reserve {{and pulled out}} of Korea. It returned to Japan to rebuild. The 34th Infantry Regiment was reconstituted, and the division returned to full strength during the next year, having been replaced in Korea by the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard. In July 1953, the division returned to <b>Korea</b> <b>to</b> restore order in prisoner of war camps. It arrived {{two weeks before the}} end of the war.|$|E

5|$|A new bow type, {{in which}} bone {{reinforcements}} cover {{the handle of}} the bow as well as the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal. Fittings from this type of bow appear right across Asia from <b>Korea</b> <b>to</b> the Crimea. Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, {{at the mouth of the}} Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.|$|E

After the war he held a number of staff {{positions}} in New Zealand and abroad. He saw active service during the Second World War as part of the 2nd New Zealand Division. He was made a prisoner of war in August 1944 and spent most of the final months of the war in captivity in Germany. After the war he commanded J Force while it was engaged in occupation duties in Japan. While Chief of General Staff, he oversaw the deployment of New Zealand's military personnel to <b>Korea</b> <b>to</b> assist the United Nations during the Korean War. He retired from the military in 1954 and died in Kawakawa, in 1972.|$|E
5|$|By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a {{comprehensive}} rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought {{to cut the}} flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North <b>Korea</b> <b>to</b> the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On July 28 the Far East Air Forces gave a list of targets in the rail interdiction program to the Bomber Command, and two days later a similar plan was ready for interdiction of highways. On August 3, the FEAF issued lists of targets for coordinated interdiction attacks south of the 38th Parallel to the Fifth Air Force and to the Navy. In general, the Han River divided the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomber Command zones.|$|E
