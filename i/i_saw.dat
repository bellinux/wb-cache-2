5|$|I {{called to}} him to turn hard opposite, so I could {{sandwich}} the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{the whole thing and}} ordered him to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E
5|$|First thing, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{these guys}} as scientifically {{accomplished}} but ethically, morons. They {{never had any}} reasons before to have ethical questions. So when they're hit with this device they're blindsided by it. The first thing they do is make money with it. They're {{not talking about the}} ethics of altering your former self.|$|E

60|$|Halifax was {{too small}} for us. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> such an {{audience}} though. They were really worth reading to for nothing, though I didn't do exactly that. It is as horrible a place as <b>I</b> ever <b>saw,</b> <b>I</b> think.|$|R
5|$|I {{came to the}} {{boundary}} of death and, having trodden {{on the threshold of}} Proserpina, I travelled through all the elements and returned. In {{the middle of the night}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the sun flashing with bright light, I came face to face with the gods below and the gods above and paid reverence to them from close at hand.|$|E

5|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> great {{changes in}} the use of cavalry. The mode of warfare changed, and the use of trench warfare, barbed wire and machine guns {{rendered}} traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Tanks, introduced in 1917, began to take over the role of shock combat.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{was soon}} transported to Tenedos, {{and then to}} Samothrace. He was {{ultimately}} killed while attempting to escape the island. The exact date is unknown, but since Theophanes Continuatus claims that the exiled Romanos <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a nightmare featuring his son's descent to Hell {{at the time of}} Constantine's death, it can be placed between 946 and Romanos's own death in 948.|$|E
5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} {{a second}} I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right.

5|$|Just before 8 o'clock <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Henry Wood take up his {{position}} {{behind the curtain}} {{at the end of}} the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E

25|$|How did I {{think up}} my {{drawings}} and my ideas for painting?

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Curtiss planes {{approximately}} 300 meters {{below us}} and falling away below. These aircraft were {{no threat to}} us whatsoever! Now I just wanted to level out of my turning bank, since my colleagues were already at a substantially higher altitude. Keppler (his wingman), overshot me. Once again, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Curtiss planes 300 meters directly below me and counted eleven aircraft.|$|E
