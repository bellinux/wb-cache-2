5000|$|Red Orchestra {{concentrates}} {{mostly on}} the multiplayer aspect of the game, {{although there is a}} singleplayer [...] "Practice" [...] mode available. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 features an advanced ballistics system for both small arms and tank rounds - incorporating bullet <b>drop,</b> <b>flight</b> time, and tanks with more realistic armor properties than most games (featuring: penetration and deflection, in relation to range and projectile trajectory angle). The player's movements are realistically modeled, giving them the ability to lie and move prone, sprint (while standing or crouching) and to deploy machine guns on objects.|$|E
40|$|Violent crimes often {{result in}} blood-shed events {{associated}} with blood spatter. Bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) {{serves as a}} good tool and effective approach to reconstruct the events that occur in a crime scene. Among other bloodstain patterns, impact spatter patterns are commonly found at crime scenes. An impact pattern {{is formed as a}} result of an impact force striking an exposed blood source and can be described as a radiating pattern of small individual drops. In most cases of BPA, the reconstruction of the events taken place involve investigating the blood <b>drop</b> <b>flight</b> dynamics and the mechanics of impact spatter generation to determine the origin of the impact. Thus, the discipline of Fluid Dynamics (FD) is also involved in most BPA cases. However, in the cases of multiple impact spatter generation events within a crime scene, it complicates the interpretation and analysis of the impact spatter pattern. There are many variables of blood <b>drop</b> <b>flight</b> dynamics and mechanisms of impact spatter generation in which a blood drop is exposed to and generated from. The variables of blood <b>drop</b> <b>flight</b> dynamics such as drop deformations/oscillations, breakup, diameter with respect to velocity and air/wind currents do affect a drop while in flight which may alter the trajectory curvature of a blood drop. However, it is relatively unknown in scientific literature how the variables of impact spatter generation setup such as the height of the blood source and impact force applied would affect the horizontal distance travelled by a blood drop generated from an impact spatter. Theoretically, there is also limited literature with regards to the correlation of blood <b>drop</b> <b>flight</b> dynamics to maximum horizontal distance travelled by blood drop. This literature review aims to address the effect of blood <b>drop</b> <b>flight</b> dynamics and the mechanisms of impact spatter generation setup have on the maximum horizontal distance travelled by a blood drop. The purpose of this literature review is to dictate parameters for potential research that may aid in answering the investigative question...|$|E

50|$|One main {{defensive}} {{strategy is}} {{their use of}} mimicry when building their nests. By blending into their surroundings, P. striatula {{is more likely to}} avoid confrontation with their predators. However, this strategy is not always successful. Their two main predators are hornets and ants. The females of the nest change their defensive strategy based on who is attacking them. When it comes to ants, the females are fiercely aggressive; they reject and bite the invaders. For hornets, they put on a threatening bending posture of the abdomen. A more useful strategy against hornets is the use of <b>dropping</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R

40|$|Violent crimes {{involving}} bloodshed {{may result}} {{in the formation of}} a number of blood drops that move through air and impact onto a surface producing a bloodstain pattern. Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA), the analysis of the position, distribution, size and morphology of the stains within the pattern present at a crime scene, may provide information about the events that gave rise to the bloodshed. The location of blood origin, i. e. victim’s position at the moment of wounding and (or) wound location, determination is of major interest to BPA. This study investigated the dynamics of formation and flight of blood drops commonly found at a crime scene (so-called passive, cast-off, impact and gunshot drops) with the aim to facilitate blood origin determination. Features of blood drop formation at passive dripping with correlation to dripping surface characteristics were studied experimentally. A numerical scheme for accurate blood <b>drop</b> <b>flight</b> characteristics modelling, including oscillations, deformation and disintegration, was developed and validated against a number of analytical and experimental cases with special attention to the passive blood drop oscillations and ultimate deformation at terminal velocity, cast-off and impact blood drop deformation and breakup features. This provided an efficient and accurate method for typical blood <b>drop</b> <b>flight</b> reconstruction from the blood origin to impact {{as well as from the}} bloodstain location to the possible blood origin. Factors affecting blood drop trajectory and blood origin estimation were studied using the developed scheme...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate and compare the factors influencing plyometric jumping performance between well-trained gymnasts and a control group. Seventy-six gymnasts and 91 moderately active subjects volunteered to participate in this study. Drop jumps (DJ) were performed from 20 -, 40 -, 60 -, 80 -, and 100 -cm heights. Flight time (FT) and contact time (CT) were recorded using contact mat. Flight time to contact time (FC) ratio and Bosco expression (BE) were calculated. Male gymnasts scored similar FT to their controls, whereas female gymnasts had significantly longer FT compared with their peers. The gymnasts obtained significantly shorter CT than their control groups, whereas their FC ratios were significantly higher and increased when the height of the drops was close to 60 cm. Moreover, gymnasts' BE was greater in comparison to their respective control groups independent of the drop height. The height of the drop that produced the best FC ratio and BE varied between the groups. The best performances were obtained between 40 - and 60 -cm drop height for both groups. Female control group showed a trend toward a continuing decline with the increase of the drop height. The best gymnasts (finalists at World Championships) obtained their best performance at 80 -cm <b>drop.</b> <b>Flight</b> time is the less discriminating factor distinguishing gymnasts' DJ performances. Considering CT, FC, and BE results all together could better profile the gymnasts rather than taken separately. Bosco expression was shown to be more sensitive to the increase in FT; we suggest BE as the best criteria to assess the appropriate drop height for plyometric training purposes in gymnasts as it has been significantly correlated to FT...|$|E
