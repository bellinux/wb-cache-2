5|$|Born in Cologne, {{the son of}} {{a synagogue}} cantor, Offenbach showed early musical talent.

Finding the management of Paris' Opéra-Comique company uninterested in staging his works, in 1855 he leased a small theatre in the Champs-Élysées. There he presented a series of his own small-scale pieces, many of which became popular.|$|E

Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-ruble pension received by most other exiles.|$|E
5|$|However, Peckham {{worked hard}} to reorganise the estates of the diocese, and held an inquiry in 1283 through 1285 into the {{revenues}} of the see. He set up administrative structures in the manors that divided them into seven administrative groups. Peckham, though, was almost continually in debt, {{and because he was}} a Franciscan, he had no personal property to help with <b>his</b> <b>living</b> expenses.

5|$|In 1904, Hunter made a {{visit to}} Paris, funded by his {{earnings}} as an illustrator. He {{was inspired by the}} numerous artistic experiences there, and became fully resolved to take up oil painting. When he returned to San Francisco in 1905, he began preparing for his first solo exhibition, which was to be held the following year. However, Hunter's early work was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and he returned to Scotland shortly afterwards, settling in Glasgow. Initially he continued to make <b>his</b> <b>living</b> there primarily as an illustrator. His oil painting began with still lifes on black backgrounds, influenced by the Dutch style.|$|E

5|$|Tucker {{was asked}} for reimbursement, and after negotiation, paid it in part, {{borrowing}} the remainder {{from members of}} the academy board.

Though he was officially cleared of wrongdoing, the incidents tarnished his reputation and highlighted the style of <b>his</b> <b>living</b> in Richmond. Meanwhile, Maria gave birth to their eldest daughter, Eleanor Rosalie, on May 4, 1804.|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{forced the}} closure of all European opera houses, Paoli made <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a {{professional}} boxer.

He teaches {{her to play}} the snare drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he relies on intimidation and even cruelty at times to maintain his domination.|$|E
