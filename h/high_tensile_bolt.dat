40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} tests conducted on seven double-strap butt-type joints fastened with <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> steel <b>bolts.</b> The bolts were torqued far into their plastic range. The joints were then subjected to fatigue and/or static loading to failure. The tests, although few in number, indicate quite clearly that {{for the type of}} joint tested, over-stressed <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> steel <b>bolts</b> are not likely to fail in fatigue: nor is the static strength of the joints affected by the over-stressing of the bolts.

On the isolator structures the various concrete members are <b>bolted</b> together using <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> steel <b>bolts</b> to a pre-determined torque. All in situ concrete is eliminated from these structures. The circuit breaker structures were cast in situ.

40|$|Phased arrays can be {{used for}} {{detecting}} cracking (and other defects) in <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>bolts.</b> The technique uses a “fingerprinting ” approach to the bolts. In contrast to current code procedures where an operator manually scans a normal beam probe over a bolt and interprets the results, this phased array technique uses an S-scan and a mechanized scanner. Specifically, the phased array probe is mounted in contact on the head of the bolt, and performs a small angle longitudinal wave S-scan down the bolt. The array is mounted in a mechanized and encoded jig for 360 o rotation round the bolt. Signals are received from the threads, bolt geometry and from mode conversions. In essence, the S-scan gives a fingerprint of the bolt at all depths and orientations when the operator scans round the bolt collecting data. Any perturbations from defects or cracks are typically very visible. Interpretation is much simpler than with alternative bolt inspection techniques. Some examples from calibration and cracked bolts will be shown. The technique can be finetuned for different bolt dimensions and features...|$|R
5000|$|A recent large model, {{weighing}} approximately 500 kg and 23 m long, {{was built}} in September 2009 by TV presenter James May {{and a team of}} volunteers from the engineering department of the University of Liverpool, who created a Meccano bridge spanning the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Liverpool. As with other models of this size and weight some non-Meccano parts were used. It was built from [...] "about 100,000 pieces of real Meccano", taking 1,100 hours, and consisted of a 9-metre (29.5 ft) [...] "swing bridge" [...] section, and a 12-metre (39.4 ft) [...] "drawbridge" [...] section. A contender for the largest model on record {{was built in}} 2014 by Graham Shepherd of Grahamstown, South Africa. The fully motorized Krupp 288 Bucket Wheel Excavator (as used on large opencast mining) is complete with auxiliary conveyors. Construction utilised Meccano parts as well as replica and strengthened parts (thickened profile plates and <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>bolts</b> in areas carrying large loads). Shepherd reports the model as being 1,335 kilograms (2,943 pounds) in mass and 17 ft tall. It required substantial timber support frames to facilitate final assembly.|$|R

40|$|Developing new {{materials}} or improving their heat treatment techniques {{is key to}} industrial upgrades for increasing fastener product quality. Nowadays, <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength <b>bolts</b> are heat-treated to achieve desired mechanical properties such as hardness, strength, toughness, and resistance to fatigue and wear. Ultrasound detection is one widely used nondestructive inspection technique. Based {{on the characteristics of}} wave transmission, the refraction, diffraction, and scattering of ultrasound wave velocity and attenuation in a material are governed by its grain boundary characteristics. In this study, C 1045 middle carbon steel was heat-treated at various temperatures and then water-quenched, and the relationships among grain size, ultrasonic velocity, attenuation, and material hardness were then determined using two ultrasound sources. Our experimental results show that a smaller average grain size as well as higher hardness can be obtained from higher quenching temperatures. Faster acoustic velocities and slower attenuation coefficients are caused by higher material hardness. A scattering effect is more obvious for higher transducer frequencies. Our results demonstrate another nondestructive test that can assess the quenching process in the fastener industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{quenched}} and tempered microstructures on the diffusion coefficient and solubility of hydrogen in <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength <b>bolt</b> steel have been investigated {{by means of the}} electrochemical permeation technique. The results obtained are as follows : (1) The diffusion coefficient was minimum when the steel had the as-quenched martensitic structure or the low temperature tempered martensite, and it increased with increasing tempering temperature. The mixed structure of ferrite and lamellar pearlite obtained by furnace cooling from a temperature above Ac_ 3 gave a higher diffusion coefficient than the tempered spheroidal pearlite. On the other hand, the solubility of hydrogen showed a behavior opposite to the diffusion coefficient. (2) The low diffusion coefficient and high solubility are attributed predominantly to hydrogen trapping at the lattice imperfections, such as dislocations and faults etc., which were introduced by martensitic transformation during quenching. (3) With regard to the effect of cathodic current density, i. e., the hydrogen concentration directly below the surface on hydrogen diffusion in tempered steel, the diffusion coefficient hardly depended upon the hydrogen concentration but the solubility of hydrogen increased up to a certain value with increasing cathodic current density. On the other hand, the hydrogen permeation current efficiency decreased with increasing cathodic current density. (4) The activation energies for hydrogen diffusion in the tempered martensite, tempered fine and/or spheroidal pearlites in the temperature range of 6 to 61 ℃, were almost constant (about 8. 1 kcal/mol) but the pre-exponential factor increased with tempering temperature. The heats of solution of hydrogen in the tempered martensite and tempered pearlites were almost the same (about - 10. 3 kcal/mol), indicating the exothermic reaction. However, the pre-exponential factor decreased with increaing tempering temperature...|$|R

Zr and/or Nb added Fe 3 Al based {{intermetallic}} alloys (i. e., Fe 3 Al-Zr, Fe 3 Al-Nb and Fe 3 Al-Zr-Nb) were arc-melted, homogenized, hot-rolled {{and then}} annealed to evaluate microstruc-ture and tensile property {{at room temperature}} {{as well as at}} a high temperature (873 K). After anneal-ing, the rolled alloys exhibited a recrystallized microstructure containing coarse second phase parti-cles, except for the Nb-added alloy with a minor content of Nb. Relatively <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> elongation as well as <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength was observed at room temperature in the Zr-added alloys with a minor amount of Zr.
