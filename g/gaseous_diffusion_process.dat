5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process.</b> Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process</b> without complicated transformers.|$|E

5|$|Like the United States, the Soviet Union (USSR) {{carried out}} {{research}} on multiple enrichment technologies for the Soviet atomic bomb project. A trial electromagnetic process {{was carried out}} in 1946 with a calutron using a magnet taken from Germany. A site was chosen for an electromagnetic plant at Sverdlovsk-45 in 1946. The pilot plant, known as Plant 418, was completed in 1948. A more efficient design was developed in which the particle beams were bent by 225° instead of 180° as in the American calutron. It was used to complete the uranium enrichment process after technical difficulties were encountered with the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process.</b> Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium-235 was brought to Sverdlovsk-45 for final enrichment to between 92 and 98 percent. After the problems with the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process</b> were resolved in 1950, it was decided not to proceed with a full-scale electromagnetic plant. , it remains operational. In 1969, a research calutron known as S-2 was built at Arzamas-16 for high-efficiency separation of isotopes of heavy elements like plutonium.|$|E

Silicon pellets were prepared in the silicon shot tower; and solar cells were fabricated using web grown where the pellets were used as a replenishment material. Verification runs were made using the boron dopant and liquid diffusion mask materials. The average of cells produced in these runs was 13 %. The relationship of sheet resistivity, temperature, gas flows, and gas composition for the diffusion of the P- 8 liquid phosphorus solution was investigated.

5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process</b> for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb {{required}} fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of uranium {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride left over from the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process.</b> This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process</b> {{remained}} more encouraging, {{although it}} too had technical obstacles to overcome. By {{the end of}} 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on gaseous diffusion. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> {{requires}} {{about 60}} {{times as much}} energy as the gas centrifuge process: gaseous diffusion-produced nuclear fuel produces 25 times more energy than is used in the <b>diffusion</b> <b>process,</b> while centrifuge-produced fuel produces 1,500 times more energy than is used in the centrifuge process.|$|R
25|$|By {{investing}} {{heavily in}} breeding plutonium in early nuclear reactors {{and in the}} electromagnetic and <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> enrichment <b>processes</b> {{for the production of}} uranium-235, the United States was able to develop three usable weapons by mid-1945. The Trinity test was a plutonium implosion-design weapon tested on 16 July 1945, with around a 20 kiloton yield. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese home islands and with Japan not surrendering, President Harry S. Truman ordered the atomic raids on enemy cities. On 6 August, a uranium-gun design bomb, Little Boy, was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima with an energy of about 15 kilotons of TNT, destroying nearly 50,000 buildings (including the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division headquarters) and killing approximately 70,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean slave laborers. On 9 August, a plutonium implosion-design bomb, Fat Man, was used against the Japanese city of Nagasaki with the explosion equivalent to about 20 kilotons of TNT, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200–28,200 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants.|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model has been developed using CFDS-FLOW 3 D Version 3. 3 to model the transport of aerosol products formed during a release of uranium hexafluoride (UF{sub 6 }) into a <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant (GDP) <b>process</b> building. As part of a facility-wide safety evaluation, a one-dimensional (1 -D) analysis of aerosol/vapor transport following such an hypothesized severe accident is being performed. The objective {{of this study is}} to supplement the 1 -D analysis with more detailed 3 -D results. Specifically, the goal is to quantify the distribution of aerosol passing out of the process building during the hypothetical accident. This work demonstrates a useful role for CFD in large 3 -D problems, where some experimental data are available for calibrating key parameters and the desired results are global (total time-integrated aerosol flow rates across a few boundary surfaces) as opposed to local velocities, temperatures, or heat transfer coefficients...|$|R
5|$|The {{need for}} {{fluorine}} {{arose from the}} need to separate the isotope235U from 238U because the former, present in natural uranium at a concentration of less than 1% is fissile (capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons), whereas the latter is not. Members of the MAUD Committee (especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti) proposed the use of gaseous diffusion for isotope separation, since, according to Graham's law the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular mass. After an extensive search, uranium hexafluoride, UF6, {{was determined to be}} the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process.</b> Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF6.|$|E
5|$|When {{cooperation}} resumed in September 1943, Groves and Oppenheimer {{revealed the}} existence of the Los Alamos Laboratory to Chadwick, Peierls and Oliphant. Oppenheimer wanted all three to proceed to Los Alamos as soon as possible, but it was decided that Oliphant would go to Berkeley to work on the electromagnetic process and Peierls would go to New York to work on the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process.</b> The task then fell to Chadwick. The original idea, favoured by Groves, was that the British scientists would work as a group under Chadwick, who would farm out work to them. This was soon discarded in favour of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory. They worked in most of its divisions, only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process</b> {{required}} suitable pumps {{that had}} to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{four more}} <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plants {{were added to}} the site, named K-27, K-29, K-31 and K-33. The K-25 site was renamed the Oak Ridge <b>Gaseous</b> <b>Diffusion</b> Plant in 1955. Production of enriched uranium ended in 1964, and <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> finally ceased on the site on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge <b>Gaseous</b> <b>Diffusion</b> Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Demolition of all five <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plants was {{completed}} in February 2017.|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} WAKE {{dispersion model}} {{a component of}} the HGSYSTEM/UF{sub 6 } model suite, is based on Shell Research Ltd. `s HGSYSTEM Version 3. 0 and was developed by the US Department of Energy for use in estimating downwind dispersion of materials due to accidental releases from <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant (GDP) <b>process</b> buildings. The model is applicable to scenarios involving both ground-level and elevated releases into building wake cavities of non-reactive plumes that are either neutrally or positively buoyant. Over the 2 -year period since its creation, the WAKE model has been used to perform consequence analyses for Safety Analysis Reports (SARs) associated with <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plants in Portsmouth (PORTS), Paducah (PGDP), and Oak Ridge. These applications have identified the need for additional model capabilities (such as the treatment of complex terrain and time-variant releases) not present in the original utilities which, in turn, has resulted in numerous modifications to these codes as well as the development of additional, stand-alone postprocessing utilities. Consequently, application of the model has become increasingly complex as the number of executable, input, and output files associated with a single model run has steadily grown. In response to these problems, a streamlined version of the WAKE model has been developed which integrates all calculations that are currently performed by the existing WAKE, and the various post-processing utilities. This report summarizes the efforts involved in developing this revised version of the WAKE model...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Soviets began to replace their <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> {{machines}} with centrifuges, {{but it was}} not until 1990 that the final <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> cascade was shut down.|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of}} the product increased. By April, K-25 had attained a 1.1 percent enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7 percent enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other {{production plant}}s and became the prototypes {{for a new generation of}} plants. Uranium was enriched by the K-25 <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process</b> until 1985; the plants were then decommissioned and decontaminated. A 235 MW coal-fired power station was included for reliability and to provide variable frequency, although most electric power came from the TVA.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process</b> required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{centrifuge}} process uses {{a large number}} of rotating cylinders in series and parallel formations. Each cylinder's rotation creates a strong centripetal force so that the heavier gas molecules containing 238U move tangentially toward the outside of the cylinder and the lighter gas molecules rich in 235U collect closer to the center. It requires much less energy to achieve the same separation than the older <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>process,</b> which it has largely replaced and so is the current method of choice and is termed second generation. It has a separation factor per stage of 1.3 relative to gaseous diffusion of 1.005, which translates to about one-fiftieth of the energy requirements. Gas centrifuge techniques produce about 54% of the world's enriched uranium.|$|E
50|$|As {{existing}} <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plants became obsolete, {{they were}} replaced by second generation gas centrifuge technology, which requires far less electric power to produce equivalent amounts of separated uranium. AREVA replaced its Georges Besse <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant with the Georges Besse II centrifuge plant.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} and initial {{application of a}} mechanistic model (TOUGHREACT-N) designed to characterize soil nitrogen (N) cycling and losses are described. The model couples advective and diffusive nutrient transport, multiple microbial biomass dynamics, and equilibrium and kinetic chemical reactions. TOUGHREACT-N was calibrated and tested against field measurements to assess pathways of N loss as either gas emission or solute leachate following fertilization and irrigation in a Central Valley, California, agricultural field as functions of fertilizer application rate and depth, and irrigation water volume. Our results, relative to the period before plants emerge, show that an increase in fertilizer rate produced a nonlinear response in terms of N losses. An increase of irrigation volume produced NO{sub 2 }{sup -} and NO{sub 3 }{sup -} leaching, whereas an increase in fertilization depth mainly increased leaching of all N solutes. In addition, nitrifying bacteria largely increased in mass with increasing fertilizer rate. Increases in water application caused nitrifiers and denitrifiers to decrease and increase their mass, respectively, while nitrifiers and denitrifiers reversed their spatial stratification when fertilizer was applied below 15 cm depth.
