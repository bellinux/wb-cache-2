Serious recommendations for protection of the skin toward irritants include hygienic aspects {{and the use of}} appropriate skin care. Furthermore, preventing an accumulation of irritants on unprotected skin is mandatory. An intraindividual comparison study with 30 participants (17 female, 13 male; age: 44. 2 ± 8. 3 years) was performed to evaluate the properties of a newly developed water-in-oil (W/O) balm on artificial sodium dodecyl sulfate-damaged epidermal barrier. The balm was applied 14 days twice daily, and transepidermal water loss and erythema were investigated. A significant improvement of both parameters after 12 days and even after 21 days could be confirmed. Two major clinical trials were performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy regarding protective and regenerative properties of the W/O balm on irritated skin in the anogenital area. Therefore, 29 children were enrolled (14 male, 15 female, age: 15. 5 ± 7. 8 months) in an open-labeled 4 -week clinical study. The balm was used in the area under disposable diapers at least after diaper change or if required. Furthermore, in a second open, multicenter study, 43 women (mean age: 46. 2 ± 16. 9) with predisposition to skin irritation in the outer anogenital region were included. The product was applied for 4 weeks 1 – 2 times daily. In both studies, skin tolerability, applicability, scent, spreadability, and removability of the balm were evaluated by participants and practitioners predominantly as good or even very good, also skin hydration, protection, and regeneration were judged positively. The studies confirmed that the newly developed W/O balm exhibits excellent tolerability and is easy to remove. At the same time, excellent properties with respect to efficacy regarding regeneration and protection could be observed, without any undesired effects at any time.

[...] In adults, the stratum corneum is composed of 25 to 30 layers of flattened dead keratinocytes, which are continuously shed and replaced from below. These dead cells are interlaid with lipids secreted by the stratum granulosum just underneath, which help to make this layer of the skin a waterproof barrier. The stratum corneum's function is to reduce water loss, repel water, protect deeper layers of the skin from injury, and to repel microbial invasion of the skin. In infants, this layer of the skin is much thinner and more easily disrupted.|$|E
40|$|A {{mother of}} a 50 day old infant male {{presented}} to the pe-diatrician with a concern raised by a family member who noticed ants were attracted to the baby’s wet diapers as shown in Fig. 1 & 2. After further questioning, the mother reported symptoms of polydipsia, frequently wet <b>diapers,</b> persistent napkin <b>dermatitis,</b> and no weight gain since birth. It was eventually confirmed that the infant had per-manent neonatal diabetes mellitus (insulin gene mutation). Discussion The “osmotic ” symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia are well known classical presentations of diabetes in both adults and older children. The Hindu physicians, Charak and Su-shrut, who wrote between 400 and 500 BC, were probably the first to recognize the “sweetness ” of diabetic urine. The ancient Indians tested for diabetes by observing whether ants were attracted to a person’s urine, and called the ail-ment “sweet urine disease ” (Madhumeha) (1). In modern times, frequent change of wet diapers, persistent severe dia-per dermatitis, and failure to thrive has been observed as presenting symptoms of diabetes. However, to our knowl-edge, ants attracted to discarded wet diapers because of its high sugar content had not been previously documented. We wished to share this curiosity with the readership of the Journal. Increasing awareness of the presentations of dia-betes in infants and young children among doctors, nurses, and parents should lead to earlier recognition and diagnosis of diabetes, with reduction of late presentations as diabetic ketoacidosis and its associated morbidity and mortality (2) ...|$|R

The test formulation consisted of minerals (zinc, selenate, and molybdenum), L-ascorbic acid, along with Centella asiatica extract, and tetrahydrocurcumin (THC). The test formulation and DMEM {{were divided into two}} parts, one part of each was treated with the Biofield Energy Treatment by Aksana Hancharuk and denoted as treated group, while other part was coded as the untreated groups. Skin parameters against various cell lines such as HFF- 1, HaCaT and B 16 -F 10 were examined with the combination of Biofield Treated (BT) and untreated test formulation (UT) with DMEM. MTT assay result showed that the test formulation was found to be safe and nontoxic at tested concentrations. Human fibroblast cell proliferation using BrdU method showed a significant increased cell proliferation by 91. 51 % and 201. 14 % in different Biofield Energy Treated groups. UT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group showed an increased level of collagen by 64. 58 % (2. 5 µg/mL) and 55. 55 % (1. 25 µg/mL), respectively compared with the untreated group. Similarly, elastin synthesis was increased in UT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group by 21. 96 % and 11. 42 % at concentration 10 and 5 µg/mL, respectively compared to the untreated group. However, hyaluronic acid level was increased by 14. 02 % and 6. 57 % at concentrations 1. 25 and 0. 625 µg/mL, respectively in BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group compared with the untreated group. Moreover, inhibition of melanin synthesis was observed by 12. 95 % and 17. 86 % (0. 125 µg/mL) in UT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation and BT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation groups, respectively compared with the untreated group in B 16 -F 10 melanoma cell line. Anti-wrinkling activity in HFF- 1 cells showed a notable cell viability in all the groups at various concentrations, i. e. in UT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation, BT-DMEM + UT-Test formulation, and BT-DMEM + BT-Test formulation group by 15. 68 %, 36. 47 %, and 29. 64 %, respectively at 2. 5 µg/mL compared with the untreated group. The significant wound healing activity was reported in scratch assay in HFF- 1 and HaCaT cells due to the significantly higher cellular migration of fibroblast and keratinocytes. Therefore, Biofield Energy Treatment (The Trivedi Effect®) based test formulation and cell medium might be a suitable approach for the development for herbal cosmetics and formulations as anti-wrinkling, skin-whitening, anti-ageing, and rejuvenating action.

The most frequent type results from increased fragility of the newborn buttock skin when covered by diapers. According to the mechanisms involved and {{the severity of the}} dermatitis, one can distinguish the intertrigo of the chubby baby, and the so-called "W", "Y" and "red panties" types of <b>diaper</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> When the effects of occlusion are not controlled by adequate absorption by the diapers, hyperhydration of the stratum corneum occurs and progresses to maceration. As a result, the value of the coefficient of friction of the skin increases with epidermal weakening to rubbing. In addition, fecal enzymes (urease, proteases and lipases) alter urines and skin. Judicious hygiene measures and the correct choice of diapers are mandatory. Cutaneous colonization by microorganisms, the most important of which being Candida albicans, is the main complication. Adequate preventive and curative measures can combat <b>diaper</b> <b>dermatitis</b> with confidence. A miconazole paste allows to improve the tribological properties of the interface between diapers and the skin. It also abates the impact of Candida albicans in the pathogenesis of the skin disorder.
