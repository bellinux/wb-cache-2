He was the son of Toshizo Abbe, who was the local school's {{headmaster}} and a kendo instructor, and his wife, Kote Abbe. The couple had four sons and five daughters, and Abbe was the youngest child in the family. On 4 September 1919, when Abbe was not yet <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> his father drowned in a flash flood while training in the mountains. A young schoolteacher, Manpei Hino, subsequently became a father figure for the young boy and introduced him to the martial arts, including sumo.

5|$|After his death, {{a legend}} arose {{that he had}} not died, that his funeral was staged, and that he had escaped to Hawaii, married a native woman, and fathered several {{children}} with her. Andrew Forest Muir, writing in 1956 in the Filson Club History Quarterly, debunked this legend. He documented that the first Deshas in Hawaii did not arrive until nearly two decades after Isaac Desha's death. At the time of Baker's murder, the progenitor of the Hawaiian Desha family had been <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> That progenitor was John R. Langherne Desha, a grandson of Governor Joseph Desha and nephew of Isaac Desha. In Honolulu, he helped establish Queen's Hospital and worked there until his death.|$|E

40|$|Quality and Curriculum Guidelines for Preschool Programs for <b>Four</b> <b>Year</b> <b>Olds.</b> The {{purpose of}} that {{document}} {{was to provide}} the framework for the design and implementation of a high-quality preschool program targeted to <b>four</b> <b>year</b> <b>olds</b> at risk of school failure. That document has provided the foundation for our highly successful Michigan School Readiness Program, the state prekindergarten program targeted at <b>four</b> <b>year</b> <b>olds</b> at risk of school failure, now serving almost 26, 000 children each year, 19 percent of all four-year-old children in Michigan. Recognizing the value and need for quality early childhood education programs for children <b>four</b> through eight <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> the Michigan State Board of Education appointed another committee to develop Early Childhood Standards of Quality for Prekindergarten through Second Grade, and adopted those standards on December 15, 1992. Although used broadly, many of the recommendations were applicable to public school districts because of the wide age range covered. At the same time, procedural safeguards and other rules were adopted for Early Childhood Special Education (formerly Pre-Primary Impaired, PPI) classrooms...|$|R

5|$|Although {{originally}} developed mainly for Western riding and stock uses, {{it has also}} been seen competing in endurance riding, three-day eventing, show hunter, and driving. It jumps well, and can be used for dressage. Originally, breed club shows did not allow people over the age of 16 to show POAs under saddle; adults could, however, show them in halter or driving classes. In 1973, the age limit for riders was raised to 18, and in 1987 it was decided that adults 19 and over could show horses two to <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> under saddle.|$|E
5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at {{about three years}} of age and can then become pregnant; in comparison, males reach sexual {{maturity}} when they are about <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> although they can produce sperm as early as two years. While the chest glands can be functional as early as 18 months of age, males do not begin scent-marking behaviours until they reach sexual maturity. Because the offspring have a long dependent period, female koalas usually breed in alternate years. Favourable environmental factors, such as a plentiful supply of high-quality food trees, allow them to reproduce every year.|$|E

40|$|Phonological {{awareness}} and alphabet knowledge {{are two of}} the strongest predictors of reading acquisition. Many New Zealand children are entering school with low levels of emergent literacy skills, so an important area of study is how to boost the phonological {{awareness and}} alphabet knowledge of <b>four</b> <b>year</b> <b>olds</b> in preparation for their entrance into school. The current research proposed an evidence-based intervention, using games and books, could raise the levels of phonological awareness and alphabet knowledge in children who were shown to have low levels of emergent literacy. The study examined the variation of emergent literacy knowledge, assessed using PALS Pre-K, in a sample of 42 New Zealand <b>four</b> <b>year</b> <b>old</b> children attending kindergarten. The study also investigated the effects of a phonological awareness and alphabet knowledge intervention in a sample of 24 <b>four</b> <b>year</b> <b>old</b> children (taken from the original sample of 42). The results showed 1) a large range in the emergent literacy scores of the 42 <b>four</b> <b>year</b> <b>olds</b> and 2) that a phonological awareness and alphabet knowledge intervention was effective in significantly raising the levels of upper-case letter-naming, letter-sound awareness and beginning sound awareness in the intervention group. The scores for name writing, lower-case letter-naming and rhyming although higher for the intervention group were not significantly so. The results suggest there is a relationship between letter-naming knowledge and letter-sound knowledge and that beginning sound knowledge was a difficult concept for many children to grasp without explicit teaching. The findings showed an evidence-based intervention that is designed appropriately with regard to focus, length of session and group size, can be effective in raising the emergent literacy knowledge of a group of <b>four</b> <b>year</b> <b>old</b> children with low levels of emergent literacy knowledge...|$|R
