40|$|<b>Instrumental</b> <b>variables</b> {{estimation}} is {{a widely}} used technique in many fields in the social sciences. An important problem in applying the technique is the choice of <b>instrumental</b> <b>variables,</b> since empirical researchers often have many (valid) <b>instrumental</b> <b>variables</b> from which to choose. According to conventional asymptotic theory, the asymptotic variance of an estimator decreases {{with the number of}} instruments used for estimation.

40|$|The <b>instrumental</b> <b>variables</b> {{framework}} {{is commonly used}} for the estimation of causal effects from cohort samples. However, the combination of <b>instrumental</b> <b>variables</b> with more efficient designs such as case-control sampling requires new methodological consideration.

We show that the standard <b>instrumental</b> <b>variables</b> analysis does not appropriately estimate the causal effects of interest when the <b>instrumental</b> <b>variables</b> design is combined with the case-control design. We also propose a method that can estimate the causal effects in such combined designs. We illustrate the method with a study in oncology. ...|$|R
