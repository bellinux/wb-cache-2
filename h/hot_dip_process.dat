50|$|Galvalume {{steel sheet}} is carbon steel sheet coated with aluminium-zinc alloy by a {{continuous}} hot-dip process. The nominal coating composition is 55% aluminium and 45% zinc. A small but important addition of silicon {{is included in}} the coating alloy. It is added not to enhance the corrosion performance, but to provide good coating adhesion to the steel substrate when the product is roll-formed, drawn, or bent during fabrication.Galvalume steel sheet combines the excellent barrier corrosion protection of aluminium with the galvanic protection of zinc. The result is a coating that lasts a long time, a coating that provides cut-edge protection along sheared edges, and therefore, a coating that offers excellent protection to steel sheet. Although there are a few exceptions, for most applications in most types of environment, Galvalume steel sheet is the preferred product when long-term resistance to atmospheric corrosion is desired. It outlasts a galvanized coating of comparable thickness, and offers cut-edge protection that is not available with aluminium-coated sheet. This cut-edge protection means there is less rust-staining along sheared edges, at scratches, and other imperfections in the coating. Also, since the coating is so resistant to corrosion, it retains a very bright surface appearance when exposed to most atmospheres. These attributes make Galvalume steel sheet the preferred material for roofing. The superior corrosion resistance of Galvalume steel sheet is achieved by the presence of microscopic zinc-rich and aluminium-rich areas within the coating. The aluminium-rich areas, which corrode very slowly, provide the long-term durability while the zinc-rich areas, which corrode preferentially, provide galvanic protection. Galvalume metals are made with steel panels having a coating of corrosion resistant aluminium-zinc alloy applied by a continuous <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>process.</b> The nominal composition of the coating is 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon. Galvalume is the trade name for this patented sheet steel product. The alloy coating of aluminium and zinc combines the best properties of both metals. It has the corrosion resistance and heat reflectivity characteristic of aluminium coatings, with the formability and galvanic protection of cut edges characteristic of zinc coatings.|$|E
50|$|Aluminized steel can be {{made using}} a variety of <b>processes,</b> cladding, <b>hot</b> <b>dipping,</b> {{galvanic}} coating, metallizing, and calorizing, but the most effective <b>process</b> is <b>hot</b> <b>dipping.</b> The <b>process</b> of <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> <b>process</b> is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|R

40|$|The {{strip steel}} surface {{condition}} after continuous annealing of strip {{is extremely important}} {{to the quality of}} galvannealed coating (GA). The presence of oxides or precipitated can affect the reactions at the coating/substrate interface and decrease the zinc wettability on the steel surface, leading to various defects in the final product.

Applications to <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> bath management practices are set forth. Background The coating {{of iron and}} steel with zinc to improve corrosion resistance has been practiced in various forms for 260 years, and a thorough description of the numerous wire-related technologies has been compiled in the handbook Ferrous Wire. 1 In general, the basic unalloyed zinc technologies may be grouped under the headings “hot dip galvanizing ” and “electrogalvanizing”. <b>Hot</b> <b>dip</b> practice involves the passage of wire through a molten zinc bath, whereas electrogalvanizing involves electroplating. The galvanized steel coating may involve no further processing. Alternatively, it may be redrawn, or otherwise reworked, chromated or oiled. It {{is important to note}} that the success of these technologies and the serviceability of the final product depend substantially on prior conditioning of the wire. Critical annealing, cleaning and fluxing (in the case of <b>hot</b> <b>dip)</b> <b>processes</b> precede the coating step. Moreover, <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coatings are optimized by the maintenance of small additions of aluminum in the zinc bath and by “wiping ” and quenching practices upon emergence from the bath. Modern, in depth presentations on zinc-based steel coating systems may be found in Zinc-Based Steel Coating Systems: Production and Performance. 2 The physical metallurgical basis of zinc-coated steel has been recently reviewed in detail by Marder. 3 It is practical and economical to apply a zinc alloy coating.

A possible and alternative route to realize this is {{through the application of}} an Al-Si-rich coating on the steel substrate using a <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> <b>process,</b> followed by a diffusion annealing treatment. Previously, a series of compositions were used for dipping, namely: pure Al, Al + 10 wt% Si (hypo-eutectic composition) and Al + 25 wt% Si (hypereutectic composition). After these dipping experiments, and the subsequent evaluation of the coating and its formed intermetallic phases, the use of a hypo-eutectic Al-Si-bath was recommended for further investigation, because of certain advantages: i. e. hypo-eutectic concentrations allow lower dipping temperatures and reduce the formation of ordered Fe-Si-structures that cause brittleness in the coating and substrate. The present work reports on the results obtained on materials that were <b>hot</b> <b>dipped</b> in a hypo-eutectic Al-Si bath.

It was shown that bainite formation in the Si-alloyed grade was too slow to bring about the retention of a significant amount of austenite down to room temperature. The mixed Al-Si grade, on the other hand, exhibited faster bainite formation kinetics under heat treatment conditions compatible with the CGL process, such {{that it is possible to}} retain a significant amount of austenite. The partial substitution of silicon by aluminum appears thus a promising path for the production of galvanized TRIP-assisted steels...|$|R

As there is a method for coating known as Galfan is available, in which combination of 95 %zinc and 5 % Aluminium is used for protecting steel from corrosion. As there are not much details available about why this composition is used Zinc- 5 %Al, we are interested in study of effects of different composition of Aluminum with Zinc, so we study the effect by adding different composition 2. 5 %, 4. 5 %, 6. 5 %, 8. 5 % & 11. 5 % Aluminum in Zinc, for this study we are using <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanizing <b>process</b> for studying this coating. Hot-dip galvanizing is widely used to improve the corrosion resistance of steel. To obtain high-quality coatings, some alloy elements are added to the zinc bath.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> {{aluminizing}} <b>process</b> {{to simulate}} the continuous galvanizing line (CGL) {{was carried out in}} three successive steps by a <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> simulator: the pre-treatment for removing scales on the 200 × 250 mm 2 and 1 mm in thickness cold rolled steel sheet, the dipping in 660 °C Al-Si melt for 3 s and the cooling. In a pre-treatment, the steel specimen was partly coated by Au to confirm the mechanism of intermetallic compound (IMC) formation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were followed to observe the cross-section and the distribution of the elements. The specimen was analyzed in the boundary of the dipped-undipped part to see the formation mechanism of the aluminized steel. An intermetallic compound (IMC) is rapidly developed and grown in the steel-liquid interface. It has been usually reported that the IMC was formed by the dissolution of iron in the steel substrate toward the melt and the diffusion of aluminum in an opposite direction. The specimen is covered with aluminum- 10 wt. % silicon, forms the IMC in the part that was not Au coated. However, IMC is not formed in the Au-coated part. The interface of the dipped-undipped is also analyzed by EDX. At the interface of the steel-IMC, it is clearly shown that the IMC is only formed in the dipped part and exists in the steel substrate as well, and contributes by iron, aluminum and silicon. The result clearly shows that only aluminum diffuses into the steel substrate without the dissolution of iron and forms the IMC between the steel substrate and the melt. Au coating and the short dipping time prevent the iron from dissolving into the aluminum melt. By TEM combined with focused ion beam (FIB) sample preparation, the IMC is confirmed as Fe 2 SiAl 8, a hexagonal structure with space group P 63 /mmc...|$|R
40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry’s move to pure-tin finishes {{is creating}} a dilemma for the high-reliability community. Most military and aerospace companies forbid the use of pure-tin {{because of the risk}} of tin whiskers. To resolve this dilemma, <b>hot</b> solder <b>dip</b> is being implemented to convert components to alternative finishes. However, poorly designed solder dip temperature profiles can induce severe thermal gradients within components, which can cause acute and/or latent defects. This paper addresses the thermodynamic aspects of the solder <b>dip</b> <b>process</b> and provides solutions for minimizing these thermal gradients. The temperature distribution in a component was modeled using finite element analysis during three different solder <b>dip</b> <b>processes.</b> It was determined that differential temperatures were minimized when profiles with gradual preheat and gradual cool down were utilized. In addition, the model was verified by experimental results, which demonstrated a good correlation between simulated and actual measurements.

40|$|Recently, {{advanced}} {{high strength}} steels for automotive applications {{were designed to}} achieve a carbide- free bainitic microstructure after conventional thermo-mechanical processing and a continuous annealing treatment. The microstructure obtained consists of ferrite laths interwoven with thin films of untransformed retained austenite. The sufficiently tough matrix and {{the control of the}} heterogeneity in the microstructure allowed an optimum combination of strength, ductility, and formability to be achieved. However, this work probed that even using a devoted theoretical alloying, carbide-free bainitic steels are hardly compatible with a conventional <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanizing annealing <b>process,</b> without any consideration about Zn coatability and adherence. The hardenability of the designed alloys was insufficient in some cases and the amount of austenite retained in the microstructure was too low or/and mechanically too unstable for high ductility. As a consequence, the obtained mechanical properties were comparable to those in high-Si dual phase steels without a beneficial transformation induced plasticity effectsupport of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (contract RFSR-CT- 2008 - 00021) and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (contracts MAT 2010 - 15330 and IPT- 2012 - 0320 - 420000) for funding this researchPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{shift of}} {{electronics}} industry towards {{the use of}} lead-free solders in components manufacturing brought also the challenge of addressing the problem of tin whiskers. Manufacturers of high reliability and safety critical equipment in sectors such as defence and aerospace rely increasingly {{on the use of}} commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components for their products and systems. The use of COTS components with lead-free solder plated terminations comes with the risks for their long term reliability associated with tin whisker growth related failures. In the case of leaded type electronic components such as Quad Flat Package (QFP) and Small Outline Package (SOP), one of the promising solutions to this problem is to “re-finish” the package terminations by replacing the lead-free solder coatings on the leads with conventional tin–lead solder. This involves subjecting the electronic components to a post-manufacturing process known as <b>Hot</b> Solder <b>Dip</b> (HSD). One of the main concerns for adopting HSD (refinishing) as a strategy to the tin whisker problem is the potential risk for thermally induced damage in the components when subjected to this process. This paper details a thermal modelling driven approach to the characterisation of the impact of <b>hot</b> solder <b>dipping</b> on electronic components. Main focus is on the evaluation of the re-finishing process effects on parts’ temperature gradients and heating/cooling rates, and on the advantages of applying an efficient model based process optimisation. Transient thermal finite element analysis is used to evaluate the temperature distribution in Quad Flat Package (QFP) variants during a double-dip <b>hot</b> solder <b>dipping</b> <b>process</b> developed by Micross Components Ltd. Full detailed three-dimensional (3 D) models of the components are developed using comprehensive characterisation of the respective package structures and materials based on X-ray, SEM-EDX, cross-sectional metallurgy and 3 D CT scan. The thermal modelling approach is validated using thermocouple measurement data for one of the studied parts and by comparing with model temperature predictions. Model results have informed the process optimisation strategy, and through experimentation key process parameters are alerted to provide optimal thermal characteristics. The optimised process settings result in temperature ramp rates at die level within recommended manufacture’s limit. A demonstration and discussion on the influence of the package internal structure and design on the thermal response to HSD is also provided...|$|R
