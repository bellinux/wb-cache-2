A viewer {{complained that}} the celebrities were likely to have used the US version of Proactiv, which differs from the UK version. According to the ASA, the celebrities had signed statements saying they had used the UK version {{for a few weeks}} one to three years earlier, but the advertisements gave the appearance that they had continued to benefit from <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> viewer's complaint was upheld.|$|E

25|$|According to Hindu belief, death {{happens on}} two levels: a {{physical}} death and a ritual death. The latter happens {{only after the}} kapala kriya ritual of the funeral, when the skull of the burnt corpse bursts or a hole is opened in <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> prana (life force) exits it. The corpse used for shava sadhana thus in an intermediate stage between life and death.|$|E
25|$|When {{the stadium}} was renovated in the mid-1970s, the plaque {{had to be}} moved from the directors' {{entrance}} to allow the necessary changes.

25|$|A graphic novel, {{illustrated}} by Steven Ross and adapted by Scott Rockwell, {{was first published}} as a four-part comic in 1991 by the Innovative Corporation, of Wheeling, WV and then published as a single volume by Corgi on 12 November 1992.

25|$|During the {{military}} regime known as the Revolución Libertadora that had deposed Perón's government in 1955, in 1957 and before the elections {{that had to be}} held in 1958, a Constitutional Convention was elected to reform the constitution. This reform does not include 1949's, implicitly annulling <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> text was based on the 1898 one. The only changes done were to include a summary of Perón's social articles known as article 14 bis (existing currently) and to establish the necessity to have a Labour and Social Security Code.|$|E
25|$|In {{perfectly}} competitive markets, firms {{decide the}} quantity {{to be produced}} based on marginal costs and sale price.

If the marginal cost is higher than the price, it would not be profitable to produce <b>it.</b> <b>So</b> <b>the</b> production will be carried out until the marginal cost is equal to the sale price. In other words, firms refuse to sell if the marginal cost is greater than the market price.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} nontrivial {{example of}} a vector bundle is the Möbius band (pictured on the right): a strip of paper with a twist in it, which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the Möbius band). K-theory is a tool for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings: elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> Möbius band represents {{an element of the}} K-group of a circle.|$|E

25|$|Houses {{were usually}} leased for the year, {{but also for}} longer terms, rent being paid in advance, half-yearly. The {{contract}} generally specified that the house be in good repair, and the tenant was bound to keep <b>it</b> <b>so.</b> <b>The</b> woodwork, including doors and door frames, was removable, and the tenant might bring and take away his own. The Code stipulated that if the landlord re-entered before the term was up, he must remit a fair proportion of the rent. Land could be leased {{for the purpose of}} building houses or other buildings on it, the tenant being rent-free for eight or ten years; after which the building came into the landlord's possession.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequency}} of the tone determined by how often a vortex encountered the hole while moving at some speed u less than the initial jet speed. Since the jet slowed as it proceeded toward the hole, {{the speed of the}} vortex slowed with <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> frequency and Strouhal number was greater at closer spacing. The Strouhal number data showed clearly the almost linear relation between frequency and initial jet speed. The number would be more constant if the actual jet speed at the hole could have been used as the characteristic speed. In four of the distances tested, there were jumps between Stage I and Stage II. The hysteresis loops are clear indications of the complex nature of the jet instability gain structure.|$|E
25|$|Before Baron Gautsch sailed {{one last}} time from Kotor back to Trieste, a conference of war naval {{authorities}} was held in Trieste. Baron Gautschs second officer Tenze was present {{as a representative of}} Captain Paul Winter. At the conference, the commanders of ships were informed that the Navy planned to set mine fields in the northern Adriatic {{in order to protect the}} entrance to its main naval port, Pula. Tenze informed his captain about <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> first officer Luppis set the ship's route for the following journey. Later, the crew of Baron Gautsch received further instructions regarding navigation from military authorities in Zadar via radio. On its way back, Baron Gautsch was carrying refugees from the territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina, people that were coming back home from holiday, including many women and children, as well as members of the Austro-Hungarian military that were on their way back to Austria. There were 66 crew members and 240 passengers on board (this data does not include children under 10 years of age and conscripted soldiers).|$|E

25|$|However, it is {{a simple}} {{accounting}} error to think, that the gross profit share of value-added is equal to true business profit, or that constant capital invested in physical assets (fixed equipment and inventories) represents the capital that an enterprise owns, other than a fund to pay wages, or that profits from product sales are the only net income the corporation has. That can be verified from any corporate balance sheet. If an enterprise borrows or leases capital for production, rather than investing its own, this affects the cost of capital that is tied up at any particular time. How the profitability of capital is accounted for, depends very much on who owns the capital, as distinct from who borrows it, or who uses <b>it.</b> <b>So</b> <b>the</b> rate of profit concept which Marx uses in his theoretical analysis of capitalist production (i.e. S/(C+V)) differs from the actual business concept of the rate of profit, because it disregards all sorts of financial and ownership issues, and because it concerns only part of the total circuit of capital.|$|E
25|$|Vang Pao moved three battalions {{back into}} a fertile rice growing area, the Muong Ngan valley. Next, he {{received}} reinforcements from the Royal Lao Army. With the 103rd Bataillon Parachutiste (103rd Parachute Battalion) added to the irregulars, the combined force moved down from their hill position to Phonsavan on 29 April. In {{the ruins of the}} town smashed by artillery and air strikes, they found two BTR-40 Armored Cars, 18 other vehicles, 12 37mm antiaircraft guns, and a 75mm howitzer, which they destroyed. Continuing through town two kilometers to the northwest, {{on the north side of}} Route 4 they uncovered a cave complex crammed with pre-positioned communist supplies. Behind barrels of rocks barricading cave entrances against air attack, they found 300 tons of medical supplies. Another cave contained hospital beds for 1,000 patients. Still another contained over a mile of supplies within it; as the cache was too big to ruin, local Buddhist monks were convinced to lay a curse upon <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> superstitious Pathet Lao would not reclaim the goods. There were operating theaters; one had a pair of X-ray machines. Air America flew in a cargo of varied explosives to destroy the goods. The 1,000 Hmong troops occupied Phonsavan for the first time since 1962; they did not have to fire a shot.|$|E
25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E
