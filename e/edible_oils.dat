40|$|<b>Edible</b> <b>oil</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} consumer items. Consumers use it in the preparation of food items every day. The demand for <b>edible</b> <b>oil</b> is growing because of the increase not only in population but also in their standard of living. The production of <b>edible</b> <b>oil</b> is carried out by both large and small firms. Owing to liberalization, the import of <b>edible</b> <b>oil</b> is also encouraged. The Government supplies <b>edible</b> <b>oil</b> through its Public Distribution Shops. Nowadays, big oil mills go for largescale production and reap the economies of scale of production. The profit in largescale units attracts many new firms to the market. The existing small firms are unable to compete with the large firms in marketing their products. Nowadays, the problem in <b>edible</b> <b>oil</b> market is not one of production but is one of marketing. Even though, there have been many previous studies related to production and economics of largescale production of <b>edible</b> <b>oil,</b> only a few studies have focused on the marketing of <b>edible</b> <b>oil.</b> In these studies, only the channels of distribution, marketing cost, market margin, package and advertisement have been discussed. But no studies focus on the marketing problems among the <b>edible</b> <b>oil</b> owners.

25|$|Rajasthan's {{economy is}} {{primarily}} agricultural and pastoral. Wheat and barley are cultivated over large areas, as are pulses, sugarcane, and oilseeds. Cotton and tobacco are the state's cash crops. Rajasthan {{is among the}} largest producers of <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> in India and the second largest producer of oilseeds. Rajasthan is also the biggest wool-producing state in India and the main opium producer and consumer. There are mainly two crop seasons. The water for irrigation comes from wells and tanks.

25|$|In the {{processing}} of <b>edible</b> <b>oils,</b> the oil is heated under vacuum to near the smoke point, and water is introduced {{at the bottom of}} the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam sparging removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization is key to the manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and canola oils found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors and flavors, and lightens the color of the oil.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the dish but a common one is made by soaking cooked rice in water overnight. Rice is boiled the usual way. Then phaen or starch is strained away. Rice is cooled in air temperature for 3–4 hours. Then cool water is added {{in a way that}} about an inch of water rises above the rice. Rice is generally covered with a light piece of fabric. 12–24 hours later panta bhat is ready. Care must be taken to cover the dish during the long soaking to avoid contamination. The soaked rice is usually eaten in the morning with salt, lime, chili (either raw or roasted) and onions (sliced or whole) mostly for flavor. Water is discarded before consumption. Sometimes <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> may be added.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to analyze the impact of <b>Edible</b> <b>Oil</b> Deficit on Food Expenditure in Pakistan for the period 1971 - 2008. <b>Edible</b> <b>oil</b> deficit {{is one of the major}} {{concerns}} for the policy makers in Pakistan.

It was found that long run negative relationship exists between <b>edible</b> <b>oil</b> deficit and food expenditure and hence the result derives the policy implication that there is a need to boost up the efforts in the agriculture sector to steadily increase the local production of oil seeds in the country.

25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, stir-frying and stir-frying followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, stir-frying and stir-frying combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according to this study are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an uncooked sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates and minerals. Stir-frying with soybean, peanut, safflower or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, and broccoli stir-fried with extra virgin olive oil or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to uncooked broccoli. These levels were significantly lower with other <b>edible</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|E

The relationship between food subsidy and food expenditure is found to be insignificant suggesting that due to improper targeting and consumer’s perception about quality and accessibility of subsidised food, Government’s food support programmes are not effective. <b>Edible</b> <b>Oil,</b> Production, Imports, Trade Deficit, Balance of Payments, International Trade, Oilseed Crops, Agriculture, Pakistan, <b>Edible</b> <b>Oil</b> Deficit, Demand Function, Food, Inflation, Food Inflation, Household Expenditure...|$|R
