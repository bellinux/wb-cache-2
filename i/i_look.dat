5|$|As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> {{back on it}} today, I see {{the whole}} picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be}} one of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how <b>I</b> <b>look,</b> but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I {{remember}} back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E

5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} 3 on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 131,000 copies in the United States. Ready was the second-highest debut of the week, only behind Whitney Houston's {{comeback}} album, <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> To You (2009). The album currently {{remains on the}} top half of the Billboard 200 and Top R/Hip-Hop Albums charts. On February 16, 2010, the album was certified gold in sales, by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), following shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States. It is Songz's first RIAA-certified album. As of June 11, 2014, Ready was officially certified platinum by the RIAA.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|My object {{has been}} to dramatize like the Greeks (a modest phrase!) {{striking}} passages of history, as they did of history & mythology.

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>Look</b> to You is {{the seventh}} and final studio album by American singer Whitney Houston. It was first {{released}} on August 28, 2009 through Sony Music in Europe, then August 31, 2009 with Arista Records in the United States before being released by RCA Records in the United Kingdom on October 19, 2009. The album was Houston's first studio album since 2003's , and the follow-up to 2002's Just Whitney.|$|E

25|$|The Easterner {{government}} of the 1580s are often accused of increasing {{the damage caused by}} the Imjin War in the 1590s. Though controversial, mainstream historians generally believe that Yi I advised the king to prepare 100,000 soldiers against possible foreign invasions. However, this was refused by Yu Seongryong, a major leader of the Easterners, because Yu believed that raising a large army would be harsh on the populace. However, Yi's worries were exemplified in 1592, when 200,000 Japanese soldiers invaded Busan. However, there is a theory that the advice was in fact a forgery invented by Yi's pupil Kim Jang-Saeng to make Yi <b>I</b> <b>look</b> wiser and to make Yu Seongryong look foolish.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama congratulated Trump, {{while also}} taking the {{opportunity}} to emphasise that action on climate change is a priority for Fiji: Fiji has {{a close relationship with}} the United States and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to working with you and your administration in the months and years ahead. We especially seek America's support in our struggle against the extreme weather events and rising sea levels caused by climate change, which pose a particular threat to the Pacific islands and other low lying areas of the world. We also look forward to working with you to protect our oceans and seas from the threat of pollution and overfishing. With every best wish as you prepare to assume the presidency.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the humiliation of demotion, he did not resign {{immediately}} from service {{and it has been}} suggested that this was because he needed his salary to support the publication of The Game Birds of India that he was working on. Hume retired from the civil service only in 1882. In 1883 he wrote an open letter to the graduates of Calcutta University, calling upon them to form their own national political movement. This led in 1885 to the first session of the Indian National Congress held in Bombay. In 1887 writing to the Public Commission of India he made what was then a statement unexpected from a civil servant — <b>I</b> <b>look</b> upon myself as a Native of India.|$|E

25|$|The {{only means}} {{which have been}} placed in my power of 'raising the wages of colliers' has been by endeavouring to beat down all those {{restrictions}} upon trade which tend to reduce the price to be obtained for the product of their labour, & to lower as much as may be the taxes on the commodities which they may require for use or for consumption. Beyond this <b>I</b> <b>look</b> to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, & in some foreign lands; & I need not remind you that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers & guardians of savings.|$|E
25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> over my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me that}} I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} primary campaign, Romney called Arizona’s approach to illegal immigration “a {{model for the}} nation.” He vowed that {{on his first day}} in office as president, he would {{bring an end to the}} lawsuits the Obama Administration’s Justice Department had brought challenging Arizona’s immigration policy. He also praised the anti-illegal immigration efforts of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a law professor who had drafted much of Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration enforcement law and similar measures around the country. Campaigning with Kobach in January 2012, Romney said, “We need more conservative leaders like Kris willing to stand up for the rule of law. With Kris on the team, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are stepping forward to address this problem.” When the Supreme Court struck down parts of Arizona's SB 1070 in June 2012, a Romney campaign spokesman said that Romney supports the rights of states to make their own immigration laws when the federal government has failed to address illegal immigration.|$|E
