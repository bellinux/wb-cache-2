This research conducted a city-wide econometric hedonic analysis with 2000 to 2004 Department of <b>Housing</b> <b>Control</b> data across different walking distances, subsystems (trunk, feeder), socio-economic strata and time. The main results showed that, {{with respect to the}} value of properties in relation to proximity, the housing market places value premiums on the properties in the immediate walking proximity of feeder lines. The analysis by socio-economic strata showed that middle-income properties were valued more if they fell closer to the system, while there were opposite results for low-income housing. Finally, analysis across time reflects slight average annual increases in property values correlated with the implementation of the system in two specific areas analyzed. Throughout the paper, the author acknowledges some of the challenges of using hedonic modeling for property value impact assessments and emphasizes that the interpretation of the results are case specific.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} structure, the {{financial}} viability of agro-processing industries {{and the effect}} of credit access on value addition by different agro-processing units in Oyo State, Nigeria. A multistage random sampling method was used to select a sample of 160 credit and non credit agro-processors of different types from each selected local government areas by using proportional allocation method. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The extent of value addition has been about 34 % and 20 % for credit and non credit users in the cassava mill sector respectively. The maximum value addition has been observed in fruits/vegetable processing (103 %) followed by cashew based units. The results obtained for the processors with credit indicated that they are efficient than their counterparts producing without credit. This result is expected and points to the positive impact of credit on value chain activities. There was under capacity utilization in almost all types of processing industries in the state due to lack of adequate supplies of raw material, bottlenecks in market penetration and marketing strategies, inadequate credit. The break-even output is very low hence the agro industries in the state were running into loss due to low capacity utilization. Improvement in basic infrastructure like developing railway links, metallic roads, cool chains, adequate/ uninterrupted power supply, disposal of sewage/ industrial effluents, <b>housing,</b> <b>control</b> of traffic congestion can bring a positive change on resource utilization...|$|E
40|$|A transportable, {{whole body}} {{indirect}} calorimeter, {{designed for use}} in the tropics, is described. The calorimeter was built to study energy expenditure of people having chronically or acutely low levels of food intake, and it will help to determine energy adaptations made by individuals with restricted food intake. The calorimeter comprises two units: a 27 m 3 ventilated chamber connected to an office <b>housing</b> <b>control</b> and monitoring equipment. The system also allows the experimenter to assess the rate of energy expenditure by means of a ventilated hood or a baby respiration chamber. The incoming air flow rate is variable and is typically set at approximately 30 l/min. Carbon dioxide production (VCO 2) and oxygen consumption (VO 2) are continuously monitored by means of differential gas analysers via a computerized data acquisition unit. Gas production/consumption rates are measured with a delay of 80 s, the complete response to step changes in VCO 2 or VO 2 consumption being calculated over 15 min using the rate of change terms in the gas exchange equations. The total electrical power required for the whole system is 12 kW. The calorimeter has been functioning for nearly 4 years in a rural village of The Gambia during which ambient temperatures have ranged from 16 to 44 degrees C and dewpoints from - 8 to 24 degrees C. The performance and accuracy of the calorimeter were tested using 20 per cent CO 2 in N 2 infusion and butane burning. Agreement between the theoretical and the measured values was found to be 99 per cent for VO 2 and 100 per cent for VCO 2 with a precision for both gases of +/- 10 ml/min over a 1 -h period...|$|E
40|$|Community {{is a key}} and contested concept much used {{in social}} {{sciences}} and public policy, including asylum and immigration policies. The notion of refugee community is often utilized uncritically to apply to national, ethnic or other groups, yet the existence of 'community' cannot be assumed. Where refugee community has been addressed, studies of refugee community organizations dominate. Less {{attention has been given}} to everyday experiences of people seeking asylum, particularly those living outside London following the introduction of compulsory dispersal. This ethnography results from fourteen months of fieldwork in the major dispersal city of Leeds in the north of England, and included people from over twelve countries at different stages of the asylum process. The research found that conditions in the country of origin and UK policies create insecurity that shape social life and affect the ways that 'community' is experienced. Policy infiltrates daily life through <b>housing</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms, shaping capacity for homemaking and affecting social relationships. In this precarious context secrecy is a vital tool in managing social life. Refugee community organizations, parties and social events form around nascent social groupings that include some and exclude others. Moving beyond recognition that divisions exist within 'communities', this research examines how boundaries operate in new UK social settings for recently-arrived refugees. Forms of familiarity and cultural reproduction are achieved through music, dancing, dress and food. Rather than simply representing 'home' culture, such practices create moments and places to contest both continuity and adaptation to the UK The central importance of food highlights the particular role of women in reproducing community - the ephemeral nature of eating and dancing enables a sense of shared values within the context of fluidity. Recently-arrived refugees do not live in a community, but engage with (or avoid) spatial and temporal realizations of community.

40|$|The role of {{land use}} {{planning}} system in housing development {{is not only to}} meet housing needs, but to also encourage the efficiency of the housing market system. The effectiveness {{of land use}} planning in Malaysia, however, is questionable due to the existence of housing oversupply. The shortcomings in the practice of housing planning have arguably contributed to the problem. The veracity of the argument has been proven in this empirical research conducted in the Johor Bahru Conurbation area. The research studied the effectiveness of the land use planning system measured in triangulation by examining the process of preparing development plans and the outcomes of planning control, followed by an analysis of the perceptions of respondents. Content analysis was applied to analyse selected structure plans, local plans and housing application files. The perceptions of town planners were analysed based on a structured questionnaire survey. To further explore the issues in the planning of housing supply, in-depth interviews were conducted with senior town planners. The research shows weaknesses occurring at several stages, beginning with the activities of housing forecast and formulation of housing policies, followed by the determination of land area and distribution of locations for future housing development. The situation was further exacerbated by the inefficiency of the local planning authority in approving new housing applications. The study also reveals several issues inherent in the processes of the planning of housing supply. Among them are the difficulty in considering and forecasting `effective demand’ for housing, vagueness of policies on <b>housing</b> <b>control</b> and the problems related to the compliance of land use zoning. The study also found that the ineffectiveness of the planning system occurred due to over emphasis on meeting housing needs, while ignoring other important aspects, i. e. households ‘effective demand’, housing preferences and local housing market demands. The findings of the research indicate an urgent need for a change in the approach and practice of housing planning in the development plans and planning control. This can be achieved with the improvement of current housing planning activities as well as through enhancing responsiveness of the local planning authority to market demand mechanisms without neglecting the fundamental goal of meeting housing need...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} airways that disproportionately affects low-income and minority children in the United States. Some studies have found a clear link between poor housing quality and exposure to allergen triggers associated with increased risk of asthma. Other studies have evaluated the relationship between stressful circumstances due to chronic illness, premature birth or violence on asthma outcomes. Psychological stress is thought to weaken the immune and neuroendocrine response making the body more vulnerable to environmental allergens. Studies have been done {{to assess the impact}} of psychological stress due to violence or the care of long term-critically ill children on increased asthma morbidity. However, asthma morbidity is not equal in all low-income and minority communities. It is possible that a form of stress - housing stress - which results from living in substandard housing conditions, may in fact provide more insight into the pathways linking indoor home exposures and stress in a way that leads to greater asthma susceptibility. Few studies have been done {{to assess the impact of}} stress due to substandard housing conditions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of severe housing stress due to dilapidation, mold and a lack of <b>housing</b> <b>control</b> on child asthma control and on caregiver asthma-related quality of life. METHODS: A total of 143 children with asthma living in Boston, Massachusetts and between the ages of 4 and 18 were enrolled in the Boston Allergen Sampling Study between 2008 and 2011. Home visits were conducted to measure the levels of common allergens in the home and assess child asthma control, housing stress, perceived stress, and caregiver asthma-related quality of life. Housing stress was assessed based on resident perceptions of dilapidation, mold, and a lack of housing control; perceived stress for the caregiver was assessed using the Perceived-Stress Scale (PSS); child asthma control was assessed using Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores; and caregiver asthma-related quality of life was assessed using the Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life (PACQOL) questionnaires. RESULTS: In a multivariate logistic regression severe housing stress was associated with 7. 5 times increased odds of poor asthma control (OR = 7. 51, 95 %CI 2. 7 to 20. 79, p< 0. 0001) for the child and 3. 0 times increased odds of poor caregiver asthma-related quality of life (OR = 3. 02, 95 %CI 1. 37 to 6. 63, p< 0. 006). This association was significant after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of allergen exposure, the association between severe housing stress and asthma health outcomes for both the child and caregiver indicate that there is an emotional stress-based pathway directly tied to poor housing quality that poses increased risk for worse asthma health outcomes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the passing}} 20 years, China’s urban housing {{market has been}} {{experiencing}} a rapid development period. As an essential pillar industry, the housing sector drives the development of over 60 industries and even contributes dramatically to the whole economy. The rapid development pace of the housing sector is mainly due to {{the rapid growth of}} the investment in housing industry, which leads to the significant rising of land price and housing price. However, the housing market is special compared with other markets. The unique characteristics of housing determine the housing market embodies its own special characteristics. Both of the special characteristics lead to the phenomenon of the simultaneous existing of market failure and policy failure. Hence, it is of great importance for the government to intervene in the housing market to achieve the policy goal of sustainable social development and equity chance of home ownership. Generally, there are 4 types of control tools that the government could take to regulate the housing industry, namely financial tools, fiscal tools, land policy and administrative policy, the mechanism and effectiveness of which is largely differentiated from each other. Firstly, as a capital-intensive industry, the supply and demand of housing are inseparable from financial support. The impact of financial policy on housing market is achieved by means of deposit rate and loan rate. However, since the financial tools is more obvious on housing supply and the expectation that continuous growing of housing price of residents is strong, the effectiveness of the financial control tools is not obvious on controlling the housing price. Secondly, fiscal policies, mainly tax, {{have an impact on the}} housing market, but there is a certain amount of time lag of the control tools of tax no matter in the regulation of the structure of housing market or in the regulation of the supply and demand of housing. The effectiveness of tax is obvious since it directly affects the cost of the developers and the buyers. Thirdly, land policy affects the housing market by controlling the amount of land supply or arranging different land uses to inhibit or encourage housing demand. However, from the practical effect of land policy on the control of housing price, the actual result is relatively poor because the land price doesn’t effectively control the housing price. Finally, administrative policy is the special characteristic of macro-control tools in China, and affects the housing market by controlling the development and transaction process. The effectiveness is direct and manifest but differs among the districts. Overall, due to the low efficiency of the government, the administrative interference in the housing market did not achieve the expected market reaction. The analysis of the macro control tools and the effectiveness on controlling the housing price in China could provide enlightenments for the further making and implementation of <b>housing</b> <b>control</b> tools. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E
