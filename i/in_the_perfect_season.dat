5000|$|Stories abound about Csonka's toughness. He {{broke his}} nose about ten times playing {{football}} in high school, college, and the pros, {{causing it to}} be permanently deformed, and he would remain in the game with blood pouring out of it. He {{may be the only}} running back to receive a personal foul for unnecessary roughness while running the ball, when, in a game against the Buffalo Bills in 1970, he knocked out Safety John Pitts with a forearm shot that was more like a right cross. In a close game against the Minnesota Vikings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>season</b> of 1972, Csonka was hit in the back by linebacker Roy Winston in a tackle so grotesque it was shown on The Tonight Show. Csonka thought his back was broken and he actually crawled off the field. Once on the sideline, he [...] "walked it off" [...] and in a few minutes was back in the game. His return to the game was crucial, as the winning touchdown pass to tight end Jim Mandich was set up by a fake to Csonka. He was named the 10th toughest football player of all time in the 1996 NFL Films production The NFL's 100 Toughest Players. Dolphins' offensive line coach Monte Clark was asked about Csonka's bruising running style, and he responded, [...] "When Csonka goes on safari, the lions roll up their windows." ...|$|E

60|$|The first flower-stems {{which were}} thrown up by some plants in my {{greenhouse}} bore only cleistogamic flowers. The petals of small size remained permanently closed over the reproductive organs, but their white tips {{could just be}} seen between the almost completely closed sepals. The pollen, which was scanty in amount, but not so scanty as in Viola or Oxalis, remained enclosed within the anthers, whence the tubes proceeded and penetrated the stigma. As the ovarium swelled the little withered corolla was carried upwards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a cap. These cleistogamic flowers produced an abundance of seed. Later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>perfect</b> flowers appeared. With plants {{in a state of}} nature the flowers open only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early morning, as I have been informed by Mr. Wallis, who particularly attended to the time of their flowering. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of D. Anglica, the still folded petals on some plants in my greenhouse opened just sufficiently to leave a minute aperture; the anthers dehisced properly, but <b>the</b> pollen-grains adhered <b>in</b> a mass to them, and thence emitted their tubes, which penetrated the stigmas. These flowers, therefore, were in an intermediate condition, and could not be called either perfect or cleistogamic.|$|R
