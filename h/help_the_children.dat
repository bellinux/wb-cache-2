Members of the confraternity serve as teachers in the Sunday Schools of the parish (there are seven different Sunday Schools belonging to Mt. St. Peter's in total). These teachers send out the Catholic messages of faith and love through words, stories, examples, and prayers in order to <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> grow in their faith.

25|$|Seeing {{how fast}} the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the {{children}} all drive to the beach {{in order to get}} the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're glad that the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided to listen to his father and come <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} {{structured}} interviews {{to examine the}} views of 101 South Australian immigrant families, grouped by country of origin, concerning their educational expectations for their children ages birth to 8 years. The overall research questions were: (1) What are the parental expectations of immigrant groups for the early education of their children? (2) How do these educational expectations differ and are there commonalities across the selected groups? (3) What are early childhood teachers' educational expectations for <b>the</b> <b>children</b> they teach? and (4) What are the areas of congruence or difference between the expectations of parents and teachers? The findings indicated differences between groups and between parents and teachers in the importance placed on early childhood education, preparing <b>the</b> <b>child</b> for school, <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> social and emotional growth, <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> moral growth, <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> to care for <b>the</b> environment, and <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> adjust to school (social aspect).

2500|$|Baden-Powell {{wanted a}} Scout {{to learn to}} make his own decisions, as he felt this would <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> grow and mature. Baden-Powell wrote that a Scout should paddle his own canoe, metaphorically speaking. He should travel not in a rowing boat, with his back to where he goes, rowed by others and someone else at the rudder, but alone in a canoe: facing the future, {{paddling}} and steering by himself. Scouting teaches self-reliance by bringing the Scouts into a challenging, somewhat risky environment, without help in the direct neighbourhood.

2500|$|Concerns {{have often}} been raised over the buying public's moral {{complicity}} in purchasing products assembled or otherwise manufactured in developing countries with child labour. However, others have raised concerns that boycotting products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or strenuous professions, such as prostitution or agriculture. For example, a UNICEF study found that after the Child Labour Deterrence Act {{was introduced in the}} US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in Bangladesh, leaving many to resort to jobs such as [...] "stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution", jobs that are [...] "more hazardous and exploitative than garment production".

2500|$|Maxine McCarty Gray, {{played by}} Tyne Daly: She is Amy's widowed mother. A social worker for the Department of Children and Families, she had retired, but {{she returns to}} the job {{at the start of}} the series. She is willing to do {{whatever}} it takes to <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> in her care, even bending the law. She is an opinionated, strong-willed woman, very set in her ways, and capable of holding long grudges (she has not spoken to her brother in over 12 years), but loving to her family. Her relationship with daughter Amy is often not easy, since they are so much alike. After a troubled courtship, she becomes engaged to a wealthy businessman, Jared Duff, but he dies 48 hours before their wedding (a storyline twist necessitated by the unexpected death of the actor Richard Crenna, who played the character). She later becomes involved in a very complicated, on again off again relationship to her landscape designer Ignacio Messina. She has two heart attacks in the last season and has to undergo open heart surgery, but makes certain lifestyle changes and recovers well. At the end of the series she accepts Ignacio's marriage proposal and is set to retire again, becoming a foster parent to the last child she helped.|$|E
