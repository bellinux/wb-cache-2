5|$|Leucopaxillus giganteus {{can form}} fairy rings in grassy areas like pastures, {{and is also}} found along roadsides; it {{produces}} fruiting bodies <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn. It is a saprobic species, and so derives nutrients by decomposing organic matter.|$|E
5|$|The Murray River and {{southern}} tributaries originally displayed {{a pattern of}} high flows in winter, high flows and floods in spring, and low flows <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn. The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish was adapted to these natural flow patterns. River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns, with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn and low flows in winter and spring. Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse have been completely eliminated.|$|E

5|$|Banksia verticillata, {{commonly}} known as granite banksia or Albany banksia, is a species of shrub or (rarely) tree of the genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. It is native to the southwest of Western Australia and can reach up to 3m (10ft) in height. It can grow taller to 5m (16ft) in sheltered areas, and much smaller in more exposed areas. This species has elliptic green leaves and large, bright golden yellow inflorescences or flower spikes, appearing <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn. The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) is the most prominent pollinator, although several other species of honeyeater, as well as bees, visit the flower spikes.|$|E

5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> the other half in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This {{is the reason why}} the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies grow scattered or {{in groups}} on the ground under hardwood trees.

5|$|Changes in {{the water}} regime due to the {{construction}} of the Ithai barrage across the Manipur River have caused changes in the vegetation composition of the phumdis. A study was instituted, from October 2005 to July 2006, to record the vegetation composition and productivity of phumdis in areas of ranging thickness, water depth and soil pH, accumulating data in both summer and winter. The study recorded 83 plant species of 21 families (Poaceae and Cyperaceae formed the dominant families); 81 species were recorded <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> 48 in winter.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> {{live off}} fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile Atlantic and Pacific salmon, herring, capelin and American sand lance, {{as well as}} Atlantic mackerel, pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.|$|E

5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where they appear <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech forest on calcareous soil.|$|E
