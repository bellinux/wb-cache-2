Aimed at promoting informed consumer choice, COOL required retailers to disclose the covered products 2 ̆ 7 origin. In prior decisions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (2 ̆ 2 GATT 2 ̆ 2) art. III: 4, the AB correctly rejected protectionist rules that unnecessarily encumbered consumer choice by adversely affecting conditions of competition for imports. In US–COOL, however, the AB formalistically transposed such GATT jurisprudence into TBT analysis, equating private action in compliance with neutral, transparency-promoting labeling rules to private action in compliance with capricious, opacity-inducing distribution rules. This article argues that, while GATT NT-jurisprudence should enlighten analysis under the TBT, WTO adjudicators should not allow exporting Members 2 ̆ 7 perceived entitlement to trade volumes—which may well be premised on continued opacity and uninformed consumer choice—to interfere with <b>importing</b> <b>Members</b> 2 ̆ 7 origin-neutral regulations...|$|E

30|$|This paper aims {{to enhance}} our {{understanding}} of the relationship between RTAs and agricultural technology and productivity. The implementation of an RTA is expected to induce increases in market competition levels, in domestic markets through increases in imports and in foreign markets through increases in exports. These increases in market competition levels could eventually result in important implications for agricultural technology and productivity in <b>importing</b> and exporting <b>member</b> countries of regional trading blocs. This paper examines these implications in the context of Viner’s (1950) conventional partial equilibrium framework with perfectly elastic foreign supply schedules faced by the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> country, and in the context of Pomfret’s (1986) extended partial equilibrium framework depicting upward-sloping foreign supply schedules for the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> country.|$|R
40|$|WHILE it is {{accepted}} that {{the category of}} "developing country" is a broad one, it can nevertheless be acknowledged that the countries which fall within this categorisation share several common features. Such common features include their lack of financial resources and scientific capacity, and their reliance on trade in primary agricultural goods. The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures was originally created to regulate trade in primary agricultural goods, and so its provisions are of great significance to developing countries. In its Preamble the Agreement acknowledges both the unique circumstances of developing countries and its desire {{to assist them in}} entering into and expanding within the international trading markets. As part of this endeavour, several provisions were included in the Agreement which purport to protect and provide for the interests of developing countries. In its inception, its Preamble, and the very nature of its content, the Agreement shows a desire to assist developing countries wherever possible. Unfortunately, a close analysis of the provisions of the Agreement shows that this desire has not been fulfilled. Many of the provisions of the Agreement are heavily skewed toward the interests of <b>importing</b> <b>Members,</b> often at the expense of developing Members - particularly those that export primary agricultural goods. Even the provisions of the Agreement which purport to provide protection and special and differential treatment specifically for developing countries frequently fall short, either as a result of ambiguous phrasing or poor textual interpretation by the dispute settlement bodies of the World Trade Organization. As a result, there exists a potential within the Agreement to have a significant detrimental impact on the international trading opportunities of exporting developing countries. In this thesis I analyse the provisions of the Agreement to determine where, why and how they are likely to have, or are having, a detrimental impact on developing countries (particularly exporting developing countries). After identifying these problems I examine and discuss several potential solutions and how they may be implemented to minimise - or even remove - the negative impact on developing countries and their international trading markets...|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} for achieving {{this result is}} as follows. The exporting member state zero-rates the VAT. This means that the member state of the exporting merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> state [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> state at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges VAT on resale in the normal way.|$|R
30|$|The {{analytical}} {{literature has}} {{paid little attention}} to adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity, which are typically associated with shifts in supply curves, when examining the effects of RTAs on agricultural trade and welfare through the conventional frameworks. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing the implications of RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity for the effects of RTAs on agricultural trade and welfare. It investigates the relationship between RTAs and agricultural technology and productivity in the context of Viner’s (1950) conventional partial equilibrium framework with perfectly elastic foreign supply schedules faced by the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> country. It also examines this relationship in the context of Pomfret’s (1986) extended partial equilibrium framework depicting upward-sloping foreign supply schedules for the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> country.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} the tariff liberalization in four largest CARICOM countries (Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago) on their trade flows. I trace changes in the product-line imports from CARICOM and non-CARICOM countries against time and commodity-level variation in external tariffs. I find that in each country the reduction of the external tariff, which eroded preferences enjoyed by <b>member</b> <b>imports,</b> increased the ratio of imports from non-member countries to <b>imports</b> from <b>member</b> countries. In Trinidad and Tobago, the higher ratio was largely the result of non-member <b>imports</b> crowding out <b>member</b> <b>imports.</b> In the three other countries, the ratio increased mainly because of higher non-member imports; {{there is little evidence that}} tariff reductions had an impact on <b>member</b> <b>imports.</b> Findings suggest that in Trinidad and Tobago liberalization of the external tariff reversed some of the trade diversion effects of CARICOM. ...|$|R

These effects are expected to induce adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and exporting countries.

Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: New York, NY, 1950) conventional partial equilibrium framework with perfectly elastic foreign supply schedules faced by the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> country. It also examines these implications in the context of Pomfret’s (Review of World Economics, 122 (3) : 439 – 465, 1986) extended partial equilibrium framework depicting upward-sloping foreign supply schedules for the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> country. The analysis underscores important changes and redistributions through the RTA’s initial benefits and losses, following the RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity.

30|$|Alternatively, the {{formation}} of an RTA could lessen the incentives of domestic firms in the agricultural sector of <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> countries to implement technology and productivity upgrading policies. These implications could arguably occur since RTA-induced increases in imports would raise the market competition levels and, consequently, would lead to reductions in the price-to-cost margins. This situation could reduce the market share of domestic firms and the expected returns from technology and productivity upgrading investments, and from innovation activities in general (Aghion and Howitt, 1998; Funk, 2003; Ghazalian, 2012).|$|R

30|$|The seminal partial {{equilibrium}} {{framework of}} Viner (1950) indentifies the principal implications of RTAs through the trade creation {{and the trade}} diversion effects. The trade creation effect implies that the removal (or reduction) of policy trade barriers (e.g., tariffs) between RTA member countries leads {{to an increase in}} international trade flows between them, displacing less efficient domestic production. This effect generates positive welfare implications for the <b>importing</b> RTA <b>member</b> country. The trade diversion effect implies that the regional trade preferences induce a diversion of trade from the more efficient RTA non-member country to the less efficient RTA member country. This effect results in negative welfare implications for the <b>importing</b> RTA <b>member</b> country.|$|R

For instance, the number of RTAs that {{have been reported to}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) exceeded 500 in 2012 (WTO, 2012). RTAs normally encompass reductions (or eliminations) of policy trade barriers (e.g., tariffs, non-tariff barriers) between member countries. Also, RTAs often bring about higher levels of business cooperation and trade facilitation measures (e.g., development of regional trade-enhancing infrastructure) between member countries that further promote intra-regional trade flows. RTAs are commonly associated with increases in intra-regional trade flows in agricultural productsa. Naturally, such increases in intra-regional trade would be accompanied with a rise in market competition levels, in domestic agricultural markets for producers in <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> countries and in foreign regional agricultural markets for producers in exporting member countries.|$|R
