Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Current space suits {{have limited}} {{movement}} due to gas pressurization during {{exposure to the}} vacuum of space. Alternatively, if pressure is applied by an elastic garment vs. pneumatic garment to produce mechanical counter pressure (MCP), several advantages are possible. In this study, we investigate local microcirculatory and other effects produced with and without a prototype MCP <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> sleeve during exposure to varying levels of vacuum. METHODS: The entire arms of eight male volunteers were studied at normal ambient pressure and during 5 min exposures to - 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg with and without the MCP <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> sleeve. Pressure distribution, skin microvascular flow, and temperature were measured. RESULTS: The MCP <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> sleeve generated over 200 mm Hg on the middle finger, dorsum of the hand, and the wrist. However, pressure was significantly lower on the forearm and the upper arm. Without the <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> sleeve, only two of eight subjects tolerated - 100 mm Hg. Also, no subject tolerated - 150 mm Hg. However, subjects tolerated all vacuum pressures wearing the <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> sleeve. Skin microvascular flow and temperature remained within control values with the <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> sleeve at a chamber pressure of - 150 mm Hg. DISCUSSION: The MCP <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> sleeve counteracts adverse effects of vacuum exposures due to lower pressure differentials. Pressure levels over the hand and wrist {{are similar to those}} of the current U. S. space suit <b>glove</b> <b>and</b> sleeve, but additional development is required to increase MCP over the forearm and upper arm...|$|R

5|$|Shoe polish {{contains}} {{chemical substances}} {{which can be}} absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. When handling shoe polish, one should ideally wear <b>gloves,</b> <b>and</b> stay in a well-ventilated area. Shoe polish should be kept {{out of reach of}} children and animals. It can stain the skin for a protracted period of time, and will cause irritation to the eye if there is direct contact.|$|E
5|$|When the College {{first opened}} in 1888 {{there was no}} uniform, instead the girls wore long cotton dresses, <b>gloves</b> <b>and</b> hat. A straw boater was {{introduced}} in the early 20th century, worn with a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its burning bush woven into it in red. During this time Prefects wore red silk arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} kept as pets, cats are also used in the {{international}} fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets and stuffed toys; and shoes, <b>gloves</b> <b>and</b> musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are {{needed to make a}} cat fur coat). This use has now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.|$|E

5|$|He is the player's first {{opponent}} {{in all of}} his roles and is famous for his weakness and cowardice. These elements are considered by critics to be stereotypes of French people. These characteristics were emphasized by the developer of the Wii game which included cutscenes which depict Glass Joe in French settings. Glass Joe {{is considered one of the}} most well-known characters in the Punch-Out!! series and a Nintendo icon. His name has been used to describe poor performance by sportspeople and teams. In The Wii game his dialogue consists of him pleading not for the player to strike him in the jaw, complaints about the tightness of his <b>gloves,</b> <b>and</b> counting to ten in French.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} this {{certainty}} was that the investigation was poorly conducted. The crime scene was not secured and searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved.

5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing <b>gloves</b> <b>and</b> shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, <b>gloves,</b> <b>and</b> handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather <b>gloves</b> <b>and</b> protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
