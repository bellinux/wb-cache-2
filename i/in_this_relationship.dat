Due to her rebellious and emotionless attitude, she is often annoyed by her co-workers, especially Leslie. She has a boyfriend named Derek, who is openly gay and dating another openly gay boy named Ben. Despite being <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship,</b> April begins to develop a crush on Andy, as {{he is one of}} the few people that has the ability to make her smile. She goes so far as to accept a job as Ron's assistant just so she can stay in the parks department and see Andy.|$|E
5|$|Mirror {{symmetry}} {{was originally}} discovered by physicists. Mathematicians became interested <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> around 1990 when Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes {{showed that it}} {{could be used as a}} tool in enumerative geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the number of solutions to geometric questions. Candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold, thus solving a longstanding problem. Although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise way, some of its mathematical predictions have since been proven rigorously.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{scholars}} {{debate the}} influence of politics in determining union strength in the US and other countries. One argument is that political parties play an expected role in determining union strength, with left-wing governments generally promoting greater union density, while others contest this finding by pointing out important counterexamples and explaining the reverse causality inherent <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{decline of}} Constantinople– a main trading partner of Kievan Rus'– played a {{significant}} role in the decline of the Kievan Rus'. The trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly Byzantine) through eastern Europe to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. Kiev was the main power and initiator <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship,</b> once the Byzantine Empire fell into turmoil and the supplies became erratic, profits dried out, and Kiev lost its appeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} parsec as a unit of {{distance}} follows naturally from Bessel's method, because the distance in parsecs can be computed simply as the reciprocal of the parallax angle in arcseconds (i.e. if the parallax angle is 1 arcsecond, the object is 1pc from the Sun; if the parallax angle is 0.5 arcseconds, the object is 2pc away; etc.). No trigonometric functions are required <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> because the very small angles involved mean that the approximate solution of the skinny triangle can be applied.|$|E

25|$|There {{were not}} nearly enough troops to defend Byzantium's borders {{at the time and}} there {{certainly}} was not enough for the two factions to split; consequently, foreigner mercenaries were brought in. Kantakouzenos hired Turks and Serbs — his main supply of Turkish mercenaries came from the Bey of Aydin, a nominal ally established by Andronikos III. The Regency of John V relied on Turkish mercenaries as well. However, Kantakouzenos began to draw support from the Ottoman Sultan Orhan, who wed Kantakouzenos' daughter in 1345. By 1347, Kantakouzenos had triumphed and entered Constantinople. However, in his hour of victory, he came to an accord with Anna and her son, John V: John V (now 15 years of age) and Kantakouzenos would rule as co-emperors, though John V would be the junior <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship.</b> This unlikely partnership was not destined to last long.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between smoking and schizophrenia is well established, a factor to be considered <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> {{is the role of}} the tobacco industry. Research based on internal industry documents shows a concerted effort by the industry to promote belief that people with schizophrenia need to smoke and that it is dangerous for them to quit. Such promotion includes monitoring or supporting research that endorsed the idea that people with schizophrenia are uniquely immune to the health consequences of smoking (since proved false) and that tobacco is needed for people with schizophrenia to self-medicate. The industry also provided cigarettes to hospital wards and supported efforts to block hospital-based smoking bans. Although this does not discredit the effects of nicotine in schizophrenia, it is argued that the efforts of the tobacco industry slowed the decline in smoking prevalence in people with schizophrenia as well as the development of clinical policies to promote smoking cessation.|$|E

25|$|Alex {{returns to}} the city alone and goes to Robert's house with the {{intention}} of killing him. Alex falls asleep in his car outside the house and is awoken by Robert who invites him in. As he retrieves the gun from the glove box, he discovers an envelope containing the results of Vera's pregnancy test and a letter written by Vera on the back. The film cuts to a flashback of the time Robert came to Alex's home while he was away. It is revealed that the day before, Vera attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on pills but is saved by Robert. The next day, Vera finds out she is pregnant and confides with Robert, revealing that she never had an affair and that the baby was in fact Alex's, even though she says it felt like it wasn't his as they hardly ever talk. She expressed concerns about having another baby <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> that was lacking communication.|$|E
25|$|John's {{marriage}} {{was never a}} happy one. Rumors circulated that {{at the age of}} 25 {{he fell in love with}} Eugênia José de Menezes, his wife's chaperone. She became pregnant, and John was suspected of being the father. The case was hushed up, and the young woman was sent to Spain to bear the child. She gave birth to a daughter, whose name is unknown. The mother lived the rest of her life in nunneries and John supported her economically. Historians Tobias Monteiro and Patrick Wilcken write that there are indications that John also had a homosexual relationship as a sexual outlet, given his disastrous marriage, in which he lived apart from his wife, with whom he was together only on ceremonial occasions. His partner <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> would have been his favorite manservant, Francisco José Rufino de Sousa Lobato, who, according to these historians, may have regularly masturbated his master. While it may have been out of sheer malice, a priest named Miguel stated that he once stumbled upon the scene and therefore was deported to Angola, but not before leaving written testimony. Regardless of the truth or falsity of the claim, Rufino de Sousa received a variety of honors, accumulating among others the charges of adviser to the king, secretary of the Casa do Infantado, secretary of the Bureau of Conscience and Orders (Mesa de Consciência e Ordens) and governor of the Santa Cruz fortress. He also received the title of Baron and later Viscount of Vila Nova da Rainha.|$|E

500|$|Homosexual or {{bisexual}} activity also occurs between gods, {{although such}} interactions are most usually considered purely ritualistic, or have purposes other than sexual pleasure.

[...] Although married to the goddess Svaha, Agni is also shown as {{being part of a}} same-sex couple with Soma, the god of the moon. Agni takes a receptive role <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship,</b> accepting semen from Soma with his mouth, paralleling Agni's role in accepting sacrifices from Earth to Heaven. Orthodox Hinduism emphasises that these are [...] "mithuna", ritual sexual encounters, and Agni and his mouth represent the feminine role.|$|E

He views Tokyo as a father figure, and his Yurine as a mother figure; and aims to supplant the city's role <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship.</b> Eko was a nameless character in the initial draft and known as [...] "Another Karas" [...] with a different appearance, although his prosthetic left leg is retained for the final version.|$|E

500|$|The fiction film {{tells the}} story of a young woman who has a routine job in a shoe factory in provincial Czechoslovakia. [...] When the army holds {{maneuvers}} near her home town, the factory supervisor organizes a mixer for the largely female workforce and the all-male soldiers. [...] This dance proves a mixed success, with many of the soldiers, who are middle-aged reservists, and many of the factory workers, who are inexperienced young women with idealized views of romance, being confused by and disappointed with their potential dancing partners. The film's protagonist, though, does meet an attractive young man who plays in the dance band and has a one-night fling with him. When she travels to the capital city where he lives in order to resume their romance, she meets his parents and comes to the realization that there is no future <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E

Hathor can even be called [...] "the Eye of Horus"—one of several ways in which the distinctions between the two eyes are blurred. The Eye can also act as an extension of and companion to Atum, a creator god closely associated with Ra. Sometimes this eye is called the Eye of Atum, although at other times the Eye of Ra and the Eye of Atum are distinct, with Ra's Eye the sun and Atum's Eye the moon.|$|E
