5|$|Should a new tunnel be built, {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} run next to the Oslo Tunnel. One proposal from the National Rail Administration calls for a separate commuter train station to be built underground, {{at the location of}} Oslo Bus Terminal, within walking distance of OsloS. This proposal involves the line connecting to the existing route before reaching Nationaltheatret. The lobby organisation Norsk Bane <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> line to run further north, and serve Majorstuen, where there is a major metro and tramway hub. Norsk Bane also call for the tunnel to be built for higher speeds, and state {{that it is necessary to}} build high-speed rail to Bergen and Stavanger. Combined with a new line from Drammen to the tunnel, it would allow travel time from Drammen and Oslo to be reduced to 18 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Furry Creek is the {{location}} of a new upscale golf course and resort development. Proposals <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new highway from Vancouver via the Capilano River watershed would emerge on Highway 99 at Furry Creek. However, the fact that this route traverses the Lower Mainland's Capilano watershed creates nearly insurmountable political obstacles to its construction.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{advocates for}} radical reform in justice systems <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> public policy {{adoption}} of non-punitive, non-violent Restorative Justice methods, {{and many of}} those studying the success of these methods, including a , have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace. From the late 2000s on, a Theory of Active Peace has been proposed which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory.|$|E
25|$|Three new underpasses {{for road}} traffic were built under {{the line at}} the station in 1991. Since 2012 a new {{high-speed}} section of the Vestfold Line is being built between Porsgrunn and Farriseidet, and thus Eidanger Station will in the future only be located on the Brevik Line. Proposals <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bicycle path to be laid on the old section of track, which would see Eidanger as the point of origin.|$|E

25|$|In July 2009, South Africa was {{hit with}} rolling protests by poor {{communities}} that demanded access to basic services, jobs, adequate housing and the democratisation of service delivery. These protests {{have been linked to}} the World Cup as protesters complain that public funds are being diverted away from social issues to build stadiums and upgrade airports. Fears have been expressed that the growing protests by shack dwellers could result in the tournament being disrupted. Some grassroots social movements <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> boycott of the event.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{has been}} criticised by judges {{on the basis}} that it does not {{incorporate}} all the rights in the Convention into domestic law. Legal commentators have also pointed out that the Convention is not a modern human rights instrument and was drafted in the 1940s as a response to specific historical circumstances. The values which it embodies are said to be those of a different generation and omits in particular children's rights, information rights and socio-economic rights. Senior judges <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more critical approach.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} some Chinese {{citizens}} <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reassessment of the protests and compensation {{from the government}} to victims' families. One group in particular, Tiananmen Mothers, seeks compensation, vindication for victims {{and the right to}} receive donations from within the mainland and abroad. Zhang Shijun, a former soldier who was involved in the military crackdown, had published an open letter to President Hu Jintao seeking to have the government reevaluate its position on the protests. He was subsequently arrested and taken from his home.|$|E

25|$|Teoh Beng Hock (20 April 1979 – 16 July 2009) was a Malaysian {{journalist}} and political aide to Ean Yong Hian Wah, {{a member of}} the Selangor state legislative assembly and state executive council. On 15 July 2009, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) took Teoh into custody for questioning about allegations of corruption. Teoh was found dead the next morning on the rooftop of a building adjacent to the MACC offices. Pakatan Rakyat leaders and a number of federal government officials <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Royal Commission of inquiry into Teoh's death.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} has revived debate concerning police use of Tasers. This was the 16th death {{following the}} police use of Tasers in Canada since 2003 {{and civil liberties}} groups <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moratorium on Tasers until training and procedures can be developed and implemented to minimize the risks. The human rights group Amnesty International repeated its call for Taser use to be suspended until an independent investigation into the medical and other effects has taken place. Meanwhile, Canada's seventeenth Taser-related death occurred {{less than a week}} later when Quilem Registre died after being tasered by police in Montreal.|$|E
25|$|MART {{stated that}} it did not believe the public was {{consulted}} properly and that the information provided by supporters of the charge was biased and insufficient. MART started a legal petition calling for a referendum on a directly elected mayor who would lead Bury council and be able to withdraw Bury's support from the scheme. This required 7,099people or 5% of the Bury electorate to sign the petition. Some councillors for Bury <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> referendum directly on the congestion charge. MART has launched similar petitions in the other seven districts of Greater Manchester that support the TiF bid.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, American {{intellectual}} Noam Chomsky argued that Israeli {{claims that the}} Palestinian leadership rejected the international consensus calling for a Palestinian state, with borders along the Green Line, were {{not consistent with the}} documented record. In 2008 Al Jazeera and Haaretz both reported that elements in the Palestinian leadership, even inside Hamas, <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> two-state settlement based on the pre-June 1967 borders (the Green Line). Although Hamas' official policy is committed to Israel's destruction, Ismail Haniya, the prime minister of the Palestinian unity government until June 2007, suggested that a long-term truce with Israel could be achieved if Israel withdrew from territory occupied in 1967.|$|E
25|$|There are {{suggestions}} {{about a new}} larger border checkpoint to be built on the Norwegian side, as the current station has insufficient capacity to handle increased traffic, and the ground is not sufficiently stable to allow an expansion at the current site. Individual Norwegian police executives <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> common border checkpoint located directly on the border line. This would allow for a more cost-effective and less time-consuming operation. However, Norwegian and Russian legislation, {{as well as the}} Schengen Agreement, prohibit such an operation. The Parliament of Norway's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has taken initiative to introduce a 24-hour-a-day opening time at the crossing; this has been rejected by the local police district, who stated that nearly all trans-border traffic is persons and that there is hardly any demand for a night service. Estimates show that border traffic may increase to 400,000 crossings by the mid- to late 2010s. The demand for a larger station remains as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|Plans from 2011 <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new tunnel {{which runs}} from Majorstuen via Stortinget to Tøyen, but {{following}} {{a different route}} and with intermediate stations at Bislett, Hammersborg and Olaf Ryes plass, in the St. Hanshaugen and Grünerløkka boroughs {{north of the city}} center. Three of the lines would thus follow the existing tunnel to Stortinget and then switch to the new line, while the other three lines would follow the new tunnel to Stortinget and then run along the old tunnel onwards. This would allow for a six-minute headway on all but two branches, and also allow the proposed Fornebu Line to Skøyen, Fornebu and Nesodden to be built as part of the metro. Ruter has stated that the current stations are located in the areas which the most people want to travel to, and that if a second tunnel should deviate from these areas, they would have to serve places which generate as much traffic as the current stations.|$|E
