5|$|On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused {{extensive}} {{destruction in}} the borough, ravaging portions of Lower Manhattan with record-high storm surge from New York Harbor, severe flooding, and high winds, causing power outages <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of city residents and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems. The storm and its profound impacts have prompted {{the discussion of}} constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough and the metropolitan area {{to minimize the risk}} of destructive consequences from another such event in the future. Around 15 percent of the borough is considered to be in flood-risk zones.|$|E

The halo extends <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> light years, much further than the stellar halo and close to the distance of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The mass of this hot halo is nearly equivalent to the mass of the Milky Way itself. The temperature of this halo gas is between 1 and 2.5 million K (1.8 and 4.5 million oF).|$|R

25|$|The natural nuclear {{reactors}} formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that {{acted as a}} neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back down again and preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of years.|$|E
25|$|A {{person must}} be on the electoral roll in order to vote.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of magnetic activity of stars is mostly {{based on the}} study of the Sun and some spectroscopic surveys <b>of</b> a few <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> stars. However, the detailed mechanisms of the solar magnetic activity cycle are not fully understood. With the Kepler mission that is providing exquisite photometric data <b>for</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> stars monitored continuously for more than three year, we can study changes in the light curves that can be related to magnetic activity. We show here a few examples of stars for which we did a time-frequency analysis to look for such signature. Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure.

25|$|In the 20th century, many levees and dams {{were built}} on the San Joaquin {{and all of its}} major tributaries. These {{engineering}} works changed the fluctuating nature of the river forever, and cut off the Tulare Basin {{from the rest of the}} San Joaquin watershed. Once habitat <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of spawning salmon and millions of migratory birds, today the river is subject to tremendous water-supply, navigation and regulation works by various federal agencies, which have dramatically reduced the flow of the river since the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this time Sammartino found out through Angelo Savoldi, a {{recently}} fired office employee of Capitol Wrestling Corporation, {{that he had been}} cheated by Vince McMahon Sr. on the promised gate percentages for his entire second title run. Sammartino filed suit against McMahon and his Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The suit was eventually settled out of court by McMahon's son, Vince McMahon after his father had died. Part of the settlement included Sammartino returning to do color commentary on WWF television in exchange <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of dollars for what amounted to nineteen days of work.|$|E
25|$|Rio de Janeiro {{is home to}} {{the largest}} Portuguese {{population}} outside of Lisbon in Portugal. After independence from Portugal, Rio de Janeiro became a destination <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of immigrants from Portugal, mainly in the early 20th century. The immigrants were mostly poor peasants who subsequently found prosperity in Rio as city workers and small traders. The Portuguese cultural influence is still seen {{in many parts of the}} city (and many other parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro), including architecture and language. Most Brazilians with some cultural contact with Rio know how to easily differentiate between the local dialect, fluminense, and other Brazilian dialects.|$|E
5000|$|Iyer's {{primary focus}} while as Energy Director of the World Bank Group was {{increasing}} access to clean {{energy for the}} poor through collaboration {{between the public and}} private sectors, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notable projects include the Bangladesh Solar Initiative, which provided solar power to over 2 million rural homes which were previously without electricity and lighting.

25|$|The {{symbiotic}} relationship has also stretched to include car manufacturers, clothing designers and sneaker companies, {{and many other}} companies have used the hip hop community to make their name or to give them credibility. One such beneficiary was Jacob the Jeweler, a diamond merchant from New York. Jacob Arabo's clientele included Sean Combs, Lil' Kim and Nas. He created jewelry pieces from precious metals that were heavily loaded with diamond and gemstones. As his name was mentioned in the song lyrics of his hip hop customers, his profile quickly rose. Arabo expanded his brand to include gem-encrusted watches that retail <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of dollars, gaining so much attention that Cartier filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit against him for putting diamonds {{on the faces of}} their watches and reselling them without permission. Arabo's profile increased steadily until his June 2006 arrest by the FBI on money laundering charges.|$|E
25|$|The {{radioactivity}} of all {{radioactive waste}} diminishes with time. All radionuclides {{contained in the}} waste have a half-life—the {{time it takes for}} half of the atoms to decay into another nuclide—and eventually all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements (i.e., stable nuclides). Certain radioactive elements (such as plutonium-239) will remain hazardous to humans and other creatures <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of years. Other radionuclides remain hazardous for millions of years. Thus, these wastes must be shielded for centuries and isolated from the living environment for millennia. Since radioactive decay follows the half-life rule, the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived isotope like iodine-129 will be much less intense than that of a short-lived isotope like iodine-131. The two tables show some of the major radioisotopes, their half-lives, and their radiation yield as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235.|$|E
25|$|The second {{duty of the}} Council was {{to assist}} in Joseph Smith's 1844 {{campaign}} for President of the United States. Smith ran on a platform among church members of bringing restitution for land and property lost in Missouri, eliminating slavery, compensating slave-owners with the sale of private lands, reducing the salaries of members of Congress, eliminating debt imprisonment, etc. Members of the Council campaigned throughout the United States. Besides sending out hundreds of political missionaries to campaign for Smith throughout the U.S., they also appointed fellow members of the Fifty as political ambassadors to Russia, the Republic of Texas, Washington D.C., England, and France. However, Smith was murdered by a large mob {{in the midst of}} his presidential campaign. The campaign was meant to draw greater attention to the plight of the Mormons, who had received no state or federal restitution <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of dollars worth of property lost to mob violence in relation to the 1838 Mormon War. However, the Nauvoo Expositor incident, Smith's Presidential campaign, and even hyperbolic and inaccurate rumors about the Council of Fifty helped create the local unrest that led to his assassination.|$|E

Mount Yana had probably reached its full size of [...] in elevation and [...] in diameter before Mount Maidu, the second source, had acquired half its growth. Mount Maidu, which eventually surpassed Mount Yana in size, was centered over what is now the town of Mineral, California but has been extinct <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of years (the grassy plain around the town is Maidu's caldera). A third source situated north of Latour Butte made a lesser contribution to the formation.
