40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{dynamics}} {{of a sea}} breeze front interacting with the heavily urbanized New York City area are examined. In addition, we investigate {{the impact of the}} urban-influenced sea breeze front on transport and diffusion of simulated passive tracer plumes. We employ the U. S. Navy’s Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS – a registered trademark of the Naval Research Laboratory) to perform a nested simulation with data assimilation for the sea breeze event of 9 August 2004. Available surface and upper-air observations are used to validate the simulation. We also perform a sensitivity study in which the urban influence is removed (no-urban). The sea breeze front has characteristics of a <b>density</b> <b>current,</b> including an elevated head at the leading edge. The <b>density</b> <b>current</b> moves slowly and unevenly across the city. Kelvin–Helmholtz billows form in the region of the <b>density</b> <b>current</b> head, and the results show evidence of the occurrence of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI). The <b>density</b> <b>current</b> head is greatly elevated owing to the enhanced surface drag of the urban area. This urban influence is further explored in the no-urban simulation, in which the head of the <b>density</b> <b>current</b> is not elevated to the same degree and KHI does not occur. The sea breeze/density current has a large impact on transport and diffusion of simulated tracer plumes, not only changing the direction of plume motion due to the wind shift but also redistributing tracer material in the vertical so as to produce dramatic, rapid changes in near-surface concentration as the front passes. In particular, large upward vertical velocity {{at the head of the}} <b>density</b> <b>current</b> advects tracer material to large elevations, greatly reducing near-surface concentration.

Based on field, modelling {{and rare}} geochemical studies most workers argue for formation and growth within an eruption plume, although recent studies suggest formation within a pyroclastic <b>density</b> <b>current.</b> Here we adopt an integrated field and geochemical approach to test existing models of formation. A sequence of massive lapilli tuffs and breccias from the Isle of Skye, NW Scotland, record deposition from the sustained {{passage of a}} pyroclastic <b>density</b> <b>current.</b> Accretionary lapilli in two vertically chemically zoned massive lapilli tuff units within this sequence display evolving chemical trends from core to rim.

Here we present electron microprobe analyses of accretionary lapilli (ash aggregates with a massive pellet at their core and a cortex of multiple concentric fine ash laminae) collected from a variety of pyroclastic <b>density</b> <b>current</b> deposits (Scafell Caldera, English Lake District; Kilchrist Caldera, Isle of Skye, NW Scotland; Poris Formation, Tenerife) These rocks span the absolute time period 460 Ma- 273 ka and formed in a variety of tectonic and environmental settings. In all cases there are significant geochemical variations between cores and laminae of individual accretionary lapilli and the matrix of the tuffs/lapilli-tuffs in which they are found. We suggest that ash pellets form in co-ignimbrite plumes and on reaching a critical density fall under gravity into the underlying turbulent pyroclastic <b>density</b> <b>current.</b> Here the pellets accrete laminae that reflect the chemistry of the pulse of the <b>density</b> <b>current</b> surrounding it at that time, and therefore, the laminae of the growing accretionary lapilli progressively record chemical flux during the eruption.
