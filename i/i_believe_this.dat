Carter Brown praised the design: <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> would be a superb design for United States Coinage, rooted {{as it is in}} a great tradition, being based on the 'Liberty Cap cent' of 1794, following Augustin Dupré's Libertas Americana medal commemorating Saratoga and Yorktown (1777–1781).|$|E
25|$|The opening Test at Brisbane has {{a history}} of having {{important}} psychological effects on the teams. The four England teams before ours had all lost there. Even Len Hutton's eventually victorious side went down there by an innings. We drew the match and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> was the turning point of our tour. Nobody expected us to come out of it with our pride intact.|$|E

500|$|Asked at {{the hearing}} by Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{attorney}} Roger Robb whether he was planning [...] "to suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States", Teller replied that:I {{do not want to}} suggest anything of the kind. I know Oppenheimer as an intellectually most alert and a very complicated person, and I think it would be presumptuous and wrong on my part if I would try in any way to analyze his motives. But I have always assumed, and I now assume that he is loyal to the United States. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this,</b> and I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.He was immediately asked whether he believed that Oppenheimer was a [...] "security risk", to which he testified: ...|$|E
500|$|Accepting the nomination, Lincoln {{delivered}} his House Divided Speech, drawing on , [...] "A house divided against itself cannot stand. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I {{do not expect}} the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." [...] The speech created an evocative image {{of the danger of}} disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator. On being informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated [...] " [...] is the strong man of the party...and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won." ...|$|E
500|$|Sportswriters {{also pointed}} to the Tigers' tougher conference {{schedule}} when compared to those of USC and Oklahoma. SEC commissioner Mike Slive remarked, [...] "If Auburn goes through this league undefeated, they deserve {{to play for the}} national championship." [...] Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer, in the runup to the game, seemingly agreed with the assessment, saying, [...] "We started out playing Southern Cal and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> Auburn team is better." [...] Some writers also indicated USC's five-point win—in which the Trojans struggled—over rival UCLA as an indicator that the Tigers could be the better team. In the end, such arguments were unable to sway voters, who ranked USC first, Oklahoma second, and Auburn third in all of the major polls decided by human voters. The Utes, who were also undefeated {{at the conclusion of the}} regular season, received limited attention because they were a member of a non-BCS conference.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>this</b> {{would be}} the end of our search, because we had found all for which we came, and more.

500|$|With a half-secret trust, {{the fact}} that the {{beneficiary}} of the will holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust. This must go further than the mere [...] "hope" [...] that the beneficiary (again <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> should read [...] "trustee" [...] - the beneficiary is the passive party to a trust) of the will will act in accordance with its terms. The requirements for a half-secret trust to be valid are similar to those for fully secret trusts, and were laid out in Blackwell v Blackwell, where a testator gave five trustees pieces of property, instructing them (in the will) to hold on to this property as they had been asked. Prior to the testator's death, the trustees had all been told what to do with the property. Lord Sumner said that: ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Mandle of The Independent stated: [...] "Jenner {{has gone}} on to inspire countless men and women, but her comments, which were made after she was celebrated at Glamour magazine's Women Of The Year in New York were branded 'offensive and insulting'." [...] He added: [...] "People began tweeting the other, harder things women have to deal with, such as {{institutionalized}} oppression, abuse and sexual assault". James Smith, husband of Moira Smith, the only female New York Police Department officer to die on September 11, 2001, returned Moira's [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] award, given posthumously. Referring to Jenner as a man, he stated that he found Glamour giving Jenner the same award insulting to Moira's memory, and referred to the matter as a publicity stunt. Smith later said that, having supported transgender youth and Glamour decision to honor transgender actress Laverne Cox in 2014, he did not object because Jenner is transgender; he objected to Jenner's [...] "hardest part about being a woman" [...] commentary; this proved to him that Jenner [...] "is not truly a woman. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> comment and others he has made trivializes the transgender experience as I have witnessed it." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the letter}} was tabled at the Shaw Commission in 1929, Rustam Haidar spoke to Faisal in Baghdad and cabled that Faisal had [...] "no {{recollection}} that he wrote anything of the sort". In January 1930, Haidar wrote to a newspaper in Baghdad that Faisal: [...] "finds it exceedingly strange that such a matter is attributed {{to him as he}} at no time would consider allowing any foreign nation to share in an Arab country". Awni Abd al-Hadi, Faisal's secretary, wrote in his memoirs that he was not aware that a meeting between Frankfurter and Faisal took place and that: [...] "I believe that this letter, assuming that it is authentic, was written by Lawrence, and that Lawrence signed it in English on behalf of Faisal. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> letter is part of the false claims made by Chaim Weizmann and Lawrence to lead astray public opinion." [...] According to Allawi, the most likely explanation for the Frankfurter letter is that a meeting took place, a letter was drafted in English by Lawrence, but that its [...] "contents were not entirely made clear to Faisal. He then {{may or may not have}} been induced to sign it", since it ran counter to Faisal's other public and private statements at the time.A 1 March interview by Le Matin quoted Faisal as saying: ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2017, Williams {{condemned}} antisemitism {{and backed}} {{a petition to}} remove the works of David Irving and other Holocaust denial books from the University of Manchester.

2500|$|... "The {{relevant}} statutory {{language has}} not changed materially {{and it is not}} easy to identify a principled basis for distinguishing that case from this," [...] John Paul Stevens, later elevated to the Supreme Court himself, wrote about Wilko in his dissent.

2500|$|Duncan Smith's defence of his {{department}} was that [...] "You cannot absolutely prove {{those two things}} are connected – you cannot disprove what I said. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> to be right." [...] This led Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and former {{chief economist at the}} Cabinet Office, to accuse the Conservative Party of going beyond spin and the normal political practice of cherry picking of figures to the act of actually [...] "making things up" [...] with respect to the impact of government policy on employment and other matters.|$|E
2500|$|I {{therefore}} {{can understand the}} imposition of a 25-year time limit only as a holding that the deference the Court pays to the Law School's educational judgments and refusal to change its admissions policies will itself expire. At that point these policies will clearly have failed to [...] "'eliminate the [...] need for any racial or ethnic'" [...] discrimination because the academic credentials gap will still be there. [...] The Court defines this time limit in terms of narrow tailoring, [...] but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> arises from its refusal to define rigorously the broad state interest vindicated today[...] With these observations, I join the last sentence of Part III of the opinion of the Court.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Eno {{wrote of}} Lomax's later {{recording}} career in his notes to accompany {{an anthology of}} Lomax's world recordings: [...] turned his intelligent attentions to music from {{many other parts of}} the world, securing for them a dignity and status they had not previously been accorded. The [...] "World Music" [...] phenomenon arose partly from those efforts, as did his great book, Folk Song Style and Culture. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> {{is one of the most}} important books ever written about music, in my all time top ten. It is one of the very rare attempts to put cultural criticism onto a serious, comprehensible, and rational footing by someone who had the experience and breadth of vision to be able to do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the sessions, [...] "Call on Me" [...] was written. For the song, Jackson {{revealed}} that Nelly and Dupri {{had been in}} the studio alone working together, and came up with the record on their own. They called Jackson up, played it for her over the phone, and asked if she wanted to record it. Jackson obliged. Speaking about the song, Dupri said [...] "It's a duet between her and Nelly. It's the jump-off. We don't just have a record that's just a Nelly and Janet record. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> record is gonna be one of the biggest records on radio this year. Outside of who it is, it's a well-put-together song." [...] Dupri also commented about Nelly's addition to the song, saying: ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{introduced}} a [...] "Then and Now" [...] structure, which utilizes flashbacks that bookend the episode; flashbacks {{were used in}} previous seasons of the television series, and were sparsely used in the graphic novels the series is based on. Although Gimple stated that this feature would not be seen throughout the season, he said, [...] "We definitely play with time this season. And we’ll be jumping around a little bit, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> is our only Then and Now." [...] Kirkman noted that the audience [...] " [...] so much more about Gareth {{and all of those}} people because of those two very minor scenes." [...] Gimple knew the backstory of Terminus while the characters were traveling there in the previous season, and stated that it echoes what happens next to Rick's group. The writers wanted to divulge and formulate the [...] "whole story" [...] of Terminus that affects the characters of the show; he related the stories of everyone in their universe to [...] "walking ghosts of Christmas Future and ghosts of Christmas Past to [...] characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huxley always {{believed}} that on a broad view evolution led to advances in organisation. Progress without a goal {{was one of his}} phrases, to distinguish his point of view from classical Aristotelian teleology. [...] "The ordinary man, or at least the ordinary poet, philosopher and theologian, always was anxious to find purpose in the evolutionary process. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> reasoning to be totally false."The idea of evolutionary progress was subjected to some fierce criticism {{in the latter part of}} the twentieth century. Cladists, for example, were (and are) strongly against any suggestion that a group could be scientifically described as 'advanced' and others as 'primitive.' For them, and especially for the radical group of transformed cladists, there is no such thing as an advanced group, they are derived or apomorphic. Primitive groups are plesiomorphic. Ironically, it was Huxley who invented the terms clade and grades. However, to take a rather extreme case, it would seem strange to say that when man is compared to bacteria, that mankind is not a vastly more complex and advanced form of life; or that the invasion of the land by plants and animals was not a great advance in the history of life on this planet. On this issue Julian was at the opposite end of the spectrum from his grandfather, who was, at least for the first half of his career, a propagandist for 'persistent types', getting close to denying any advances at all.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the band's early {{releases}} {{touch on}} Christian themes {{and placed them}} {{in the front of}} the Christian punk scene. However, by 2012 this was a title that the band was trying to distance themselves from. As of 2015, MxPx singer Mike Herrera has said he is no longer Christian. When asked about the topic he stated [...] "...There's a million different little nooks and crannies we can go down as to why to believe something, why not to believe. It's just one of those things was 'alright <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>this,</b> this, this is sinning.' Beyond that, do <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in god? I'm not sure.
