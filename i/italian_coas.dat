40|$|Coastal areas, and in {{particular}} coastal dunes, are ecosystems strongly affected by the invasion of alien plants. However, few attempts have ever been made to quantify alien species incidence in different communities along the coastal zonation. This work aims to analyze the distribution of alien plants along the coastal zonation of sandy shores on the Tyrrhenian coast, addressing specifically differences among plant communities in abundance of alien plants. Methods The study was performed on recent dunes (Holocene) of the central western coast of Italy. We selected dune landscapes where invasion processes were particularly evident. Vegetation plots were randomly sampled and through cluster analysis, we identified six plant communities corresponding to the typical zonation described for the Tyrrhenian sandy coast of Central Italy. We evaluated and compared frequency and abundance of invasion in these different communities. Further, we investigated how propagule pressure (measured using as proxy human structures) contributed to the observed invasion patterns. Important Findings We found a relatively low total number of aliens but also a differential distribution pattern and strong abundance {{of some of the}} aliens in specific sectors of the vegetation zonation. The perennial community of transition dunes appears most affected by invasion processes, related almost exclusively to the frequent and widespread Carpobrotus aff. acinaciformis. This alien species reaches high cover values, apparently lowering cover of native species of transition dune plant communities. Higher levels of invasion in the transition dune can be partially explained because of greater propagule pressure in this section of the dune profile. Our findings thus have important conservation and management implications since transition dune communities with Crucianella maritima are rare and protected (sensu Habitat 92 / 43 /EEC Directive) along the entire <b>Italian</b> <b>coas...</b>|$|E
