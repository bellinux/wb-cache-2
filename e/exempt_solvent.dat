40|$|Commercial {{cleaning}} of garments is primarily done by dry cleaning methods that use a non-aqueous solvent. Two cleaning solvents {{have dominated the}} dry cleaning industry [...] perchloroethylene and hydrocarbon solvent. However, several alternative cleaning processes and solvents have emerged that include, but not limited to: high flash point petroleum solvent, carbon dioxide (CO 2), volatile methyl siloxane (D 5), propylene glycol ether, n-propyl bromide, and water-based cleaning system such as professional wet cleaning. Perchloroethylene (perc) is {{the most widely used}} cleaning solvent in commercial dry cleaning because of its physical and chemical properties. In 1991, however, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) identified perc as a toxic air contaminant (TAC) associated with environmental and human health risks. In the same year, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) added perc in the Section 112 Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) list. Then in 1996, the U. S. EPA removed perchloroethylene from the definition of volatile organic compound (VOC), thus classifying perc as an exempt compound. Notwithstanding its status as an <b>exempt</b> <b>solvent,</b> perc dry cleaning facilities are stil...|$|E
40|$|Surface coating {{facilities}} are {{major sources of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urban areas. These VOCs can contribute to ground-level ozone formation, and many are hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), including xylene, ethylbenzene, and toluene. This project was conducted {{in order to provide}} information for updating the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), USA, permit by rule for Surface Coating Facilities. Project objectives were: 1) To develop a database of information regarding surface coating facilities in Texas; 2) To estimate maximum emission rates for various VOC species from surface coating facilities in Texas; 3) To conduct dispersion modeling to estimate off-site impacts from surface coating facilities. The database was developed using 286 TCEQ permit files authorizing surface coating facilities in Texas during 2006 and 2007. The database was designed to include information important for estimating emission rates, and for using as inputs to the dispersion model. Hourly and annual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), and <b>exempt</b> <b>solvents</b> (ES) were calculated for each permitted entity/ company in the database, according to equations given by TCEQ. Dispersion modeling was then conducted for 3 facility configurations (worst-case stack height, good practice stack height, and fugitive emissions), for urban and rural dispersion parameters, for 8 -hour and 24 -hour operating scenarios, and for 1 -hour, 24 -hour, and annual averaging times, for a total of 36 scenarios. The highest modeled concentrations were for the worst-case stack height, rural dispersion parameters, 24 -hour operation scenario, and 1 -hour averaging time. 108 specific chemical species, which are components of surface coatings, were identified as candidates for further health impacts review. </p...|$|R
