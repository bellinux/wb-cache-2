5|$|From February through November 1950, McCain was {{executive}} officer of the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> , and from June 1950 was involved {{in the early stages of}} the Korean War, joining Task Force 77 to patrol the Formosa Strait.|$|E
5|$|The <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Admiral Scheer {{was named}} after Reinhard Scheer and christened by his {{daughter}} Marianne. The ship was ordered and funded by the Reichsmarine of the Weimar Republic and launched in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Various naval {{warships}} and shore installations {{were named}} for Hipper: <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Admiral Hipper of the Kriegsmarine, the training frigate Hipper of the Bundesmarine and a {{building of the}} German Naval Operations School in Bremerhaven.|$|E
5000|$|The US {{built the}} [...] of <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> during the war. While earlier <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> were noted for their {{powerful}} torpedo armament (especially Japanese <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers),</b> later ships {{built by the}} USN concentrated mainly on anti-aircraft armament, as their main role was escorting aircraft carriers instead of engaging in surface actions. Interestingly, most Japanese <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> were sunk by aircraft or submarines, rather than in surface engagements.|$|R
5000|$|Kako and {{her sister}} ship Furutaka were the first {{generation}} of high speed <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> in the Japanese navy, intended to counter the US Navy [...] scout cruisers and Royal Navy [...] <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> {{development}} steadied between World War I and World War II {{thanks to}} the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and successor treaties and conferences, where the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy agreed to limit heavy cruisers to 10,000tons displacement with 8-inch main armament. Up until the Alaska class, US cruisers designed between the wars followed this pattern.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the bottom hull plates. Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204. Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Lützow in January 1945.|$|E
5|$|The German <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> , ship #36, survived {{both the}} Able and Baker tests but was too {{radioactive}} to have leaks repaired. In September 1946 she was towed to Kwajalein Atoll, where she capsized {{in shallow water}} on December 22, 1946, five months after Baker. She remains there today, with starboard propeller blades in the air.|$|E
5000|$|Elsewhere, to the northward, eleven troop-laden transports—escorted by destroyers {{and covered}} by the light carrier , four <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers,</b> and a destroyer—steamed toward Port Moresby. In addition, another Japanese task force—formed around the two Pearl Harbor veterans, {{carriers}} [...] and , and screened by two <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> and six destroyers—provided additional air cover.|$|R
5000|$|Patterson was {{south of}} Savo Island and Florida Island, with a US-Australian {{group of three}} <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> and two destroyers. To their north were the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> , USS Vincennes, USS Quincy and two destroyers. [...] Driving rain slashed the waters between the {{northern}} force and ships of the southern force.|$|R
5000|$|The type {{was used}} on the [...] and [...] classes of <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> as main battery, mounted in four twin turrets {{weighing}} 180 tonnes each. The calibre of 203 mm (8 inches) was characteristic of <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> built {{as a result of}} limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.|$|R
5|$|After safely {{returning}} to port in Kiel, Leipzig {{was taken into}} the Deutsche Werke shipyard for repairs. She was decommissioned while under repair and reclassified as a training ship. To accommodate additional training crews, four of the ship's boilers were removed. She returned to service in late 1940. In early June 1941, she escorted the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Lützow (formerly Deutschland) to Norway. After {{she returned to the}} Baltic, she and the cruiser Emden provided artillery support to advancing German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. In September, she supported the invasion of the Baltic islands in the West Estonian archipelago. While bombarding Soviet positions on Moon Island, Leipzig was attacked unsuccessfully by the Soviet submarine Shch-317. In late September, the ship joined the German Baltic Fleet, centered on the battleship Tirpitz; the fleet was tasked with blocking a possible Soviet attempt {{to break out of the}} Baltic. Leipzig returned to Kiel in October, and conducted maneuvers with the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Admiral Scheer. Leipzig became the flagship of the training fleet in 1942; she spent the year performing training duties.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> was sunk, a {{destroyer}} was heavily damaged, {{and the rest of the}} U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. Partly because they turned back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943, leaving it in the hands of the Allies and ending the battle for the island.|$|E
5|$|During mid- to late-1943 the Home Fleet, the Royal Navy's main {{striking}} force {{stationed in the}} United Kingdom, was augmented by two forces of United States Navy warships to replace British ships dispatched to the Mediterranean and Pacific. These reinforcements were considered necessary {{to ensure that the}} fleet remained able to counter the German battle group based in Norway, which was built around the battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, and the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Lützow.|$|E

50|$|The two Veinticinco de Mayo-class <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> {{served in}} the Argentine Navy through World War II. They were the only post-Washington Naval Treaty <b>heavy</b> <b>cruisers</b> built for a South American Navy. Both ships of the class were built in Italy by the OTO company, and {{commissioned}} into the Argentine Navy in 1931.|$|R
5|$|In October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} with the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Prinz Eugen; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. The ship was patched up to keep her afloat, and she helped to defend Gotenhafen from the advancing Red Army in March 1945. She then carried a group of fleeing German civilians, reaching Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September, she was dry-docked at Durban {{and on the}} 20th {{she arrived}} back in Simonstown. She sailed for Sierra Leone the next day. Operating in the Indian Ocean, on 18 November she bombarded Zante in Italian Somaliland. On 18 December she {{departed}} to join {{the search for the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> , which had recently sunk the British refrigerator ship Duquesa in the South Atlantic. The British were unsuccessful in their search and Admiral Scheer remained at large.|$|E
5|$|Strachwitz led an ad-hoc {{formation}} in Operation Doppelkopf (double-head) {{as part of}} Dietrich von Saucken's XXXIX Panzer Corps counter-offensive following the major Soviet advance in Operation Bagration. Von Saucken's goal was to relieve the encircled forces in the Courland Pocket. Strachwitz's attack on 18 August 1944 was preceded by a heavy artillery bombardment from the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Prinz Eugen; forces inside the pocket attacked to link up with Strachwitz's force. His troops reached the 16. Armee at Tukums by midday.|$|E

5|$|The torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Giffen's {{ships in}} two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> , causing heavy damage and bringing {{her to a}} dead stop. Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent a tug to take Chicago under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to return to base the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort Chicago and the tugboat.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Scheer {{underwent}} a refit while her sister ships {{set out on}} commerce raiding operations in the Atlantic. Admiral Scheer was modified during {{the early months of}} 1940, including the installation of a new, raked clipper bow. The heavy command tower was replaced with a lighter structure, and she was reclassified as a <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser.</b> Additional anti-aircraft guns were also installed, along with updated radar equipment. On 19–20 July RAF bombers attacked Admiral Scheer and the battleship , though they failed to score any hits. On 27 July, the ship was pronounced ready for service.|$|E
5|$|Akagis {{aircraft}} {{served in}} the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. Upon {{the formation of the}} First Air Fleet or Kido Butai (Striking Force) in early 1941, she became its flagship, and remained so for the duration of her service. With other fleet carriers, she took part in the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month, her aircraft bombed Darwin, Australia, and assisted in the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. In March and April 1942, Akagi aircraft helped sink a British <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> and an Australian destroyer in the Indian Ocean Raid.|$|E

5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision with the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Prinz Eugen {{late in the}} war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged from the war largely unscathed, and as a result, was seized by the Soviet Navy as war reparations, and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E
5|$|In a heavy fog in October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} with the <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> Prinz Eugen; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. Instead, they repaired Leipzig enough to keep her afloat, and in that state, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Gotenhafen against the advancing Red Army in March 1945. As the Germans continued to retreat in the east, Leipzig was then used to transport a group of fleeing German civilians. She reached Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz was a <b>heavy</b> <b>cruiser</b> of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, {{fourth in}} the , but was never completed. The ship was laid down in December 1936 and {{launched}} in January 1939, but the outbreak of World War II slowed her construction and fitting-out work was finally stopped {{in the summer of}} 1940 when she was approximately 95percent complete. The unfinished ship remained pier-side in the shipyard until March 1942, when the Kriegsmarine decided to pursue aircraft carriers over surface combatants. Seydlitz was among the vessels chosen for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers.|$|E
