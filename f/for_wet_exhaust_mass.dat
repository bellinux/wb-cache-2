40|$|AbstractIn {{an engine}} {{transient}} condition, effects of different <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> flows, inlet signal amplitudes and periods on dynamic {{responses of the}} three-way catalytic converter were investigated experimentally. Experimental results show that <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> flows, inlet signal amplitudes and periods have important influence on engine emissions and oxygen storage capacity of Ceria for the three-way catalytic converter with CeO 2 catalyst in the washcoat. With the increase of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> flow, the lambda outlet signal increases nonlinearly; emissions are better {{at the beginning and}} then turns deteriorated {{in the case of a}} high mass flow after the lean-rich transition. Outlet lambda increases almost linearly with the increase of <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> flows and lambda outlet signal amplitudes after the richlean transition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The <b>wet</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas {{cleaning}} is largely used by thermal power plants. In 1994, {{in order to}} increase the efficiency, a new, high frequency acoustic system of ash collection was built at number 8 unit of Iujno-Cuzbas thermal power plant. The results were surprisingly good. The analysis shows that the proposed components can be installed inside the Vinturi tube, which will contribute to the increase of turbulence and sound generation. It is worth mentioning that in the past these components were not permitted in these loops...|$|R
30|$|Most {{roof bolting}} {{machines}} {{used in the}} US underground mines are equipped with vacuum dust collection system to remove the drilling dust from mine environment. Some new dust control measures for roof bolters are canopy air curtain and air tubing (Goodman and Organiscak 2002; Goodman et al. 2006), <b>wet</b> <b>exhaust</b> conditioner (Beck 2012). However, the MSHA dust sample data still show that roof bolter operators are experiencing the similar level of dust overexposure as the other miners but potentially to dust with much high silica contents. This indicates that the drilling dust could still escape from the bolter’s collection systems in some circumstances.|$|R
50|$|For {{jet engine}} forms of {{internal}} combustion engines, a propelling nozzle is present. This takes the high temperature, high pressure exhaust and expands and cools it. The exhaust leaves the nozzle going at much higher speed and provides thrust, {{as well as}} constricting the flow from the engine and raising the pressure {{in the rest of}} the engine, giving greater thrust for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> that exits.|$|R

50|$|Ideally, a mixer {{is also a}} {{performance}} benefit to increasing thrust. The exhaust thrust from a jet engine is equal to <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> flow times <b>exhaust</b> velocity, ie, Thrust = ṁv, while the energy to make that thrust is given by Energy = 1/2mv2. A mixer helps reduce the fastest exhaust velocities from {{the core of the}} engine, while making the average exhaust velocity faster, producing more thrust with the same energy.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A Mean Value Model (MVM) for a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engine is}} presented. Using a phenomenological zero-dimensional {{approach}} with five continuous and three discrete states we first model {{the effects of}} the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve, the exhaust Rebreathing Lift (RBL), and the fueling rate on the state of charge in the cylinder at intake valve closing. An Arrhenius integral is then used to model the start of combustion, θsoc. A series of simple algebraic relations that captures the combustion duration and heat release is finally used to model the state of charge after the HCCI combustion and the Location of Peak Pressure (LPP). The model is parameterized and validated using steady-state test data from an experimental engine at the General Motors Corporation. The simple model captures the temperature, pressure, air-to-fuel ratio, and inert gas fraction of the <b>exhausted</b> <b>mass</b> flow. This characterization is important for the overall HCCI dynamics because the thermodynamic state (pressure, tem-perature) and concentration (oxygen and inert gas) of the <b>exhausted</b> <b>mass</b> flow affect the next combustion event. The high dilution level in HCCI engines increases the significance of this internal feedback that generally exists to a smaller extent in conventional spark-ignition and compression-ignition internal combustion engines.

Water samples were collected from 26 rural community boreholes and analyzed for heavy metal concentrations as they {{affect the quality of}} drinking water based on the WHO standard and their variability <b>for</b> both <b>wet</b> and dry seasons.

The results of analyses show the mean values and CV% as follows: pH 7. 55; 6. 21 % <b>for</b> <b>wet</b> season and 8. 89; 4. 24 % for dry season. 414 µS/cm; 137. 58 % <b>for</b> <b>wet</b> season and 272. 13 µS/cm; 94. 92 % for dry season; Fe 0. 82 mg/L; 81. 71 % <b>for</b> <b>wet</b> season and 0. 03 mg/L; 324 % for dry season; Mn 0. 73 mg/L; 52. 05 % <b>for</b> <b>wet</b> season and 0. 14 mg/L; 92 % for dry season; Zn 0. 10 mg/L; 140 % <b>for</b> <b>wet</b> season and 0. 13 mg/L; 130. 76 % for dry season; Pb 0. 74 mg/L; 75. 68 % <b>for</b> <b>wet</b> season and 0. 04 mg/L; 170 % for dry season; Cu 0. 88 mg/L; 64. 77 % <b>for</b> <b>wet</b> season and 0. 00 mg/L; 60 % for dry season. Apart from pH and Zn whose values were higher in the dry season, other metals investigated had higher concentrations in the wet season.

Since droplet mass flux constitutes only about 1 % of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>mass</b> flux, the effect of droplet entrainment on the gas flow is neglected. The novelty of the present model is in obtaining the droplet distribution within the nozzle by assum-ing a small radial random velocity component for droplets at the throat. Gas flow in the nozzle is approximated as isentropic plus a correction for the boundary layer. The computed distri-bution of droplet mass flux {{is found to be}} in good agreement with experimental data...|$|R
