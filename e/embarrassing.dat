40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. The {{present study}} {{validated}} the factorial structure found by Sharkey and Hamilton (2011), and extended their research by testing the scale's convergent validity {{by examining the}} relationships between the proclivity to intentionally <b>embarrass</b> others and self and a number of personality constructs. One hundred thirty nine University of Hawaii at Manoa students enrolled in Speech Communication classes answered online questionnaires that contained the proclivity to intentionally <b>embarrass</b> others and self, Machiavellian, communication apprehension, social desirability, and gelotophobia scales. The results suggest that increases in communication apprehension were correlated with reports of lower proclivity to intentionally <b>embarrass</b> others and oneself as well as lower proclivity to intentionally use mild face threatening tactics to <b>embarrass</b> others and mild and severe face-threatening acts to <b>embarrass</b> oneself. Results also suggest that individuals high on social desirability will be less likely to intentionally <b>embarrass</b> themselves and to intentionally use severe face-threatening acts to <b>embarrass</b> themselves. The findings in this paper have implications in regards to understanding the types of {{people who are willing to}} disrupt the working consensus through the use of intentional embarrassment despite the possibility of negative social sanctioning from other interactants...|$|R
