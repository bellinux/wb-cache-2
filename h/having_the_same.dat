5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} be caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome.

She also looks at how the brothers help {{people all over the country}} to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E

5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of valence electrons, {{being in the}} same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|In graph theory, a book {{embedding}} is a {{generalization of}} planar embedding of a graph to embeddings into a book, {{a collection of}} half-planes all <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> line as their boundary. Usually, the vertices of the graph are required to lie on this boundary line, called the spine, and the edges are required to stay within a single half-plane. The book thickness of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book embedding of the graph. Book thickness is also called pagenumber, stacknumber or fixed outerthickness. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other graph invariants including the pagewidth and book crossing number.|$|E

Principal photography began in Mumbai in mid-2011 and later moved to London, where it was primarily shot at the Jublee Campus of the University of Nottingham and Stratford-upon-Avon.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other types}} of {{tessellation}} are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made {{with more than one}} kind of regular polygon but still <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.|$|E

Microzones were found to contain on the order of 1000 Purkinje cells each, arranged in a long, narrow strip, oriented perpendicular to the cortical folds. Thus, as the adjoining diagram illustrates, Purkinje cell dendrites are flattened {{in the same direction as}} the microzones extend, while parallel fibers cross them at right angles.|$|E

5|$|Skyscraper Museum {{director}} Carol Willis, and art consultant Franck Mercurio, {{curator at}} the Field Museum in Chicago, offer moderating modern views {{about the influence of}} Saarinen's design. Willis notes that setback architecture was being implemented in New York City highrises because of 1916 zoning ordinances related to building height and sunlight, and that Saarinen's design was understood to be an embodiment of this trend. Mercurio points to the Tribune Tower competition entry from American architect Bertram Goodhue as <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> modernist features as Saarinen's, with dramatic setbacks but a more pronounced simplification of the exterior. Mercurio argues that Goodhue's design is a better example of modernism because it has less ornamentation. Goodhue's entry gained him honorable mention but no cash award.|$|E

The ILO, {{although}} <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> members as the League and being subject to the budget control of the Assembly, was an autonomous organisation with its own Governing Body, its own General Conference and its own Secretariat. Its constitution differed from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers' and workers' organisations. Albert Thomas was its first director.|$|E
5|$|After {{making their}} debut with Shavukar (1950), B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios signed Kadiri Venkata Reddy {{later in the}} year to make a {{folklore}} film.

Kamalakara Kameswara Rao and Venkata Reddy worked on the film's screenplay. Nagendrarao was also inspired from the story of Aladdin. Vijaya Vauhini Studios team worked for three to four months on the film's script and Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh was chosen as the story's backdrop. Pathala Bhairavi was made as a bilingual film, shot in Telugu and Tamil simultaneously with both the versions <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> title.
