40|$|Abstract — The Electromyography (EMG) {{is a very}} {{important}} biomedical signal and can be used for verity of applications in clinical or biomedical field. This signal is used to detect abnormal muscle activities like impaired nourishment of an organ or part of body, inflammation of muscles, pinched nerves and peripheral nerve damages etc. The EMG signal is controlled by nervous system and is dependent on the anatomical and physiological properties of muscles and is affected due to artifacts. Therefore the EMG signal is complicated signal and noise-prone. This noise signal reduces the performance of EMG signal. During signal processing, the system picks up noise signal along with desired signal. In this paper, Artificial Intelligent model using Focused Time Lagged Recurrent Neural Network with a single hidden layer has been developed. From the <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings,</b> FTLRNN reduces noise intelligently from the EMG signal.

40|$|Less {{performance}} of informal sector among {{the poorest of}} the poor in the war affected regions in Sri Lanka has been caused by many reasons. Findings of an exploratory study and the factor analysis revealed four important factors namely training and skills, education, social and economic. As the extension of the exploratory study, to test this prediction empirically with a larger sample size, the present study applied a survey method using a questionnaire especially designed based on the initial exploratory study which was conducted inductively. A sample of 300 women headed households engaged in the informal sector participated in this study.

40|$|Oestrous {{synchronization}} involves synchronization {{of ovarian}} follicular turnover, new wave emergence, and finally induction of ovulation. The final step can be synchronized by the parenteral administration of either GnRH or oestradiol benzoate. This study investigated corpus luteum and follicular emergence after ovulation had been {{induced by the}} administration of either GnRH or oestradiol benzoate. The injection of oestradiol benzoate may have delayed {{the emergence of the}} first follicular wave subsequent to the induced ovulation; administration of oestradiol benzoate or GnRH lowered the progesterone rise so that the maximum dioestrous concentration of progesterone on Day 9 was lower when cows were treated during pro-oestrus compared to the spontaneously ovulating controls. One <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> from the present study is that induction of ovulation with either oestradiol benzoate or GnRH, administered 24 or 36 h after withdrawal of the CIDR device, respectively, may lower fertility.

40|$|Background/Rationale The {{prevalence}} {{of mental health}} issues in prison populations is exacerbated by ineffective screening for mental illness during earlier contact with {{the criminal justice system}} (CJS). Effective screening is reliant on cooperation between the CJS and mental health services. Interagency working has proved difficult in the past as might be expected of working between public services so distinct in expectations, priorities and working culture. Poor interprofessional working leads to court proceedings and public safety being compromised. Further, mentally disordered defendants face inappropriate imprisonment and fail to access community support/treatment. The aim of work is to explore the nature of interprofessional working at the interface of working between the CJS and the mental health services. Methods Data was collected through a cross sectional survey of court (n= 479) and mental health workers (n= 146). Results Attitudes towards defendants and willingness to work across agencies were comparable across agencies. Procedural expectations varied as did awareness, feelings of efficacy and levels of training that supports better interagency working. Conclusions We discuss the <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> for future interprofessional training needs of both court and mental health services. We compare and contrast these with current interprofessional education whose focus is almost exclusively on relationships between health and social care professionals...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of the}} Littoral Combat Ship is to provide the Navy with an affordable, small, multi-mission ship capable of independent, interdependent and integrated operations inside the littorals. The Littoral Combat Ship will be designed to replace high-value Naval assets when conducting high-end missions such as littoral Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Warfare (MIW) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) as well as perform low-end missions such as Humanitarian Assistance (HA), Non-combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) and Maritime Intercept Operations (MIO). In order to accomplish these missions and successfully counter the enemy's littoral denial strategy, the Navy has stated the Littoral Combat Ship must incorporate endurance, speed, payload capacity, sea-keeping, shallow-draft and mission reconfigurability into a small ship design. However, constraints in current ship design technology make this desired combination of design characteristics in small ships difficult to realize at any cost. This thesis (1) analyzes the relationship between speed, endurance, and payload to determine the expected displacement of the Littoral Combat Ship, (2) determines the impact of speed, displacement and significant wave height on Littoral Combat Ship fuel consumption and endurance, and (3) analyzes the <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> on Littoral Combat Ship logistics.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to bring into {{correspondence}} the findings from human amnesic patients and the findings from monkeys with surgical lesions of those brain regions thought to be affected in the human cases, we have addressed in three experiments the <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> that human amnesia spares motor and cognitive skills. In the first experiment, monkeys with conjoint lesions of hippocampus and amygdala (H-A), which reproduced the surgical removal sustained by the noted amnesic case H. M., were only mildly impaired in learning relatively difficult pattern discrimination tasks. Monkeys with lesions of temporal stem matter (TS) were severely impaired on the same tasks, due to an apparent deficiency in visual information processing. In the second experiment, monkeys with H-A lesions were severely impaired at learning relatively easy discrimination tasks that could be acquired rapidly by normal monkeys. Monkeys with TS lesions were not impaired. In the third experiment, monkeys with H-A lesions exhibited normal acquisition of two motor skill tasks. These data can be understood {{in the light of}} a distinction between kinds of memory, founded in recent studies of the neuropsychology of human amnesia.

The paper first reviews the conceptual literature on both land tenure and food security and suggests a new conceptual framework that incorporates the dynamic linkages between the two. Second, it reviews the existing empirical literature to raise for discussion a number of issues that mediate suggested linkages and briefly examine a limited number of cases of empirical research in which such linkages have been investigated.

Participants are {{one hundred and fifty}} undergraduates in 200 and 300 levels of the Social and Management Science Faculty of a Nigerian University.   Cheating Behaviour Questionnaire (Newstead et al, 1996) an instrument which contained 21 cheating behaviours and 21 reasons for engaging or not engaging in each of the behaviours was administered. Data analysis include frequency counts, ranks and chi-square, data revealed that the four cheating behaviours, which fell within collaborative cheating, were claimed to be the most frequent. They are: (1) premeditated collusion beteeen two or more students to communicate answers to each other during examinations (2) doing another students’ coursework for them (3) allowing own coursework to be copied by another student and (4) agreement to mark each others work more generously than is merited. Analysis of  data on reasons for engaging in these behaviours also revealed that the most frequently offered reason was “ to help a friend”, this suggests an altruistic reason.
