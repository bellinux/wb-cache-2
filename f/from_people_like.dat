5|$|On July 23 at Raw 1000, Punk {{defended his}} title against Money in the Bank winner John Cena and lost by {{disqualification}} after interference from Big Show. When the night's special guest The Rock– who had interrupted Punk earlier to announce he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble– intervened to save Cena from Big Show's assault, Punk attacked him, turning heel. The following week, Punk justified his actions, explaining {{he was tired}} of people like Cena and Rock overshadowing him when the WWE Champion should be the focus of the company; Punk asserted himself further soon after by disrupting a number one contender's match between Cena and Big Show. As a result, both men were entered into the title match against Punk at SummerSlam where he successfully retained the WWE Championship. In the following weeks, Punk demanded respect <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> AJ Lee, Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart and eventually aligned with Paul Heyman in his feud with Cena. At Night of Champions, Punk retained the WWE Championship after he fought Cena to a draw. Punk continued to feud with Cena, despite the latter's arm injury, rejecting the requests of Mick Foley and Jim Ross to pick him as his Hell in a Cell opponent and leading to a brawl with WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Cena was eventually pulled from the title match at Hell in a Cell, and replaced by Ryback. On October 28 at the pay-per-view, Punk, with help from referee Brad Maddox, defeated Ryback in a Hell in a Cell match to retain the WWE Championship.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{academics}} and scholars have rejected early orientalist theories asserting a non-Islamic origin of Sufism, [...] The {{consensus is that}} it emerged in Western Asia. Many have asserted Sufism to be unique {{within the confines of}} the Islamic religion and contend that Sufism developed <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> Bayazid Bastami, who, in his utmost reverence to the sunnah, refused to eat a watermelon because he did not find any proof that Muhammad ever ate it. According to the late medieval mystic Jami, Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah (died c. 716) was the first person to be called a [...] "Sufi".|$|E
2500|$|With support <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> Akshay Kumar Dutta, Vidyasagar {{introduced}} {{the practice of}} widow remarriages to mainstream Hindu society. [...] The prevailing custom of Kulin Brahmin polygamy allowed elderly men — sometimes on their deathbeds — to marry teenage or prepubescent girls, supposedly to spare their parents the shame of having an unmarried girl attain puberty in their house. After such marriages, these girls would usually be left behind in their parental homes, where they might be subjected to orthodox rituals, especially if they were subsequently widowed. These included a semi-starvation, hard domestic labour, and close restriction on their freedom {{to leave the house}} or be seen by strangers.|$|E

2500|$|He {{has been}} admired or written about by almost every major {{literary}} {{personality of the}} 20th century, including philosophers and sociologists such as Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, [...] Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Paul Sartre whose partially psychoanalytic portrait of Flaubert in The Family Idiot was published in 1971. Georges Perec named Sentimental Education {{as one of his}} favourite novels. The Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is another great admirer of Flaubert. Apart from Perpetual Orgy, which is solely devoted to Flaubert's art, one can find lucid discussions in Vargas Llosa's Letters to a Young Novelist (published 2003). In public lecture on May 1966 at the Kaufmann Art Gallery in New York, Marshall McLuhan claimed that [...] "I derived all my knowledge of media <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> Flaubert and Rimbaud and Baudelaire." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2015, noting {{a recent}} speech in which Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha stated, [...] "We must {{eradicate}} human trash [...] from this country", [...] Pravit commented, [...] "Though his decision to refer {{to some of his}} countrymen as human trash may be appalling and disturbing, it's good that he did not say nice things that he doesn't believe in". He added: [...] "Sadly, this sentiment has been plaguing Thailand for at least a decade — the belief that those {{on the other side of}} the political divide are not just wrong, but are enemies that need to be 'removed'". He pointed out that under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, [...] "some 2 million of the 8-million population were killed for the sake of a political ideology that saw 'the other' as an enemy that had to be eradicated". Although [...] "Thailand is far from becoming another killing field of that scale," [...] stated Pravit, [...] "the seeds of mutual destruction are quite visible as they continue being nurtured by hate speech on social media and watered by remarks <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> Prayuth". He urged his fellow Thais [...] "to realise that simply because everybody isn't on the same side of politics, does not necessarily mean they have to hate and deem those on the other side as downright evil." ...|$|E
60|$|On a level, yet {{lower than}} that of the Algonkin and other hunter tribes, are the American races whom {{circumstances}} have driven into desolate infertile regions; who live, like the Ahts, mainly on fish; like the Eskimos, in a world of frost and winter; or like the Fuegians, on crustaceans and seaweed. The minute gradations of culture cannot be closely examined here, but the process is upwards, <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> the Fuegians and Diggers, to the builders of the kitchen-middens--probably quite equals of the Eskimos***--and so through the condition of Ahts.|$|E

60|$|It {{has been}} shown, or I have tried, erroneously or not, to show that, wild and {{impossible}} {{as were the}} ideal claims of Knox, of Andrew Melville, of Mr. Pont, and others, the old Scottish Kirk of 1560, by law established, was capable of giving up or suppressing these claims, even under Knox, and even while the Covenant remained in being. The mass of the ministers, after the return of Charles II. before Worcester fight, before bloody Dunbar, were not irreconcilables. The Auld Kirk, the Kirk Established, has some right to call herself the Church of Scotland by historical continuity, while the opposite claimants, the men of 1843, may seem rather to descend <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>like</b> young Renwick, the last hero who died for their ideas, but not, in himself, the only 'lawful minister' between Tweed and Cape Wrath. 'Other times, other manners.' All the Kirks are perfectly loyal; now none persecutes; interference with private life, 'Kirk discipline,' is a vanishing minimum; and, but for this recent 'garboil' (as our old writers put it) we might have said that, under differences of nomenclature, all the Kirks are united at last, in the only union worth having, that of peace and goodwill. That union may be restored, let us hope, by good temper and common sense, qualities that have not hitherto been conspicuous in the ecclesiastical history of Scotland, or of England.|$|E
