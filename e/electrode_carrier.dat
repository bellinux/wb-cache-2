5000|$|In 1947 Leksell visited Wycis in Philadelphia and than {{developed}} and described his instrument in a publication in 1949 {{and this was}} the first example of a stereotactic system based on the principle of ‘‘center-of-arc’’. In contrast to the Cartesian coordinate system of the Spiegel-Wycis device, Leksell’s frame employed used three polar coordinates (angle, depth and anterior-posterior location). This ‘‘arc-quadrant’’ device provided maximum flexibility in choosing probe entry point and trajectory, and was therefore much easier to use. The frame has been modified over the ensuing years, but remarkably remains very similar in function and appearance to the original 1949 device. The use of a movable semi-arc with an <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> implies that the tip of a probe can reach the target regardless of the position of the carrier or the angling of the arc relative to the skull fixation device, a frame or base plate with bars for bone fixation screws. This construction permits also transphenoidal, straight lateral and suboccipital probe approaches.Leksell was in many respects a perfectionist {{and for the rest of}} his life he continued to change and revise the design of virtually every small part of his instrument though the basic semicircular frame was retained. He focused not only on upgrading the function of the instrument but also on its aesthetic appearance. An important feature was that ‘‘the apparatus should be easy to handle and practical in routine clinical work’’ and ‘‘a high degree of exactitude is necessary.’’ An oft-cited quotation is ‘‘Tools used by the surgeon must be adapted to the task and where the human brain is concerned, no tool can be too refined.’’ ...|$|E

40|$|Conclusion. The {{image quality}} of 64 -MDCT {{provided}} excellent {{definition of the}} fine osseous structures and individual electrode contacts. Evaluation of electrode distances revealed a more focused stimulation for the Helix contacts, with better optimization of pulse width and frequency of stimulation. Objectives. A multi-slice CT scan was performed postoperatively to evaluate electrode distance from the modiolus and variability of fitting parameters (M level) for {{two different types of}} cochlear implant <b>electrode</b> <b>carriers,</b> CII and 90 K implants with 1 J and Helix <b>electrode</b> <b>carriers.</b> Materials and methods. The electrode's position in different cochlear implant (CI) electrodes, Advanced Bionics 90 K 1 J and Helix, was assessed postoperatively in 20 adult patients by means of a 64 -MDCT scanner. Axial, coronal, and oblique 0. 3 mm multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) were obtained and datasets were analyzed to assess the intracochlear position and distance {{from the surface of the}} electrodes to the bony edge of the modiolus. Patients' fitting characteristics were gathered at the time the CT was performed and correlated to intracochlear measurements. Results. Determination of contact distances confirmed smaller average values for the Helix at the apex and medial segments. Helix electrodes were closer to the modiolus in all segments. Likewise, M level determination showed lower values for the Helix carrier, confirming a more focused stimulation and better optimization of pulse width and frequency of stimulation...|$|R

40|$|Adult {{mammalian}} {{optic nerve}} axons {{are able to}} regenerate, when provided with the permissive environment of an autologous peripheral nerve graft, which is usually the sciatic nerve. This study demonstrates the ability of adult rat optic nerve axons to regenerate through the preformed perforations of a polyimide <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> implanted at the interface between the proximal stump of the cut optic nerve and the stump of the peripheral nerve piece used for grafting. Evidence that retinal ganglion cells regenerated their axons through the perforated <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> was obtained by retrograde labeling with a fluorescent dye deposited into the sciatic nerve graft beyond the nerve-carrier-nerve junction. The number of regenerating cells could be enhanced by injecting neuroprotective drugs like aurintricarboxylic acid and cortisol intravitreally. A second line of evidence was obtained by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to neurofilament. Third, electrical activity of the regenerating nerves was recorded after stimulating the retina with a flash of light. The results suggest that a regenerating central nerve tract may serve as an experimental model to implant artificial microdevices to monitor the physiological and topographical properties of neurites passing through the device or to stimulate them, thus interfering with their potential to grow. This study reports {{for the first time}} that the optic nerve has unique properties, which aids in the realization of these goals...|$|E

The equilibrium spacing between graphene and an Al nanoparticle is sensitive to their mutual arrangement {{with respect to the}} <b>electrode,</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration, and carrier species. For most cases, owing to the Coulomb attractive interaction between accumulated carriers in graphene or an Al nanoparticle and the counter electrode, the Al nanoparticle is desorbed from the graphene surfaces at the carrier concentration of approximately 0. 5 e or 0. 5 h per unit cell...|$|E
40|$|The {{surgical}} {{aspects of}} 34 Clarion® cochlear implants, positioned during {{a five-year period}} on 31 profoundly-deaf subjects as primary (11 children, 20 adults) and revision surgery (one child, three adults) were taken into consideration. Intra- and post-operative complications related to the specific structure of this device were considered along with the benefits obtained by update of the hardware and surgical approach. A smaller thickness of the internal receiver {{as well as the}} shifting from a retro-auricular/sub-temporal (RA-ST) to an endaural-retromastoid (EA-RM) approach have contributed to a dramatic drop in post-operative complications, such as skin defect or device extrusion. Special care should, however, be taken when cochlear implantation is planned in ears with chronic otitis or its surgical sequelae. From the two revised cases (hardware failure, electrode displacement) in whom re-implantation in the same side was performed, it has been demonstrated that the helicoidal shape of the <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> is not inducing any additional trauma to the cohlear structure...|$|E

30|$|In 1994 Neuwirth et al. [10] {{introduced}} thermal uterine balloon {{therapy to}} address these problems. The success rate and complication profile of thermal balloon therapy compare favourably with hysteroscopic techniques [11 – 14]. The Vesta system (Vesta Medical, Mountain View, Calif., USA) is a thermoregulated radiofrequency balloon system for endometrial ablation. The device consists of a silicone inflatable <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> inserted into the uterine cavity and a controller to monitor and distribute current from a matched electrosurgical generator. Treatment involves a 3  min or shorter warming-up period and a 4  min treatment phase. The system ensures that correct temperatures are maintained at a stable degree in each area, which prevents over- or undertreatment [15]. It reduces bleeding and gives a long-term outcome equivalent to that of hysteroscopic endometrial ablation [16 – 18]. The intrinsic advantages of this device over conventional electrosurgical endometrial ablation include (A) stationary electrodes, which decrease the risk of perforation or uneven treatment, (B) a balloon platform, allowing expansion to fit the uterine cavity, (C) the absence of distending fluids and (D) the ability for the procedure to be performed under local anaesthesia in an out-patient clinic setting with limited operating time [7, 19].|$|E
40|$|A {{device for}} the {{measurement}} of the flow rate of a gas or of a liquid in accordance with patent application P 4027704. 6 - 52 has two electrodes spaced {{at a distance from}} each other in the flow direction, a voltage being applied to said electrodes {{in such a way that}} one of the electrodes injects ions into the gas or liquid, the charge of which is at least partly transferred to the other electrode, whereby a measurement current is generated. The device also has a generator to generate a voltage signal changing with time, a current detector to detect a change in the measurement current caused by a change in voltage and an evaluation device to measure the length of time between the change in voltage and the change in the measurement current and to determine the flow rate of the gas and the fluid in relation to the length of time measured. To simplify the manufacturing of this device, it is intended that the two electrodes are arranged at the main surfaces of a common <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> which is insulated at least in relation to one of the two electrodes and has a flow opening extending mainly vertically in relation to its main surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Artificial {{vision is}} {{currently}} in an early-stage of maturity. This {{can be understood as}} a falling short of visual prosthesis to generate a complete visual scene with detail perception. Similarly, the physical aspects of phosphenes or spots of light demand a better understanding. Approach: This study introduces the strategy of the activation area and pinpoints its usefulness to estimate the amount of cells activated and identify {{the size and shape of}} the phosphenes. A simulation framework was built by integrating the relevant retinal interface elements and the dynamics of the ionic channels in the ganglion cells. Shape perceptions reported by Keserü in clinical trials were directly compared with our simulation framework. Similarly, the strategy of the activation area is used on a proposed electrode array to activate single cells and to produce a small spot of light required for highresolution vision. Main Results: The wide range of shape responses formerly described by patients is highly correlated with our simulationbased findings. Single-cell selectivity was reached throughout the regions near the fovea, which is necessary in humans for activities where visual detail is of primary importance and thus relevant for high resolution vision. For realistic applications, we provided the dimensions of the <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> for single localized stimulation. Significance: Together of being useful to identify the physical aspects of phosphenes generated by electrical stimulation, the applicability of the activation area can yield valuable strategies to attain single-cell selectivity...|$|E

This paper deals with nonthermal plasma reactors for the conversion of heavy oil into light hydrocarbon olefins, to be employed as gasoline components or to be added in small amounts for the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxide compounds {{in the treatment of}} exhaust gas at power plants. For the process, the plate-plate nonthermal plasma reactor driven by AC high voltage was selected. The reactor was modeled as a function of parameter characteristics, using the methodology provided by the statistical experimental design. The parameters studied were gap distance between <b>electrodes,</b> <b>carrier</b> gas flow and applied power. Results indicate that the reactions occurring in the process of heavy oil conversion have an important selective behavior. The products obtained were C 1 -C 4 hydrocarbons with ethylene as the main compound. Operating the parameters of the reactor within the established operative window of the system and close to the optimum conditions, efficiencies as high as 70 (mul/joule) were obtained.

40|$|To {{develop skills}} {{sufficient}} for hearing preservation cochlear implant surgery, surgeons need to perform several electrode insertion trials in ex vivo temporal bones, thereby consuming relatively expensive <b>electrode</b> <b>carriers.</b> The objectives {{of this study}} were to evaluate the insertion characteristics of cochlear electrodes in a plastic scala tympani model and to fabricate radio opaque polymer filament dummy electrodes of equivalent mechanical properties. In addition, this study should aid the design and development of new cochlear electrodes. Automated insertion force measurement is a new technique to reproducibly analyze and evaluate the insertion dynamics and mechanical characteristics of an electrode. Mechanical properties of MED-EL’s FLEX 28, FLEX 24, and FLEX 20 electrodes were assessed {{with the help of an}} automated insertion tool. Statistical analysis of the overall mechanical behavior of the electrodes and factors influencing the insertion force are discussed. Radio opaque dummy electrodes of comparable characteristics were fabricated based on insertion force measurements. The platinum-iridium wires were replaced by polymer filament to provide sufficient stiffness to the electrodes and to eradicate the metallic artifacts in X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. These low-cost dummy electrodes are cheap alternatives for surgical training and for in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo research purposes...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the value}} of {{high-density}} surface electromyography (sEMG) has already been proven in fundamental research and for specific diagnostic questions, there is as yet no broad clinical application. This {{is partly due to}} limitations of construction principles and application techniques of conventional electrode array systems. We developed a thin, highly flexible, two-dimensional multielectrode sEMG grid, which is manufactured by using flexprint techniques. The material used as <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> (Polyimid, 50 microm thick) allows grids to be cut out in any required shape or size. One universal grid version can therefore be used for many applications, thereby reducing costs. The reusable electrode grid is attached to the skin by using specially prepared double-sided adhesive tape, which allows the selective application of conductive cream only directly below the detection surfaces. To explore the practical possibilities, this technique was applied in single motor unit analysis of the facial musculature. The high mechanical flexibility allowed the electrode grid to follow the skin surface even in areas with very uneven contours, resulting in good electrical connections in the whole recording area. The silverchloride surfaces of the electrodes and their low electrode-to-skin impedances guaranteed high baseline stability and a low signal noise level. The electrode-to-skin attachment proved to withstand saliva and great tensile forces due to mimic contractions. The inexpensive, universally adaptable and minimally obstructive sensor allows the principal advantages of high-density sEMG to be extended to all skeletal muscles accessible from the skin surface and may lay the foundation for more broad clinical application of this noninvasive, two-dimensional sEMG technique...|$|E

To achieve this goal, additional upgrade measures will be accomplished in several UNILAC sections: LEBT [1], HSI-RFQ [2] and Alvarez main linac (power supplies for the 168 focusing quadrupoles) [3], and high current beam diagnostics [4]. Status of Components In 2008 planning and fabrication for the HSI-RFQ upgrade and commissioning for the Alvarez power supply upgrade have taken place. HSI-RFQ Upgrade The HSI-RFQ will be upgraded with new electrodes, based on a new particle dynamics design [2]. This design, with larger aperture and higher voltage (155 kV instead of 125 kV at Uranium level), provides for a larger acceptance, keeping the max. surface peak field lower than the old design (< 320 kV/cm). The new input radial matcher (IRM) design allows radial beam matching without emittance growth in the matching section. Assuming an input beam current of 25 mA U 4 + (assuming 280 mm mrad transversal emittance), a transmission of 80. 6 % can be expected. The average aperture and the transverse shape of the electrode vanes are kept constant along the whole RFQ, {{as well as the}} dimensions of the <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> rings, to keep the flat field distribution.

40|$|Cochlear {{implantation}} is a maximally invasive {{surgical procedure}} aimed at overcoming human inaudibility and providing {{the sensation of}} sound to thousands of severely deaf recipients worldwide. Specialists require extensive training to perform the surgery, yet traditional approaches such as cadaver dissection and device insertion can prove costly. Alternative training schemes have not been developed, however surgical simulators that offer force feedback during anatomical model manipulation may provide the answer. In the work, a novel approach to medical education is presented. It combines haptic technology and computer visualisation to recreate cochlear implantation in a virtual environment. The surgical simulator provides visual and haptic rendering during cochlear implant insertion into a virtual model of the human Scala Tympani. As the user inserts the sub-sampled array into a three-dimensional, reproducible representation of the Scala Tympani, collisions between the electrode and Scala Tympani walls are detected. In response, real-time forces are delivered back through the haptic device in a closed loop control system. Insertion studies {{are performed to evaluate}} the cochlear implant insertion process. Electrode array trajectories and output forces are monitored during device insertion into a synthetic model of the Scala Tympani. The force, torque and position data produced from the experiments are used in the final stage of work for simulator validation. A three-dimensional, surface description of the human Scala Tympani is derived from measured data and parameterised for future reproduction. It is visualised in a virtual environment, the Reachin Application Programming Interface, where visual and haptic rendering is implemented to make the insertion process interactive. Algorithms are produced and program optimisations performed to enable real-time, dynamic manipulation of the environment. Real world physical attributes are added to the Scala Tympani surfaces and <b>electrode</b> <b>carrier</b> to make the scene more realistic.

For injected hot carriers in a typical organic semiconductor, rapid energetic relaxation occurs {{in the order of}} tens of nanoseconds, which is much faster than the typical transit time of a charge carrier throught the device. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of photo-generated carriers on the steady-state mobility. For a typical organic voltaic material, an increase in mobility of a factor of 1. 1 is found. Therefore, we conclude that the impact of energetically hot carriers on normal device operation is limited...|$|R
