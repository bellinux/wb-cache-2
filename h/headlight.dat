5|$|For the 2013 {{model year}} revision, Aston made minor {{changes to the}} {{bodywork}} by adapting designs from the Virage, including enlarging the recessed <b>headlight</b> clusters with bi-xenon lights and LED daytime strips, widening the front splitter, updating the grille and side heat extractors, updating the LED rear lights with clear lenses and integrating a new rear spoiler with the boot lid.|$|E
5|$|The colours of glass, ceramic glazes, paints, pigments, and {{plastics}} {{are commonly}} {{produced by the}} inclusion of heavy metals (or their compounds) such as chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, zirconium, molybdenum, silver, tin, praseodymium, neodymium, erbium, tungsten, iridium, gold, lead, or uranium. Tattoo inks may contain heavy metals, such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper. The high reflectivity of some heavy metals {{is important in the}} construction of mirrors, including precision astronomical instruments. <b>Headlight</b> reflectors rely on the excellent reflectivity of a thin film of rhodium.|$|E
50|$|Early Daytonas {{featured}} fixed <b>headlights</b> {{behind an}} acrylic glass cover. A new U.S. safety regulation banning <b>headlights</b> behind covers resulted in retractable pop-up twin <b>headlights</b> in 1971.|$|R
50|$|All trains {{that were}} {{delivered}} with incandescent <b>headlights</b> {{are now being}} retrofitted with LED <b>headlights,</b> following the successful testing of LED <b>headlights</b> on the Korail Class 311000 cars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first batch}} of four {{locomotives}} had small shunting-style <b>headlights.</b> The second batch had larger mainline <b>headlights,</b> which were later {{replaced with the}} shunting-style <b>headlights</b> later in their working lives.|$|R
5|$|Though the Meridian Star is now {{the only}} {{newspaper}} printed in the city, {{there have been a}} few other historical newspapers. One such paper is the Memo Digest, a ten to twenty page publication published during the 1970s. The Digest focused on issues relevant to the African-American population of the region, gathering a circulation of about 5,000 people. Other newspapers in the city have included The Colored Messenger, The State, The Weekly Mercury, The Blade, Weekly Echo, Fair Play, <b>Headlight,</b> Meridian Morning Sun, Teacher and Preacher, and Clarion.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a {{six degrees of}} freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters in that it allows the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's <b>headlight</b> to explore darkened areas.|$|E
5|$|Some early T-26 {{tanks were}} {{repaired}} in tank units or factories {{with the use}} of later production parts. This meant replacing the all-rubber road wheels (except the front wheels) and track idlers with new strengthened ones. Armour was added for the <b>headlight,</b> the armour thickness of the driver's hatch lower door of the twin-turreted tanks was increased from 6 to 10mm and armoured PT-1 or PTK observation devices were installed. A common hatch above the engine, oil tank, and fuel tank was mounted starting in May 1940. In 1940, 255 T-26s were modernised in this way and {{in the first half of}} 1941 another 85 tanks were improved. A central factory responsible for the T-26's repair and modernisation was the Factory of Carrying-and-Conveying Machines named after S. Kirov in Leningrad, and the Factory No. 105 named after L. Kaganovich in Khabarovsk from the beginning of the Great Patriotic War until 1945.|$|E

5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with <b>headlight</b> dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end of}} the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E
25|$|In California, <b>headlight</b> {{flashing}} {{is legal}} {{in some situations}} and illegal in others. It is legal for a driver to flash his headlights to indicate intention to pass on a road which does not allow passing on the right. However, <b>headlight</b> flashing on multiple-lane highways is illegal.|$|E
25|$|A {{headlamp}} is a lamp {{attached to}} the front of a vehicle to light the road ahead. While it is common for the term <b>headlight</b> to be used interchangeably in informal discussion, headlamp is the term for the device itself, while <b>headlight</b> properly refers to the beam of light produced and distributed by the device.|$|E

50|$|Earlier {{versions}} of <b>headlights</b> and signal lights were fueled by acetylene or oil. Acetylene was preferred to oil, because its flame is resistant to both wind and rain. Acetylene <b>headlights</b> were popular until 1898, {{when the first}} electric <b>headlights</b> were introduced.|$|R
5000|$|World's first {{directional}} <b>headlights</b> (Adaptive <b>Headlights)</b> {{which could}} electronically adjust the {{low beam lights}} horizontally (during turns) and vertically (based on rear axle load) adjustment of the low beam. Also, the E65 was the first BMW available with Bi-Xenon (HID) <b>headlights.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Headlight</b> {{design in}} the U.S. changed very little from 1940 to 1983.|$|E

25|$|There are {{distinguishable}} {{differences between}} the EMD models and the Canadian GMD-built models. Most notable are the <b>headlight</b> configurations. The biggest giveaway is the rear light. GMD SD40-2s have a single beam, where EMD has twin-beam styled lights, usually placed next to each other. GMD models also have lights mounted on the nose, and EMD is above the cab between the numberboards. Some EMD variations have a nose <b>headlight,</b> although the <b>headlight</b> style and placement usually isn't the same as seen on the GMDs. Other features on the GMD models include the bell mounted above the cab between the numbers, triple-style classification lights above the numbers(since trains don't use classlights anymore, many locomotives have had them removed), and no numberboards on the back.|$|E

50|$|Modern BMW-designed halo {{rings are}} part of the BMW bi-xenon <b>headlights.</b> A {{signature}} element that served to distinguish BMW vehicles on the road, halo <b>headlights</b> were soon borrowed by other automakers. For instance, the Chevrolet Camaro and the Chevrolet Impala were equipped with halo-ring <b>headlights.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Headlight</b> {{flashing}} {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with <b>headlight</b> beam selectors located on the steering column—typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk—rather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.|$|E
25|$|The SM's six <b>headlight</b> set up {{was illegal}} in the U.S. {{at the time}} and consequently, U.S. {{specification}} cars were fitted with four fixed round exposed lamps. Also, the separate glass windshields of the headlights were illegal in the USA after 1967, which is why the DS did not get them on USA cars when it was restyled for 1968, and the VW Beetle and Vanagon/Kombi and Jaguar E-Type lost their <b>headlight</b> glass windshields at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The <b>headlight</b> {{dimmer switch}} was also {{removed from the}} floor and {{incorporated}} into the turn signal lever for all 1977 models.|$|E
50|$|In this generation, the Corolla Levin {{came with}} fixed {{rectangular}} <b>headlights</b> which distinguished {{it from the}} Sprinter Trueno with retractable <b>headlights.</b> However, the American Corolla SR5 and GT-S also had retractable <b>headlights</b> the same as Japanese Trueno, but with longer bumpers to meet the US Federal standards.|$|R
