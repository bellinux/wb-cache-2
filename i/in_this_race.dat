5|$|Ag2r had {{a meager}} 2011 season, {{managing}} only six victories. The pinnacle of the team's season {{was certainly the}} Giro d'Italia. John Gadret, one of the team's leaders, won the undulating 11th stage to Castelfidardo. Though he was outclassed by the race's truly elite riders, particularly so by Giro champion Alberto Contador, he finished the race in fourth place overall, easily the best final placing in a Grand Tour in the team's history. Hubert Dupont also rode very strongly <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>race,</b> to 12th place overall and some high stage placings as well.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when chariot racing began, but It {{may have been}} as old as chariots themselves. It is known from artistic {{evidence}} on pottery that the sport existed in the Mycenaean world, but the first literary reference to a chariot race is one described by Homer, at the funeral games of Patroclus. The participants <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>race</b> were Diomedes, Eumelus, Antilochus, Menelaus, and Meriones. The race, which was one lap around the stump of a tree, was won by Diomedes, who received a slave woman and a cauldron as his prize. A chariot race also {{was said to be}} the event that founded the Olympic Games; according to one legend, mentioned by Pindar, King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia to a race, but was defeated by Pelops, who founded the Games in honour of his victory.|$|E

5|$|Mark Cavendish and Daniele Bennati, stage {{winners in}} the past two editions of the Giro, were absent from this race, but several top sprinters took the start in Amsterdam. These {{included}} Tyler Farrar, André Greipel, and Alessandro Petacchi, all of whom had themselves won Grand Tour stages in 2009 and figured to be top favorites for the Giro's flat stages. Former Tour de France points classification winner Óscar Freire intended to make his Giro debut <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>race,</b> but he pulled out due to sinusitis shortly before the race started. Other sprinters in the Giro peloton included Robbie McEwen, Freire's teammate Graeme Brown, Baden Cooke, Leonardo Duque, Sebastian Haedo, Wouter Weylandt, and Greg Henderson.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy {{campaigned for}} the Republican Senate {{nomination}} in Wisconsin while still {{on active duty}} in 1944 but was defeated by Alexander Wiley, the incumbent. After he left the Marines in April 1945, five months {{before the end of}} the Pacific war in September 1945, McCarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position. He then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate primary nomination, with support from Thomas Coleman, the Republican Party's political boss in Wisconsin. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>race,</b> he was challenging three-term senator Robert M. La Follette Jr., founder of the Wisconsin Progressive Party and son of the celebrated Wisconsin governor and senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|$|E
5|$|Ornais and Dooneys Gate both {{suffered}} fatal {{falls on}} the first circuit. Ornais incurred a cervical fracture at the fourth fence (a plain 4ft 10-inch obstacle) and Dooneys Gate fractured his thoracolumbar at fence six (the 5ft Becher's Brook). Aintree had made significant modifications to its National Course in recent years, including improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of some fences, but another notable change was highlighted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>race</b> – that the course has been widened to allow more fences to be bypassed if necessary. As the remaining contenders on the second circuit approached the 20th fence, arrowed signposts and marshals waving chequered flags signalled them to bypass on the outside as Ornais' body was covered by a tarpaulin on the landing side. Two jumps later and they were again diverted, this time around the famous Becher's Brook, where veterinary staff attended to Dooneys Gate. This {{was the first time}} since the modern course was finalised in the 1880s that only 28 fences were jumped.|$|E
