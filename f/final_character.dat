5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The <b>final</b> <b>character</b> in the game is the Gatekeeper, whose job is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E

25|$|In Windows utilities, {{the space}} and the period are not allowed as the <b>final</b> <b>character</b> of a filename. The period is allowed as the first character, but some Windows applications, such as Windows Explorer, forbid {{creating}} or renaming such files (despite this convention being used in Unix-like systems to describe hidden files and directories). Workarounds include appending a dot when renaming the file (that is then automatically removed afterwards), using alternative file managers, or saving a file with the desired filename from within an application.|$|E

25|$|Variation {{selectors}} are {{not required}} for Arabic and Latin cursive characters, where substitution of glyphs can occur based on context: glyphs may be connected together {{depending on whether the}} character is the initial character in a word, the <b>final</b> <b>character,</b> a medial character or an isolated character. These types of glyph substitution are easily handled by the context of the character with no other authoring input involved. Authors may also use special-purpose characters such as joiners and non-joiners to force an alternate form of glyph where it would not otherwise appear. Ligatures are similar instances where glyphs may be substituted simply by turning ligatures on or off as a rich text attribute.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, the old {{inscriptions}} on {{the main}} gate were removed. Contracted workers took more than seven hours to separate the four characters, each weighing half a ton, and lower them down carefully one by one. The <b>final</b> <b>character,</b> zheng (正), was peeled off at 5:26p.m. A TV cameraman was {{run over by a}} small truck and seriously injured as supporters and opponents of the government's decision to alter the plaque at the memorial hall clashed near the scene. The Taipei City Government issued another NT$1 million fine to the MOE for damaging a historical site.

500|$|There {{were around}} forty animators on the crew, and were further divided into teams; for example, sixteen animators were {{assigned}} to Jim Hawkins because he {{appeared on the screen}} the most, and twelve {{were assigned to}} John Silver. To ensure [...] "solidity" [...] in illustration and personality, each major character in the film had a team of animators led by one supervisor. Conli mentioned that the personalities of the supervisors affect the <b>final</b> <b>character,</b> citing Glen Keane (the supervisor for John Silver) as well as John Ripa (the supervisor for Jim Hawkins) as examples. The physical appearance, movements, and facial expressions of the voice actors were infused into the characters as well.|$|E
500|$|Illustrator and {{designer}} Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization and concept design {{for many of}} the characters in the Uncharted series. Early on, the Naughty Dog development team drew a number of concept sketches depicting characters hanging from cliffs and handling weapons awkwardly; many of these concepts directly translated into the <b>final</b> <b>character</b> products. The more fluid character motions were improvised on a motion capture stage, and were not scripted or drawn beforehand. Amy Hennig, the series writer, designed the character's personalities and mannerisms. The production team sought to capture a certain tone in the character design, and closely studied the pulp adventure genre for inspiration. This included drawing characteristics from Tintin, Doc Savage, and a number of movies. They tried to contrast with other western games, which lead game designer Richard Lemarchand described as [...] "overwrought and all a bit emo." ...|$|E
500|$|New {{recurring}} {{characters were}} also introduced in season five. The character of Jillian Fisher, Brian's new dimwitted girlfriend, {{was introduced in}} the episode [...] "Whistle While Your Wife Works". She provided an ironic counterpoint to Brian's intellectualism. Her <b>final</b> <b>character</b> personality was designed to be a stereotypical blonde, [...] "a bulimic cheerleader," [...] and [...] "not the brightest bauble on the tree." [...] Her voice would later play upon the bulimic cheerleader element, with actress Drew Barrymore providing the voice of Jillian in eight episodes, five of which would be in season five. Other guest stars who made multiple appearances as recurring characters from previous seasons were Carrie Fisher as Peter's boss, Angela, and Phyllis Diller as Peter's mother. Seth MacFarlane's sister, Rachael MacFarlane, also made an appearance as Olivia, the child actress, when her character was apparently killed by Stewie in the episode [...] "Chick Cancer".|$|E

500|$|A [...] (or [...] ) clause is {{a string}} of characters, each of which {{represents}} {{a portion of the}} data item and what it may contain. Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory. For example, a [...] indicates a decimal digit, and an [...] indicates that the item is signed. Other picture characters (called [...] and [...] characters) specify how an item should be formatted. For example, a series of [...] characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the <b>final</b> <b>character</b> data; the rightmost non-numeric character will contain the item's sign, while other character positions corresponding to a [...] to the left of this position will contain a space. Repeated characters can be specified more concisely by specifying a number in parentheses after a picture character; for example, [...] is equivalent to [...] Picture specifications containing only digit (...) and sign (...) characters define purely [...] data items, while picture specifications containing alphabetic (...) or alphanumeric (...) characters define [...] data items. The presence of other formatting characters define [...] or [...] data items.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Jillian was altered several {{times by the}} show producers before its original airing; however, the <b>final</b> <b>character</b> personality {{was designed to be}} that of [...] "a bulimic cheerleader." [...] The {{character of}} Jillian was also designed to be [...] "not the brightest bauble on the tree," [...] but this too was repeatedly changed. The description of Jillian's voice being that of a bulimic cheerleader somewhat relates to a future episode plot, where Stewie calls Jillian fat, to which she responds by leaving the room and throwing up. When Stewie exclaims [...] "it's like she's fucking five," [...] this was not set to broadcast at its original air date, but rather added in at a later date for unknown reasons. When Stewie is entertaining the elderly citizens by singing a song entitled [...] "there's a hole {{in the bottom of the}} sea," [...] this is actually Seth MacFarlane's father playing the guitar, as he used to sing it to Seth when he was a child. During the making of this episode, not much thought was put into the character of Jillian, despite the fact she was always meant to be recurring character; although her regular appearances throughout season 5 were described as [...] "a big thing for Family Guy." ...|$|E
500|$|The <b>final</b> <b>character</b> to be cast, Rachel {{is portrayed}} by actress Jennifer Aniston, who auditioned {{for the role}} shortly after declining a {{position}} as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. Her decision was initially ridiculed by both her friends as well as actor Adam Sandler, a Saturday Night Live alum. Actress Téa Leoni, {{who at the time}} was being referred to by the media as [...] "the next Lucille Ball", was offered the role of Rachel as the studio's first choice, but she declined in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth. Actress Elizabeth Berkley also auditioned for the role prior to being cast in the teen sitcom Saved by the Bell. Other actresses who auditioned for Rachel include Denise Richards, Melissa Rivers, Nicollette Sheridan, Parker Posey, and Jami Gertz. Originally, the producers wanted to cast actress Courteney Cox as Rachel, who Crane and Kauffman were particularly drawn to because of her [...] "cheery, upbeat energy." [...] Additionally, Cox was the most famous cast member at the time amidst an ensemble of relatively unknown actors. However, the actress lobbied for the role of Rachel's best friend Monica, as whom she was ultimately cast, because she felt that she was not [...] "quirky" [...] enough to play Rachel. At the same time, although unbeknownst to each other, Aniston was being considered for the role of Monica, but fought to play Rachel because she felt that the character suited her better. At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to play Monica until her own character's storylines started improving.|$|E

A 2.6 demo was announced on June 26, 2013, and it was released on July 17, 2013. The designers hoped to feature the Turbo mode in this update, but it was not ready in time. The designers added a [...] "Clone Engine" [...] to the game that allowed them to make the character , whose only appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series at the time was in Melee. They designed Roy by taking a clone of Marth and changing the clone into the desired result, along with using the same use of the engine to make the character Mewtwo, albeit with major edits to its model, due to it and Lucario having different movesets. In order to avoid cease-and-desist letters from Nintendo, the designers explained that they would not use this engine to make new fighters who debuted in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The designers added new alternate costumes for a number of characters, including Dr. Mario, who was previously cut from Brawl, for Mario. It was given a release date of December 9, 2013 with a <b>final</b> <b>character</b> count of 41, more than any previous Super Smash Bros. game at the time.
