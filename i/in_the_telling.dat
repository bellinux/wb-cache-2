5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>telling.</b> One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E
5|$|Montejo the Younger next {{sent his}} cousin to Chauaca {{where most of}} the eastern lords greeted him in peace. The Cochua Maya {{resisted}} fiercely but were soon defeated by the Spanish. The Cupul Maya also rose up against the newly imposed Spanish domination, and also their opposition was quickly put down. Montejo continued to the eastern Ekab province, reaching the east coast at Pole. Stormy weather prevented the Spanish from crossing to Cozumel, and nine Spaniards drowned in the attempted crossing. Another Spanish conquistador was killed by hostile Maya. Rumours of this setback grew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> and both the Cupul and Cochua provinces once again rose up against their would-be European overlords. The Spanish hold on the eastern portion of the peninsula remained tenuous and a number of Maya polities remained independent, including Chetumal, Cochua, Cupul, Sotuta and the Tazes.|$|E

25|$|Episodes with {{dialogue}} {{from the}} Ramayana are enacted using painted {{figures of the}} characters in profile, which strongly resemble the 18th-century Indian tradition of Rajput painting. The Rajput style of brush painting was principally enacted on manuscripts and commonly employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> of epics such as the Ramayana. In the film they serve as a more traditional style of dramatic narrative, although the dialogue is frequently ironic, inappropriately modern or otherwise humorous.|$|E
25|$|Symbolism {{plays an}} {{enduring}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> {{of a story}} through painting or other Chinese art. For instance, stars and the moon are important both for religious significance and as an illustration of Chinese mythology. Symbols used in art may be grouped into four overarching categories: religious imagery, divine and mortal beings, symbols from nature and inanimate objects. Some examples of symbols include bats which means both good wishes and good luck. The moon, aside from religious and mythical connotations, can also mean a month. The particular way an image is depicted has meaning - like a round eyed-cat means it's a night scene.|$|E

25|$|By AD 8, he had {{completed}} his most ambitious work, the Metamorphoses, a hexameter epic poem in 15 books. The work encyclopedically catalogues transformations in Greek and Roman mythology, from {{the emergence of}} the cosmos to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar. The stories follow each other <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> of human beings transformed to new bodies: trees, rocks, animals, flowers, constellations etc. At the same time, he worked on the Fasti, a six-book poem in elegiac couplets on the theme of the calendar of Roman festivals and astronomy. The composition of this poem was interrupted by Ovid's exile, and it is thought that Ovid abandoned work on the piece in Tomis. It is probably in this period, if they are indeed by Ovid, that the double letters (16–21) in the Heroides were composed.|$|E

500|$|The {{reviewer}} for The Critic {{dismissed it}} as [...] "an unpleasant story... There is humor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>telling,</b> {{but it is}} humor of a rather grim character." [...] Julian Hawthorne, son of author Nathaniel Hawthorne, also ultimately disliked the novella, calling it [...] "an outrage on art and humanity". [...] He did, however, point to the similarities between Crane's [...] "monster" [...] and Victor Frankenstein's creation in Mary Shelley's most famous work, stating that Crane, like Shelley before him, successfully depicted an innocent outsider being tormented by townspeople who are themselves made monstrous by their irrational fears. [...] Other critics have since echoed the comparison between Shelley's character and Henry Johnson; Elizabeth Young explained the parallels in that, similar to Frankensteins narrative—in which [...] "a male body is hideously transformed in a scientist's laboratory and brought back by the scientist from the dead—Johnson's disfigurement {{takes place in a}} doctor's laboratory, and it is Trescott that ultimately saves him.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} {{prospective}} heroes who come forward {{as a result}} of the king's appeal varies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> from 30 to 36, but they all leave without confronting the monster. The day before the princess is due to be sacrificed, Assipattle, the youngest son of a local farmer and despised by his family, mounts his father's horse and at dawn arrives on the beach where the creature is just beginning to awaken. After stealing some hot peat and acquiring a small boat, Assipattle is driven by the waves into the stoor worm's mouth as it starts yawning. The boat is carried down to the depths of the creature's stomach until it finally comes to rest. Assipattle plunges the still burning peat into the stoor worm's liver, causing a [...] "fire that blazed like a furnace". The pain of its burning liver causes the creature to have a fit of retching that carries Assipattle, who has managed to return to his boat, back out of the monster's mouth.|$|E
500|$|Wagner {{may also}} have been {{influenced}} by the Rhine River-based German legend of Lorelei, the lovelorn young maiden who drowns herself in the river and becomes a siren, luring fishermen onto the rocks by her singing. Further possible sources lie in Greek mythology and literature. Similarities exist between the maiden guardians in the Hesperides myth and the Rhinemaidens of Das Rheingold; three females guard a highly desired golden treasure that is stolen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> of each tale. Wagner was an enthusiastic reader of Aeschylus, including his Prometheus Bound which has a chorus of Oceanids or water nymphs. One author, Rudolph Sabor, sees a link between the Oceanids' treatment of Prometheus and the Rhinemaidens' initial tolerance of Alberich. Just as in Greek myth the Oceanids are the daughters of the titan sea god Oceanus, in Norse mythology—specifically the Poetic Edda—the jötunn (similar to a giant) sea god Ægir has nine daughters. The name of one of these means [...] "wave" [...] (Welle in German) and is a possible source for Wellgunde's name.|$|E

500|$|Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie {{observe that}} [...] "the tale {{is unusual in}} that the hero little deserves his good fortune, that is if his poverty, his being a third child, and his unquestioning {{acceptance}} of the cat's sinful instructions, are not nowadays looked upon as virtues." [...] The cat should be acclaimed the prince of 'con' artists, they declare, as few swindlers have been so successful before or since. The success of Histoires is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons. While the literary skill employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>telling</b> of the tales has been recognized universally, it appears the tales were set down in great part as the author heard them told. The evidence for that assessment lies first in {{the simplicity of the}} tales, then in the use of words that were, in Perrault's era, considered populaire and du bas peuple, and finally, in the appearance of vestigial passages that now are superfluous to the plot, do not illuminate the narrative, and thus, are passages the Opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in the process of creating a work of art. One such vestigial passage is Puss's boots; his insistence upon the footwear is explained nowhere in the tale, it is not developed, nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside.|$|E
