25|$|Group R6-1 {{is similar}} to GroupsQ5-1 and Q6-1, except that the higher pyramid {{structure}} is {{on the south side}} of the courtyard. The basal platform of the complex is built of <b>dolomitic</b> <b>limestone</b> blocks. A circular altar rests at the base of the pyramid and a small structure occupies the centre of the courtyard, an unusual feature that is not often found in the Maya lowlands although other examples have been identified at Tikal and Uaxactun. This group has been dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
25|$|Against this backdrop, President Fackenthal {{resigned}} on May 1, 1913, after recommending {{a program}} of retrenchment and abandonment of the old furnaces at Alburtis. His successor, chosen on July 1, 1913, was Ralph H. Sweetser, who held largely opposite views. Sweetser modernized not only No. 1 and No. 3 stacks at Hokendauqua, but the old No. 7 stack at Alburtis. He also attempted to restart local limonite mining, an effort which proved a costly failure. By 1915, No. 6 stack at Hokendauqua had been abandoned (leaving only No. 1 and No. 3 in operation there). The limestone flux for the furnaces, until now obtained from local <b>dolomitic</b> <b>limestone</b> quarries, was now replaced by high-calcium lime from Annville, Pennsylvania, eliminating the last local source of raw materials.|$|E

2500|$|The landmass of Monti della Laga {{has a more}} {{rounded off}} {{characteristic}} in comparison {{with many of the}} other Apennine areas. This phenomenon is because the soil is far more arenaceous (sandy) and has marble formations that are not found {{in other parts of the}} central Apennine Mountains farther to north and the south. Hence the geological name given to the area, [...] "Formazione di Laga". More characteristic of the Apennine mountains are soils, rocks, and land formations made up of coal and <b>dolomitic</b> <b>limestone.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Rock of Gibraltar is {{interpreted}} by geologists as a klippe of Jurassic <b>dolomitic</b> <b>limestone</b> with series of 'shale' formations underlying {{and in part}} overlaying the limestone. It consists primarily {{of a series of}} carbonate deposits some [...] thick, varying from dark grey bituminous dolomite at the base through to a very thick, apparently homogeneous sequence of light or medium grey fine-grained limestones. The formation appears to have been laid down in a tropical environment somewhat similar to the Bahamas today, and on the basis of fossil evidence an Early Jurassic (Sinemurian) age has been proposed for the Gibraltar Limestone, though in appearance it has a strong resemblance to the Carboniferous Limestone that underlies large parts of England and Wales.|$|E
2500|$|The American War Memorial (pictured at right) is a World War I naval {{monument}} {{located near}} {{the north end of}} Line Wall Road in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, {{at the southern end of}} the Iberian Peninsula. More formally known as the Naval Monument at Gibraltar, the memorial and steps were incorporated into the Line Wall Curtain at Prince Albert's Front giving pedestrians access to the lower Reclamation Road, Fish Market Lane, and Queensway. The steps connected the town above with the Royal Navy facilities below. The monument was designed by architect Paul Philippe Cret (1876 [...] 1945), a native of France who was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Cret (pictured at right) designed the memorial on behalf of the American Battle Monuments Commission. It was constructed between 1932 and 1933. The inscription (link below) over the arch of the memorial indicates that it was [...] "erected by the United States of America to commemorate the achievements and comradeship of the American and British Navies in this vicinity during the World War." [...] On the other side of the masonry arch are two bronze medallions (pictured below) depicting the seals of the United States and of its Department of the Navy. The <b>dolomitic</b> <b>limestone</b> utilised in the construction of the monument came from the Rock of Gibraltar. The memorial is an example of the successful incorporation of a relatively recent work into older, existing architecture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Limestones {{have been}} used to capture SO 2 emitted during the {{combustion}} of coal for decades. However, due to the complexities of the variables involved in this process, many issues are still being studied. Some tests were performed in a fluidized bed reactor, which was used to evaluate the performance of the limestones in the bed for flue gas desulfurization, burning low sulfur coal. Metamorphic <b>dolomitic</b> <b>limestones</b> of low cost were evaluated considering the impurity level and need for beneficiation. They were characterized chemically, physically and microstructurally (X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, laser particle size analyzer, scanning electronic microscope). The data obtained were compared to a calcitic limestone of elevated purity and higher market value. The results showed little effect of the major impurities present in the <b>dolomitic</b> <b>limestones</b> in the calcination and desulfurization processes. Microcrystalline impurities showed a marked effect promoting grain sintering in calcination conditions of TGA/DTA tests in different atmospheres, as shown in SEM images. <b>Dolomitic</b> <b>limestones</b> generate more solid waste and capture less SO 2 per kcal (a slightly decrease in the thermal efficiency of the reactor) compared to calcitic limestones. However, due to the lower cost, they were considered to be attractive for the FBC process (2 mg SO 2 /kcal at Ca/S= 3) ...|$|R
30|$|Differential {{weathering}} {{and erosion}} of various rock types {{has resulted in}} such relief variation. The low relief area is basically consisting of weaker rocks like slate and phyllite, while quartzite, gneiss and <b>dolomitic</b> <b>limestones</b> give rise to higher relief with sharp crested ridge because of relatively resistant to weathering and erosion.|$|R

The evaporites were later activated as diapirs during the Pyrenean orogeny and the mudstones served as decollement horizons along which Triassic sediments were squeezed northwards to the line Arcachon-Toulouse.|$|R
