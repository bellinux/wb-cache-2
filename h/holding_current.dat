500|$|Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U both {{garnered}} critical {{praise and}} were commercially successful, <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> ratings of 85/100 and 92/100 on Metacritic and 86.10% and 92.39% on GameRankings. Reviewers have particularly noted the large, diverse character roster, the improvements to game mechanics, and {{the variety of}} multiplayer options. Some criticisms in the 3DS version include a lack of single player modes and issues concerning the 3DS hardware, such as the size of characters on the smaller screen when zoomed out and latency issues during both local and online multiplayer. There were also reports of players damaging their 3DS Circle Pads while playing the game excessively. [...] The Wii U version's online play quality was mildly criticized for some inconsistency, but has overall been critically acclaimed. Daniel Dischoff of Game Revolution stated [...] "It's true that Super Smash Bros. evolves every time with regard to new features, items, and characters to choose from. [...] While your favorite character may not return or a few annoying pickups may force you to turn off items altogether, this represents the biggest leap forward Smashers have seen yet." [...] Daniel Starky at GameSpot criticized the inconsistent online performance in the game, but still called it an [...] "incredible game", noting [...] "With the Wii U release, Smash Bros. has fully realized its goals." [...] Jose Otero from IGN, praising the replayability of the game, states [...] "Nearly every aspect of Smash Wii U seems fine-tuned not only {{to appeal to the}} nostalgia of long-time Nintendo fans, but also to be accessible to new players." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{combined}} {{main burner}} and pilot gas valves (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to {{within the range}} of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the [...] "press and hold for x minutes" [...] in the pilot lighting instructions. (The <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the gas valve coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple gas valve coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good gas valve.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the most}} basic of {{circuits}}, if the current falls below the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> even briefly, the circuit is turned 'OFF' (becomes blocked). However, complex circuits and devices may have different delays built-in between the time the current falls below this level and the time the device turns 'OFF'. Whether a device turns 'ON' when current is restored is a design issue. The current necessary to restore the circuit to the 'ON' state, called the [...] "threshold current" [...] (See threshold voltage), may be much greater than the <b>holding</b> <b>current,</b> or only very slightly more. Nevertheless, where the device is designed to turn back 'ON' upon restoration of the current and where the device is running at or about the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> level, slight variations in the current can cause flicker as the device cycles 'OFF' and 'ON'. If flicker is undesirable, it can be reduced by the use of capacitors or other circuits, on the other hand, flicker can be used to measure small events as in a Geiger-Müller tube.|$|E
