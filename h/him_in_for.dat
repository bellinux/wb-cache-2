5|$|In July 1889, Police Constable Luke Hanks was {{investigating}} a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office. During the investigation, a fifteen-year-old telegraph boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered {{to be in}} possession of fourteen shillings, equivalent to several weeks of his wages. At the time, messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash {{in the course of}} their duties, to prevent their own money being mixed with that of the customers. Suspecting the boy's involvement in the theft, Constable Hanks brought <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> questioning. After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a General Post Office clerk, eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.|$|E

25|$|A strong {{influence}} on the play is the novel The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger. There are some very overt references to it, as when the protagonist explains the thesis paper he has just written on The Catcher in The Rye to the family who takes <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> the night. There are also more subtle allusions made both in the script and in the cinematography of the film version, such as when various characters begin to take on Holden Caulfield-esque characteristics and attitudes.|$|E

However, King returned to Mississippi shortly afterward, where he decided to prepare himself better for the next visit, and returned to West Memphis, Arkansas, two years later in 1948. He performed on Sonny Boy Williamson's radio program on KWEM in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King's appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA.

When the {{producers}} called <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a third audition, Johnson informed them that if they wanted him then they would bring <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a screen-test. After the screen-test, Johnson was cast and spent only one day filming his scenes for the pilot. The producers, along with Johnson, wanted to portray Whitney as {{more than just the}} [...] "stereotypical jock" [...] that he could have easily become, {{in an effort to make}} sure Lana did not look stupid for going out with him. Whitney was given multiple storylines in season one in an effort to get audiences to view the character in a more pleasant light, but Kristin Kreuk feels that it was all for naught, as the audience only sees him through Clark's eyes.|$|E

500|$|In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, {{also known}} as [...] "Ma-Ma", executes three rogue drug dealers by having them skinned alive, infused with Slo-Mo (an {{addictive}} new drug which reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals {{to be the one}} who carried out the drug dealers' executions. Dredd decides to take <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> questioning.

[...] In the concluding article, published in October, 1957, Dewar wrote that the failure of the Navy to adequately support the Army at Gallipoli [...] "is {{to be found in the}} system of training officers which consciously or unconsciously suppressed independent thought and suggestions from subordinates." [...] Despite his later close association with Churchill, he criticised the former First Lord's unrealistic expectations and also Lord Fisher's inability to rein <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> want of a naval staff; and Admiral of the Fleet (at the time Commodore) Roger Keyes for actively trying to gain support for forcing the straits again instead of acting as chief of staff and only advising the Naval Commander at the Dardanelles.|$|E
500|$|Holloman {{made his}} major league debut on April 14 in a relief appearance. He made in three {{additional}} relief appearances afterward, allowing five runs in 5⅓ innings through his first four games. As a result, Holloman asked Marion for a start, claiming {{he was better}} in that role, {{and if he was}} just going {{to be used as a}} relief pitcher, he should be sold to another team. Marion gave in, and put <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a home game on May 6 against the Philadelphia Athletics. On a rainy night before a crowd of 2,473 at Sportsman's Park, Holloman threw a no-hitter in his first major league start. He had two hits as a batter, and recorded three strikeouts en route to the 6–0 victory. [...] In his autobiography, Browns owner Bill Veeck called Holloman's no-hitter [...] "the quaintest no-hitter in the history of the game," [...] saying that his pitches were [...] "belted" [...] all night but he was saved by luck and outstanding defense.|$|E
500|$|Klyce got {{in touch}} with sound and film editor Walter Murch who worked on The Conversation and he got Klyce in touch with Shire.

At first, Fincher only wanted 15–20 minutes of score and for it to be all based on solo piano. As Shire worked on it and incorporated textures of a Charles Ives piece called [...] "The Unanswered Question" [...] and Conversation-based cues, he found that he had 37 minutes of original music. The orchestra Shire assembled consisted of musicians from the San Francisco Opera and S.F. ballet. Shire said, [...] "There are 12 signs of the Zodiac and there is a way of using atonal and tonal music. So we used 12 tones, never repeating any of them but manipulating them". He used specific instruments to represent the characters: the trumpet for Toschi, the solo piano for Graysmith and the dissonant strings for the Zodiac killer.|$|E
