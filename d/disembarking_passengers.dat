25|$|With the {{platform}} too short for new NSB Class 72 trains, the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{was required to}} lengthen {{the platform}} or close the station by 2012.

In addition to saving the investment costs, cutting four stations allowed faster travel time from the remaining stations. To a certain degree {{many of the people}} previously using Askim Næringspark as a park and ride station started using Slitu Station instead.|$|E

Normally passengers boarded Flyer by a single gangway that extended from the waiting room on the upper level of the pier structure.

On this day there was an extreme low tide as the flyer approached the dock, and the freight ramp could not reach the deck of the Flyer. For this reason the Flyers own gangplank was extended out {{to the end of the}} freight ramp, which was supposedly held up with chains.|$|E
