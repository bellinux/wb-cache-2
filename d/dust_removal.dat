2500|$|Manufacturers who mass-produce {{products}} implement automated flatline finish systems. [...] These systems {{consist of}} a series of processing stations that may include sanding, <b>dust</b> <b>removal,</b> staining, sealer and topcoat applications. As the name suggests, the primary part shapes are flat. Liquid wood finishes are applied via automated spray guns in an enclosed environment or spray cabin. The material then can enter an oven or be sanded again depending on the manufacturerâ€™s setup. The material can also be recycled through the line to apply another coat of finish or continue in a system that adds successive coats depending on the layout of the production line. The systems typically used one of two approaches to production.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} methods of <b>dust</b> cake <b>removal</b> from {{collecting}} plates in electrostatic precipitators are presented. If <b>dust</b> cake <b>removal</b> from the collecting plates surface is not enough, the dust collection effectivity decreases. Some methods of <b>dust</b> cake <b>removal</b> from collecting plates are known: electromagnetic method, pneumatic method, acoustic method, plushing and mechanical rapping. The {{most effective and}} the most often used method of <b>removal</b> of <b>dust</b> cake, which is accumulated on the collecting plates in dry electrostatic precipitators, is mechanical flicking off method. Mechanism of action by using this method depends on the serial inducing of vibrates by hitting of special hammers on the collecting plates...|$|R

5000|$|Kodak's own scanner, the [...] "pro-lab" [...] Kodak HR500 Plus was {{equipped}} with Digital ICE that could scan Kodachrome slides effectively, however, this scanner was discontinued in 2005. Nikon produced the Nikon Super Coolscan LS-9000 ED scanner with {{a new version of}} ICE (Digital ICE Professional) from 2004 until it was discontinued in 2010. This was capable of scanning Kodachrome slides reliably, dust- and scratch-free, without additional software. LaserSoft Imaging released an infrared <b>dust</b> and scratch <b>removal</b> tool (iSRD - Infrared Smart Removal of Defects) in 2008, that allows Nikon's film scanners for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, as well as many scanners from other manufacturers to make high quality scans of Kodachrome slides.

50|$|Types {{of samples}} include air, surface, bulk, and swab. Air {{is the most}} common form of {{sampling}} to assess mold levels. Indoor and outdoor air are sampled, and their mold-spore levels compared. Air sampling often identifies hidden mold. Surface sampling measures the number of mold spores deposited on indoor surfaces, collected on tape or in <b>dust.</b> Bulk <b>removal</b> of material from the contaminated area is used to identify and quantify the mold in the sample. With swab, a cotton swab is rubbed across the area being sampled, often a measured area, and subsequently sent to the mold testing laboratory. Final results indicate mold levels and species located in suspect area.|$|R

40|$|Effective high {{temperature}} ceramic filters are indispensable in the advanced, coal based power systems (IGCC and PFBC). To meet the environmental particulate emission requirements and improve thermal efficiency, ceramic filters are utilized to cleanup the hot gas particulate to protect downstream heat exchanger and gas turbine components from fouling and corrosion. The mechanical integrity of ceramic filters and an efficient <b>dust</b> cake <b>removal</b> system {{are the key}} issues for hot gas cleanup systems. The filters must survive combined stresses due to mechanical, thermal, chemical and steam attack throughout normal operations (cold back pulse cleaning jets), unexpected excessive ash accumulation, and the start up and shut down conditions. To evaluate the design and performance of ceramic filters, different long term filter testing programs were conducted. To fulfill this purpose, two Advanced Particle Filter (APF) systems were complete at Tidd PFBC Demonstration Plant in Brilliant, Ohio in late 1990 {{as part of the}} Department of Energy`s (DOE) Clean Coal Technology Program. However, many filter failures 1649 were reported prior to its desired life time. In Tidd APF vessel, 28 filters failed one time, The objectives of this program were to provide an understanding of the factors pertinent to the failures of ceramic filters by characterizing filter properties and the <b>dust</b> cake <b>removal</b> mechanism, Researches were emphasized on understanding of changes of filter properties and back pulse cleaning mechanism to resolve the issues relating to filter permeability variations, ash bridging and micro-thermal cracks induced during cold back pulse cleaning. To perform failure analysis of ceramic filters, thermal numerical simulation, material laboratory analysis on filter materials and dust cake, and measurements on filter properties and back pulse intensity along filter axis within a bench scale filter chamber were conducted...|$|R

40|$|Recycling of dusts {{and other}} wastes of {{steelmaking}} is becoming to a necessity of two reasons: {{due to high}} contents of iron oxides dusts are valuable raw material for steelmaking and tightening environmental legislation makes the landfill disposal of wastes more expensive.
