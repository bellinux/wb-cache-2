40|$|A {{total of}} 492 {{clinical}} isolates {{from the family}} Enterobacteriaceae were tested in the API 20 <b>E,</b> <b>Rapid</b> <b>E,</b> and Quantum II identification systems. Discrepant identifications among these three systems were resolved by repeat testing in the identification systems or use of conventional biochemical tests. Of these isolates, 94. 1 % were correctly identified with the API 20 <b>E</b> and <b>Rapid</b> <b>E</b> systems, and 97. 0 % were correctly identified with the Quantum II system. An additional 48 non-Enterobacteriaceae isolates were tested with the Quantum II system, and 83. 3 % were correctly identified. The majority of incorrect identifications with the <b>Rapid</b> <b>E</b> and Quantum II systems were caused by a single aberrant biochemical reaction. Reproducibility of the biochemical reactions obtained with these two systems was evaluated by testing 40 organisms in triplicate. Identical biocodes for all three tests were obtained for 10 organisms with the Quantum II system and for 19 organisms with the <b>Rapid</b> <b>E</b> system. Reproducibility of the Quantum II test results was improved with a subsequent modification of the photometer of this system.

40|$|We {{explore the}} effect of a system's symmetries on {{fidelity}} decay behavior. Chaos-like exponential fidelity decay behavior occurs in non-chaotic systems when the system possesses symmetries and the applied perturbation is not tied to a classical parameter. Similar systems without symmetries exhibit faster-than-exponential decay under the same type of perturbation. This counter-intuitive result, that extra symmetries cause the system to behave in a chaotic fashion, may have important ramifications for quantum error correction.

Ribotyping, phenotypic (BIOLOG-GN fingerprints and API 20 E profiles), chemotaxonomic (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] and outer membrane proteins [OMP]), serogrouping and plasmid profiling {{data were not}} always congruent. V. anguillarum isolates were recovered in a single ribotype cluster, but many serogroups. There was little variation in OMP profiles, but not so for LPS profiles and plasmid composition.
