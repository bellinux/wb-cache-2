Three typing methods were tested and applied to differentiate strains at intra-species level: panC sequence analysis, REP-PCR and M 13 -PCR. panC gene was highly conserved within the studied strains, suggesting a low intra-specific diversity. This was supported by REP-PCR primary assays and M 13 -PCR results. M 13 -PCR profile analysis succeeded in differentiating six closely related groups (at 79 % threshold similarity) among 127 strains {{from a range of}} spoiled canned food products and from different canneries. Phenotypic traits were investigated among 20 selected strains representing groups and origins. Ranges of growth under different temperatures (from 40 °C to 70 °C), pH (from 5. 0 to 6. 5), NaCl concentrations (from 1 to 5 %) and sporulation conditions poorly differed between strains, but wet heat resistance of spores showed a 20 -fold variation between strains. Furthermore, in this study, strains that belonged to the same M 13 -PCR genetic group did not share phenotypic characteristics or common origin. The work emphasizes a low diversity within the G. stearothermophilus species but data from this study may contribute to a better control of G. stearothermophilus spoilage in canned food...|$|E

Predictive food microbiology reduces the time and expense associated with conventional challenge and shelf life testing. The purpose of this study was to characterize and model germination, outgrowth, and lag (GOL) time and the exponential growth rate (EGR) of Bacillus stearothermophilus in salty carrot medium (SCM) as a function of pH, temperature, and NaCl concentration. B. stearothermophilus is a spore-forming thermophilic organism associated with <b>flat</b> <b>sour</b> spoilage of canned foods. A split-split plot design was used to measure the effects and interactions of pH (5. 5 to 7. 0), temperature (45 to 60 &C), and NaCl (0 to 1 %) on the growth kinetics of B. stearothermophilus in SCM. A total of 96 experiments were analyzed, with individual curve parameters determined by using the Gompertz equation. Quadratic polynomial models for GOL time and EGR of B. stearothermophilus in terms of temperature, pH, and NaCl were generated by response surface analysis. The r 2 values for the GOL time and EGR models were 0. 917 and 0. 916, respectively. These models provide an estimate of bacterial growth in response to combinations of the variables studied within the specified ranges. The models were used to predict GOL times and EGRs for additional experimental conditions. The accuracy of these predictions validated the model’s predictive ability in SCM. Bacillus stearothermophilus is a gram-positive, facultativel...|$|E
