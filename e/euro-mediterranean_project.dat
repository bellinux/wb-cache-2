40|$|The energy {{issue is}} an {{essential}} factor of economic development. Moreover, since the World War II, {{it is one of}} the bases of European Union political genesis. Nowadays, the debate about the cooperation process between European Union and Mediterranean countries is partly focused on the energy issue. On the one hand, European energy dependency is raising, on the other hand, most of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries are economically dependent on their hydrocarbon exports. In this context, a new European energy policy emerged in the 90 's structured by three main principles: - energy dependency requires to diversify the geographic origins of the energy imports; - renewable energies have to be developed due to the environmental issue and to the increasing prices of fossil fuels; - create an European energy market, which could become an Euro-Mediterranean one. These elements lead to the emergence of a new cooperation between Europe and the other Mediterranean countries. The <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> Partnership <b>project</b> launched in 2007 could be a political framework able to facilitate this new form of governance. Energy issue is a pertinent thematic to analyse territorial coherence and stakes of sustainable development in the Euro-Mediterranean region. In the first part, we will demonstrate the historical role of energy issue in European Union emergence. In the second part, we will present European initiatives in energy area which tend to include the other Mediterranean countries.

40|$|Euro-Mediterranean {{ecosystems}} are {{widely recognized as}} a global hotspot of biodiversity, hosting nearly 25, 000 plant species (of which 13, 000 are endemic), and representing {{one of the main}} reservoirs of plant diversity in the world. For these reasons, Euro-Mediterranean {{ecosystems are}} considered a primary target for biodiversity conservation also in light of the services they provide to humans. Nevertheless, anthropogenic climate change is a serious threat for biodiversity conservation in this region. Indeed, the combined effect of the contraction of the Mediterranean climate domain and the expansion of the arid climate domain will lead to substantial habitat loss, which in turn may aggravate the impacts on communities of plant and animal species. In this study we assess Mediterranean habitat loss under scenarios of climate change and propose a series of adaptation options for Natura 2000 protected area sites. We first computed changes in the Mediterranean and arid climate domains (according to the Köppen‐Geiger classification) between the historical reference climate centred on the 1990 s and two future periods centred on the 2030 s and 2080 s, under RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5 scenarios. We used 11 high resolution (0. 11 °) regional climate model (RCM) simulations from the WCRP Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The simulations were previously corrected for bias by Dosio (2016). Results of this study identified Natura 2000 sites that will be affected by Mediterranean habitat loss. Our results indicate {{that by the end of}} the century the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> domain is <b>projected</b> to lose an area equivalent to the size of Greece and Portugal combined. The loss is entirely due to shifts of the arid domain, which is projected to double in size. The shrinking of the current <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> domain is <b>projected</b> to affect an important proportion of the Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites. Options for adaptation are modelled looking at facilitating the mobility of vagile species and reconnecting stable Mediterranean habitats and Natura 2000 sites through maintenance or development of corridors and stepping stones, creation of new protected areas, and actions promoting appropriate management of the wider landscape. The proposed options take into consideration investments in Green Infrastructure and the creation of a denser network of interconnected protected areas in critical zonesJRC. D. 1 -Bio-econom...|$|R

Those ambiences were in fact strongly integrated in what we could call a universal dimension where there was full awareness of the supranational dimension of science, which is able to overcome geographical borders and ideological and religious barriers. These aims can only be achieved by means of modern technology which, similar to one of the objects of its analysis, overcomes borders and is not subject to ideological assessment, fostering the exchange of data among the Centres involved in the project. More specifically, the aims are referred to three large sectors and can be summarized as follows:-to increase the knowledge of the data relative to the subject treated (philological-textual sector);-to increase linguistic knowledge (linguistic-lexicographic sector);-to develop technological tools specific for the study and dissemination of the information produced (sector of technological tools) ...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean basin is {{a global}} hotspot of {{biological}} diversity and the most rich biodiversity region in Europe. Nevertheless, climate-driven habitat loss {{is one of the}} most serious concerns for biodiversity conservation in this region. We assess Mediterranean habitat loss and conversion into arid habitat under scenarios of climate change and evaluate protected areas, including Natura 2000 sites, which will be affected by these changes. We mapped shifts of Mediterranean and arid domains using four bias-corrected simulations from Regional Climate Models for two emission scenarios over this century, disaggregated to a 1 km grid size. Our results indicate that by the end of the century the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> domain is <b>projected</b> to shift into other climatic domains by an area equivalent to 53 - 121 % of its current size. However it is projected to lose 11 - 25 % of its current extent, which represents an area close to the size of Greece and Portugal combined. The loss is entirely due to shifts of the arid domain. Additionally, our results indicate that the extent of the arid domain is projected to increase by 228 - 450 % of its current size in the European region. The shrinking of the current <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> domain is <b>projected</b> to affect 15 - 23 % of the Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites, and the loss in these sites is projected at 13 - 30 % of its current area. Loss is projected to occur in central and southern areas of the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the island of Sicily, south-eastern Greece, Cyprus, Malta and central Turkey. Computed changes in projected climatic parameters indicate that current areas of the Euro-Mediterranean domain will be hotter and drier. Temperature increase and precipitation decrease are projected to be more marked in the summer half of the year. As early as in the 2020 s annual temperature is projected to increase by 0. 9 — 1. 4 °C with respect to the present reference climate, reaching an increase of 2. 2 - 3. 6 °C by the end of the century. By this period, summer precipitation is projected to decrease by 24 - 46 % and annual precipitation by 14 - 23 %. We provide insight into several aspects of adaptation and management of Mediterranean protected areas. A proactive approach taking into consideration landscape connectivity and the concomitant threats triggered by climate change is a priority. Proactive adaptation and management promoting investments in Green Infrastructure and a denser network of interconnected protected areas are necessary instruments for preserving Mediterranean biodiversity from the threats of habitat loss.

40|$|DESERTEC aims {{to secure}} the energy needs of the {{countries}} {{north and south of}} the Mediterranean via the large-scale deployment of solar and wind energy plants in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries and their systematic inter-connection with European energy markets via high-voltage direct-current lines. This will include in particular the systematic recourse to Concentrating Solar Power (CSP). This not only promises participating countries to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels, and improve their compliance with climate policy provisions, but also to create new sources of income and employment, by speeding up know-how transfer and industrial development processes in them. If implemented on a large scale and with sufficient determination, it could allow participating countries to gain a first-mover advantage in an emerging technology that is likely to {{play a key role in}} the 21 st century and that could lay the bases for an energy system essentially based on green power. In principle, this appears to be a rational choice for the involved countries. CSP could provide firm and controllable electricity at potentially affordable and already declining prices. Moreover, CSP and other renewable energy technologies are not yet as competitive as mature technologies, and therefore offer more opportunities for newcomers; due to the excellent natural conditions in the southern Mediterranean, these countries enjoy substantial comparative advantages vis-à-vis other providers. Finally, looking for alternative energy sources is even more urgent for southern partners than for European countries. Their demand for power is growing rapidly and increasingly exceeding their current capacity of supply. They cannot simply divert fossil fuels for domestic use, as they need the revenues generated through their sale. Making stronger use of renewable energies in general, and of CSP in particular, could offer a solution to this dilemma. The sore point, however, is the cost aspect. In contrast to conventional plants, which are relatively cheap to build, but increasingly expensive to maintain, CSP plants are expensive to build, but cheap to maintain. The high start-up costs are thus the main obstacle for the large-scale deployment of this technology. A closer look at the framework conditions on either side of the Mediterranean shows that the successful implementation of this project is not at all a foregone conclusion, and that much remains to be done before the vision can become reality. The international context of DESERTEC is still characterized by an extraordinary degree of insecurity (regarding future policy preferences, energy prices, capital costs, available technologies and worldwide resources, etc.), and the strong vertical fragmentation of the energy systems of participating countries does not help either. The capital intensity and still evolving nature of CSP technology (plus the elevated energy subsidies and limited spending power of most MENA countries) further aggravate the problem of high up-front costs and potentially slow return ratios of CSP plants. Thus, having a very clear idea of the future requirements of one 2 ̆ 7 s energy system (and of the role which renewable energies should perform in this framework) is key for choosing the right technology for production, transmission, and storage. A key requirement for the large-scale introduction of green power technologies will be the creation of viable local markets for environmentally friendly energy products in southern partner countries. This will need to build on an ‘enabling environment’ that sets the right Steffen Erdle German Development In 2 stitute / Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) incentives for producers and consumers, and offers the necessary safeguards for producers and investors. Only in this case will local markets be able to develop the necessary size for attracting private investment in sufficiently large quantities and for developing local value chains on a sufficiently large scale. Otherwise, it might appear more rational to wait until production costs have come down, even if this would mean loosing an opportunity for ‘catching up’. In any case, it would be a grave mistake to only focus on the creation of landmark projects and forget about the creation of the necessary framework conditions. The large-scale provision of foreign soft loans should not slow down the implementation of the necessary institutional reforms and lead to the reproduction of development-adverse rent structures. It will thus be of utmost importance that policy makers and private promoters cooperate very closely from the very beginning. The fact that DESERTEC has been launched as a private initiative and that the related industrial initiative is pooling key business concerns could provide a crucial added value to the otherwise intergovernmental framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and complement policy-driven formats like the Mediterranean Solar Plan (MSP). The MSP itself will offer a policy framework through which DESERTEC could eventually unfold. Its potential contribution is to offer a common ground that allows for a systematic exchange of views between stakeholders from both sides of the Mediterranean about what needs to be done to facilitate the large-scale introduction of environmentally sustainable technologies along the southern rim and to provide for their inter-connection with European markets. This will also need to entail an in-depth revision of the existing legal-institutional frameworks around the Mediterranean. German development organizations could play an important facilitating role in this context. They have accumulated a wealth of experience and expertise in the fields of renewable energies, environmental protection and natural resource management that is both recognized and solicited. In addition, they have also assumed responsibility for the implementation of several large <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>projects</b> specifically in the renewable energies sphere. They appear thus ideally positioned to provide strategic advice and operational support as to how to organize an enabling legal-institutional environment, create the necessary quality infrastructure, implement large-scale projects, and improve partners’ human resources. The inter-related and well-targeted reform of accounting and pricing systems, plus the choice of the right incentive systems and power purchase agreements, will also be key. The very differentiated nature of German development organizations, and their solid working relationships with southern partner countries, will be important assets from this perspective...|$|R
