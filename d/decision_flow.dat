About the origin of flowcharting Schultheiss stipulated:"Flow-charting* is a very broad term used to describe a number of charting and diagramming operations, many of them not peculiar to data processing. <b>Decision</b> <b>flow</b> charting and work flow charting and diagramming have been used in other fields for many years, although the concept seems to be a relatively new one among librarians.About the character of flowcharting he further explained:Flow charts... combine both physical actions and decision making in one logical flow. The type of operation (action, decision requirement, hold, etc.) is indicated by the shape of the box surrounding the written inscription. The choice of box shapes and sizes may become very elaborate and representational, and may be transcribed in a variety of formats; the Head of our Data Processing Department has often jokingly remarked that by using flow charts and magnetic tape reels we have rediscovered the pictogram and the scroll and are calling this progress.|$|E
40|$|In {{the coming}} era of segment-of-one marketing, {{decisions}} about business transactions {{will be quite}} intricate, so that customer treatments can be highly individualized, reflecting customer preferences, targeted business objectives, etc. This paper describes a paradigm called “decision flows ” for specifying a form of incremental decision-making that can combine a myriad of diverse business factors and be executed in near-realtime. Starting with initial input, a <b>decision</b> <b>flow</b> will iteratively gather and derive additional information until a conclusion is reached. Decision flows can be specified in a rules-based manner that generalizes so-called “business rules ” but provides more structure than traditional expert systems. In many cases business managers {{will be able to}} understand and even modify decision flows. We also introduce an execution model that supports eager and parallel execution (a. k. a. speculative execution) of <b>decision</b> <b>flow</b> tasks. This paper develops algorithms that can help minimize response time and/or workload. The algorithms detect at runtime three key properties of tasks: eligible for eager evaluation, even if the output may not be used in the final output; unneeded, i. e., the task is not needed for completing the <b>decision</b> <b>flow</b> instance; and necessary, i. e., the task is definitely needed for completing the <b>decision</b> <b>flow</b> instance...|$|E

Secondly, during the block matching stage, a motion feature based inter mode decision scheme is introduced by analyzing the motion vector predictor’s accuracy, the block overlapping situation and the smoothness of SAD (sum of absolute difference) value.

We {{study the}} {{verification}} problem for e-service (and workflow) speci-fications, aiming at efficient techniques for guiding {{the construction of}} composite e-services to guarantee desired properties (e. g., deadlock avoidance, bounds on resource usage, response times). Based on e-service frameworks such as AZTEC and e-FLow, <b>decision</b> <b>flow</b> language Vortex, we introduce a very simple e-service model for our investigation of verification issues. We first show how three different model checking techniques are applied {{when the number of}} processes is limited to a predetermined number. We then introduce pid quantified constraint, a new sym-bolic representation that can encode infinite many system states, to verify systems with unbounded and dynamic process instantiations. We think that it is a versatile technique and more suitable for verification of e-service specifications. If this is combined with other techniques such as abstraction and widening, it is possible to solve a large category of interesting verification problems for e-services. ...|$|E

By its graphic output, users could have an easy way to interpret the <b>decision</b> <b>flow</b> and the mining outcome. However, decision tree is known to be time consuming.

In these years, we have introduced the query-based learning (QBL) method to different neural networks for providing a more effective way to learn the large dataset. These neural networks have achieved good clustering and classification results. In this paper, a novel mining scheme called QBLDT (query-based learning decision tree) is proposed to apply the QBL concept in decision tree construction. Experimental results show our proposed method is better than the traditional decision tree in different performance metrics. It makes learning quicker and can achieve better prediction results...|$|E

Sub-flow-based traffic classification achieves high accuracy using fast and efficient C 4.5 DT classifier with correlation-based filtering. Similar to payload-based traffic classification, encryption can also complicate flow feature-based traffic classification. However, it is possible to circumvent these challenges. For instance, a hierarchical method that identifies service provider followed by type of service, using statistical features from encrypted payload has been highly accurate and temporally stable [409].|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the clinical features, diagnosis, classification and management of cracked teeth which may be a diagnostic challenge in clinical practice. Results: Cracks may initiate from coronal tooth structure or from within the root and affect healthy or root treated teeth. There are many terminologies and classifications in the literature for cracked teeth that can be as confusing as the array of clinical symptoms which are associated with this condition. The term “cracked tooth syndrome” is misleading as there are a range of symptoms that do not form a distinct and reliable pattern. Symptoms will vary with teeth that have healthy pulps, for teeth with inflamed or necrotic pulps, and for teeth that have been root treated. The American Association of Endodontists have classified five specific variations of cracked teeth; craze line, fractured cusp, cracked tooth, split tooth, and vertical root fracture. The importance of differentiating dentin, pulpal and periodontal pain for diagnosis and treatment for these specific entities will be elaborated.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: When {{contamination}} is present, randomization on {{a patient}} level leads to dilution {{of the treatment}} effect. The usual solution is to randomize on a cluster level, but {{at the cost of}} efficiency and more importantly, this may introduce selection bias. Furthermore, it may slow down recruitment in the clusters that are randomized to the "less interesting" treatment. We discuss an alternative randomization procedure to approach these problems. METHODS: Pseudo cluster randomization is a two-stage randomization procedure that balances between individual randomization and cluster randomization. For common scenarios, the design factors needed to calculate the appropriate sample size are tabulated. RESULTS: A pseudo cluster randomized design can reduce selection bias and contamination, while maintaining good efficiency and possibly improving enrollment. To make a well-informed choice of randomization procedure, we discuss the advantages of each method and provide a <b>decision</b> <b>flow</b> chart. CONCLUSION: When contamination is thought to be substantial in an individually randomized setting and a cluster randomized design would suffer from selection bias and/or slow recruitment, pseudo cluster randomization can be considered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{multiple}} reference frame motion estimation (MRF-ME), an H. 264 /AVC encoder requires ultrahigh memory bandwidth. Conventional multiple reference frames single current macroblock (MRSC) scheme only considers the data reuse within one frame, and requires on-chip memory size and off-chip memory bandwidth in {{proportional to the}} reference frame number. In this paper, a single reference frame multiple current macroblocks (SRMC) scheme is presented to further exploit the data reuse at frame level. With frame-level rescheduling of the motion estimation ME procedures in different reference frames, one loaded search window can be utilized by multiple current MBs in different original frames. The demanded on-chip memory size and off-chip memory bandwidth for MRF-ME can thus be reduced to those supporting only one reference frame. Moreover, based on SRMC scheme, an architecture prototype with two-stage mode <b>decision</b> <b>flow</b> is proposed. For HDTV specifications, 62. 21 KB (74. 8 %) of SRAM and 364. 3 MB/s (62. 6 %) of system bandwidth are saved {{in comparison with the}} MRSC scheme...|$|E

Today, organizations have flatter structures, companies diversify less, and functional departments have started to become less well-defined. The rise of self-directed teams reflects these trends.

Also the directives given to the team tend to become more general and less prescribed.|$|R
