25|$|Assimilation (i.e., marrying Russians {{and having}} {{children}} of such unions counted as Russians) explains {{the decrease in}} numbers of Ukrainians, Belarusians {{and most of the}} Uralic peoples. The assimilation is reflected in the high median age of these peoples (see the table below), as assimilation is stronger among young people than among old people. The process of assimilation of the Uralic peoples of Russia <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> on for centuries and is most prominent among the Mordvins (1.4% of the Russian population in 1926 and 0.5% in 2010), the Karelians, Veps and Izhorians.|$|E
500|$|Dinklage has {{received}} widespread praise for his performance, with Matthew Gilbert from The Boston Globe saying that Dinklage [...] "gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware". Dan Kois of The New York Times noted that Dinklage's performance {{has made the}} character [...] "all the more popular". The Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage". Tyrion {{has been called the}} [...] "most quotable" [...] character and [...] "one of the most beloved characters" [...] of the series. For his performance, he has gone on to win a Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2011 and 2015, as well as the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. As a result of his performance and increased screen time, Dinklage was given top billing starting in the series' second season. In 2014, he said on The Late Show with David Letterman that he had once tried to read the books the show is based upon, but had found them confusing. He joked, [...] "George Martin, our author, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> to kill my character soon because I mentioned that." [...] In 2014, Dinklage and four of his Game of Thrones co-stars became some of the highest paid actors on television, although sources differ on the actors' per-episode salaries as of 2017. In 2015, Dinklage lent his voice for the role of Tyrion in , an episodic graphic adventure video game based on the show.|$|E

And while FiveThirtyEight expressed that [...] "nonetheless, Clinton <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> to win, and she could win by a big margin", the forecaster also made a point about the unreliability of poll trackers in some cases, about a considerable number of undecided voters and about the unpredictable outcome in traditional swing states.|$|E

2500|$|The use {{of amber}} lights to alert drivers that a spotter vehicle is parked is controversial. Light bars and strobe lights have been {{becoming}} increasingly popular with storm spotters and storm chasers since, proponents claim, both groups often travel {{in less than}} ideal weather conditions where visibility may be limited. However, in recent years, some spotters and chasers have been seen using red, blue, white, and/or green lighting devices, apparently imitating emergency vehicles. Such actions are illegal in most areas and are highly condemned by both the spotter and storm chaser communities. Said Chuck Doswell, [...] "flashing light bars added to your chase vehicle (similar to those used by law enforcement) may be illegal in some places and their use to imply some sort of official status to your chasing <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> to get you in trouble". Chris Novy, a trainer of storm spotters throughout the US and a veteran storm chaser, also notes that lights distract and can even unconsciously attract other drivers and that lights may encourage people to drive aggressively or to park in situations they would otherwise avoid and thus increase danger to themselves and to other drivers.|$|E

The general mass of the medical profession, equipped with a little experience and a muddled training, and preposterously impeded by the private adventure conditions under which it lives, goes about pretending to the possession of precise knowledge which simply does not exist in the world. Medical research is under-endowed and stupidly endowed, not for systematic scientific inquiry so much as for the unscientific seeking of remedies for specific evils--for cancer, consumption, and the like. Yet masked, misrepresented limited and hampered, the work of establishing a sound science of vital processes in health and disease <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> on now, similar to the clarification of physics and chemistry that went on in the later part of the eighteenth and {{the early years of the}} nineteenth centuries. It is not unreasonable to suppose that medicine may presently arrive at far-reaching generalised convictions, and proceed to take over this great hinterland of human interests which legitimately belongs to it.|$|E

Dear brother, I hope you are getting along good, and in good spirits; you must not mind the failure of the sewer bills, etc. It don't seem to me it makes so much difference about worldly successes (beyond just enough to eat and drink and shelter, in the moderatest limits) any more, since the last four months of my life especially, and that merely to live, and have one fair meal a day, is enough--but then you have a family, and that makes a difference.|$|E
