50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> (Iberolacerta monticola or Lacerta monticola) is {{a species}} of lizard in the Lacertidae family. It is found in Portugal and Spain. Its natural {{habitats}} are mountain forests, shrubland, rivers and rocky areas. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> {{is listed}} as {{vulnerable}} in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, because of the fragmentation of its range and the threats to its habitat posed by agriculture, forestry activities and tourism. Where the conditions are suitable, it can be quite common, but other populations are declining in size.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual {{conflict}} is exhibited when males target other males through sperm competition. For example, <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta monticola) males create hard mating plugs. These mating plugs are placed within the female cloaca instantly after copulation, which was hypothesized {{to function as}} a [...] "chastity belt." [...] However, the study found no evidence to support the hypothesis, as males were able to displace the mating plugs of other males. There is no direct conflict between males and females, but males may evolve manipulative traits to counter the removal of their mating plugs.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> {{are often}} {{territorial}} in the breeding season. The eggs are laid under stones {{or in other}} concealed locations and are about 10 to 15 mm long. The young hatch out after about {{six to eight weeks}} and mature in about two years. A 2008 field study found females mate with males with more green on their bodies.|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a karyological study of <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> by standard and C-, AgNOR-, DAPI-, and Alu I-banding methods. The {{results showed that}} Lacerta monticola monticola and L. m. cantabrica possess 2 N = 36 uniarmed chromosomes. Lacerta m. cyreni differs from the other two subspecies of L. monticola in the NOR-bearing chromosome pairs and {{in the presence of}} the heteromorphic and heterochromatic W-chromosome. The Pyrenean species L. aurelioi and L. bonnali differ from L. monticola in having a karyotype rich in biarmed elements. In fact, L. aurelioi possesses a 2 N = 26 karyotype with 10 biarmed + 16 uniarmed macrochromosomes. In L. bonnali, an intraspecific variability in diploid number due to Robertsonian translocations was found: the specimens of L. b. aranica have a karyotype similar to that of L. aurelioi while the specimens from nominal subspecies (population of Monte Perdido) possess a 2 N = 24 karyotype with 12 biarmed + 12 uniarmed macrochromosomes. Our results confirm that <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> form a heterogeneous group in which at least five taxa can be distinguished karyologically...|$|R
40|$|Intrasexual {{competition}} favours {{the evolution}} of conspicuous fighting ability badges. However, {{in spite of the}} fact that chemoreception is important in sexual selection of many animals, such as lizards, the role of chemical signals in males' contests is relatively unknown. Here, we show that proportions of cholesterol in femoral gland secretions of male <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> were related to their body size (which confers a competitive advantage in fights). Males discriminated chemically and responded aggressively to cholesterol stimuli presented on swabs. Moreover, we experimentally increased cholesterol in the scent of males, and staged encounters in neutral cages between two unfamiliar and size-matched males. Focal males lost more agonisitic interactions against males manipulated with cholesterol than in control tests. We suggest that differences in scent composition may reliably signal fighting ability in many lizard species, which would help to avoid the costs of fighting...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> {{measures}} about 8 cm from snout to vent with a long, slender tail {{twice as}} long again. It is somewhat flattened with finely boned, short limbs. The colour varies {{in different parts of}} its range. The general colour is light brown variously patterned with longitudinal bands of colour or longitudinal rows of dots and small patches. Unlike some other wall lizards, the stripe along the spine is less dark than other bands. Most, but not all, individuals have a distinctive green belly and the juveniles may have blue tails. A 2008 field study reported the underparts of Iberian rock lizards turn green with maturity, and the upperparts gradually turn green as the lizard ages further.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> {{is found}} in the Cantabrian Mountains and in Galicia in {{northwest}} Spain, and also in the Sierra de Gredos in Central Spain and Serra da Estrela in central Portugal. It occurs at sea level in Galicia, but elsewhere is seldom found below an altitude of 1000 m and up to 2000 m above sea level in the mountains. It favours damp places among boulders in scrubby areas, and in Galicia, it {{is found in}} low-level woodlands. It is a cold-resistant species, often found above the tree line in areas where the winters are long and the summers wet or misty. Where its range overlaps that of the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), it is found at higher altitudes and it climbs higher up cliffs.|$|E
40|$|Many lizards use caudal {{autotomy}} as an antipredatory strategy. We experimentally {{examined the}} effect of tail loss on the time-budgets, movement patterns, and home range size of the <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> Lacerta monticola in the field during the mating season. Our results indicate that tail loss did not alter most variables in male and female time-budgets but did affect the time spent moving and movement patterns of males. Tailless males spent less time moving and, when moving, more time on rocks, with shorter movements, more pauses, and less time on bushes than did tailed ones. Home range size was smaller in tailless males but did not differ between tailed and tailless females. The results suggest that tailless males may compensate the survival cost of autotomy by modifying their use of space and time; as a result, however, they may incur lower access to females.

40|$|Interspecific {{competition}} {{can limit}} {{the distribution of}} species along altitudinal gradients. It {{has been suggested that}} Western European <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> (genus Iberolacerta) are restricted to mountains due to the expansion of wall lizards (Podarcis), but there is no experimental evidence to corroborate this hypothesis. This study examines if interference competition with Podarcis muralis is a plausible explanation for the alpine confinement of <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> Iberolacerta cyreni. In a first experiment, we used an enclosure with four types of microhabitats to investigate whether adult <b>rock</b> and/or wall <b>lizards</b> shifted microhabitat or refuge preferences {{in the presence of the}} other species, and to detect aggressive interactions between them. In a second experiment, we staged heterospecific encounters between naïve, laboratoryborn juveniles to identify behavioural differences and agonistic interactions. In the enclosure, neither <b>rock</b> nor wall <b>lizards</b> changed their microhabitat preferences in the presence of the other species. Nevertheless, <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> increased the diversity of microhabitats and nocturnal refuges used in the single species trials, which had twice the number of conspecifics. Aggressive interactions involved mainly large <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> males. Juveniles did not show any interspecific agonistic behaviour, but <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> spent more time basking and less time moving. Thus, we found no evidence of competition between both species in terms of habitat shifts or agonistic interactions, although intraspecific interactions seemed to explain the behaviour of adult <b>rock</b> <b>lizards.</b> We conclude that other factors are currently determining the alpine confinement of <b>rock</b> <b>lizards.</b> This paper is a contribution to the project CGL 2007 - 02744 /BOS, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN).

40|$|Abstract Faeces {{play a role}} in {{intraspecific}} {{chemical communication}} in many vertebrates, including lizards. Here, we hypothesised that juvenile <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> (Lacerta (=Iberolacerta) monticola) use substrate-borne conspecific faecal chemicals to assess the social environ-ment and base their spatial decisions. To test this hypothesis, we prepared chemical stimuli by dissolving faeces in an organic solvent (dichloromethane, DCM) and conducted chemosensory trials where we quantified latency to the first tongue flick (TF) and TF rates when young captive-borne juveniles were placed in an arena compart-ment whose substrate was labelled by (1) a control (DCM), (2) their own faecal chemicals, (3) faecal chemicals of another juvenile, (4) faecal chemicals of an adult female or (5) faecal chemicals of an adult male. Following TF observations, we removed a partition that separated the labelled compartment from a chemically unlabelled one, and recorded for 5 min when juveniles first crossed to the unlabelled compartment and total time spent in the labelled compartment. Each juvenile was tested with all stimuli in a randomised order. In addition, juveniles belonged to different families and were unrelated to and unfamiliar with faeces donors. Taken together, TF and spatial responses toward stimuli indicate that juveniles discrimi-nated between faecal chemicals of conspecific juveniles, adult females and males, and that they avoided remaining in substrates labelled by adult male faecal chemicals. We suggest that juveniles assess the social environment based on conspecific faecal chemicals thus avoiding aggression and cannibalistic risks undertaken from encounters with adult males...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary theory {{proposes that}} signals used in sexual {{selection}} {{can only be}} stable if they are honest and condition dependent. However, {{despite the fact that}} chemical signals are used by many animals, empirical research has mainly focused on visual and acoustic signals. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for lizards, but in some lizards its precursor (cholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 -ol=provitamin D) is found in femoral gland secretions, which males use for scent marking and intraspecific communication. By allocating provitamin D to secretions, males might need to divert vitamin D from metabolism. This might be costly and condition dependent. We tested whether diet quality affected chemical signals of male <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> (Lacerta monticola) and its consequences for sexual selection. After experimental supplementation of dietary vitamin D, males increased the proportion of provitamin D in femoral secretions. Further experiments showed that females detected these changes in males' signals by chemosensory cues, and discriminated provitamin D, and changes in its concentration, from similar steroids (i. e. cholesterol) found in secretions. Moreover, females preferred areas scent marked by males with more provitamin D in their secretions. This mechanism would confer honesty to chemical signals of male lizards, and, thus, females may rely on it to select high-quality males. We suggest that the allocation of vitamins and other essential nutrients to either visual (e. g. carotenoids) or chemical ornaments might be the common basis of honest sexual displays in many animals...|$|R
40|$|Many reptile species dig {{underground}} nests {{where they}} deposit eggs with flexible and permeable shells that have physical {{contact with the}} soil and are highly permeable to soil water and gases. <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> eggs (Lacerta monticola cyrenni) incubated in acidic substrates suffered significant impairment to their development. Therefore, soil pollution could be affecting embryonic development. Low pH had {{a negative effect on}} egg water exchange, hatchling size and locomotor performance. In all cases, pH had no effect on incubation duration and embryo survival. At substrate pH of 4 and 10, eggs absorbed less water and final egg size and weight was lower than at neutral pH. Hatchlings from eggs incubated in acidic substrates had lower mass (up to 28 % of weight), SVL, and tail length than controls. Running speed - a good indicator of lizard fitness - was also affected by substrate pH. Embryos incubated at pH 4 ran slower than controls. The alteration of the water absorption process that low substrate pH had on eggs during incubation partially explained the observed effects on hatchling characteristics. These sublethal effects may influence the survival or success of juveniles during or after their first wintering. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Giardia duodenalis is a {{zoonotic}} parasite that infects the gut of a {{wide range}} of vertebrates, including numerous wildlife species. However, little is known about this protozoan parasite in reptiles. Fecal samples from 31 wild lizards were collected in Galicia (northwest Spain) and screened for the presence of Giardia by PCR amplification and sequencing of the ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 region in the ribosomal unit. This allowed detection of the parasite in 5 samples (16. 1 %), and enabled identification of G. duodenalis assemblage A 2 in two samples of <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> (Iberolacerta monticola), G. duodenalis assemblage B in other two samples of I. monticola, and G. duodenalis assemblage E in one sample of Bocage’s wall lizard (Podarcis bocagei). The results obtained after PCR amplification and sequencing of the SSU-rDNA gene confirmed the presence of G. duodenalis assemblage A in two samples of I. monticola. This is the first report of G. duodenalis in free-living lizards, although further studies are needed to distinguish between actual infection and mechanical dissemination of cysts. The detection of zoonotic and livestock-specific assemblages of G. duodenalis demonstrates the wide environmental contamination by this parasite, possibly due to human activities...|$|E
40|$|Infertile and {{non-viable}} fertile eggs {{within a}} reptile clutch may decrease the incubation {{success of the}} remaining eggs, as (1) opportunistic pathogens may use the nutrient resources provided by dead eggs to colonize the clutch and spread to and kill viable eggs; and (2) odours released by spoilt eggs may attract predators to the clutch. These hypotheses were tested on the <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta monticola) by comparing the incubation success of fertile eggs between clutches composed solely of fertile eggs and clutches containing {{a small number of}} dead eggs. In a laboratory experiment, fungi (Fusarium sp. and Gliocladium sp.) colonized both infertile eggs and fertile eggs that died during incubation and thereafter spread to and killed adjacent eggs. In addition, offspring hatched earlier from fungal infected eggs than from non-infected eggs. The former were smaller and lighter than the latter, as they hatched before using the full egg yolk content. Results from a field experiment did not corroborate the fungal pathogenic effects observed in the laboratory nor did they confirm that clutches containing dead eggs suffer higher predation. Despite the inconclusive results regarding the role of fungal pathogens in nature, the present study indicates that this subject deserves further investigation in reptiles...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{selection}} favors more conspicuous male displays, whereas {{natural selection}} (via predator pressure) favors less conspicuous displays. However, this trade-off might be altered if males with more conspicuous displays could compensate behaviorally for their increased conspicuousness by acting more cautiously toward predators. The {{aim of this}} study was to explore in 2 species of <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> whether or not conspicuous coloration was associated with antipredatory behavior and whether conspicuousness-dependent regulation of antipredatory behavior existed. Our results suggested that male lizards may compensate for the negative effects of conspicuous sexual coloration on predation risk by modulating their antipredatory behavior (time inside refuges, false alarms, etc). We found that male Iberolacerta monticola, but not male Iberolacerta cyreni, compensated for the negative effects of blue lateral ocelli, which increased visual conspicuousness. However, male lizards did not compensate for relatively unexposed ventral spots. We also found that male I. monticola in better condition and with more blue lateral ocelli were shier, whereas male I. cyreni in better condition and with more ventral spots were bolder. These 2 lizard species live in habitats that differ in refuge availability and in the number of potential predators, which may promote differences in the trade-off between predation risk and social behavior and may explain the observed interspecific differences in antipredatory behavior. This suggests that regulation of antipredatory behavior may also function as a condition-dependent cost promoting costly (honest) sexual signaling in some species.

40|$|Resources {{invested}} by prey {{to acquire}} information on predator behavior {{from inside the}} refuge are crucial {{to minimize the risk}} of suffering a future fatal attack. However, most studies have only analyzed situations where information on the predator behavior is unavailable for hiding preys. Also, temporal patterns of risk may affect antipredatory behavior allocation. We simulated in outdoor terraria series of 2 types of predatory attacks (low vs. high risks) with different sequences of risks (predictable series vs. attacks where risk level changed randomly) to <b>Iberian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizards.</b> We measured time spent entirely hidden in refuges until appearing near the exit of the refuge (appearance time) and time spent leaning out of the refuge while monitoring the predator (monitoring time) after each predatory interaction. Monitoring time, irrespectively of the temporal pattern of risk, was higher after a single low-risk approach of the predator than after a direct unsuccessful attack. In addition, after multiple repeated interactions with the predator, there was a significant decrease in monitoring time with the sequence order of interactions but only when lizards fled to the refuge after low-risk approaches. Lizards spent more time monitoring the predator from inside the refuge after a low-risk approach, which may be explained because, if {{there has not been a}} clear attack, uncertainty on immediate future risk would be greater, and prey may need more time before leaving the refuge to ensure that a predator has not detected the lizard and that it is not ambushing near the refuge. Our study suggests that acquisition of information during and after an attack is important in determining refuge use as an antipredation response. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
