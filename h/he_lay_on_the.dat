Ballard suffered a concussion and multiple facial fractures as a result. He was taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation and observation and released the next day.

25|$|Blackford's son {{became ill}} {{probably}} with malaria, {{the date and}} details of the sickness are unknown. Blackford took him to Lexington, Kentucky for medical treatment, but he died {{only a short time}} later. The death was an emotional blow to Blackford. He returned to Vincennes where he arrived in the night and entered the home of his friend John Coburn. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor and wept till morning. He then locked himself away for two weeks in a room in Coburn's home, never speaking and only coming out to receive a meal. As he recovered, he sold his Vincennes estate and invested the money in land.|$|E
500|$|In the 1996–97 season, Wetherall played less {{regularly}} as {{new manager}} George Graham experimented with defensive combinations, though {{by the following}} season he had re-established himself in the starting eleven, sometimes acting as captain, and signed a new five-year contract. On 27 September 1997, he scored in the 1–0 victory over arch-rivals Manchester United when Roy Keane's knee was badly injured {{in the act of}} fouling Alf-Inge Håland, who then accused Keane of feigning injury. Keane later took revenge on Håland during a Manchester derby and said to Håland as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground: [...] "And don't ever stand over me again sneering about fake injuries, and tell your pal Wetherall there's some for him as well." [...] Later that season Wetherall was among the Leeds travelling party who escaped unhurt as their aircraft crash-landed after an engine caught fire on takeoff.|$|E

500|$|Fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal {{had seen}} a number of {{controversial}} incidents in the previous seasons. The rivalry between the two clubs had grown more intense since {{the formation of the}} Premier League in 1992, since when all but one Premier League title had been won by Manchester United or Arsenal (Blackburn Rovers won the title in 1994–95). However, the rivalry could be traced back to Alex Ferguson's first fixture against Arsenal as United manager in 1987, when David Rocastle was sent off and a row erupted. The following season, Brian McClair missed a penalty for United in an FA Cup tie and Nigel Winterburn made a point of aggravating him. McClair got his revenge in 1990: after a lunging tackle from Winterburn on Denis Irwin, McClair and Irwin both kicked Winterburn while <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, sparking a 21-man brawl. Both teams were fined and deducted points and it has often been suggested that this was a turning point in relations. The rivalry continued to intensify as [...] "hard men" [...] such as Patrick Vieira, Roy Keane and Martin Keown joined the sides.|$|E

2500|$|Hanna {{was shot}} dead after driving home to Lurgan from a {{function}} at the British Legion Club in Lurgan {{in the early hours}} of 27 July 1975. According to Martin Dillon, two men approached him as he got out of his car. Hanna reportedly asked them, [...] "What are you playing at?", and one of the men produced a pistol, placed it to his temple and shot him. The gunman then fired a second shot into the back of Hanna's head as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. A neighbour who was also in the car was shot in the head and seriously injured. His wife, Ann witnessed the killing; however she was too distressed at the time to identify the killer. Dillon claims that prior to his death Hanna had been under surveillance by the RUC Special Branch.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the labor}} {{workforce}} of PDM Contractors consisted {{of high school students}} and young men. One of these youths was a 15-year-old named Anthony Antonucci, whom Gacy had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at the youth's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied the youth with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed Antonucci's hands behind his back. The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the handcuff after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci—a member of his high school wrestling team—pounced upon him. The youth wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house. Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor: [...] "Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Art {{historian}} Uwe Schneede {{considers this}} performance pivotal for {{the reception of}} German avant garde art in the United States, as it {{paved the way for}} the recognition of Beuys' own work, but also that of contemporaries such as Lüpertz, Baselitz, Kiefer and many others in the 1980s. In May 1974 Beuys flew to New York and was taken by ambulance to the site of the performance, a room in the René Block Gallery at 409 West Broadway. Beuys lay on the ambulance stretcher swathed in felt. He shared this room with a coyote, for eight hours over three days. At times he stood, wrapped in a thick, grey blanket of felt, leaning on a large shepherd's staff. At times <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> straw, at times he watched the coyote as the coyote watched him and cautiously circled the man, or shredded the blanket to pieces, and at times he engaged in symbolic gestures, such as striking a large triangle or tossing his leather gloves to the animal; the performance continuously shifted between elements that were required by the realities of the situation, and elements that had a purely symbolic character. At the end of the three days, Beuys hugged the coyote that had grown quite tolerant of him, and was taken to the airport. Again he rode in a veiled ambulance, leaving America without having set foot on its ground. As Beuys later explained: ‘I wanted to isolate myself, insulate myself, see nothing of America other than the coyote.’ ...|$|E
