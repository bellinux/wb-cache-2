25|$|On 13 June, the {{motorcade}} of King Abdullah II was attacked with stones and bottles by protesters {{in the city}} of Tafileh, although this was later denied, a royal official stating that they were enthusiastically greeted. Some indication <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> actually an outbreak of violence between the Darak (Jordanian Gendarmerie) and local unemployed protesters. It is alleged that the local mayor caused the Darak to force back the protesters not wanting his city to look bad, the protesters replied with stones and empty bottles. The King is alleged to have been 12km away.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{submarine}} K-141 Kursk {{sailed to}} perform an exercise of firing dummy torpedoes at the Pyotr Velikiy, a Kirov-class battlecruiser. On 12 August 2000, at 11:28 local time (07:28 UTC), {{there was an explosion}} while preparing to fire the torpedoes. The only credible report to date <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to the failure and explosion of one of the Kursk's hydrogen peroxide-fueled torpedoes. It is believed that HTP, a form of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide used as propellant for the torpedo, seeped through its container, damaged either by rust or in the loading procedure back on land where an incident involving one of the torpedoes accidentally touching ground went unreported. The vessel was lost with all hands. A similar incident was responsible for the loss of HMS Sidon in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Byrne later {{discusses}} how {{the rise}} of the Dál gCais sept of Déisi Tuisceart in North Munster {{at the expense of the}} Eóganachta was not unlike {{the rise of}} that dynasty at the expense of the Dáirine several centuries before, and this may in fact have been the inspiration for Dál gCais claims. An earlier and frequently cited argument by John V. Kelleher <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a political scheme of the Uí Néill, Ireland's most dominant dynasty, whom he argues created the Kingdom of Thomond in the 10th century to further weaken the position of the already divided Eóganachta. If true, the Uí Néill were creating who would soon become their greatest military rivals in nearly the last four centuries, threatening Tara as much as Cashel. The Déisi Muman, on the other hand, remained prominent supporters of the Eóganachta throughout their career.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the lead}} {{programmer}} Katsuya Yamano, Nintendo R did not consult previous Metroid games for programming techniques, and instead used their previous game Wario Land 4 as a reference. The system director, Takehiko Hosokawa, states that while parts of old Metroid gameplay remain in Fusion, the developers decided to introduce new elements to the game. Samus's suit design revamped for Fusion; the canonical explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> because an X Parasite had attacked Samus {{and made her}} lose all her abilities. Missiles were further expanded with two [...] "upgrades", much like the various beam upgrades: the Ice Missile which has a similar effect to the Ice Beam, and the Diffusion Missile which greatly increases the blast radius. Other minor abilities were added to Fusion, such as climbing walls and ceilings. The health and missile drops are replaced by X Parasites that are similarly released after defeating enemies.|$|E

2500|$|The {{events leading}} to this {{massacre}} are unknown, {{but there are}} many hypotheses. The most plausible <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> internecine warfare, and that [...] "overpopulation, land-use patterns, and an unstable climate caused the people to compete for available farmland" [...] and other resources. The malnutrition suffered by the Crow Creek villagers was most likely common for people in that region during this time period. Because of this, there is a strong chance that another Initial Coalescent group or several groups in the region attacked the Crow Creek village for its arable land and resources.|$|E

30|$|Why do the {{textbook}} introduce near synonyms without differentiating them?

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{interpretations of the}} word Sittanvasal. In Tamil language, Sit-tan-na-va-yil means [...] "the abode of great saints". Another {{explanation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a suburb of Annalvayil, called chiru-annal-vaayil, meaning [...] "smaller Annalvayil". It is {{also said that the}} word Sittanavasal is a derivative from two Sanskrit words, ‘'Siddhanam’' and ‘'vasah'’ meaning [...] "abode of siddhas". Alternative suggestions are that Sittanavasal is a Tamil name that was used in the Sangam period, or that is a derivative from Siddhaanaam-vaasah, of north Indian origin which was corrupted first to [...] "iddhannavaasah" [...] and finally as [...] "Sittannavasal". In the Brahmi script, the name mentioned in the inscriptions is [...] "ChiRu-posil".|$|E
2500|$|The 2001, {{election}} {{met with}} instability for the Labour Party. The Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet stated: [...] "We are {{heading for a}} political earthquake when the votes are counted tonight, if we believe the opinion polls." [...] In an interview with The Associated Press Jagland stated [...] "It is unstable and unpredictable." [...] After the election in 2001, Stoltenberg and his cabinet were forced to resign, with the Labour Party suffering from its worst election campaign results since 1924. With the 98% votes taken, the Labour Party only garnered 24%, falling from 35%. Jagland, the Labor Party leader, commented on the results saying, [...] "We {{will have to make}} a decision about whether to continue in government after we know the full results". After the election Stoltenberg said, [...] "What is clear <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a very bad election." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hamilton's abrupt test {{career is}} {{particularly}} significant on two counts. Firstly <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the first series under new coach Duncan Fletcher's control. Whether or not one agreed with Fletcher's selections, {{one thing he}} can be commended on is always giving players a chance in a few games – not just one. For Hamilton to have only one game is very unusual. Secondly, and possibly related to the first, is the manner of Hamilton's dismissals. On each occasion, he was [...] "tucked up" [...] by a fast short pitched ball into his ribs, only managing to glove {{the ball to the}} waiting slip cordon. Even if this was perceived as a technical flaw, it is unusual that Hamilton was not tried in {{at least some of the}} ODIs that followed that test series. His rise to prominence and immediate removal from the side remains a mystery. Few players (if any) during Fletcher's tenure as England coach were treated quite so ruthlessly.|$|E

2500|$|Pinzón {{returned}} home to Palos, arriving on 15 March 1493, precisely {{the same day the}} Niña reached the voyage's starting point. [...] Exhausted and suffering from a recurrent fever, he was taken from his ship in a stretcher. As Columbus arrived, his friends took him to a farm on the boundary between Palos and Moguer. It is possible that Martín's son, Arias Pérez Pinzón, did not bring him directly to his house in Palos in order to protect him, given that Columbus had threatened him earlier. Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> because Martín did not get along well with Catalina Alonso, the woman who had been living with his father since he became a widower, and with whom the father would have two illegitimate children: Francisco and Inés Pinzón. According to the testimony of Francisco Medel and Hernán Pérez Mateos, he was brought to the La Rábida Monastery, where he died; he was entombed there, as was his wish.|$|E
2500|$|The lack of {{transport}} aircraft was another constraint. On 5 August, {{the only two}} aircraft available for supply work returned to Australia. On 17 August, a Japanese air raid on Port Moresby destroyed five aircraft and severely damaged eleven others when the aircraft had been parked close together. Of these, seven transports (later dubbed [...] "biscuit bombers") were destroyed or put out of commission, leaving only one in service. This report by Gillison is indicative since there is considerable variation in the sources as to the number and type of planes damaged and destroyed. What is clear <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a disastrous event that significantly curtailed the Allied capacity to resupply the troops fighting along the track. Moremon says that no aircraft were available for dropping until 23 August while McCathy states this as 22 August. Given the tenuous supply situation, this was a significant break. Civilian aircraft and pilots were pressed into service {{in an effort to}} meet demand. They were mainly used in flights between Australia and New Guinea or in rear areas in order to release military planes and personnel for service in forward areas but this did not solve the immediate problem.|$|E
2500|$|Amenhotep's first {{campaign}} {{took place}} in his third regnal year. It is known that the pharaoh was attacked by the host of Qatna while crossing the Orontes river, but he emerged victorious and acquired rich booty, among which even the equipment of a Mitanni charioteer is mentioned. The king was well known for his physical prowess and {{is said to have}} singlehandedly killed 7 rebel Princes at Kadesh, which successfully terminated his first Syrian campaign on a victorious note. [...] After the campaign, the king ordered the bodies of the seven princes to be hung upside down on the prow of his ship. Upon reaching Thebes {{all but one of the}} princes were mounted on the city walls. The other was taken to the often rebellious territory of Nubia and hung on the city wall of Napata, as an example of the consequence of rising against Pharaoh and to demoralise any Nubian opponents of Egyptian authority there. Amenhotep called this campaign his first in a Stele from Amada, however he also called his second campaign his first, causing some confusion. The most common solution for this, although not universally accepted, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the first campaign he fought alone before the death of his father and thus before he was the sole king of Egypt, and he counted his second campaign as his first because it was the first that was his and his alone.|$|E

My private opinion <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> entirely a gratuitous assumption, and that Pidger was altogether innocent of any such sentiments--to which he had never given any sort of expression that I could ever hear of. Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa had a superstition, however, that he would have declared his passion, if he had not been cut short in his youth (at about sixty) by over-drinking his constitution, and over-doing an attempt to set it right again by swilling Bath water. They had a lurking suspicion even, that he died of secret love; though I must say there was a picture of him in the house with a damask nose, which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed upon.|$|E
