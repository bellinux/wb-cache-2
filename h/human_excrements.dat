60|$|But, {{to proceed}} to other enormities: Every person who walks the streets, must needs observe the immense number of <b>human</b> <b>excrements</b> at the doors and steps of waste houses, and {{at the sides of}} every dead wall; for which the disaffected party have {{assigned}} a very false and malicious cause. They would have it, that these heaps were laid there privately by British fundaments, to make the world believe, that our Irish vulgar do daily eat and drink; and, consequently, that the clamour of poverty among us, must be false, proceeding only from Jacobites and Papists. They would confirm this, by pretending to observe, that a British anus being more narrowly perforated than one of our own country; and many of these excrements upon a strict view appearing copple crowned, with a point like a cone or pyramid, are easily distinguished from the Hibernian, which lie much flatter, and with lest continuity. I communicated this conjecture to an eminent physician, who is well versed in such profound speculations; and at my request was pleased to make trial with each of his fingers, by thrusting them into the anus of several persons of both nations, and professed he could find no such difference between them as those ill-disposed people allege. On the contrary, he assured me, that much the greater number of narrow cavities were of Hibernian origin. This I only mention to shew how ready the Jacobites are to lay hold of any handle to express their malice against the government. I had almost forgot to add, that my friend the physician could, by smelling each finger, distinguish the Hibernian excrement from the British, and was not above twice mistaken in an hundred experiments; upon which he intends very soon to publish a learned dissertation.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: By {{studying}} the etiology and the causalities of the cholera breaking {{out in the}} German cities since the 1830 s the young scientific discipline "Hygiene" tried to influence urban administrations to prevent the contamination of the soil with <b>human</b> <b>excrements.</b> Most of the Hygienists followed the theory developed by Max von Pettenkofer, the first German professor of Hygiene, that the soiling was the causing factor {{of most of the}} intestinal diseases. This theory based on the hypothesis of a prerequisite fermentation of a germ in the soil before being capable to produce disease in a susceptible individual. According to this - never irrefutably proved - theory the cities {{should be aware of the}} condition of soil (Bodenbeschaffenheit), whereas the pollution of the running water was not considered to be dangerous by reason of the supposed self-purification of running streams...|$|E
40|$|Recent studies {{confirm the}} {{increase}} of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. One of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate laundering procedures. Most Slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. In addition to this fact, there is {{an increasing number of}} hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. On the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. In our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium terrae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. Candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. Swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating <b>human</b> <b>excrements</b> and were inoculated together with the chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions. It was found that E. faecium, S. aureus, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa survivedat 60 °C, but no microorganisms were found at 75 °C...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo objetivou levantar preliminarmente os escarabeíneos copro-necrófagos da região de Brejo Novo, Caruaru, Pernambuco, e verificar aspectos da estrutura da comunidade como sazonalidade, diversidade, equitabilidade, riqueza e abundância das espécies. Foram {{realizadas}} 10 coletas, com intervalos de 30 dias e duração de 48 horas, de setembro de 2003 a julho de 2004. Utilizaramse 24 armadilhas de queda, com dois tipos de isca, fezes humanas e carne bovina em estado de putrefação. Foram coletados 1. 540 indivíduos pertencentes a seis tribos, 12 gêneros e 28 espécies. As espécies Canthon af. carbonarius, Canthon chalybaeus, Dichotomius nisus, D. semisquamosus, Digitonthophagus gazella e Eurysternus hirtellus aparentemente são as mais adaptadas ao ambiente estudado. Foram coletados 826 indivíduos em armadilhas iscadas com fezes humanas e 714 em carne bovina apodrecida. Ocorreu um número maior de espécies consideradas "raras" (15), sendo três destas "singletons", duas "doubletons" e 10 com abundância entre três e 10 indivíduos, 13 espécies foram consideradas "comuns". Das espécies analisadas, sete apresentaram hábitos alimentares generalistas, quatro são estritamente coprófagas e uma estritamente necrófaga. Foram verificadas correlações positivas entre a precipitação mensal e a abundância e a riqueza de espécies. O levantamento preliminar das espécies de Scarabaeinae da região de Brejo Novo contribuiu para aumentar o número de espécies registradas para o estado de Pernambuco e região Nordeste do Brasil. This paper {{reports the}} results of the preliminary survey of copro-necrophagous dung beetles of Brejo Novo region, Caruaru, Pernambuco, as well as some aspects of the community structure such as seasonality, diversity, equitability, richness and abundance of species. Ten samplings with intervals of 30 days and duration of 48 hours, fortnightly were done between September 2003 to July 2004. Scarab beetles were collected with 24 pitfall traps baited with two types of baits, <b>human</b> <b>excrements</b> and rotting bovine meat. A total of 1, 540 individuals belonging to six tribes, 12 genera and 28 species were collected. The species Canthon af. carbonarius, Canthon chalybaeus, Dichotomius nisus, D. semisquamosus, Digitonthophagus gazella and Eurysternus hirtellus are, apparently, adapted to the studied environment. Traps baited with <b>human</b> <b>excrements</b> attracted 826 individuals and those with rotting bovine meat attracted 714 specimens. Large number of species (15) considered "rare" occurred, being three of them "singletons", two "doubletons" and 10 with abundance between three and 10 individuals; 13 species were considered "common". Of the analyzed species, seven present generalist alimentary habits, four are strictly coprophagous and one is strictly necrophagous. Positive correlations were verified between the precipitation and the abundance of the individuals and the species richness. This preliminary survey of the dung beetles of the Brejo Novo region contributed {{to increase the number of}} species registered for Pernambuco and northeast region of Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Remote {{communities}} in the Nepalese mountains above 2500 [*]m a. s. l. belong to the most precarious in the world. Inhabitants struggle for the minimum in terms of safe drinking water, food and sanitation. Reliable, affordable and clean energy for cooking, room heating and warm water for personal hygiene is often lacking and dependency on firewood very high. The remoteness and unlikeliness of electric grid connection {{in the coming decades}} make a diversified energy supply from renewable local resources crucial. Small-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic substrates has been used for long in rural areas of developing countries to produce biogas as energy source and recover residue as organic fertilizer. AD is challenging at high elevations due to year around lower ambient temperatures and lower annual biomass production per area compared to lowlands. Nevertheless, examples of operational household AD exist even above 3000 [*]m a. s. l. in the Andes. Here we compare firewood consumption with biogas potential from organic substrates in a community with 39 households at 3150 [*]m a. s. l. in Jumla District, Nepal. In five households with varying numbers of members and animals kept, mean firewood use and its energy content per capita (cap) and day (d) were 2. 1 [*]kg or ca. 25 [*]MJ in spring and 2. 3 [*]kg or ca. 28 [*]MJ in winter. Easily available substrates include cow, sheep and horse dung from overnight shelters and <b>human</b> <b>excrements</b> from pit latrines, amounting on average to 1. 7 [*]kg wet weight (kgww) cap− 1 [*]d− 1 in spring and 2. 2 [*]kgww[*]cap− 1 [*]d− 1 in winter. Adjusted to normal conditions (Nm 3 at 0 [*]°C, 1013. 15 [*]hPa), these substrates yielded on average 0. 08 [*]Nm 3 [*]cap− 1 [*]d− 1 biogas in spring and 0. 12 [*]Nm 3 [*]cap− 1 [*]d− 1 in winter (35 – 60 % methane content) in biochemical methane potential (BMPs) tests at 36 [*]°C. This could provide up to 60 % of basic cooking needs on average and up to 75 % in a “typical” household in terms of members and animals kept. Of the overall thermal energy needs including also room heating ca. 10 – 20 % could be covered, substituting 0. 1 – 0. 4 (mean: 0. 2) [*]kg firewood cap− 1 [*]d− 1. If only animal dung and <b>human</b> <b>excrements</b> are considered, no competition for resources arises as residues can still be used as organic fertilizer. This study supports the design and introduction of planned pilot digesters integrated into on-going community development including pit latrines for substrate availability, greenhouses as possible way of thermal insulation, and planned pico-hydropower plants to use excess electricity during the night for digester heating...|$|E
40|$|Banda Aceh, Indonesia, {{populated}} with 250. 000 inhabitants, produces 180 tons of waste daily. But only 165 tons are delivered to its 21 ha area of municipal landfill facility, the Gampong Jawa Landfill (GJL). Since 2009, GJL stopped the open dumping practice and switched to sanitary landfill system. However, landfill gas (LFG) generated is still naturally venting {{out into the}} atmosphere. For leachate treatment, GJL has an anaerobic, an aerobic, and a maturation pool. There is also an advanced biogas reactor, namely the Intermediate Treatment Facility (ITF), which has 40 kW electricity generating capacity. Two Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) systems also available, functioned to process <b>human</b> <b>excrements</b> with total capacity of 130 cubic meter. This research is conducted to study the potential electricity generation from all-combined available resources in GJL. It includes potentials from landfills, ITF, and WWTPs. Literature review, in-depth interviews, field survey, and spread-sheet simulation are methods that have been conducted to achieve the objectives. The result shows that GJL could benefit more than sufficient electricity for its own operations, and transmit the rest to the National Power Grid.

Preventive archaeological excavations were carried out between 1996 / 1997 and seven historical strata were observed, from Gallo-Roman period up to Modern Times. Soil samples from cesspools, latrines, and structures-like were studied and revealed intestinal parasite eggs in the different archaeological contexts. Ascaris lumbricoides, A. suum, Trichuris trichiura, T. suis. Taenia sp., Fasciola hepatica, Diphyllobothrium sp., Capillaria sp. and Oxyuris equi eggs were found. Paleoparasitology confirmed the use of structures as latrines or cesspit as firstly supposed by the archaeologists. Medieval latrines were not only used for rejection of <b>human</b> <b>excrements.</b> The finding of Ascaris sp. and Trichuris sp. eggs may point to human's or wild swine's feces. Gallo-Roman people used to eat wild boar. Therefore, both A. suum and T. suis, or A. lumbricoides and T. trichuris, may be present, considering a swine carcass recovered into a cesspit. Careful sediment analysis may reveal its origin, although parasites of domestic animals can be found together with those of human's. Taenia sp. eggs identified in latrine samples indicate ingestion of uncooked beef with cysticercoid larvae. F. hepatica eggs suggest the ingestion of raw contaminated vegetables and Diphyllobothrium sp. eggs indicate contaminated fresh-water fish consumption.

Disposal of human feaces is one of the pressing public health problems in most of the urban areas. A critical look at the existing toilet systems of the slums was observed and analyzed. Considerations were made with respect to the slums, environmental factors, provision of sanitation system, physical, social and cultural factors. Four different locations were sampled this include Elabuchi, Marine Base, Abonnema Wharf and Nember Waterside. At Elabuchi 165 households disposes faeces directly into the River while 25 house holds have bucket latrine. At Marine base, 65 households disposes faces directly into the river, while 25 households have bucket latrine.

40|$|There are 2. 6 {{billion people}} who have no access to "improved sanitation" all over the world, of which 814 million people live in India. As a result of this, people resort to open {{defecation}} and this causes serious damage to the people‟s health and also pollutes the surrounding environment. This thesis explores the sanitation situation in a village called Mohaddipur in the Bind Block of Nalanda district in the state of Bihar, India. This SIDA financed project will provide this village with a public toilet complex which will be constructed {{with the help of the}} community members and strive towards putting an end to open defecation which is practised by these community members of the study area. Through the sanitation facilities being provided it was also important to close the nutrient cycle loop between agriculture and sanitation and make this toilet complex sustainable in all aspects of sustainability: social, economic, environmental and cultural. The provision of Ecological Sanitation (ecosan) facilities through the implementation of CompostEra toilet units and technology, in the toilet complex, in both the „hardware‟ and the „software‟ aspects is studied in this thesis. Women and adolescent girls were sensitised through education on Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) to empower these women in this village of Mohaddipur to not only improve their health but to also get an opportunity to get an education and gain a livelihood. Participatory Action Research (PAR) method has been used in this study to empower the community of this village in order to increase the social, educational, gender and economic strength of the individuals. The results and subsequent discussion show the need to include communities in designing a sanitation facility and how capacity building is a very important step in this process.

End-of-pipe, large scale sewerage solutions for densely populated areas and cities are analysed for their historical origins and contemporary ramifications, and contrasted with examples of classical, mediaeval, early modern and contemporary times in different regions of Europe and India. The cases were presented in a non-chronological order to avoid simple narratives of progress. The focus is on questions of agricultural recycling of excrement and the relevance of human waste for public health issues. Analytical tools during the cross-temporal and cross-cultural case comparison are the categorisations of <b>human</b> <b>excrement</b> as e. g. waste, threat or resource, the technique of dualism-deterritorialisation and occasionally the Entanglement approach. Main results are that the large-scale introduction of sewerage systems in European cities around the world coincides with urbanisation and industrialisation, that pre-industrial dense settlement faced essentially the same excrement management challenges as modern cities do and that the stability of certain management systems has been severely influenced by factors such as power structures, paradigms of purity and piety as well as economic developments.
