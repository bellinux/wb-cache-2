During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as [...] "violently anti-communist, and much more militaristic than the norm". He was quoted in 1950 remarking, [...] "If you say why not bomb [...] tomorrow, I say, why not today? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> today at five o'clock, I say why not one o'clock?" ...|$|E

They accept Muslims if you declare that you are loyal to this society, to democracy. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that {{you are one of}} them, they will accept you. If you have reservations, they will worry." [...] His concern has centred on the power of [...] "Islamism" [...] or fundamentalist political Islam in Denmark's Muslim community which he has tried to fight, especially {{in the wake of the}} controversy by forming an association of democratic, moderate Muslims.|$|E
500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> you are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing {{down a couple of}} hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E

Holloway, who happened to be serving on a Selection Board in Washington at the time, promptly met with Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh A. Burke, who warned that a deployment order was imminent but that commitments in East Asia precluded any reinforcements from the Seventh Fleet. Retorted Holloway, [...] "I don't need any help.

After Hussein ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and killed by the army of Yazid I, the Umayyad ruler, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr confronted Yazid and {{expelled}} him from Iraq, southern Arabia and the greater part of Syria, and parts of Egypt. Following a lengthy campaign, on his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother Asma' bint Abu Bakr, the daughter of the first caliph, for advice. Asma' bint Abu Bakr replied to her son: [...] "You know better in your own self, that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free".

2500|$|Liston {{failed to}} answer the bell for the seventh round, and Ali was {{declared}} the winner by technical knockout. At that point the fight was level on the official scorecards. It {{was the first time}} since 1919—when Jack Dempsey defeated Jess Willard—that a world heavyweight champion had quit on his stool. Liston said he quit because of a shoulder injury. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder. However, David Remnick, for his book, King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero, spoke with one of Liston's cornermen, who told him that Liston could have continued: [...] " [...] was all BS. We had a return bout clause with Clay, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> your guy just quit, who is gonna get a return bout. We cooked up that shoulder thing on the spot." [...] Hall of Fame matchmaker Teddy Brenner also disputed the shoulder injury, claiming he saw Liston use the same arm to throw a chair in his dressing room after the match. However there is ample evidence that Liston carried an injury to his left shoulder into the fight.|$|E

[...] This would be said in a moment of truth but the next day had changed his mind and he'd be up and off.... He was married to his music and I didn't mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn't make me happy was {{when he was in the}} home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people in there with him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship. Before the home studio was built Beehive Cottage was our sanctuary, afterwards it just became his workplace." [...] – Jenny Rylance ...|$|E
2500|$|When CNN {{presenter}} Jeff Greenfield {{was asked}} why Chomsky was never on his show, {{he claimed that}} Chomsky might [...] "be {{one of the leading}} intellectuals who can't talk on television. [...] If you got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, [...] he's out". Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, {{and a whole lot of}} it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E
