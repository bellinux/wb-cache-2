Funded by the Wellcome Trust, Significant Walks pools the expertise of a research team that share a mutual interest in the resonance of walking as an interpretive tool and who came together following Shirley Chubb’s exhibition Thinking Path, which took Charles Darwin’s daily ritual of walking the same path in the grounds of his family home as its inspiration. The collaborative research team are working {{with a group of}} participants who are invited to identify a personal walk that <b>encapsulates</b> <b>memory,</b> reminiscence and familiarity as well as being a measure of their physical experience. Manifested as an immersive digital artwork, a methodology has been identified that synthesizes eye level video documentation of participant’s personal walks with simultaneously gathered streams of kinematic data recording the movement of the spine. Researchers and participants work together to explore how the interpretive qualities of visual effects can be applied to each body of synthesized footage in order to express the nature and resonance of personal movement whilst walking. Each micro journey expresses individual experience through the interpretation of clinically accurate data and acts as a vehicle for precise accounts of physical movement whilst also presenting the reflective individual at the core of scientific understanding...|$|R

40|$|Large {{and fast}} hard disks for little money have enabled the {{processing}} of huge amounts of data on a single machine. For this purpose, the well-established STXXL library provides a framework for external memory algorithms with an easy-to-use interface. However, the clock speed of processors cannot {{keep up with the}} increasing bandwidth of parallel disks, making many algorithms actually compute-bound. To overcome this steadily worsening limitation, we exploit today’s multi-core processors with two new approaches.

Second, we augment the unique pipelining feature of the STXXL, to enable automatic task parallelization.

HadoopV 1 executes MapReduce tasks in working slots that are statically configured, YARN uses {{a set of}} task containers to <b>encapsulate</b> its <b>memory</b> and CPU resources. However, neither of them considers the runtime performance of the cluster when deciding the proper number of concurrent tasks to run on each node to achieve the optimal throughput. In order to gain higher performance, the users of Hadoop usually need to use their experience to carefully configure {{the resources of the}} cluster and the resources needed by their jobs. But as the workload is typically always changing in the cluster, rarely could such a manual configuration lead to optimized performance. In this paper, we study the MapReduce job performance in HadoopV 1 and YARN with different resource configurations, and model the cluster throughput in terms of the resource capacity of the cluster. We propose SMapReduce, which can dynamically manage a proper number of concurrent tasks running on each node. SMapReduce can gain the maximum job throughput by considering the thrashing phenomenon and the balancing between map and reduce tasks. Evaluation results show that SMapReduce can yield significant performance speedup comparing to both HadoopV 1 and YARN for various MapReduce workloads. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

To understand whether the absence of the spleen is associated with a defined B cell defect, we analyzed B cell subsets in the peripheral blood. We found that a population of B cells known as immunoglobulin (Ig) M memory is lacking in patients without spleen. The absence of IgM memory B cells con-elates with an impaired immune response to encapsulated bacteria not only in splenectomized patients, but also in individuals with an intact spleen. We show that the physiological and transient predisposition to pneumococcal infections of young children (0 - 2 yr) is associated with the lack of circulating IgM memory B cells and of serum antipolysaccharide IgM. We also demonstrate that IgM memory B cells are undetectable in a fraction of patients with common variable immunodeficiency, who have recurrent and invasive infections by <b>encapsulated</b> bacteria.

40|$|Imagery rescripting (IR) is a transdiagnostic {{technique}} {{that aims to}} change the meaning associated with distressing memories. The literature review discusses advances in the evidence base for the efficacy of IR, optimal methods of delivering the technique and the mechanisms underlying it, published since the last review by Arntz (2012). Research has identified beneficial effects from single and multiple sessions of IR, both with and without additional cognitive restructuring, {{across a range of}} disorders. Exploration into the optimal approach to adopt when using IR, and the mechanisms underlying it,remains in its infancy. IR research is generally limited by methodological differences across studies, predominantly relying on case study designs, making it difficult to generalise findings. Overall, the literature supports the efficacy of IR as a transdiagnostic technique, however continued research is needed to explain the mechanisms underlying it and clarify the optimal method to delivering the intervention. The empirical paper provides encouraging evidence for the impact of a single session of IR on non-clinical paranoia. A within subjects design was used with fifteen university students experiencing high levels of non-clinical paranoia. Participants attended three sessions. During the first session, participants recalled a recurrent, distressing memory, which was then rescripted in the second session. Participants attended a follow-up session one-week later. The impact of the intervention was assessed through measures of paranoia, affect and the self, taken at each session. Results revealed reductions in paranoia, negative affect and negative core beliefs about the self, alongside improvements in self-esteem and positive affect following IR. The impact of memory intrusions, strength of <b>encapsulated</b> belief, <b>memory</b> related distress and the emotional impact of the memory targeted were also reduced following the intervention. Effects were either further reduced or maintained at follow-up. Limitations and clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{confluence}} of 3 D stacking, emerging dense memory technologies, and low-voltage throughput-oriented many-core processors has sparked interest in single-chip servers as {{building blocks for}} scalable data-centric system design. These chips <b>encapsulate</b> an entire <b>memory</b> hierarchy within a 3 D-stacked multi-die package. Stacking alters key assump-tions of conventional hierarchy design, drastically increas-ing cross-layer bandwidth and reducing the latency ratio between successive layers. Hence, prior work, specifically PicoServer, suggests flattening the hierarchy, eliding inter-mediate caches that otherwise lengthen the critical path be-tween L 1 and stacked memory. Although PicoServer argues for a flattened memory hier-archy for web serving workloads, it remains unclear if its conclusions hold more generally—particularly when con-sidering metrics besides access latency—and more recent studies have often included intermediate caches. In this pa-per, we investigate the bandwidth, latency, and energy filter-ing afforded by an L 2 cache. For data-centric scientific and server applications, we conclude: (1) 3 D stacking provides copious bandwidth, hence L 2 bandwidth filtering is moot; (2) although a flat hierarchy is optimal for access patterns with poor temporal locality, some workloads benefit from ac-cess latency reduction afforded by L 2, an effect magnified by latency-intolerant in-order cores and for memory technolo-gies with asymmetric read and write latencies; and (3) inter-mediate caches are rarely desirable from an energy perspec-tive, and only if the cache is optimized for low leakage. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Action/Reflection {{model used}} at the Centre for Christian Studies (CCS), a {{theological}} college of the United Church of Canada for diaconal preparation, {{is the subject of}} this research. This tool for carrying out transformative theological education is taught to students and used by them to reflect on and integrate their learning into practice with a view to "living a theology of justice". It helps them analyse their experience of the world with a critical lens, considering their active response in light of theology, social analysis, Scripture, and other theory. This research documents the lived experience of the CCS Action/Reflection model: the originating theories; staff and student input into its formation; how it has evolved; how it has been taught and learned; and what it has come to mean to graduates and staff who have used it. The study is structured as a narrative weaving together multiple strands from staff and student perspectives. The tale begins with a chronological telling of creating, learning, and using the model. It then moves into naming patterns in the story: contradictions, insights, and overlapping conversations. Presenting an account that <b>encapsulates</b> the community <b>memory,</b> two themes emerge: the historical and contextual details of the model's development, alongside its flexibility and capacity for adaptation to different needs and situations. The story of the CCS Action/Reflection model is recorded as a narrative of theory development and pedagogy, which addresses how theological students can learn to reflect in a way that is well defined, beneficial to learning, and integrated into practice.

40|$|Objects, {{material}} or digital, mediate memories: {{they act as}} anchors in between temporal notions and relations of past and present. Through those objects of memory, the act of remembering occurs neither completely relived in the mind, nor fully captured in the medium. Essential to personal memories, objects represent also our collective memory and capture our social history. The papers submitted for this PhD by selected publications look at the design of innovative technology that can make remembering more evocative and affective. They look at both museums, where digital and material are combined in an augmented reality, and personal/family contexts, where the home and mundane Objects can be technologically enhanced to <b>encapsulate</b> digital <b>memories.</b> The museum was ideal to experiment with hybrid settings that combine material (the collection and the architectural space) and digital (the information) (papers 1 to 3). Personalization of information was used to augment the reality of rooms and exhibits: whole body interaction (i. e. physical movements in the space) was used to select and personalize the content and engage visitors with both material (the object) and digital (the information). Although the mobile technology is dated, these papers show the value of combining digital and physical to provide a holistic experience that made visitors wonder. Where the fusion occurs, however, is in the digital technology. To balance this perspective, paper 4 looks at the effect of taking the digital content out into the exhibition space. My recent research (papers 5 - 9) looks at objects of memory in the personal realm, in particular in the family home. Starting from observing the role and function of mementos, I conclude that a more holistic and organic approach {{has to be taken}} to make personal digital objects of memory more present in people's life. Materialization can be achieved with digital devices designed for individual and family use, so that the product fits with the mundane aspects of life, is immediate, and stimulates affect, not efficiency. Finally papers 10 and 11 provide evidence of the innovative methodologies I have developed and successfully used in iterative user studies and evaluations across different research projects and many years of research. As a whole this submission shows that there is a huge design space to explore in looking at how technology could be used in public or private spaces to bring together the two aspects of memory: remembering in the mind and capturing through objects, in order to preserve our digital life as tangible interactive objects.

40|$|The object {{technology}} model is constantly evolving {{to address the}} software crisis problem. This novel idea which informed and currently guides the design style of most modern scalable software systems has caused a strong belief that the object-oriented technology is the ultimate answer to the software crisis, i. e. applying an object-oriented development method will eventually lead to quality code. It is important to emphasise that object-orientedness does not make testing obsolete. As a matter of fact, some aspects of its very nature introduce new problems into the production of correct programs and their testing due to paradigmatic features like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and dynamic binding as this research work shows. Most work in testing research has centred on procedure-oriented software with worthwhile methods of testing having been developed as a result. However, those cannot be applied directly to object-oriented software owing {{to the fact that}} the architectures of such systems differ on many key issues. In this thesis, we investigate and review the problems introduced by the features of the {{object technology}} model and then proceed to show why traditional structured software testing techniques are insufficient for testing object-oriented software by comparing the fundamental differences in their architecture. Also, by reviewing Weyuker’s test adequacy axioms we show that program-based testing and specification-based testing are orthogonal and complementary. Thus, a software testing methodology that is solely based on one of these approaches (i. e. program-based or specification-based testing) cannot adequately cover all the essential paths of the system under test or satisfactorily guarantee correctness in practice. We argue that a new method is required which integrates the benefits of the two approaches and further builds upon their individual strengths to create a more meaningful, practical and reliable solution. To this end, this thesis introduces and discusses a new automaton-based framework formalism for object-oriented classes called the Class-Machine and a test method that is based on this formalism. Here, the notion of a class or the idea behind classification in object-oriented languages is embodied within a machine framework. The Class-Machine model represents a polymorphic abstraction for heterogeneous families of Object-Machines that model a real life problem in a given domain; these Object-Machines are instances of different concrete machine types. The Class-Machine has an extensible machine implementation as well as an extensible machine interface. Thus, the Class-Machine is introduced as a formal framework for generating autonomous Object-Machines (i. e. Object-Machine Generator) that share common Generic Class-Machine States and Specific Object-Machine States. The states of these Object-Machines are manipulated by a set of processing functions (i. e. Class-Machine Methods and Object-Machine Methods) that must satisfy a set of preconditions before they are allowed to modify the state(s) of the Object-Machines. The Class-Machine model can also be viewed as a platform for integrating a society of communicating Object-Machines. To verify and completely test systems that adhere to the Class-Machine framework, a novel testing method is proposed i. e. the fault-finders (f²) - a distributed family of software checkers specifically designed to crawl through a Class-Machine implementation to look for a particular type of fault and tell us the location of the fault in the program (i. e. the class under test). Given this information, we can statistically show the distribution of faults in an object-oriented system and then provide a probabilistic assertion of the number and type of faults that remain undetected after testing is completed. To address the problems caused through the encapsulation mechanism, this thesis introduces and discusses another novel framework formalism that has complete visibility on all the <b>encapsulated</b> methods, <b>memory</b> states of the instance and class variables of a given Object-Machine or Class-Machine system under test. We call this the Class Machine Friend Function (CMƒƒ). In order to further illustrate all the fundamental theoretical ideas and paradigmatic features inherent within our proposed Class-Machine model, this thesis considers four different Class-Machine case studies. Finally, to further show that the Class-Machine theoretical purity does not mitigate against practical concerns, our novel object-oriented specification, verification, debugging and testing approaches proposed in this thesis are exemplified in an automated testing tool called: The Class-Machine Testing Tool (CMTT) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on two World Wide Web projects: the virtual nation of Cyber-Yugoslavia (www. juga. com) and the {{homepage}} of former Yugoslav president Tito (www. titoville. com). Both projects problematize our under standing of nationhood and political leadership through skilful manipulation of the structural characteristics of the medium. The virtual, performative and transitory nature of both {{the nation and the}} state will be exemplifed by Cyber-Yugoslavia – a virtual nation-building endeavour conjured up by Belgrade expatriate playwright Zoran Bacic. The changing character of political leadership will be discussed against the backdrop of Tito’s homepage, which archives numerous image and sound files documenting the life of the former Yugoslav president. The two projects share at least three common elements: their genre is parody; their subject matter is repressed collective memory; and they reflect the anxieties of the postmodern condition in their treatment of its most emblematic medium, the Internet. The repressed collective <b>memory</b> <b>encapsulated</b> in these projects is that of South-Slav unity, {{as an alternative to the}} now dominant particularist ethno- nationalisms of the Yugoslav successor states. The idea of unity of the South Slavs, which gained popularity in the nineteenth century under the Habsburg yoke, was institutionally sanctioned in two twentieth-century Yugoslav states: the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918 – 41), called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes from 1918 to 1929, and the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (1945 – 91), called People’s Federative Republic of Yugoslavia from 1945 to 1963. The first was made possible by the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War One. Its nation-building rhetoric, underpinning the politics of centralization and Serbian hegemony, rested on a view of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as ‘three tribes’ of the same nation. The second Yugoslavia, which grew out of the national liberation movement in World War Two, was founded on federalist principles and a nation-building rhetoric of ‘brotherhood and unity’, i. e. national equality for all the member nations. During the period of existence of both Yugoslav states, a tendency against political unification and in favour of the formation of independent national states co-existed with the dominant nation-building narratives. Tito’s model in particular, which may be interpreted as a compromise between the two opposing tendencies, left a deep cultural legacy of ethnic tolerance and was internalized by segments of the post-World War Two generations in former Yugoslavia as an important part of their national identity. Linda Hutcheon has explained the popularity of parody in periods of ideological instability as an impulse for challenging the established norms. I would like to suggest that the technological advances and the introduction of the new mass media also encouraged the proliferation of parody as one of the modes of positive self-reference with a universal appeal akin to Bakhtinian 'carnival laughter'. The Internet in particular seems to foster the more positive, universalizing aspects of what Hutcheon calls 'parodic ethos'...|$|R
