A system built up of a single glass pane, a steel frame and a <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> is only loaded by a concentrated monotonic in-plane load at the top. Three <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> types are defined, namely a flexible joint on the end, a two-sided and a one-sided rigid joint. A finite element model was developed and calibrated with the experiments followed by varying the geometry of the glass pane. The applied criteria are the strength of glass for failure and the restricted in-plane displacement at the top. The system with a flexible joint on the end can be characterized by small loads, large inplane displacements and small stiffnesses. The stiffness is the criterion. Systems with two-sided and one sided rigid joints can be characterized by larger loads, much smaller,in-plane displacements and larger stiffnesses. The strength of glass is the criterion and is located on the glass pane's surface in the vicinity of the <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> which anchors the tensile diagonal of the glass pane. These tensile stresses increase by the different in stiffness of the <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> (rigid) and the less shear stiffness of the bolts between beadwork and outside beam of the frame.

The aim was to determine gluing parameters affording satisfactory behaviour to manufactured glulam in a tropical climate. Three abundant wood species, with special properties, were selected for the study and resorcinol-phenol-formaldehyde resin was used for bonding. Three industrial parameters were considered: adhesive spread rate, closed assembly time and gluing pressure. Delamination and shearing tests were carried out in accordance with European Standards. The tests revealed the influence of wood properties and manufacturing parameters on joint resistance. In fact, the results showed that specific gravity and the shrinkage coefficient greatly influenced the gluing step. Indeed, wood with a medium specific gravity needed more adhesive and more pressure than wood with a high specific gravity. In addition, planing and lamella thickness were found to affect <b>glue</b> <b>joint</b> resistance. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Under a maximally applied {{decrease}} in relative humidity of 40 %, the panels tested {{did not show}} any shrinkage cracking in the oak wood or the glue connections, no matter whether this {{decrease in}} relative humidity was applied abruptly or in a more gradual, step-wise fashion. By means of a basic analytical bi-layer model it has been demonstrated that the local tensile stresses developing in the panels under restrained hygral shrinkage indeed were lower than the tensile strength of new oak wood {{perpendicular to the grain}} direction, as reported recently in [28]. Nonetheless, the tensile stress generated near the cleated end—as a result of Type 2 shrinkage—is comparable to the tensile strength of seventeenth century oak wood reported in [28], which possibly explains the crack formation regularly observed near cleated ends in seventeenth century historical cabinets, see Fig.  2. Alternatively, these cracks may result from the local tensile stress reaching the fracture strength of the (aging) historic glue connecting the oak wooden boards, leading to failure of a <b>glue</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E

An FFrmodel of a violin plate, symmetri-cal along the center line (the <b>glue</b> <b>joint),</b> is used when calculating the eigenmodes. Shape and frequency of the first six modes are studied when 1) plate arching, 2) plate thickness and thickness distribution, 3) material parameters for spruce and maple, and 4) boundary conditions of the plate are used as parameters.

Calculated and experimentally determined modal shapes and frequencies are found to be close- the frequencies differ often much less than 8 %.

40|$|OAK-B 135 Fast {{ignition}} {{is a novel}} {{scheme for}} achieving laser fusion. A class of these targets involves cone mounted CH shells. The authors have been fabricating such targets with shells {{with a wide variety}} of diameters and wall thicknesses for several years at General Atomics. In addition, recently such shells were needed for implosion experiments at Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) that for the first time were required to be gas retentive. Fabrication of these targets requires producing appropriate cones and shells, assembling the targets, and characterization of the assembled targets. The cones are produced using micromachining and plating techniques. The shells are fabricated using the depolymerizable mandrel technique followed by micromachining a hole for the cone. The cone and the shell then need to be assembled properly for gas retention and precisely in order to position the cone tip at the desired position within the shell. Both are critical for the fast ignition experiments. The presence of the cone in the shell creates new challenges in characterization of the assembled targets. Finally, for targets requiring a gas fill, the cone-shell assembly needs to be tested for gas retention and proper strength at the <b>glue</b> <b>joint.</b> This paper presents an overview of the developmental efforts and technical issues addressed during the fabrication of fast ignition targets...|$|E
3000|$|For a Type 2 {{shrinkage}} analysis at the cleated ends, a plane-stress {{assumption is}} taken, {{in agreement with}} the limited thickness of the cleated ends and the boards in the out-of-plane direction. Hence, in the bi-layer model the stress response only depends on the material characteristics in the x-direction, see Eqs. (6) and (7). The elastic moduli and the hygroscopic expansion coefficients are again taken from Table  2, whereby the x-direction of the bi-layer is represented by the longitudinal direction of the oak wooden cleated end (= layer (1)), and by the radial direction of the oak wooden boards (= layer (2)). The effective height h^(2) across which the oak wooden board substantially contributes to the local hygral-mechanical equilibrium near the cleated end is assumed to be equal to the height h^(1) of the cleated end. Under a maximal drop in moisture content of m^(1)=m^(2)=- 0.038, Eq. (6) provides a tensile stress in the oak wooden board of σ _xx^(2)= 9.4 [...] N/mm^ 2. With this result, the total horizontal shrinkage strain in the layers from Eq. (3) is calculated as ϵ _xx=- 0.13 %, which is indeed comparable to the total final shrinkage strain measured for mock-up A on the cleated end, see Fig.  12 for the strain gauge group 1, 10, 14, 23. This agreement confirms that the above assumption for the effective height h^(2) of the oak wooden board is realistic. Note that the above tensile stress does not exceed the tensile strength of new oak wood of 21 [...] N/mm^ 2 (measured perpendicular to the grain direction), as reported in [28]; however, the stress has a magnitude relatively close to the reported tensile strength of 12 [...] N/mm^ 2 for seventeenth century oak wood, which, considering a realistic spread in the material properties for oak wood, thus potentially may lead to crack formation comparable to that observed near cleated ends of seventeenth century historical cabinets displayed in museums, see Fig.  2. Alternatively, this value for the tensile stress may reach the strength of the glue connecting the oak wooden boards, thereby leading to failure of a <b>glue</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
