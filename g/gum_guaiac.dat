40|$|FOBT {{testing for}} {{colorectal}} cancer (11). He {{stated that the}} concept of occult blood detection is generally cred-ited to Van Deen, who in 1864 used <b>gum</b> <b>guaiac,</b> as an indicator reagent. Boas was the first to demonstrate its value for the detection of bowel malignancy (12) and Greegor was the first to stimulate interest in screening with the guaiac test (13). The guaiac FOBTs (GT) detect the peroxidase activity of heme either as intact hemoglobin or free heme. In the presence of heme and a developer (hydrogen peroxide) guaiac acid is oxidized producing a blue color. In screening for colorectal neoplasms a true positive GT is one which indicates bleeding from a colon cancer or polyp. All other positive results are considered to be false positive. Heme is present in red meat and peroxidase activity is present in fresh fruits and vegetables such as radishes, turnips and broccoli. These foods, therefore, have the potential to produce false-positive results. Some reports suggest that delay-ing development of GT cards for at least three days will decrease the number of false positives due to plant peroxidases and obviate the need for diet restriction o...|$|E

40|$|Fecal {{occult blood}} testing with <b>guaiac</b> <b>gum</b> is a simple, safe, and cheap method for {{screening}} for colorectal cancer. In the office setting, compliance is good. Asymptomatic colorectal cancers are detected {{at a more}} favourable pathologic stage than those detected in symptomatic patients. Because of the low positive predictive value of the test, many persons testing positive undergo unnecessary bowel examinations. As yet, randomized controlled studies have not shown that fecal occult blood screening reduces mortality from colorectal cancer. At present, screening with this test is left to the judgement of the individual physician...|$|R
