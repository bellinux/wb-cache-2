5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E
5|$|The guns in {{the back}} of the {{forecastle}} have defied explanation, but one theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> included to compensate for the guns that were positioned in the aftcastle, aiming forwards, but which would have been obscured due to the angle from which the ship was depicted. The list of ammunition, small firearms, longbows, arrows, pikes, and bills closely matches the archaeological evidence. As the source that is closest in time to the sinking of the Mary Rose, it has been of central importance for the archaeological project, especially in estimating the size of the crew.|$|E
5|$|The late 12th-century defences at Framlingham Castle have invoked {{much debate}} by scholars. One interpretation, put forward for example by {{historian}} R. Allen Brown, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> relatively advanced {{for their time}} and represented a change in contemporary thinking about military defence. Framlingham has no keep, for example – {{this had been a}} very popular feature in previous Anglo-Norman castles, but this castle breaks with the tradition, relying on the curtain wall and mural towers instead. The pattern of ground-level arrowslits at Framlingham were similarly innovative for their time, enabling interlocking and flanking fire against attackers. The design of Framlingham's defences is similar in many ways to Henry II's innovative work at Dover and Orford.|$|E
40|$|This paper gives game-theoretic {{versions}} of several results on "merging of opinions" obtained in measure-theoretic probability and algorithmic randomness theory. An {{advantage of the}} game-theoretic versions over the measure-theoretic results <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pointwise, their advantage over the algorithmic randomness results <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> non-asymptotic, {{but the most important}} advantage over both <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very constructive, giving explicit and efficient strategies for players in a game of prediction.

5|$|This cut-marked human bone {{assemblage}} {{represented the}} largest yet identified from within a Neolithic long barrow in southern Britain, although similar evidence for dismemberment {{has been found}} from other Neolithic British sites, such as West Trump, Eyford, Aldestrop, and Haddenham. There are two possibilities for how this material developed. The first is that {{the bodies of the}} dead were excarnated or exposed to the elements, followed by a secondary burial within the tomb. The second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> placed in the tomb, where the flesh decomposed, before the bodies were then rearranged within the tomb itself. These practices may have been accompanied by other ritualistic or ceremonial practices, direct evidence for which does not survive.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} potbelly monuments <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> representations of rulership. This {{is suggested by}} the body position represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, Antigua Guatemala, Kaminaljuyu, Santa Cruz del Quiché, Takalik Abaj, Tikal, Ujuxte, El Balsamo, Los Cerritos and La Nueva in Guatemala, Chalchuapa in El Salvador, and Copán in Honduras. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then Bilbao Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Ethel & Millie then {{abandoned}} their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine, where the Nelson survivors last saw them standing in line being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of the Ethel & Millie were never seen again, and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance. Prevailing opinion {{at the time was}} that they were murdered and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies, but these scenarios cannot be substantiated. Another theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> taken prisoner aboard the boat and killed when the submarine was itself sunk. The son of Arthur Soanes, a sailor who disappeared in this incident, later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a spiritual medium, reporting that he had died on board the German vessel. UC 63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{applications}} of statistical semantics (listed above) {{can also be}} addressed by lexicon-based algorithms, instead of the corpus-based algorithms of statistical semantics.

25|$|The {{description}} of Benjamin being born after the arrival in Canaan is thought by some scholars {{to refer to}} the tribe of Benjamin coming into existence by branching from the Joseph group after the tribe had settled in Canaan. A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the Joseph tribes (including Benjamin) <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the only Israelites which went to Egypt and returned, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in Canaan throughout.|$|E
25|$|The ethno-linguistic {{affiliation}} of the Bastarnae {{was probably}} Germanic, which {{is supported by}} ancient historians and modern archeology. However, ancient literary sources imply Celtic or Scytho-Sarmatian origins. The most likely scenario <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> originally a group of East Germanic tribes, originally resident in the lower Vistula river valley. In ca. 200 BC, these tribes then migrated, possibly accompanied by some Celtic elements, southeastwards into the North Pontic region. Some elements appear to have become assimilated, to some extent, by the surrounding Sarmatians by the 3rd century.|$|E
25|$|In Horsell Common {{there are}} three ancient bell barrow burial mounds that are around 3-4,000 years old.
