For this reason a number of products like audio- and videotapes, lipsticks, nail varnish, shoe polish, furniture polish, typewriter ribbon and photocopier drying toners were analysed. The investigation was carried out in cooperation with the IRI for inorganic analyses (instrumental neutron activation method) and TAUW for organic analyses (gas chromatography- mass spectrometry method). Especially audio-and videotapes contain sometimes high concentrations of metals like Cr IV, Ni, Zn, Co and Sb. Some tapes contain also high Cl concentrations due to probably PVC. Results showed that, compared to the criteria waste materials from the investigated products should not be indicated as <b>hazardous</b> <b>household</b> <b>waste,</b> except shoe polish, furniture polish and similar products (naphtalene content) and typewriter ribbon (oil content).

40|$|AbstractDespite {{the serious}} threat to public health that it represents, <b>hazardous</b> <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> (HHW) is not {{perceived}} as dangerous {{by a majority of}} the population. Existing waste management systems contribute to this misperception, by underestimating the importance of these residues. This, in practice, reflects the lack of knowledge of citizens about the risks and about their responsibility. This study aimed to identify the major HHW generated and disposal practices of the population of São Luís District and know the HHW management situation of the municipality of Canoas, Brazil. We conducted a neighborhood survey, identifying the generation and destination of 15 types of HHW. The situation of the management of this waste was obtained through consultations with the City of Canoas, where we observed little effective action to correct mismanagement. With the aim of improving the current administration, this paper proposes the use of the Family Health Strategy as a liaison for implementation of an appropriate <b>hazardous</b> <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> management program.

5000|$|The 2010 New York State <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Waste</b> Facility Siting Plan also {{presents}} important information when evaluating the TSDF’s in each county. Chapter 1 of the siting plan states that ten-day transfer stations, generators who store {{for less than}} 90 days, facilities or locations for collecting <b>household</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes,</b> facilities for collecting non-manifested waste such as universal waste, sanitary landfills, and trucks are not included as TSD facilities in the detailed analyses included in the Plan. This shows that not all <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> facilities are taken into consideration when examining the eligibility of a county for building more facilities. Omitting such facilities from the analyses presents inaccurate calculations and assumptions. Those facilities still emit pollution and wastes, regardless {{of the size of}} facility or time-length of the waste transfer. [...] Homeowners in New York emit a larger percentage of toxic chemicals into the environment than renters do, since those who own homes require more energy use. Also, the air pollutants that contribute the most to cancer in New York are diesel emissions. This makes sense because New York has a lot of busy counties with many tourists and overpopulated counties. Many people rely on public transit in New York City, for example, since it is so cheap and easy to access compared to owning a car. This intense use of the public transit system increases those people’s carbon emissions. The Scorecard analysis states that New York experiences only 45% of days with good air quality in a year, and 1% of days with unhealthful air quality. Because of this, New York ranked among the 10% dirtiest/worst of all counties in the United States in 2003. In regards to air quality management, the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability supports that “the City has implemented a policy to reduce, replace, retrofit and refuel City vehicles. In 2014, the City reduced its fleet by at least 5 percent and expanded the use of biodiesel. Additionally, 400 vehicles were upgraded through the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) and other funding sources, and Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) were installed on 685 buses in 2014”. These advances bring hope to the reduction of future carbon emissions, but consistency is key.|$|R

40|$|Municipal Solid wastes [...] the {{majority}} of which are household refuse [...] have, increasingly been implicated {{as a source of}} hazardous materials in landfill leachate discharges (U. S.

Data collected on the components of these wastes are critical for solid wastes systems planning [...] especially landfill design, hazardous materials collection systems, and resource recovery. A number of recent studies by the University of Arizona 2 ̆ 7 s Garbage Project have identified household products as a possible source of hazardous materials in landfills (Wilson 1985, Rathje et al. 1987 a, 1987 b). Studies have addressed (1) the definition of these 2 ̆ 2 <b>household</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> 2 ̆ 2 (HHW), (2) the characteristics of HHW from hands-on analyses of residential solid wastes in four United States study cities and Mexico City, Mexico, (3) the relationships between derived waste characteristics and within-study city Socioeconomic variability and variability between the regions studied and (4) the potential biodegradation pathways and characteristics of municipal landfill leachates. Results of these studies suggest that: (1) While HHW comprises a very small proportion of the total residential solid wastes, total quantities generated per year are quite high. (2) Significant differences in HHW discard rates are observed between both study communities and census tracts within study communities. (3) Socioeconomic variability between census tracts (within study communities), are related to the differential discard of HHW and, we believe, can be used to estimate characteristics of HHW in U. S. cities without necessitating further large-scale, costly, refuse sorts. (4) Long-term discard trends for HHW may influence the levels of risk associated with these wastes.
