40|$|ABSTRACT: HEPD {{belongs to}} the {{superfamily}} of 2 -His- 1 carboxylate non-heme iron-dependent dioxygenases. It converts 2 -hydroxyethylphosphonate (2 -HEP) to <b>hydroxymethylphosphonate</b> (HMP) and formate. Previously postulated mechanisms for the reaction catalyzed by HEPD cannot explain its conversion of 1 -HEP to acetylphosphate. Alternative mechanisms that involve either phosphite or methylphosphonate as intermediates, which potentially explain all experimental studies including isotope labeling experiments and use of substrate analogues, were investigated. The results of these studies reveal that these alternative mechanisms are not correct. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of Lys 16, Arg 90, and Tyr 98 support roles of these residues in binding of 2 -HEP. Mutation of Lys 16 to Ala resulted in an inactive enzyme, whereas mutation of Arg 90 to Ala or Tyr 98 to Phe greatly decreased kcat/Km, 2 -HEP. Furthermore, the latter mutants could not be saturated in O 2. These results suggest that proper binding of 2 -HEP is important for O 2 activation and that the enzyme uses a compulsory binding order with 2 -HE...|$|E
