40|$|Abstract This work {{describes}} the hydrodynamics of a plate column of 5 cm inner diameter and 2. 75 m height, operated in a semi-batch manner using an oil-water system {{especially important for}} enzymatic catalyzed reactions. The parameters such as dispersed phase superficial velocity, plate orifice size, number of nozzles, nozzle size and plate spacing, affecting the dispersed phase <b>hold</b> <b>up,</b> were investigated. It was observed that the orifice plate produced an uneven change in drop diameter and hence nozzles were used to study the hydrodynamics. The total and dynamic <b>hold</b> <b>ups</b> determined were increased {{with an increase in}} dispersed phase superficial velocity, while decreased with an increase in a nozzle size. The total <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> decreased, while dynamic <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> slightly increased with an increase in plate spacing. Correlations obtained are found to be appropriate for the estimation of the total <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> and dynamic <b>hold</b> <b>up...</b>|$|R

5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below {{the pipeline}} warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E

40|$|Experimental reactor was a {{cylindrical}} bubble-column made of glass, with {{an inside}} diameter of 15 cmand {{a height of}} 2. 8 (m). The column was equipped with two types of sparger, a porous plate and aperforated plate with the same porosity. In this study, liquid phase and gas phase were water and airrespectively. Gas <b>hold</b> <b>up,</b> bubble size and effect of sparger type in different gas velocity wereinvestigated. Gas <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> was determined with differential pressure method and used to estimate thetransition velocity in slurry bubble column reactors. The results showed that with increasing thesuperficial gas velocity, the total gas <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> increases. Also perforated -type sparger increases thediameter of bubbles up to 35 % and decreases gas <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> to about 40 % respectively.

40|$|Gas <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> was {{measured}} in mechanically agitated vessels fitted with dual impellers. Different impellers like Pitched blade turbine and Disc turbine were used. 5 different combinations of dual impellers were used. A tank of 0. 45 m internal diameter with an impeller diameter of 0. 15 m was used. Superficial gas velocity was varied from 0. 005 m/sec to 0. 01 m/ sec. Correlations are proposed for gas <b>hold</b> <b>ups</b> for different combinations of impellers. Optimum combination of dual impellers for maximum gas <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> has been identified.

5|$|The fogstand beetle of the Namib Desert, Stenocara gracilipes, is able {{to collect}} water from fog, as its elytra have a {{textured}} surface combining hydrophilic (water-loving) bumps and waxy, hydrophobic troughs.

Similar adaptations are found in several other Namib desert beetles such as Onymacris unguicularis.|$|E

The general formula {{is that the}} nth shell can in {{principle}} <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> to 2(n2) electrons. Since electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus, an atom's electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electrons. However, {{this is not a}} strict requirement: atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells. (See Madelung rule for more details.)

5|$|It is an {{outstanding}} example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England. Barns of this type {{were based on a}} longitudinal frame, with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to be both long and high, they experience high structural loads from the wind. They therefore have numerous internal braces, acting {{in much the same way}} as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> the roof. The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time, and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved.|$|E
