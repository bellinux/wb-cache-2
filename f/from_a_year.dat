5|$|Coolidge and Cox were renominated {{for their}} {{respective}} offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his {{actions in the}} Police Strike around {{the state and the}} nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form.

His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge run for president in 1920.|$|E

5|$|He also {{experienced}} stomach disease, having a low production of gastric acids. This was worsened by harsh military conditions, including long periods with little food. The first {{references to the}} disease {{that would lead to}} his death, a case of edema, are <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before, in a letter directed to Álvarez Thomas. He declared having problems in the chest, a lung, and his right leg. A later letter to Sarratea confirmed his situation, and specified that it started on 23 April 1819. The gravity of his condition led the doctor Francisco de Paula Rivero to diagnose an advanced dropsy. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires, where he died. He was embalmed by Joseph Redhead and Juan Sullivan. Sullivan performed the autopsy; it revealed high levels of fluid in multiple edemas and a tumor in the right epigastrium. The liver and spleen had grown beyond normal levels, there were hamartomas in the kidneys, and problems with the lungs and heart.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, however, it was {{reported}} that the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.|$|E
