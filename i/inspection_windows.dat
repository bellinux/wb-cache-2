Masma is a mixed-initiative decision support system based on agent technologies that addresses various aspects of the agenda management problem: in particular it is the result of an investigation on several issues concerning the acceptability of the agent approach by human users. The paper is focused on how the initiative moves between the different actors involved in the system: human users, personal interface agents and service agents. Two classes of control mechanisms are introduced and explained that coordinate continuous interaction among the actors. The first group concerns negotiation protocols and personalization of agents that are used as standard tools to model strategies of communication.

40|$|LectureOwing {{to their}} {{impressive}} properties reciprocating positive displacement pumps {{are used in}} many applications. Pumping fluids at high delivery pressures and metering are the areas of frequent use. The design of reciprocating pumps requires an exact knowledge of the appearing phenomena such as unacceptable pipeline pulsation and harmful cavitation. But cavitation in reciprocating positive displacement pumps is still an insufficiently understood problem. For {{a better understanding of}} the effects of incipient, partial and full cavitation in reciprocating positive displacement pumps high-speed camera measurements were done under real operating conditions using a horizontal single-acting plunger pump. <b>Inspection</b> <b>windows</b> were placed to capture all cavitation phenomena. Exemplarily the cavitation phenomena and their erosive potential are to be described on the basis of high-speed sequences for selected cavitation conditions. Also the mechanism of the incipient cavitation and the opening of the self acting valves could be clearly investigated with this experimental setup. Standards and guidelines were discussed concerning the economical operating of reciprocating positive displacement pumps...|$|E
40|$|Much {{interest}} {{has been shown}} in IR cells capable of maintaining one or more samples at constant temperature, constant water vapour or gas pressure, or under vacuum conditions (Farmer, 1974). This note describes a cell capable of maintaining a vacuum between 10 - 3 torr and 10 - 4 tort from room temperature to 1000 ~ whilst the spectrum is being recorded; such cells have been constructed previously but for less severe conditions. The cell and associated vacuum system are shown schematically in Fig. 1. The vacuum in the cell body is produced by an Edwards rotary pump and a normal mercury diffusion pump. To obtain a vacuum of 10 - 3 to 10 - 4 torr, a liquid nitrogen trap and foreline trap are used. The trap is filled with activated alumina. The O-ring seals in the cell are made of Viton. The constant vacuum control is obtained with Pirani and Penning gauges. Figs 2 and 3 show the cell body, which is made of stainless teel (AISI 304). In it are four clay mineral samples, in the form of oriented films, supported in a tray; this is manipulated with an external magnetic bar.

It was only available as a 250 although a handful of experimental 350s were built. In 1934, another overhead cam OK made its debut at the olympia show. Available in road, trials and race trim and in 250 and 350 capacities, it continued in production until early 1939.

50|$|T-Stoff: High test {{peroxide}} equipment {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along the starboard beam of the lifting frame from the trunnion end to the halfway point. The pipe is fitted at the upper end to the triple valve assembly, consisting of two flow valves and a three-way valve. The triple valve assembly connects to two tanks, a large measuring tank and a smaller overflow tank. The measuring tank can be filled to the rocket's required amount of T-stoff, after which any excess flows down a stand pipe to the overflow tank. The measuring tank is fitted with a ventilation stud, which vents displaced air as the tank is filled. The ventilation stud includes a ball cock fixed to a frustum stopper, which blocks the vent stud in case of accidental overfilling so that T-Stoff does not spray from the air vent. Both T-Stoff tanks are fitted with an <b>inspection</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R

40|$|Because of {{performance}} problems with hardboard siding in southern Florida, the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed a local standard requiring prefinishing of siding and priming of all siding surfaces, including the back. However, {{the effectiveness of}} these practices was questioned. To determine if back-priming or factory finishing improves durability and performance of hardboard siding, we installed factory-finished and factory-primed siding on two buildings in southern Florida. The buildings were identical except that one had gutters and no overhangs and the other had overhangs and no gutters. Half the siding was back-primed and half was not. Moisture content, temperature, and air pressure difference across the siding were continuously monitored for 2 years. Condition and thickness of siding boards were recorded every 3 months. After removal from the buildings, siding was inspected and final moisture contents were determined. The siding was in excellent condition after about 2 years of outside exposure. There was no evidence that back-priming the siding reduced its in-service moisture content. Whether the siding was from the overhang building or the guttered building did not seem to make a difference, but <b>inspection</b> of the <b>windows</b> and final moisture contents of the trim strongly suggested that overhangs provided additional protection on the gable ends (gutters were only present on the sidewalls) ...|$|R
40|$|We report recent {{high power}} RF tests on an 805 MHz RF pillbox cavity with {{demountable}} windows for beam apertures at Lab G of Fermilab, a dedicated facility for testing of MUCOOL (muon cooling) components. The cavity is installed inside a superconducting solenoidal magnet. A 12 MW peak RF power klystron {{is used for}} the tests. The cavity has been processed both with and without magnetic field. Without magnetic field, a gradient of 34 MV/m was reached rather quickly with very low sparking rate. In a 2. 5 T solenoidal field, a 16 MV/m gradient was achieved, and it had to take many weeks of conditioning. Strong multipacting effects associated with high radiation levels were measured during the processing with the magnetic field. More recently Be windows with TiN-coated surface have been installed and tested at conditions of with and without the external magnetic field. A conservative 16 MV/m gradient without magnetic field was reached quickly as planned. Less multipacting was observed during the conditioning, it indicated that the TiN-coated surface on the windows had indeed helped to reduce the secondary electron emissions significantly. A modest gradient of 16. 5 MV/m was finally achieved with magnet on in solenoidal mode and the field up to 4 T. Preliminary <b>inspection</b> on Be <b>windows</b> surface found no damage at all, in comparison with Cu windows where substantial surface damage was found.
