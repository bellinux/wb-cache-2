5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.|$|E

She began her career as a filmmaker with her debut short In a Jazz Way, a thirty minute film co-directed with Louise Ghertler about dance documentarian Mura Dehn.

5|$|Despite {{the early}} <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> the novel, after the Second World War it fell into neglect as {{critical}} attention to Döblin was directed primarily towards his next novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), {{and a new}} edition of Berge Meere und Giganten was not published until 1977.

Released in 1994 by Warner Brothers-Reprise and produced by Nile Rodgers (producer of albums by David Bowie, Madonna, et cetera), Your Filthy Little Mouth explores relatively disparate genres of popular music, but contextualizes them via rock and blues. The album reflects Roth's growing <b>fascinations</b> <b>with</b> literature and philosophy, {{as well as his}} experiences living in New York City's Lower East Side during the early 1990s. The album's artwork, based conceptually on tattoo art and graffiti art, is executed by Roth.|$|R

40|$|In his time, {{an anecdote}} accused Paganini of a demonic pact with Lucifer himself in {{exchange}} for amazing fiddler?s prowess. Stemming from this anecdotal association between extraordinary technical skill and the ?supernatural? comes an ironic, grotesque virtuoso piece for violin and piano: the Devil?s Dance. At its core {{it is a very}} tuneful, richly textured, ironic pop-classical piece with a quirky dialogue between the two instruments. Aesthetically it can sometimes be reminiscent of the late 19 th century <b>fascinations</b> <b>with</b> gothic fantasy genre found in pieces such as The Sorcerer?s Apprentice, Danse Macabre or Mephisto Waltz to name a few. Despite its flamboyant contrariness and a somewhat carnivalesque tone, it is rigorously structured as an ultra-fast inverted waltz, with dazzling scales, haunting harmonies and exotic melody lines...|$|R
40|$|The {{beauty of}} the {{developing}} embryo, and the awe that it inspires, lure many scientists into the field of developmental biology. What compels cells to divide, migrate, and morph into a being with a complex body plan? Evolutionary developmental biologists hold similar <b>fascinations,</b> <b>with</b> dynamics that take place on a grander timescale. How do phenotypic traits diverge over evolutionary time? This primer illustrates how a deep understanding of the basic principles that underlie developmental biology have changed how scientists think about the evolution of body form. The primer culminates {{in a conversation with}} David Stern, PhD, and Michael Shapiro, PhD, who discuss current topics in morphological evolution, why the field should be of interest to classic developmental biologists, and what lies ahead.

Particularly, the artist’s pseudo-mystic beliefs about the ocean, her frustrations with her life struggles, and <b>fascinations</b> <b>with</b> scientific facts and libation vessels are discussed.

5|$|Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash (Italian: Dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio), {{sometimes}} called Dog on a Leash or Leash in Motion, is a 1912 painting by Italian Futurist painter Giacomo Balla.

My research group’s efforts toward designing new sensors based on small molecule gelators are described. In particular, I highlight how our design strategy has evolved as we learn more about molecular gelators.

5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region.

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> light.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than she was tall. The <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E
