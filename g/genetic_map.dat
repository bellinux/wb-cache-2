5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E

25|$|A {{linkage map}} (also {{known as a}} <b>genetic</b> <b>map)</b> is a table for a species or {{experimental}} population that shows the position of its known genes or genetic markers relative {{to each other in}} terms of recombination frequency, rather than a specific physical distance along each chromosome. Linkage maps were first developed by Alfred Sturtevant, a student of Thomas Hunt Morgan.|$|E

The combined map confirms the two-chromosome genomic structure and the correspondence of the initial <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> to the circular chromosome. The linear chromosome is almost devoid of auxotrophic markers, which probably explains why it was missed by <b>genetic</b> <b>mapping</b> studies...|$|R

25|$|A study {{conducted}} on 218 individuals in 2010 by the Argentine geneticist Daniel Corach, has {{established that the}} <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> of Argentina is composed by 79% from different European ethnicities (mainly Spanish and Italian ethnicities), 18% of different indigenous ethnicities, and 4.3% of African ethnic groups, in which 63.6% of the tested group {{had at least one}} ancestor who was Indigenous.|$|E
25|$|A <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> is a map {{based on}} the {{frequencies}} of recombination between markers during crossover of homologous chromosomes. The greater the frequency of recombination (segregation) between two genetic markers, the further apart they are assumed to be. Conversely, the lower the frequency of recombination between the markers, the smaller the physical distance between them. Historically, the markers originally used were detectable phenotypes (enzyme production, eye colour) derived from coding DNA sequences; eventually, confirmed or assumed noncoding DNA sequences such as microsatellites or those generating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been used.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{maps are}} very {{important}} to understand the structure and organization of genomes from which evolution patterns and syntenic relationships between species can be deduced. Genetic maps also provide a framework for the mapping of genes of interest and estimating the magnitude of their effects and aid our understanding of genotype/phenotype associations. DH populations have become standard resources in genetic mapping for species in which DHs are readily available. Doubled haploid populations are ideal for genetic mapping. It is possible to produce a <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> within two years of the initial cross regardless of the species. Map construction is relatively easy using a DH population derived from a hybrid of two homozygous parents as the expected segregation ratio is simple, i.e. 1:1. DH populations have now been used to produce genetic maps of barley, rapeseed, rice, wheat, and pepper. DH populations {{played a major role in}} facilitating the generation of the molecular marker maps in eight crop species.|$|E
40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>maps</b> are the {{fundamental}} tools to identify features of phenotypes that {{are linked to}} specific genetic loci and eventually DNA sequences or genes. The major use of <b>genetic</b> linkage <b>maps</b> has, therefore, been to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL). <b>Genetic</b> <b>maps</b> are also essential for marker assisted selection, comparative mapping, high-resolution mapping and map based cloning. To date, over 40 maps with at least 300 markers have been published for different Triticeae populations. The quality of <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> can be affected {{by a number of}} factors and map curation ensures that map quality issues are identified and, where possible, resolved. We report on the issues involved in the production of quality <b>genetic</b> linkage <b>maps</b> by inspection of marker genotype data after map construction...|$|R

25|$|Morgan and his {{students}} became more successful at finding mutant flies; they counted the mutant characteristics of thousands of fruit flies and studied their inheritance. As they accumulated multiple mutants, they combined them to study more complex inheritance patterns. The observation of a miniature-wing mutant, which was also on the sex chromosome but sometimes sorted independently to the white-eye mutation, led Morgan {{to the idea of}} genetic linkage and to hypothesize the phenomenon of crossing over. He relied on the discovery of Frans Alfons Janssens, a Belgian professor at the University of Leuven, who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it chiasmatypie. Morgan proposed that the amount of crossing over between linked genes differs and that crossover frequency might indicate the distance separating genes on the chromosome. The later English geneticist J. B. S. Haldane suggested that the unit of measurement for linkage be called the morgan. Morgan's student Alfred Sturtevant developed the first <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Oppenheimer {{reviewed}} the Weale and Capelli studies {{and suggested that}} correlations of gene frequency mean nothing without {{a knowledge of the}} genetic prehistory of the regions in question. His criticism of these studies is that they generated models based on the historical evidence of Gildas and Procopius, and then selected methodologies to test against these populations. Weale's transect spotlights that Belgium is further west in the <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> than North Walsham, Asbourne and Friesland. In Oppenheimer's view, this is evidence that the Belgae and other continental people – and hence continental genetic markers indistinguishable from those ascribed to Anglo-Saxons – arrived earlier and were already strong in the 5th century in particular regions or areas. Oppenheimer, basing his research on the Weale and Capelli studies, maintains that none of the invasions since the Romans have {{had a significant impact on}} the gene pool of the British Isles, and that the inhabitants from prehistoric times belong to an Iberian genetic grouping. He says that most people in the British Isles are genetically similar to the Basque people of northern Spain and southwestern France, from 90% in Wales to 66% in East Anglia. Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow – one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe – which occurred just after the Last Glacial Maximum. Bryan Sykes, a former geneticist at Oxford University, came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer, which he set forth in his 2006 book called Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History, published in the United States and Canada as Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland. Many feasible scenarios can be constructed to account for evidence. However, Y-chromosome evidence relies on the archaeological and historical evidence for interpretation, and there is a danger of creating a circular argument. Therefore, scenarios that are not justified by other evidence or are created to account for the historical evidence have not been universally accepted.|$|E

500|$|In 1930, McClintock was {{the first}} person to {{describe}} the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The following year, McClintock and Creighton proved the link between chromosomal crossover during meiosis and the recombination of genetic traits. They observed how the recombination of chromosomes seen under a microscope correlated with new traits. Until this point, it had only been hypothesized that genetic recombination could occur during meiosis, although it had not been shown genetically. McClintock published the first <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9. [...] This information provided necessary data for the crossing-over study she published with Creighton; they also showed that crossing-over occurs in sister chromatids as well as homologous chromosomes. In 1938, she produced a cytogenetic analysis of the centromere, describing the organization and function of the centromere, as well as the fact that it can divide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Comparative genomics, {{through the}} {{integration}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> from species of interest with whole genome sequences of other species, will facilitate the identification of genes affecting phenotypes of interest. The development of microsatellite markers from expressed sequence tags will serve to increase marker densities on current salmonid <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> and initiate in silico comparative maps with species whose genomes have been fully sequenced. Results Eighty-nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were generated for rainbow trout of which at least 74 amplify in other salmonids. Fifty-five {{have been associated with}} functional annotation and 30 were <b>mapped</b> on existing <b>genetic</b> <b>maps.</b> Homologous sequences were identified for 20 of the EST containing microsatellites to identify comparative assignments within the tetraodon, mouse, and/or human genomes.
