RCDs are supposed to disconnect the supply whenever the imbalance current between the live conductor(s) and the neutral conductor, i. e. residual current, exceeds the predetermined value. Such an imbalance is sometimes caused by current leakage through the body of a person who is grounded and accidentally touching the <b>energized</b> <b>part</b> of the circuit, which could result in a lethal shock. However, harmonic components in ground fault current may influence the tripping sensitivity of RCDs, and the protection against electrical shock may not be effective.

With the added second sensor head, the sensed AC voltage will be less sensitive to the medium of the sensing environment and distance between the sensing surface and the probe.

40|$|Abstract: The {{exploitation}} of a power-distribution network involves the scheduling of multiple maintenance and unforeseen repair tasks. The main resource is a network subject to topological, economical and electric constraints. A line section being maintained {{needs to be}} isolated {{from the rest of}} the network by opening all surrounding switches. This, in turn, would leave other areas of the network de-energized, which is unacceptable in most cases. Hence, these areas have to get their supply via some alternative way, i. e., service needs being restored closing switches connecting to an <b>energized</b> <b>part</b> of the network, taking into account overloading of branches, energy losses, and the cost of the necessary switching operations. In case tasks are carried out in the same area, switching operations might be shared among them. In some cases a valid network reconfiguration might not even exist. Finally, typical scheduling constraints have to be met: resources of limited availability (manpower, vehicles, etc.), due dates, priority relations, etc. We present PLANETS, a prototype scheduler based on CHIP, generating nearoptimal schedules for the tasks to be carried out in one week making sure that, at any moment in time, the network is appropriately reconfigured to guarantee power supply to all consumers. The minimization criterion involves lateness, priority and total cost of the necessary switching operations...|$|E
40|$|An Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) is an {{electrical}} device that disconnects protected circuit whenever it detects unbalance current between the phase conductor and the neutral conductor. Such an unbalance is sometimes caused by current leakage {{through the body}} of a person who is grounded when accidentally touching the <b>energized</b> <b>part</b> of the circuit. A lethal shock can result from these conditions. ELCB are designed to disconnect this fault fast enough to mitigate the harm caused by such shocks. Currently, there is no Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) with auto re-closer features in the market. The current ELCB that available in the market is a manual type and cannot differentiate between temporary disturbances and permanent faults. It’s means that, if a disturbance or fault occurs on the protected area (house or shop), the protection system will force ELCB to trip. One of the drawbacks of the common ELCB is that, it’s can’t turn on the power supply back to the normal operation condition although only a short disturbance occurs. Such disturbance is lightning strike on the transmission line in the distribution site near to the protected area. To turn the power back to normal operation, consumers need to do that manually. To overcome this problem, Auto Re-closer Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (AR-ELCB) has been developed. This thesis presents the development of AR-ELCB. This device was designed to differentiate between permanent fault and short disturbances (lightning) ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{dielectric}} withstand test or [...] "high potential" [...] or [...] "hipot" [...] test is an electrical test performed on a component or product {{to determine the}} effectiveness of its insulation. The test may be between mutually insulated sections of a <b>part</b> or <b>energized</b> <b>parts</b> and electrical ground. The test is a means to qualify a device's ability to operate safely during rated electrical conditions. If current through a device under test {{is less than a}} specified limit at the required test potential and time duration, the device meets the {{dielectric withstand}} requirement. A dielectric withstand test may be done as a factory test on new equipment, or may be done on apparatus in service as a routine maintenance test.|$|R

Previously, open switchboards were made with switches and other devices were mounted on panels made of slate, granite, or ebony asbestos board. The metal enclosure of the switchboard is bonded to earth ground for protection of personnel. Large switchboards may be free-standing floor-mounted enclosures with provision for incoming connections at either the top or bottom of the enclosure. A switchboard may have incoming bus bars or bus duct for the source connection, and also for large circuits fed from the board. A switchboard may include a metering or control compartment separated from the power distribution conductors.|$|R
50|$|For medium-power {{transmitters}} up to a several tens of kilowatts, including 50 kW AM and 20 kW FM, {{forced air}} cooling is generally used. At power levels above these some transmitters have the output stage cooled by a forced liquid cooling system analogous to an automobile cooling system. Since the coolant directly touches the high-voltage anodes of the tubes, only distilled, deionised water or a special dielectric coolant {{can be used}} in the cooling circuit. This high-purity coolant is in turn cooled by a heat exchanger, where the second cooling circuit can use water of ordinary quality because it is not in contact with <b>energized</b> <b>parts.</b> Very-high-power tubes of small physical size may use evaporative cooling by water in contact with the anode. The production of steam allows a high heat flow in a small space.|$|R
50|$|Selection of {{appropriate}} PPE, given a certain task to be performed, is normally handled {{in one of}} two possible ways. The first method is to consult a hazard category classification table, like that found in NFPA 70E Table 130.7(C)(15)(a) lists a number of typical electrical tasks by various voltage levels and recommends the category of PPE that should be worn. For example, when working on 600 V switchgear and performing a removal of bolted covers to expose bare, <b>energized</b> <b>parts,</b> the table recommends a Category 3 Protective Clothing System. This Category 3 system corresponds to an ensemble of PPE that together offers protection up to 25 cal/cm² (105 J/cm² or 1.05 MJ/m²). The minimum rating of PPE necessary for any category is the maximum available energy for that category. For example, a Category 3 arc-flash hazard requires PPE rated for no less than 25 cal/cm² (1.05 MJ/m²).|$|R

The commission included the human rights advocate and reformer Elbridge Thomas Gerry, New York lawyer and politician Matthew Hale, and Buffalo dentist and experimenter Alfred P. Southwick.

40|$|In {{the case}} of direct or {{indirect}} contact with electrically <b>energized</b> <b>parts,</b> an electric current circulates through the body. When the magnitude and duration of the current through the heart exceed the ventricular fibrillation thresholds, the cardiac muscle starts uncoordinated contractions, greatly jeopardizing {{the life of the}} subject.

The instant consequence of the introduction of this method is the restriction of curvature; you cannot follow a complex curve again with precision through its furrow. If you are a dextrous plowman, you can drive your plow any number of times along the simple curve. But you cannot repeat again exactly the motions which cut a variable one.[AE] You may retouch it, energize it, and deepen it in parts, but you cannot cut it all through again equally. And the retouching and <b>energizing</b> in <b>parts</b> is a living and intellectual process; but the cutting all through, equally, a mechanical one. The difference is exactly such as that between the dexterity of turning out two similar moldings from a lathe, and carving them with the free hand, like a Pisan sculptor.

Dynamics of Energized Harmonic Molecules: The {{classical}} equations {{of motion}} of some bent triatomic harmonic molecular models are integrated numerically to investigate the assumptions underlying contemporary theories of unimolecular reaction rates. The small vibration and weak coupling approximations are shown to be inadequate for energies near dissociation, but reaction frequencies, based upon a modification of the former approximation, are seen {{to be in good}} agreement with the model's actual reaction frequencies. The effects of rotation upon intramolecular energy exchange are shown to be non-negligible. The effects of bond anharmonicity were not included in this paper. Part II. Dynamics of Energized Anharmonic Molecules: The classical {{equations of motion}} of two anharmonic bent triatomic molecular models are integrated numerically. It is found that at dissociative energies, the intramolecular energy transfer rate is the frequency with which any two bonds compress. The normal mode description of the motion is observed to be entirely inadequate. Molecular lifetimes are shown to be unstable to small perturbations in the initial conditions for the molecular trajectory. This instability may imply gross differences in the classical and quantal lifetimes of <b>energized</b> molecules. <b>Part</b> III.

40|$|Distributed {{generation}} (DG) with {{a converter}} interface to the grid {{is found in}} many of the green power resources applications. In this thesis, the control of a voltage source converter (VSC), as the DG front end, is in focus regarding the power quality problems that could appear at the connection point. The aims have been set to maintain a stable operation of the DG, in case of network disturbances, and to react in a corrective way during different grid operating conditions (e. g. in case of voltage dips). For this purpose, vector current controllers have been implemented with two different line filters; namely an inductance filter (L-filter) and an inductance-capacitance-inductance filter (LCL-filter). The controllers have incorporated: one sample time delay compensation, limitation of the reference voltage to avoid saturation, an integrator anti-windup, a DC-link voltage controller, a PCC voltage regulator, and an islanding detection algorithm. The ride-through capability of the DG has been examined against a variety of possible voltage dips that could appear at the connection point. Moreover, the capability of the DG to compensate for the voltage at the connection point has been studied. Finally, the intentional islanding has been considered, where the DG is allowed to <b>energize</b> a <b>part</b> of the grid in case of the utility outage forming what is called an island. The results found are that the effect of unbalanced voltage dips on the DC-link voltage ripple is minimized if the oscillating powers, produced during that period, are supplied by the grid side instead of the DC-side. Moreover, design equations have been derived in order to calculate the maximum currents that would flow through the VSC valves during voltage dips. These equations are to be used in designing VSC’s with voltage dips ride-through capability. In addition, a neural-network based PLL, which extracts the phase angle of the fundamental component of the grid voltage, has been introduced in order to provide better performance in case of a DG with voltage compensation capability. Finally, combining the voltage regulator with the estimated frequency as a measure for islanding condition has, in this work, been found as an appropriate practice, to detect islanding, {{especially in the case of}} weak grids...|$|R
