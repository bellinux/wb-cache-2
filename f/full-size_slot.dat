[...] Based directly on the Ford Expedition, introduced the year before, the Navigator gave the Lincoln-Mercury its first <b>full-size</b> SUV (<b>slotted</b> above the Mercury Mountaineer, based upon the Ford Explorer).|$|R
5000|$|After a 29-year absence, the Mercury Montego {{nameplate}} was revived for the 2005 model year, {{shifting to}} a <b>full-size</b> sedan. <b>Slotted</b> in size between the Mercury Milan and the Mercury Grand Marquis, the 2005 Montego was the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Five Hundred. For the 2008 model year, the Montego adopted the nameplate {{of the car}} it had replaced, becoming the final generation of the Mercury Sable.|$|R
50|$|A small-form-factor {{case that}} is 67% {{smaller than the}} XPS 410. It does not use <b>full-size</b> PCI <b>slots.</b> The XPS 200 is aimed at being a low-impact machine, meaning it blends in better with the room's features. It {{is more of a}} {{multimedia}} computer than an actual gaming machine, despite the XPS name. The main difference between the XPS 210 and its predecessor, the XPS 200, is the upgrade to the Intel Core 2 Duo processor line. This makes the XPS 210 faster than the XPS 200.|$|R
5000|$|The Mercury Marquis was {{introduced}} for the 1967 model year {{as part of}} the <b>full-size</b> Mercury lineup. <b>Slotted</b> above the Mercury Monterey and Montclair, the Marquis was positioned alongside the Park Lane in the lineup. Roughly the division's counterpart to the Ford LTD introduced in 1965, the Marquis differed from the LTD with plusher interior trim and a higher level of standard equipment. Unlike the Ford, for 1967 and 1968 the Marquis was produced in a single two-door hardtop body style; convertibles and Marauder fastbacks remained part of the Park Lane lineup. All four-door hardtop models were Park Lane Broughams [...]|$|R
50|$|Surface Book is {{a first-time}} Surface-family 2-in-1 {{to be shipped}} with a keyboard. Contrary to a Type Cover {{optional}} keyboard accessory of other Surface tablets, Surface Book's keyboard is a thick and sturdy part, capable of folding back behind the display. It contains two USB 3.0 ports, <b>full-size</b> SD card <b>slot</b> on the left, Mini DisplayPort and SurfaceConnect port on the right, has an integrated additional battery and an optional Nvidia discrete GPU with 1 GB of video memory. It {{can be used for}} non-demanding tasks such as web browsing without the connected keyboard part, and when laptop convenience, extended connectivity, performance, and battery life are needed — with the keyboard attached.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. This study mainly focuses on parametric investigation of ceiling-slot ventilated enclosures for determining the airflow and thermal characteristics. In the analyses, the container cross-sectional area is kept constant. However, the container length assumes values of 6. 13 m, 8. 33 m, and 13. 3 m, and the aspect ratio of the container varies accordingly. Besides, the effect of injection slot width on the flow distribution is also studied by taking two different slot widths at a particular aspect ratio. The air velocity at the slot exit is varied {{in such a way}} that the Reynolds number of injection is in the range of 20 and 2 x 10 ^ 5. The numerical analyses are carried out by using ANSYS-FLUENT software which is based on control volume approach. Reynolds Stress Model is applied for modeling the 3 D turbulent flow inside the enclosure. In discretization of convective terms, QUICK scheme is adopted, and SIMPLE algorithm is applied for solution of momentum and continuity equations. For evaluating the turbulent stresses near the wall, “log-law” function is used. In heat transfer analysis, for the top, lateral and rear surfaces of the container, the combine effect of solar radiation, convection and surface emission is simultaneously considered. In doing so, 3 D flow of air around the truck surface, and the related heat transfer problem is studied by generating thirty-two million of non-uniform grids around the truck. To capture the velocity, pressure and temperature gradients along the boundary layer, special type grids are generated in regions close to the solid surface. Convergence criteria for all flow and temperature parameters are taken to be 10 - 5. For flows with Re> 200, if the container aspect ratio is H/L< 0. 2, the flow separates from the upper surface of the container at a length ratio of z/L. ≈ 0. 85 Otherwise a cone-like vertical vortex occurs and causes uneven flow distribution in the container. The thermal performance of ventilation in the container is measured by a non-dimensional temperature distribution, θx at a particular cross-section. Generally, uniformity in temperature is provided at high Reynolds numbers. However, for 02 H/L. <, temperature disturbance takes place at the rare surface and can be avoided by <b>full-size</b> injection <b>slot.</b> dc 201...|$|R
