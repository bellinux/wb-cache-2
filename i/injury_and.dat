50|$|Tracking <b>and</b> {{investigating}} workplace <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> illnesses play {{an important}} role in preventing future <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> illnesses. Under OSHA’s Recordkeeping regulation, certain covered employers in high hazard industries are required to prepare and maintain records of serious occupational <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> illnesses. This information is important for employers, workers and OSHA in evaluating the safety of a workplace, understanding industry hazards, and implementing worker protections to reduce and eliminate hazards.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} three decades of life, more {{individuals}} in the USA die from <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> violence than from any other cause. Millions more people survive and are left with physical, emotional, <b>and</b> financial problems. <b>Injuries</b> <b>and</b> violence are not accidents; they are preventable. Prevention has a strong scientific foundation, yet efforts are not fully implemented or integrated into clinical and community settings. In this Series paper, we review the burden of <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> violence in the USA, note effective interventions, and discuss methods to bring interventions into practice. Alliances between the public health community and medical care organisations, health-care providers, states, and communities can reduce <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> violence. We encourage partnerships between medical and public health communities to consistently frame <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> violence as preventable, identify evidence-based interventions, provide scientific information to decision makers, and strengthen the capacity of an integrated health system to prevent <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> violence.

5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain <b>injury</b> <b>and</b> has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head <b>injury</b> <b>and</b> the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Queens Boulevard Weinshall's DOT made {{efforts to}} reduce {{pedestrian}} <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> fatalities on New York City's most dangerous street.

Longer shifts are also associated with more <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> accidents: 10-hour shifts had 13% more and 12-hour shifts had 28% more than 8-hour shifts. Other studies have showed a link between fatigue <b>and</b> workplace <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> accidents.

5|$|All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to recover from <b>injury</b> <b>and</b> to reproduce asexually.
