40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> {{ventilation}} is {{a common}} mode of ventilation used to manage both adult and pediatric populations. However, {{there is very little}} evidence that distinguishes the efficacy of <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation over that of volume controlled ventilation in the adult population. This gap in the literature {{may be due to the}} absence of a consistent and systematic algorithm for managing <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation. This article provides a brief overview of the applications of both <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation and volume controlled ventilation and proposes an algorithmic approach to the management of patients receiving <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation. This algorithmic approach highlights the need for clinicians to have a comprehensive conceptual understanding of mechanical ventilation, pulmonary physiology, and interpretation of ventilator graphics in order to best care for patients receiving <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation. The objective of identifying a systematic approach to managing <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation is to provide a more generalizable and equitable approach to management of the ICU patient. Ideally, a consistent approach to managing <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation in the adult population will glean more reliable information regarding actual patient outcomes, as well as the efficacy of <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation when compared to volume controlled ventilation...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{processing}} {{has been}} limited {{by the lack of}} <b>direct</b> flow and <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> of the polymer melt at multiple points in space and time. Improved axial and radial valve designs are discussed that require negligible actuation force to control the flow of the pressurized melt. The forces resulting from pressure loads and shear stresses are first analyzed for an axial valve pin. Subsequently, a radial valve design is implemented and experimentally characterized using neat polycarbonate. A sigmoidal response surface is fit to the experimental data and found to very well model the observed pressure drop as a function of flow rate and valve pin position. The juncture loss at the valve port is then characterized by estimating and removing the pressure drops in the circular flow segments of the valve. Analysis indicated that the juncture loss is inversely proportional to the exposed area, or vesica piscis, formed between the circular flow channel in the valve body and the flow port on the moving valve pin. While applicable to many different polymer processing operations, the validated models are used to show the dynamic valve pin position {{as a function of the}} desired flow rate and desired cavity pressure in the hot runner of an injection mold. Finally, the impact of the designs on lower power, more compact mechanical and control system designs are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the 'high-normal blood pressure' as a risk factor of hypertension for applying primary prevention strategy in Korean people. To keep time sequence of events, and to prevent information bias, nested case control study was chosen for avoiding measurement errors because hypertension is a benign disease. Source population consisted of the 'Seoul Cohort' participants and follow-up was done by using Korea Medical Insurance Corporation's database on the utilization of health services from January 1, 1993 to June 30, 1997. Incidence cases were ascertained through the chart review, telephone contacts, and <b>direct</b> blood <b>pressure</b> measurements. <b>Controls</b> included the pairing of 4 individuals to each case on the basis of age. The statistically significant risk factors of hypertension were body mass index, dietary fiber, alcohol consumption, weekly activity, and history of quitting smoking as well as high-normal blood pressure (p< 0. 05). The multivariate odds ratio of high-normal blood pressure adjusted for all risk factors was 1. 84 (95 % CI, 1. 31 - 2. 56). Thus, the 'high-normal blood pressure' is considered as a risk factor for hypertension in Korean middle-aged men, which suggests that the vigorous lifestyle modification for persons with 'high-normal blood pressure' is needed...|$|R

The goal of this research is the derivation of the approximation concept for evaluation of the efficiency improvement potential applying the proportional <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> for variable speed pumps in water supply. The proportional <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> has been compared with the constant <b>pressure</b> <b>control.</b> For this reason, the energy calculation analyses have been made for certain pumps.

Based on the average possible linear declination of the pump proportional <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> curve (15 %) and the average water leakage in network (24 %) in Latvia, the conclusions are as follows: 1) 12. 2 % of annually consumed electrical energy may be saved up in water supply systems applying the proportional <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> is used instead of the constant pressure control; 2) The annual reduction of the existing water leakage rate may reach 3. 7 % in water supply networks...|$|R

50|$|A {{clinical}} {{control group}} {{can be a}} placebo arm or it can involve an old method used to address a clinical outcome when testing a new idea. For example in a study released by the British Medical Journal, in 1995 studying the effects of strict blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> versus more relaxed blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> in diabetic patients, the clinical control group was the diabetic patients that did not receive tight blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control.</b> In order {{to qualify for the}} study, the patients had to meet the inclusion criteria and not match the exclusion criteria. Once the study population was determined, the patients were placed in either the experimental group (strict blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <150/80mmHg) versus non strict blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> (<180/110). There were a wide variety of ending points for patients such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, etc. The study was stopped before completion because strict blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> was so much superior to the clinical control group which had relaxed blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control.</b> The study was no longer considered ethical because tight blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> was so much more effective at preventing end points that the clinical control group had to be discontinued. The clinical control group is not always a placebo group. Sometimes the clinical control group can involve comparing a new drug to an older drug in a superiority trial. In a superiority trial, the clinical control group is the older medication rather than the new medication. For example in the ALLHAT trial, Thiazide diuretics were demonstrated to be superior to calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular events in high risk patients with hypertension. In the ALLHAT study, the clinical control group was not a placebo it was ACEI or Calcium Channel Blockers.Overall, clinical control groups can either be a placebo or an old standard of therapy.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{investigated}} the prognostic impact of 24 -h blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> in treated hypertensive subjects. BackgroundThere is growing evidence that ambulatory blood pressure improves risk stratification in untreated subjects with essential hypertension. Surprisingly, {{little is known}} on the prognostic value of this procedure in treated subjects. MethodsDiagnostic procedures including 24 -h noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were undertaken in 790 subjects with essential hypertension (mean age 48 years) before therapy and after an average follow-up of 3. 7 years (2, 891 patient-years). ResultsAt the follow-up visit, 26. 6 % of subjects achieved adequate office blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> (< 140 / 90 mm Hg), and 37. 3 % of subjects achieved adequate ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> (daytime blood <b>pressure</b> < 135 / 85 mm Hg). Months or years after the follow-up visit, 58 patients suffered a first cardiovascular event. Event rate was lower (0. 71 events/ 100 person-years) among the subjects with adequate ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> than among those with higher blood pressure levels (1. 87 events/ 100 person-years) (p = 0. 0026). Ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> predicted a lesser risk for subsequent cardiovascular disease independently of other individual risk factors (RR 0. 36; 95 % confidence intervals: 0. 18 to 0. 70; p = 0. 003), including age, diabetes and left ventricular hypertrophy.
