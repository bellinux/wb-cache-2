5000|$|The Forum had a {{rectangular}} plan with sides 250 m and 300 m long.

According to others, the square should be located south-southeast of the Ottoman Murat Pasha Mosque. In the Byzantine Age, the square was surrounded by porticoes adorned with bas-reliefs and niches with statues. Particularly noteworthy among them was a group representing Constantine the Great and his mother Helena holding their hands on a <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> <b>silver</b> cross, a composition that became very popular in Byzantine art.|$|E

40|$|Absorbing {{power of}} various {{materials}} of wave-lengths greater than 50 μ—For blackening a receiver of a thermocouple for radiation for obtaining pure rotation band spectra, {{it is desirable}} to use a material that is an efficient absorber of the extreme infra-red but a poor absorber of radiation of shorter wave-lengths. The absorbing power of 25 materials were tested for radiation of wave-lengths near 4 μ and greater than 50 μ. Of all the materials tested, white lead, litharge, red phosphorus, powdered glass, copper sulphide, and celestite were found the best for covering a receiver to absorb the extreme infa-red radiation. The 25 materials were tested by painting them on a receiver of a thermocouple which was exposed to extreme infra-red radiation. The same receiver and thermocouple were used throughout the experiment. A D'Arsonval type galvanometer was improved by using a quartz suspension and replacing each conducting lead with silver leaf or <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> <b>silver</b> ribbon 1 μ thick wound in a spiral...|$|E
40|$|A {{chasuble}} {{from the}} textile {{collection of the}} Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga underwent a laboratorial study prior to the conservation treatment. The analyses gave vegetable fibres for the support layers used in the embroidered strips (orphreys), in the applied embroidered figures, in the volume in-filling threads of those applied embroidered figures, and the intermediate linning support layer. The patterned silk, the back linning, and the embroidery threads of the orphreys are made of ungummed silk. Through X-ray fluorescence spectrometry {{the main component of}} the metallic embroidery threads was found to be silver, although other metals were also detected. These results together with the observations made using a metallographic microscope and a scanning electron microscope suggest that the golden threads should be <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> <b>silver,</b> which was commonly used between the 15 th and 17 th Centuries. This paper also presents a description of the condition survey and treatment intervention, which includes the application of a nylon support as a consolidation method on the embroidered figures, opposed to the traditional method, which was thought to be inadequate for the present case...|$|E
40|$|A <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> <b>silver</b> reliquary of St. Demetrius {{has been}} found {{recently}} {{in the region of}} Veliko Tarnovo. It is a rectangular box with measurements 4. 8 x 4. 2 x 1. 00 cm. On the both sides are St. Demetrius and St. Procopius. They are circled with devoted inscriptions in Greek. They begin and end with a cross. The inscription around St. Demetrius says: +ΦΡΟΥΡΟΝ CΟΥ ΜΥ/ΡΟΝ ΠΗCΤΗΝ ЄΧΟΝ ΚЄ ΠΟΘΟΝ CΥΜЄΟΝ ΑΘΟς+ ("I keep your unction, I have the faith and the will of Simeon, Athos"). That's how the name of the guarantee of the relic is known - Simeon from Athos. At this stage of examinations we have a vague result considering his person; probably he has been a high-standing person from the ecclesiastical hierarchy, associated with someone from the Mount Athos. On the other side, round the image of St. Procopius is written: +ΔΟΜΗC Α(Υ) ΤΟCΥ ΔΗΜΗΤΡΗЄ ("I am your shelter, Demetrius") and +ΜЄΓΗCΤЄCΥΝ ΠΡΟΚΟΠΗΟ ("Most glorious Procopius"). The inscriptions repeat other formulae, known from other precious reliquary of St. Demetrius from XII and XIII-XIV cc. The composition of the present relic reminds largely to a two-sided icon of the saints George and Theodore Stratelates from the village of Dolishte, the region of Varna. The last one dates back to second half of XIII c. or the first decades of XIV c. The examined reliquary with the images of St. Demetrius and St. Procopius has been made with more technological and artistic skills and it is very likely {{to be used as a}} model for making the small icon of the village of Dolishte. The iconographical and stylistic patterns for the images of the saints soldiers on the reliquary, found in the region of Elena, we can find amongst the ivory triptych of Constantinople, the steatite icons and the metallic matrixes and models as some Byzantine arts, influenced by the Late Romance art. Definitely the newfound reliquary is from Thessaloniki and it could be gone back to the first half of XII c. or whit in the beginning of XIII c...|$|E

50|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>plating</b> of <b>silver</b> {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of jewelry. Like copper, silver atoms diffuse into the gold layer, causing slow gradual fading of its color and eventually causing tarnishing of the surface. This process may take months and even years, depending on the thickness of the gold layer. A barrier metal layer is used to counter this effect. Copper, which also migrates into gold, does so more slowly than silver. The copper is usually further plated with nickel. A gold-plated silver article is usually a silver substrate with layers of copper, nickel, and gold deposited on top of it.|$|R
