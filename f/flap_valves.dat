40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out in 15 normal {{subjects}} and 14 patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence to test whether a rectoanal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> could be responsible for maintaining faecal continence in man. Intraluminal pressures were recorded from the rectum and from three sites in the anal canal during serial increases in intra-abdominal pressure, produced by forced expiration into a sphygmomanometer keeping {{the height of the}} column of mercury at prescribed levels. The anal pressures in the normal volunteers always remained higher than the intrarectal pressures even when these were as high as 230 cm H 2 O. This pressure gradient was the reverse of that which would be found if an anterior rectal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> maintained continence and suggests instead that continence is normally maintained by a reflex contraction of the external anal sphincter. The anal pressures in patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence, however, fell below the rectal pressure as the intra-abdominal pressure increased, creating the conditions for a <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve was incompetent, however, because fluid infused into the rectum leaked from the anus whenever the rectal pressure exceeded the anal pressure...|$|R

5000|$|Attempts at man-powered flight still persisted. Paucton's {{rotorcraft}} was man-powered, {{while another}} approach, also originally studied by da Vinci, {{was the use}} of <b>flap</b> <b>valves.</b> The flap valve is a simple hinged flap over a hole in the wing. In one direction it opens to allow air through and in the other it closes to allow an increased pressure difference. An early example was designed by Bauer in 1764. Later in 1808, Jacob Degen built an ornithopter with <b>flap</b> <b>valves,</b> in which the pilot stood on a rigid frame and worked the wings with a movable horizontal bar. His 1809 attempt at flight failed, so he then added a small hydrogen balloon and the combination achieved some short hops. Popular illustrations of the day depicted his machine without the balloon, leading to confusion as to what had actually flown. In 1811, Albrecht Berblinger built an ornithopter based on Degen's design but omitted the balloon, plunging instead into the Danube. The fiasco did have an upside: George Cayley, also taken in by the illustrations, was spurred to publish his findings to date [...] "for the sake of giving a little more dignity to a subject bordering upon the ludicrous in public estimation", and the modern era of aviation was born.|$|E
5000|$|Grazing marshes {{were created}} from Medieval times by {{building}} sea walls (earth banks) across tidal mudflats and salt marsh to make polders (though the term [...] "polder" [...] is little used in Britain). Polders in Britain are mostly drained by gravity, rather than active pumping. The original tidal drainage channels were augmented by new ditches, and <b>flap</b> <b>valves</b> {{in the sea}} walls let water drain out at low tide and prevent the sea or tidal river from entering at high tide. Constructing polders {{in this way is}} called inning or reclaiming from the sea.|$|E

The design is not yet wholly modern, incorporating as it does two pilot-operated paddles or oars which appear to work as <b>flap</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E

Double dump valves are used to discharge a flow of material {{while at the same}} time serving as an airlock transition point to preserve the pressure differential above and below the valve. This type of material handling valve is ideal for use with bulky or abrasive materials that would tend to jam or damage a rotary feeder.|$|E

50|$|The Magdeburg hemispheres are a pair {{of large}} copper hemispheres, with mating rims. They were used to {{demonstrate}} the power of atmospheric pressure. When the rims were sealed with grease {{and the air was}} pumped out, the sphere contained a vacuum and could not be pulled apart by teams of horses. The Magdeburg hemispheres were designed by a German scientist and mayor of Magdeburg, Otto von Guericke, to demonstrate the air pump that he had invented, and the concept of atmospheric pressure. The first artificial vacuum had been produced a few years earlier by Evangelista Torricelli, and had inspired Guericke to design the world's first vacuum pump, which consisted of a piston and cylinder with one-way <b>flap</b> <b>valves.</b> The hemispheres became popular in physics lectures as an illustration of the strength of air pressure, and are still used in education.

40|$|A small angle (His angle) {{between the}} {{oesophagus}} and the fundus {{of the stomach}} is considered to act as <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> and anti-reflux barrier. A wide angle results in dysfunction of the oesophagogastric junction and subsequently in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Here, we used real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 50 [*]ms resolution (20 frames per second) in 12 volunteers and 12 patients with GERD to assess transport of pineapple juice through the oesophagogastric junction and reflux during Valsalva. We found that the intra-abdominal part of the oesophagus was bended towards the left side resulting in an angle of 75. 3 [*]Â±[*] 17. 4, which was significantly larger during Valsava (P[*]=[*] 0. 017). Reflux and several underlying pathologies were detected in 11 out of 12 patients. Our data visualize oesophagogastric junction physiology and disprove the <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> hypothesis.

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: The {{pathogenesis}} of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is multifactorial, including the mechanical anti-reflux barrier of the gastroesophageal junction. This barrier can be evaluated endoscopically in two ways: {{by measuring the}} axial length of any hiatal hernia present or by assessing the gastroesophageal <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b> The endoscopic measurement of axial length is troublesome because of the physiological dynamics in the area. Grading the gastroesophageal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> is easier and has proven reproducible. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the two endoscopic grading methods with regard to associations with GERD. Patients and methods: Population-based subjects underwent endoscopic examination assessing the axial length of hiatus hernia, the gastroesophageal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> using the Hill classification, esophagitis using the Los Angeles (LA) classification, and columnar metaplasia using the Z-line appearance (ZAP) classification. Biopsies were taken from the squamocolumnar junction to assess the presence of intestinal metaplasia. Symptoms were recorded with the validated Abdominal Symptom Questionnaire. GERD was defined according to the Montreal definition. Results: In total, 334 subjects were included in the study and underwent endoscopy; 86 subjects suffered from GERD and 211 presented no symptoms or signs of GERD. Based on logistic regression, the estimated area under the curve statistic (AUC) for Hill (0. 65 [95 % CI 0. 59 - 0. 72]) was higher than the corresponding estimate for the axial length of a hiatal hernia (0. 61 [95 % CI 0. 54 - 0. 68]), although the difference was not statistically significant (P= 0. 225). Conclusion: From our data, and in terms of association with GERD, the Hill classification was slightly stronger compared to the axial length of a hiatal hernia, but we could not verify that the Hill classification was superior as a predictor. The Hill classification may replace the axial length of a hiatal hernia in the endoscopic assessment of the mechanical anti-reflux barrier of the gastroesophageal junction...|$|R
