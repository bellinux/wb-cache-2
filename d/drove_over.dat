5|$|Well-executed {{evacuations}} and warnings {{limited the}} death toll to six, while damage amounted to $305.8million (1998USD, $409.8million 2009USD). In addition to the six human lives lost, 497 heads of cattle and 21,387 chickens were killed. All six human deaths were indirectly related to Georges; the first death occurred when an 61-year-old woman stepped on a downed wire and was electrocuted; the second occurred when a 56-year-old man <b>drove</b> <b>over</b> another downed wire on his motorcycle and was electrocuted.|$|E
5|$|At Survivor Series, Kane {{tried to}} get Edge to bring Paul Bearer out to them but Edge brought out an empty wheelchair. Kane tried to {{interrogate}} Edge during their fight but in the end, Edge unknowingly double pinned his rival, keeping Kane as World Heavyweight Champion before wheeling Kane into a barricade. On November 26, Edge was offered {{a chance at a}} rematch with Kane for the title if we would let Bearer go free. But Edge did not keep his word. At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane outside and <b>drove</b> <b>over</b> a dummy of Paul Bearer before driving off with the real one again.|$|E

During practice for the Indianapolis 500, he <b>drove</b> <b>over</b> a piece of debris after Paul Dana's second-turn crash and flipped over. Two days later Hornish qualified in second place, crashing out after leading for a race-high 77 laps and finishing 23rd. At the Milwaukee Mile he qualified for the pole position and led for 123 of 225 laps, passing Dario Franchitti with nine laps left for his second win of the season. Hornish {{finished third in the}} championship standings, with 512 points.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2015, The Nation reported, [...] "The {{fallout from}} the Edward Snowden fiasco wasn't just political—it was largely economic. Soon after {{the extent of the}} NSA's data {{collection}} became public, overseas customers (including the Brazilian government) started abandoning U.S.-based tech companies in <b>droves</b> <b>over</b> privacy concerns. The dust hasn't settled yet, but tech-research firm Forrester estimated the losses may total 'as high as $180 billion,' or 25 percent of industry revenue." ...|$|R
5|$|Michael Bree's first {{victim was}} Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict {{whom he met}} at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He {{is thought to have}} strangled her before setting her body on fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and <b>drove</b> <b>over</b> the body. Then, as he drove home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out.|$|E
5|$|During {{the yellow}} flag period, some cars elected to make pit stops, and Ricardo González spun the No. 43 RGR Sport Ligier. The No. 7 Audi rejoined the race after repairs to its floor which was damaged {{when the car}} <b>drove</b> <b>over</b> a kerb and its ducts {{required}} cleaning after rubber picked up from the circuit caused the vehicle to overheat. The entry rejoined in 15th place overall. The race restarted 12 minutes later with Davidson leading the field, ahead of the No. 8 Audi. Kobayashi immediately got ahead of Dumas to move into third position. Manor's No. 31 entry driven by Richard Bradley overtook the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports car of Chris Cumming at Eau Rouge for fourth place in LMP2. Nathanaël Berthon's No. 26 vehicle had its left-rear tyre punctured following contact with Abu Dhabi Proton's No. 88 Porsche at La Source, while Andy Priaulx in the No. 67 Ford passed Dempsey-Proton's No. 77 car for fifth place in LMGTE Pro. Berthon went off the track at the Bus Stop chicane while attempting to drive into the pit lane.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{began on}} the front straightaway as the field headed into turn one. Wade Cunningham, Wheldon's teammate in the No. 17 Dallara, clipped James Hinchcliffe, driving the No. 06 Dallara, and then made contact with J. R. Hildebrand in the No. 4 Dallara. Then Cunningham swerved and Hildebrand <b>drove</b> <b>over</b> the rear of his car, causing his to go airborne. Cunningham collected Jay Howard in the No. 15 Dallara {{on the inside and}} then Townsend Bell in the No. 22 Dallara on the outside before colliding with the retaining wall. Attempting to avoid the crash ahead, Vitor Meira lost control of his No. 14 Dallara and spun inward, collecting both Charlie Kimball's No. 83 Dallara and E. J. Viso's No. 59 Dallara. Tomas Scheckter, in the No. 57 Dallara, was also attempting to avoid the crash by rapidly slowing down on the outside. Following that, Paul Tracy ran into the back of his car with his No. 8 Motegi Wheels Dallara and Pippa Mann, rapidly approaching in the No. 30 Dallara, went over the top of him after jerking to the outside to avoid crashing into Alex Lloyd in the No. 19 Dallara.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>droving</b> <b>over</b> a {{significant}} distance occurred in 1836 when 300 cattle were moved by Joseph Hawdon in 26 {{days from the}} Murrumbidgee River to Melbourne, {{a distance of about}} 480 km. As droving skills were developed, more and more challenging assignments were undertaken. In 1863, boss drover George Gregory drove 8,000 sheep from near Rockhampton to the Northern Territory border, some 2,100 km, taking seven months. Robert Christison overlanded 7,000 sheep from Queensland to Adelaide, a distance of 2,500 km, in the early 1870s.|$|R

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The first practice session was initially held in wet-weather conditions before less rain fell and drivers were required to adapt to changing levels of grip. Full wet tyres {{were used in the}} session's opening period before the field utilised intermediate tyres in its closing minutes. The conditions prevented the teams from collecting data on how the dry-compound tyres would perform. Adrian Sutil was the fastest driver with a time of 1:25.701 seconds, ahead of Massa who spun several times and had the fastest time until Sutil's lap. Jenson Button was third-fastest despite complaining about his car's handling, ahead of Rubens Barrichello (who spun at high-speed at turn three after driving into a large amount of standing water) and Vitaly Petrov. Rosberg and Sébastien Buemi were sixth and seventh-fastest. Nico Hülkenberg, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Pedro de la Rosa rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. Hamilton <b>drove</b> <b>over</b> standing water at the exit of the turn three left-hander twenty minutes before the session ended and slid sideways into the turn four tyre barrier, heavily damaging his car.|$|E
5|$|De la Rosa and Irvine {{qualified}} in {{ninth and}} eleventh positions respectively for Jaguar; the pair {{were separated by}} Trulli in the Jordan who's engine failed on his third run {{and was unable to}} return to the pit lane to use his team's spare car. The three drivers were ahead of Villeneuve in the faster of the two BAR cars, who in turn, qualified in front of teammate Panis; both drivers struggled to find grip throughout the one-hour period. Alesi qualified in 14th position, more than four tenths of a second in front of Prost teammate Luciano Burti; the latter spun off in the circuit's stadium section which caused a yellow flag to be shown. The two were split by Zonta in the slower Jordan car who <b>drove</b> <b>over</b> a kerb at the Senna chicane on his third run of the session which lost him time and he encountered slower cars. The Benetton cars filled the ninth row of the grid with Fisichella 17th and Button 18th; the latter's car had its gearbox changed and pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a failed engine. Behind them, the Arrows drivers managed to qualify in 18th and 19th; Enrique Bernoldi qualifying ahead of Jos Verstappen. Bernoldi improved his car's handling although his potential best run was disrupted because of Button's engine failure and Verstappen spun on his final timed lap. The starting order was completed by Fernando Alonso and Tarso Marques in the Minardi cars.|$|E
5|$|Maricello's super soft tyres {{began to}} degrade quickly, {{allowing}} Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer {{over the next}} two laps. Rossi caught Maricello by the start of the sixth lap but the latter remained on the circuit. King, who was delayed by a long queue of vehicles behind him, was the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and rejoined the track in clear air. On lap eight, Matsushita collided heavily with de Jong at the Novelle chicane, causing him to retire and was later penalised with a three-place grid penalty for the sprint race after the stewards judged him to have missed the corner's braking point. De Jong was able to continue. Marciello made his pit stop for new tyres on the next lap, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to move into the first and second places and both drivers built an advantage over the remainder of the field. Maricello rejoined in eleventh, behind Pic, who made his pit stop one lap later. Sørensen was placed into the Casino Hairpin barriers at the apex of the corner by Nato on lap ten, ending his race. Nato was issued with a ten-second time penalty, but no safety car was deployed. Marvelov retired from the race in the pit lane with damage to his car after running off the circuit, and <b>drove</b> <b>over</b> a kerb exiting the left-hand Louis Chiron corner, causing him to become airborne, and hit the barriers lining the track.|$|E
50|$|In 1944, a nightwatch {{was begun}} in Bärenbach to warn of any {{impending}} airstrikes. Rooms {{were set up}} for the watchmen at the Party house. Early on 30 January 1944, Allied aircraft flew in <b>droves</b> <b>over</b> Bärenbach. German fighters were sent to defend against them. It was not quite 11 o’clock in the morning when the sound of the aircraft’s guns burst out overhead. One plane was shot down in the exchange; the German fighter pilot crashed between Bärenbach and Würrich and was badly wounded, dying a short while later.|$|R

50|$|The two motors were {{mounted in}} half height in the {{locomotive}} frame. Those two motors <b>drove</b> big cogwheels <b>over</b> sprockets spring-loaded on both sides. Each {{of those big}} cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The two jackshafts drove a shared slit coupling rod which <b>drove</b> - <b>over</b> a vertical crosshead - the crank pin of the center drive-axle. Side rods connected to the slit coupling rod transmitted the force to the outer drive-wheels.This drive concept was later used at the Ae 3/6 II.|$|R
