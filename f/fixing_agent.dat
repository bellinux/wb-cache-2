40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} a finite population of boundedly rational agents whose preferences differ. The interaction level among agents {{allows us to}} partition the population into local networks. In each local network, there exists a <b>fixed</b> <b>agent,</b> as defined by Glaeser and al. [8], who shares, directly or indirectly, her information with all agents within the local network. Time is discrete and in each period agents are paired to play a {{battle of the sexes}} game. We show that in the short run, all <b>fixed</b> <b>agent</b> plays a particular strategy, but only neighboring <b>fixed</b> <b>agents</b> need to coordinate on the same strategy. In the long run however, all <b>fixed</b> <b>agents</b> coordinate on the same strategy, leading to a uniform convention, as defined by Young [22]. Our main result shows that location leads to information access and distribution which in turn leads to coordination. In particular, it shows that the outcome that prevails in a population of heterogeneous agents facing asymmetric information is decided by those agents who share the most widely their information. 1 Location, Information and Coordination...|$|R

This was particularly pronounced {{in the area of}} the sky, obscuring many fine details and altering this area's colouring. Once these layers were removed, it was discovered that the original grey-blue sky had been repainted with broad strokes of a deep blue dye mixed with a <b>fixing</b> <b>agent.</b> An analysis of the blue pigments in the painting showed that the original blue colour, still discernible as a bright line above the horizon, was composed of azurite, while the blue pigment in more superficial layers was true ultramarine or lapis lazuli.

Additional alteration of the painting is well attested in parish accounts; the painting was [...] "varnished and somewhat restored" [...] by the painter Aline Bernard (1841–1910) in 1885, and a second time in 1907 by a Nils Janzon.

We have proposed two types of transactions namely trusted and non trusted transactions. Non trusted transaction can be allowed to execute without authentication.

50|$|Albumen {{is both a}} {{thickening}} and a <b>fixing</b> <b>agent</b> for insoluble pigments. Chrome yellow, the ochres, vermilion and ultramarine {{are such}} pigments. Albumen is always dissolved in the cold, a process that takes several days when large quantities are required. Egg albumen is expensive and only used for the lightest shades. Blood albumen solution is used in cases when very dark colours are required to be absolutely fast to washing. After printing, albumen thickened colours are exposed to hot steam, which coagulates the albumen and effectually fixes the colours.|$|E

50|$|Edwin Land's {{original}} idea behind instant photography {{was to create}} a photographic system that was seamless and easy for anyone to use. The first roll film cameras required the photographer to use a light meter to take a reading of the light level, then to set the exposure setting on the lens. Then the lens was focused and the subject framed and the picture was taken. The photographer flipped a switch and pulled the large tab {{in the back of the}} camera to pull the negative over the positive, through some rollers to spread the developing agent. After the picture developed inside the camera for the required time, the photographer opened the small door in the camera back and peeled the positive from the negative. To prevent fading, the black and white positive had to be coated with a <b>fixing</b> <b>agent,</b> a potentially messy procedure which led to the development of coaterless instant pack film.|$|E
