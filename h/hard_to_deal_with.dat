5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with,</b> but she loved the scenery.|$|E

500|$|The {{deaths of}} Ana Lucia and Libby caused {{speculation}} {{that they were}} killed off due to the DUIs that actresses Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros received within fifteen minutes of each other on December 1, 2005. Watros pleaded guilty, was fined $370, and had her license suspended for 90 days. Rodriguez initially pleaded innocent, but in April pleaded guilty, {{and was sentenced to}} five days in Oahu correctional facility, but ended up serving only 65 hours due to jail overcrowding. In February 2006, US Weekly claimed that an insider told them that the Lost producers were frustrated with Rodriguez's behavior and were going to kill her character off. Soon after, [...] "Two for the Road" [...] aired, writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse told TV Guide that when talking to Rodriguez about the part of Ana Lucia, she said that she would be interested, but only for a year. After sitting down with her, the two were very impressed with her energy, and decided to adjust their plan to make her character only last one season. Since audiences had a negative reaction to Ana-Lucia, the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans, so they decided that Libby, who was well liked, should also be killed for emotional impact. [...] Lindelof recalled that after they found out that both Rodriguez and Watros got the DUIs, he was concerned that it would look like killing Ana and Libby was the producers attempt to say [...] "Don't drive drunk!", and even considered re-writing the script so it wouldn't seem that way, but the producers decided just to keep it like it was. Lindelof also denied rumors that Rodriguez was killed off because she was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with,</b> saying that Michelle was [...] "totally professional and got along well with all the other actors." [...] According to Lindelof and Cuse, Watros was very sad about Libby being killed off, and the producers felt bad for her, so they helped her get in a pilot for a show on CBS called My Ex-Life, although it was not picked up by the network.|$|E

A person born into an upper-middle-class family will have greater advantages by the mere fact of birth than a person born into poverty.|$|R
