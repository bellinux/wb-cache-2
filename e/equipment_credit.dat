40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} {{of the world in}} the coming years is food security. The main problem of agriculture in the future is not only to produce more, but to do so in a sustainable way. European Innovation Partnership called "Productivity and sustainability of agriculture" aims to provide a working interface between agriculture, bio-economy, science and other disciplines at national, regional and EU level. European Innovation Partnership is a new concept that was introduced in Strategy Europe 2020 of the European Commission. In this document, the Commission underlines the role of research and innovation as key elements in adapting to future challenges of the European Union. This partnership will also serve as a catalyst to increase the effectiveness of actions related to innovation supported through rural development policy, EU research and innovation. It has been identified two main objectives for the European Innovation Partnership: promoting productivity and efficiency of agriculture and durable agriculture sustainability in all Member States. It aims to create a better cooperation between research and agricultural practice, namely farmers. Through National Program for Rural Development 2014 - 2020, can be financed such initiatives, through Measure 16, sub- 16. 1 - Support for the establishment and operation of operational groups of the EIP for agricultural productivity and sustainability and sub- 16. 2 - Support for pilot projects and development of new products, practices, processes and technologies. The purpose of these sub-measures is to support the establishment of operational groups between partners coming from research: research institutes, research stations or centers, higher education institutions that have research in agriculture or which can be applied in agriculture and agricultural producers (farmers, companies, cooperatives and producer groups). Development and innovation activities would enable farmers to capitalize on joint the produced products, to adapt production to market requirements, have better access to inputs, <b>equipment,</b> <b>credit</b> and marketing, to optimize their production costs, create short supply chains and handle with various market challenges...|$|E

50|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of this experiment, the Company {{extended}} free passage from 1685 to 1707 for Hollanders wishing to settle at the Cape. In 1688 it sponsored the immigration of 200 French Huguenot refugees forced into exile by the Edict of Fontainebleau. The terms under which the Huguenots agreed to immigrate were the same offered to other VOC subjects, including free passage and requisite farm <b>equipment</b> on <b>credit.</b> Prior attempts at cultivating vineyards or exploiting olive groves for fruit had been unsuccessful, and it was hoped that Huguenot colonists accustomed to Mediterranean agriculture could succeed where the Dutch had failed. They were augmented by VOC soldiers returning from Asia, predominantly Germans channeled into Amsterdam by the Company's extensive recruitment network and thence overseas. Despite their diverse nationalities, the colonists used a common language and adopted similar attitudes towards politics. The attributes they shared came to serve as a basis for the evolution of Afrikaner identity and consciousness.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper reports some of {{the results}} of a study to explore {{vulnerability}} contexts i. e. trends, shocks and local cultural practices that affect livelihood assets i. e. natural capital (land, water, biodiversity), physical capital (infrastructure, machinery), human capital (labour, skills), financial capital (savings, disposable assets), and social capital (rights, support systems) in Abesard, Iran. It also describes structures, including organizations (government, private), and processes, including policies, laws and incentives, that determine the livelihood strategies of households (agricultural intensification or expansion, livelihood diversification, and migration) which, in turn, impact the assets. Participatory vulnerability analysis (PVA) was used within a sustainable rural livelihoods (SRL) framework to assess the differences of the livelihoods of poor, average, and better-off households. Findings revealed that land use change, climate change, market fluctuations and higher mechanization were the main contexts of vulnerability that led to noticeable differences between households, particularly in human resources, landholdings, <b>equipments,</b> linkages, <b>credits</b> and markets, affecting the livelihood strategie...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-An {{identification}} of the principal design factors that influence the technical performance of a parabolic trough concentrator and which relate directly to design and manufacturing decisions is presented. These factors include spectraldirectional reflectivity of the mirror system, the mirror-receiver tube intercept factor, the incident angle modifier and absorptivity-transmissivity product of the receiver tube and cover tube, the end loss factor and a factor describing the effect of tracking errors and receiver tube misalignment. Each of these factors has been quantified in terms of design and manufacturing tolerances and associated performance degradation. Other design considerations that relate to thermal oss from the receiver tube are low emissivity coatings, evacuation and anti-reflection coating. The analysis ofenergy costs using the parabolic trough concentrator is developed. This analysis determines both the break-even, current metered cost of energy and the annual cash flow over periods of investment ranging from 5 to 15 yr. The economic factors include investment tax <b>credit,</b> energy <b>equipment</b> ax <b>credit,</b> income tax bracket, cost of auxiliary system, foundations and controls, cost of collector at installation, costs of maintenance and taxes, costs of fuel, cost of capital, general inflation rate and fuel escalation rate.

50|$|Cooley's early {{strategic}} initiatives were in {{the direction}} of making Wells Fargo's branch network statewide. The Federal Reserve had blocked the bank's earlier attempts to acquire an established bank in southern California. As a result, Wells Fargo had to build its own branch system.

In 1968 Wells Fargo changed from a state to a federal banking charter, in part so that it could set up subsidiaries for businesses such as <b>equipment</b> leasing and <b>credit</b> cards rather than having to create special divisions within the bank.
