5|$|Allgame gave {{positive}} {{reviews of}} the game. <b>It</b> <b>said</b> that game includes everything from hidden items, simplistic gameplay, fun and replay value, and basic but good-looking graphics. Defunct Games called Wonder Boy in Monster Land the most challenging game in the Wonder Boy series, noting the lack of passwords or continues in the Master System version, the relatively few chances to earn extra lives, and a time limit. The review said {{that the ability to}} earn gold and upgrade equipment which are laid out in the status screen tremendously adds to the replay value. It praised the responsive, though sometimes not precise, controls and the tight hit detection. Moreover, <b>it</b> <b>said</b> that the graphics were colorful and that it complemented the music and its simplistic sound effects well. Overall, the review said that the game is recommended for Master System and platforming fans alike.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. <b>It</b> <b>said</b> that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{a history}} of the Boston Transcript, the most resolutely anti-union of Boston's {{newspapers}} in 1919, perpetuated its original account of urban chaos during the strike's first nights. It described large crowds, including a number of sailors from docked naval ships, that took to the streets, smashing windows, committing robbery and stoning bystanders and cars. <b>It</b> <b>said</b> that the northern, southern, and western areas of the city were all taken over by armed gangs.|$|E

In settlement of the suit, Lundberg and Vanguard issued a full retraction of the claim.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, the EyeTV HD {{product for}} {{recording}} high-definition {{cable and satellite}} programming was introduced. Because cable and satellite signals are encoded, the device must be connected to a tuner from a television provider.

A review in Laptop Magazine gave EyeTV HD 3.5 out of 5 stars. <b>It</b> <b>said</b> the interface was intuitive and the video quality was good, but noted it was only compatible with Macs.|$|E

5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. <b>It</b> <b>said</b> it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of individual freedom in society was already {{one of the}} central points in the FPÖ (and VdU's) programme during the 1950s. The party did not regard its liberalism and its pan-German, nationalist positions as contradictory. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the party developed economically, supporting tax reduction, less state intervention and more privatisation. Starting in the late 2000s, the party has taken a more populist tack, combining this position with support for the welfare state. It criticised unemployment and alleged welfare-state abuse by immigrants which, <b>it</b> <b>said,</b> threatened the welfare state and pensioners' benefits.|$|E

5|$|Bill Werde {{was named}} {{editorial}} director in 2008, and {{was followed by}} Janice Min in January 2014, who is also responsible for editorial content at The Hollywood Reporter. The magazine has since been making changes {{to make it more}} of a general interest music news source, as opposed to solely an industry trade. It started covering more celebrity, fashion, and gossip. Min hired Tony Gervino as the publication's editor, which was different than Billboard's historical appointments, in {{that he did not have}} a background in the music industry. Tony Gervino was appointed editor-in-chief in April 2014. An item on NPR covered a leaked version of Billboards annual survey, which <b>it</b> <b>said</b> had more gossip and focused on less professional topics than prior surveys. For example, it polled readers on a lawsuit pop-star Kesha filed against her producer alleging sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|Jardine was {{selected}} to tour Australia with the M.C.C. team in 1928–29 {{as part of a}} very strong batting side, playing in all five Test matches and scoring 341 runs at an average of 42.62. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,168 runs (average 64.88). He was also on the five-man selection committee for the tour, which chose teams to play in specific games but had not chosen the touring party. Wisden judged that he had been as great a success as had been expected and impressed everyone with the strength of his defensive shots and his play on the back foot. <b>It</b> <b>said</b> that he played some delightful innings. Percy Fender, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Jardine never had the chance to play a normal innings in the Test, having to provide the stability to the batting, and often seeming to come out to bat in a crisis.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2008, {{the project}} had been {{estimated}} {{at a total}} cost of $3.1 billion USD, however the revised project has an estimated cost of $1 billion USD (The difference in estimates partially {{due to differences in}} previous tunnel designs). Financial closing on the project was reached in October, 2009. Miami-Dade County allegedly contributed $402 million, the city of Miami $50 million, and the state $650 million to build, operate and maintain it. Those contributions are spread during construction and operation of the tunnel project. During construction, 90% of the funds are provided by the private sector. Of the estimated one billion dollar total project cost, 607 million <b>it</b> <b>said</b> to go to design and construction, 195.1 million to financing, 59.6 million to insurance and maintenance during construction, 41.2 million to reserves, and 209.8 million for state development cost.|$|E
