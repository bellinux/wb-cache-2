25|$|Different atlases {{can give}} rise to, in essence, the same manifold. The circle can be mapped by two {{coordinate}} charts, {{but if the}} domains of these charts are changed slightly a different atlas for the same manifold is obtained. These different atlases can be combined into a bigger atlas. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> that the transition maps of such a combined atlas are not as smooth {{as those of the}} constituent atlases. If Ck atlases can be combined to form a Ck atlas, then they are called compatible. Compatibility of atlases is an equivalence relation; by combining all the atlases in an equivalence class, a maximal atlas can be constructed. Each Ck atlas belongs to a unique maximal Ck atlas.|$|E

25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is {{an emotion}} that is felt in {{all stages of}} infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to get angry at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E

JR tells Babe that he loves her and asks her to give them another chance, but as friends first and see where it leads. Babe, hesitant at first, accepts his request.|$|E

The dam controversy was not much of an election issue, and attempts by the Democratic Labor Party to portray Dunstan as a communist over his opposition to ongoing Australian support for South Vietnam had little effect. The LCL campaigned heavily on Hall, while Dunstan promised sweeping social reform, artistic transformation and more community services. He said [...] "We'll set a new standard of social advancement that the whole of Australia will envy. We believe South Australia can set the pace. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> here.

Although the share of the votes had been similar to 1968, the dilution of the Playmander had changed the share of the seats. As Labor had attained a majority of the popular vote for a long period, and because malapportionment had been largely ended, the political scientists Neal Blewett and Dean Jaensch said [...] "a Dunstan decade seems assured".|$|E

500|$|In a February 11, 2011 Entertainment Weekly article, veteran script {{supervisor}} Sandy Schklair {{announced that}} he desired credit for directing The Room. Schklair told EW shortly after being hired on as script supervisor, Wiseau became too engrossed with his acting duties to direct the film properly; according to Schklair, Wiseau then asked him to [...] "tell the actors what to do, and yell 'Action' and 'Cut' and tell the cameraman what shots to get." [...] The script supervisor {{also said that he}} had a conversation with Wiseau in which he refused to give up the title of [...] "director", but asked Schklair to [...] "direct [...] movie." [...] The story is corroborated by {{at least one of the}} film's actors, who requested anonymity for the story. Wiseau has dismissed Schklair's comments.

Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E
