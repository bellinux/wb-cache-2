40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the chemical composition and physico-functional properties of flour from Ivorian taro (Colocasia esculenta, cv yatan) corm as affected by boiling time. The change in boiling time {{led to a}} significant (p< 0. 05) reduction in the <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity</b> of starch, total carbohydrate, total phenolic compound, reducing and total sugars contents, whereas the moisture content, water absorption capacity, water solubility index, paste clarity and foam capacity increased significantly (p< 0. 05). The crude fat, crude fibre, crude protein and total ash contents were not affected by the change in boiling time. The flour of Ivorian taro corm is {{a good source of}} carbohydrate, fiber and ash. It contained a fair amount of crude protein and showed a high water absorption capacity and <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity</b> of starch. Within this flour, calcium, iron, sodium, zinc and copper had the lowest values while phosphorus, potassium and magnesium had the highest values. Significant correlations were observed between such constituents and physico-functional properties as moisture and water solubility index; crude fat and <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity</b> starch; total carbohydrate and paste clarity; total phenolic compound and forming capacity. PCA showed that FRTC was located at the left of the score plot, while FBTC 20, FBTC 35 and FBTC 50 had a positive score in the first principal component...|$|E
40|$|Polysaccharide {{components}} {{present in}} the pseudo-stem (scape) of M. paradisiaca were purified from acetone powder of the scape by delignification followed by extraction with aqueous solvents into water soluble polysaccharide (WSP), EDTA-soluble polysaccharide (EDTA-SP), alkali-soluble polysaccharide (ASP) and alkali-insoluble polysaccharide (AISP) fractions. Sugar compositional analysis showed that WSP and EDTA-SP contained only D-Glc whereas ASP contained D-Glc, L-Ara and D-Xyl in similar to 1 : 1 : 10 ratio, respectively, and AISP 'contained D-Glc, L-Ara and D-Xyl in similar to 10 : 1 : 2 ratio, respectively. WSP was further purified by complexation with iso-amylalcohol and characterized by specific rotation, IR spectroscopy, <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity,</b> ferricyanide number, blue value, hydrolysis with alpha-amylase and glucoamylase, and methylation linkage analysis, and {{shown to be a}} amylopectin type alpha-D-glucan...|$|E
40|$|Amylopectin (AP) and {{intermediate}} materials (IM) from five endosperm mutant genotypes {{in a common}} Oh 43 inbred line were isolated and examined by gel-permeation chromatography, <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity,</b> blue value (BV), and viscosity. The chain-length distributions of AP and IM were determined using an enzymatic- chromatographic method. The degrees of branching in AP and IM decreased when the amylose-extender (ae) gene was present. The dull- 1 (du 1) gene produced AP and IM with the highest degrees of branching among the samples. The ae starch had a significantly (P less than 0. 01) longer peak average chain length (CL) of the long-B chains in the IM fraction (177 glucose units) than did the AP faction (73 glucose units) or the other starches (37 - 56 glucose units). The higher <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity</b> in ae starch of the IM (6. 1) {{compared with that of}} the AP (2. 8) supported the idea that the IM had a longer CL than did the AP. There {{were no significant differences in}} the peak CL of A or B chains in AP and IM fractions of brittle- 1 (bt 1), du 1, ae bt 1, and ae du 1 starches. The IM of ae and ae du 1 starches had higher BV than did the AP fractions; however, the IM of du 1 and ae bt 1 had lower BV than did the AP fractions. The limiting viscosity number and gel- permeation chromatography results indicated that the AP and IM fractions of bt 1 and du 1 starches possessed more branching and larger hydrodynamic volume properties than those of the ae, ae bt 1, and ae du 1 starches. The present study demonstrated that genetic background affects the CL of starch branches, degree of branching, and iodine binding properties of starches...|$|E
40|$|The {{polysaccharide}} components {{present in}} the scape of Muse paradisiaca (banana) were fractionated into water-soluble (WSP), EDTA-soluble (EDTA-SP), alkali-soluble (ASP) and alkali-insoluble (AISP) polysaccharide fractions Anjaneyalu, Jagadish and Raju (1997) Glycoconj. J. 14, 507 - 512. The EDTA-SP was further fractionated by iso-amyl alcohol into EDTA-SPA and EDTA-SP-B. The homogeneity of these two polysaccharides was established by repeated precipitation with iso-amyl alcohol, gel-filtration chromatography and sedimentation analysis. The polysaccharides were characterized by monosaccharide composition analysis, methylation linkage analysis, <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity,</b> ferricyanide number, blue value, hydrolysis with alpha -amylase, gold-electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. Data from all of these studies suggest that EDTA-SP-A is a branched amylose-type alpha -D-glucan and that EDTA-SP-B is a highly branched amylopectin-type polymer. The nature of the branching patterns of these polysaccharides suggests that they are unique to M. paradisiaca...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} Yam Tuber Species (YTS), Tuber Steeping Duration (TSD) and Flour Particle Size (FPS) as factors of flour. Data were collected using white yam, water yam and yellow yam steeped in water (30 ± 2 °C, pH 6. 78) and withdrawn, and the flour classified, and analyzed for each parameter. Results obtained showed {{that all the}} test parameters, Water Retention Capacity (WRC), Swelling Index (SI), Solubility (TSS) and <b>Iodine</b> <b>Affinity</b> of Starch (IAS) correlated very much better and significantly (Pr< 0. 10) with FPS than with TSD. Inverse relationships were observed with all the parameters. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated that no significance existed in the main factors for YTS (WRC and TSS). Otherwise, the study variables {{were found to be}} critical determinants for the magnitude and extent of the physicochemical properties of steeped yam flour pastes.

40|$|Starches {{from six}} {{different}} species (cassava, arrowroot, sweet potato, yam, canna and ginger) were iso-lated and some structural and physicochemical characteristics analysed and correlated. Phosphorous and amylose contents were determined using a colorimetric method and measuring <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity,</b> respec-tively. Molecular weight distributions of starches were analysed by Sepharose CL 2 B. Granular {{shape and size}} distribution were performed using an image analyser system attached to a light microscope. Swelling power was determined at 60, 70, 80 and 90 °C. Pasting and thermal properties were measured using a rapid viscoanalyser, and a differential scanning calorimeter, respectively. Phosphorous content varied from 0. 007 to 0. 031 % for cassava and canna starches, respectively. Yam, canna and ginger starches displayed higher amylose contents (32. 6, 31. 7 and 26. 5 %, respectively) than cassava, arrowroot and sweet potato starches (19. 8, 20. 8 and 22. 6 %, respectively). These last three starches displayed amylose molecules of higher molecular weight than those shown for yam, canna and ginger starches. Canna starch showed higher proportions of longer branch chains of amylopectin than others starches.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of starches from 17 endosperm mutant genotypes {{in a common}} Oh 43 inbred background were examined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity</b> (IA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chain-length distributions of amylopectins were determined by an enzymatic- chromatographic method. Each genotype exhibited distinctive GPC elution patterns of its native and isoamylase-debranched starches and distinctivemorphology as noted by SEM. The amylose-extender (ae), dull- 1 (du 1), and sugary- 1 (su 1) genes were associated with increased amounts of amylose and intermediate fractions compared with normal starch. The waxy (wx) gene was epistatic to other genes relative to the accumulation of amylopectin, which was consistent with work done elsewhere. The discrepancy in amylose percentage determined by GPC and IA in some genotypes may have resulted from {{the presence of a}} large amount of intermediate materials in those genotypes, which could not always be distinguished from amylose by the IA method. For example, in ae starch, most of the intermediate materials were measured as amylose by the IA procedure, whereas in du 1, ae brittle- 1 (bt 1), and ae du 1 starches, most of the intermediate materials were exclded from IA measurements. The intermediate fractions from each genotype in the GPC elution profiles also differed from each other, suggesting differences in molecular weight and/or branching. The proportions of long B chains and the average chain length of amylopectins were increased when the ae gene was present. In contrast, the du 1 gene decreased the proportions of the long B chains of amylopectins. The mutants containing he ae gene showed low degrees of branching in amylopectin; mutants containing the du 1 and/or su 1 genes hd high degrees of branching. Genetic background {{played a major role in}} determining the fine structure of starch components.

40|$|Starches were {{isolated}} from a dent maize (Zea mays L.) inbred line Oh 43, from single endosperm mutants {{and from the}} double-mutant combinations within Oh 43. The thermal properties of the starches, including onset temperature (T[subscript] o), peak temperature, gelatinization temperature range, and enthalpy ([delta]H) of gelatinization and retrogradation and percentage of retrogradation, were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. A Voland-Stevens texture analyzer {{was used to measure}} gel strength. Double mutants generally had higher T[subscript] o and [delta]H for gelatinization and lower T[subscript] o for retrogradation, and lower gel strength measurements than those of single mutants. Sixteen mutant genotypes along with the normal genotype were selected for characterization of their fine structures and physicochemical properties. Each genotype exhibited different elution patterns of its native and isoamylase-debranched starches by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and showed distinctive morphology revealed by scanning electron microscopy. The amylose-extender (ae), dull- 1 (du 1), and sugary- 1 (su 1) genes were associated with increased amounts of amylose and intermediate materials, whereas the waxy (wx) gene produced starch with essentially 100 % amylopectin. The discrepancy in amylose percentage by using GPC and <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity</b> in some genotypes may have resulted from the presence of a large amount of intermediate materials in those starches. The mutants containing the ae gene had low amounts of branching in the amylopectin; mutants containing the du 1 and/or su 1 genes had a high amount of branching. Among all the structural characteristics, amylose content was the most important factor affecting the physicochemical properties. Other structural characteristics were weakly correlated with physicochemical properties. Five mutant genotypes (ae, brittle- 1 (bt 1), du 1, ae bt 1, and ae du 1) were further fractionated, and the amylopectin and intermediate materials were obtained for study of their structural characteristics and physicochemical properties. The amylopectin and intermediate materials from the same starch source exhibited different structural characteristics and properties, as did their fractions from different starches. This study demonstrated that genetic background {{plays an important role in}} determining the fine structure of starch components.

40|$|Two genetically {{unrelated}} normal {{dent maize}} inbreds, ICI 63 and ICI 92, with different heterotic backgrounds {{were used for}} studying environmental temperature effects on grain yield and quality. These two maize inbreds are used in commercially available hybrids and are proprietary to ICI Seeds. The maize inbreds were grown in a greenhouse to control the growing condition of the plants. After 14 days post-pollination, the ears were wrapped in temperature control devices set at 25 or 35 ∘ C during the grain-filling period. Grain yield, kernel weight, and kernel density were less for ears developing at 35 ∘ C than for those at 25 ∘ C. The extent of the reduction, however, was different for each variety: 13. 1 and 37. 9 % less kernel weight and 8. 47 and 10. 08 % less density for ICI 63 and ICI 92, respectively. At the increased temperature, starch granule size decreased, and gelatinization onset temperature increased. The starch granules of ICI 63 became more oval-shaped when the developing temperature was set at 35 ∘ C, {{but there was no}} change in shape for ICI 92. At the higher developmental temperature, amylose content of ICI 63 and ICI 92, determined by <b>iodine</b> <b>affinity,</b> decreased 2. 39 and 2. 20 %, respectively. Amylose molecular weight of both varieties also decreased. Size-exclusion chromatography and high-performance anion exchange chromatography revealed an increased medium branch-chain fraction and decreased long and short branch-chain fractions for ICI 63 amylopectin, whereas amylopectin from ICI 92 possessed increased long and medium branch-chain fractions and a decreased short branch-chain fraction when developed at 35 ∘ C. An in vitro model study, in which a 3. 5 mg/mL water dispersed amylose solution was used, was performed {{to determine the effects of}} temperature on conformation and properties of amylose molecules in aqueous solution. The retrogradation rate, an index of association and double helix formation in amylose molecules, decreased as incubation temperature increased. The initial retrogradation rate decreased from 58. 8 to 17. 4 % after one day when the temperature was increased from 5 to 15 ∘ C. The rate further decreased with a significantly smaller discrepancy to 12. 5, 9. 2 and 7. 1 % after one day at 25, 35 and 45 ∘ C, respectively. As incubation temperature increased from 5 to 45 ∘ C, number- and weight-average degree of polymerization of double helix segments of retrograded amylose increased from 39 to 52 and 47 to 72, respectively. This study demonstrated that environmental temperature has an effect on the maize starch fine structure. In addition to temperature effects on starch synthesis enzymes, the simple physical phenomenon of growth temperature can directly affect the conformation of starch molecules...|$|E
