25|$|Medieval Latin is {{the written}} Latin in use during {{that portion of}} the postclassical period when no {{corresponding}} Latin vernacular existed. The spoken language had developed into the various incipient Romance languages; however, in the educated and official world Latin continued without its natural spoken base. Moreover, this Latin spread into lands that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> Latin, such as the Germanic and Slavic nations. It became useful for international communication between the member states of the Holy Roman Empire and its allies.|$|E

25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken aback by the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Falcone {{received}} an effusive congratulatory {{phone call from}} Giulio Andreotti after the narrow escape. Falcone privately thought it odd that Andreotti, who he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> to, would suddenly contact him, and he mused {{about the significance of}} the incident to a friend. Unknown to Falcone the efforts to kill him were suspended while the Maxi trial verdicts went through the appeals process that had often set convicted Mafia members free. Later investigations into the murders of two police officers, Antonino Agostino and Emanuele Piazza, who worked for the secret service, revealed that they had secretly defused the bombs that had been placed by a Mafia commando aided by other secret service men. Agostino and his wife were killed on 5 August 1989 outside their home, and Piazza on 15 March 1990.|$|E

One friend, Ryan Duffin (called [...] "Randall" [...] in the Rolling Stone article), told The Washington Post that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> to any reporter from Rolling Stone, although Erdely had claimed him as a source to corroborate the accuser's story. Sandra Menendez, a student who claimed to have been interviewed by Erdely but who was not directly quoted in the article, told CNN that she and others became uncomfortable after speaking with Erdely, concluding she had [...] "an agenda".|$|E
500|$|On [...] "Mesias" [...] Arjona {{talks about}} a {{character}} who appears [...] "in {{the form of a}} wealthy, well-armed magnate with [...] some sinister plan for the world." [...] Some critics argued that it was a [...] "metaphorical attack" [...] on capitalism and imperialism, named as [...] "classic Arjona targets." [...] The song became a subject of some controversy when fans and critics noted connections between its theme and the attacks of September 2001, months after the song's release, which resulted in the FBI investigating Arjona. The singer later commented that [...] "Mesías" [...] had no relationship to the attacks, and that the lyrics were pure coincidence. He further stated the FBI <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> directly to him, but instead to somebody on his team.|$|E
500|$|They {{found it}} {{difficult}} to charge her because she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> her opinions in public, unlike Wheelwright and the other men who had been tried, nor had she ever signed any statements about them. Winthrop's first two lines of prosecution were to portray her as a co-conspirator of others who had openly caused trouble in the colony, and then to fault her for holding conventicles. [...] Question by question, Hutchinson effectively stonewalled him in her responses, and Winthrop was unable {{to find a way to}} convert her known membership in a seditious faction into a convictable offence. [...] Deputy governor Thomas Dudley had a substantial background in law, and he stepped in to assist the prosecution. [...] Dudley questioned Hutchinson about her conventicles and her association with the other conspirators. With no answer by Hutchinson, he moved on to the charge of her slandering the ministers.|$|E

Your {{delicacy}} will tell you that a handsome woman needs some friends who are not--well, not on that footing with her. The effect of her own beauty would become a torment to her if she could not escape from it occasionally. You are probably on much more confidential terms with Kitty than I am.

500|$|Former congressman Hoeppel, who {{gathered}} just over {{one percent of}} the vote, wrote Nixon after the election, stating that he had never expected to win, and that his purpose had been [...] "to expose what I considered to be the alien-minded, un-American, PAC, Red, congressional record of the Democratic incumbent". [...] Despite any hard feelings, Voorhis sent Nixon a letter of congratulations in early December 1946. Nixon and Voorhis met for an hour at Voorhis's office, and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. In 1971, Voorhis said that the two <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> again. [...] Voorhis's final letter as a congressman, written on December 31, was to his father, who had been his political adviser throughout his congressional career.

[...] Asher did not recall hearing the remark and could not verify whether it was actually spoken. He said that, [...] "it seems very much like Mike. And to tell the truth, I think he had a point," [...] arguing that Pet Sounds [...] "was not much of a success" [...] and that its music [...] "was [...] not what Beach Boys fans were expecting." [...] Parks believes that Love's hostility toward Wilson and Smile was [...] "the deciding factor" [...] in the album's cancellation. In a 1998 deposition related to the memoir , Wilson testified that Love <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> the line to him, and when asked if Love's opposition to the lyrics made him shelve the album, he responded: [...] "No. There weren't as many lyrics as there was just—see, Smile wasn't a lyrical thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The lawsuit {{missed the}} filing {{deadline}} of January 1, 1993. The {{speaker of the}} Florida House of Representatives commissioned a group to research and provide a report by which the equitable claim bill could be evaluated. It took them nearly a year to do the research, including interviews, and writing. On December 22, 1993, historians from Florida State University, Florida A University, and the University of Florida delivered a 100-page report (with 400 pages of attached documentation) on the Rosewood massacre. It was based on available primary documents, and interviews mostly with black survivors of the incident. Due to the media attention received by residents of Cedar Key and Sumner following filing of the claim by survivors, white participants were discouraged from offering interviews to the historians. The report used a taped description of the events by Jason McElveen, a Cedar Key resident who had since died, and an interview with Ernest Parham, who {{was in high school}} in 1923 and happened upon the lynching of Sam Carter. Parham said he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> of the incident because he was never asked. [...] The report was titled [...] "Documented History of the Incident which Occurred at Rosewood, Florida in January 1923". Gary Moore, the investigative journalist who wrote the 1982 story in The St. Petersburg Times that reopened the Rosewood case, criticized demonstrable errors in the report. The commissioned group retracted the most serious of these, without public discussion. They delivered the final report to the Florida Board of Regents and it became part of the legislative record.|$|E

500|$|At the {{invitation}} of his cousin John Amory Lowell, James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute. Some speculated the opportunity {{was because of the}} family connection, offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression. Lowell chose to speak on [...] "The English Poets", telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets [...] "for the injuries received by one whom the public won't allow among the living". The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration. His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon. Lowell, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> in public before, was praised for these lectures. Francis James Child said that Lowell, whom he deemed was typically [...] "perverse", was able to [...] "persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents". While his series was still in progress, Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard, a post vacated by Longfellow, at an annual salary of $1,200, though he never applied for it. The job description was changing after Longfellow; instead of teaching languages directly, Lowell would supervise the department and deliver two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing. Lowell accepted the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad. He set sail on June 4 of that year, leaving his daughter Mabel in the care of a governess named Frances Dunlap. Abroad, he visited Le Havre, Paris, and London, spending time with friends including Story, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Leigh Hunt. Primarily, however, Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages, particularly German, which he found difficult. He complained: [...] "The confounding genders! If I die I shall have engraved on my tombstone that I died of der, die, das, not because I caught them but because I couldn't." ...|$|E

[...] The CMC demanded that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) hand over the tapes and backup tapes of particular interviews with Yanner and Foster which were central to the investigation, the interviews then had to be deleted from ABC audio and computers.|$|E

2500|$|Fitch {{was able}} to damage Ike Clanton's {{credibility}} through skillful questioning. In response to his questioning, Clanton denied seeking confirmation from Wyatt Earp about the reward offered by Wells, Fargo & Co, [...] "dead or alive", for the stage robbers. When shown the telegram confirming the reward would be paid in either circumstance, he denied having ever seen it before. On November 12, he got Clanton to testify that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> to Ned Boyle {{on the morning of}} the gunfight, and on November 23, Boyle's testimony contradicted Clanton's. During Ike Clanton's testimony under cross-examination by Fitch, he said [...] "I don't remember" [...] 14 times. This and other contradictions impugned Clanton's testimony.|$|E

She, along with Vulcheva, are the only nurses who admitted knowing Ashraf by sight beforehand, but she said she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> with him. She denied having attempted suicide out of guilt for what she had done. In court she stated that [...] "I am not guilty on any of the counts. My conscience is clear." [...] and [...] "We had protection from no-one, we had no doctor. We were alone there with those men who did everything they wanted to do". She said she attempted to retract her confession on 17 July 1999, but that a Colonel Juma came and threatened to renew the torture if she persisted.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Wakefield wrote Callous Disregard: Autism and Vaccines – The Truth Behind a Tragedy, {{in which}} he {{rejected}} the charges against him, and claimed {{that the loss of}} his license was a political attempt to silence his criticism of vaccine safety. [...] In 2013, Joel A. Harrison, PhD, MPH published a detailed examination of Callous Disregard, and concluded that [...] "a careful review of publicly available information makes it clear that ... every major claim Wakefield makes in his book concerning vaccine safety is wrong." [...] He demonstrated that in some cases, the references that Wakefield cited to support his claims showed exactly the opposite. [...] For example, Wakefield asserted that Brith Christenson, MD, PhD, a respected Swedish vaccine researcher, had told him that vaccine safety studies had not been carried out in Sweden because Swedish physicians did not concern themselves with vaccine safety; then cited three Swedish papers—two of them co-authored by Christenson—detailing multiple vaccine safety studies that had been conducted in Sweden.
