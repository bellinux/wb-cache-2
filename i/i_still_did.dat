Wherefore, one day as I was in a meeting of God's people, full of sadness and terror, for my fears again were strong upon me; and as I was now thinking my soul was never the better, but my case most sad and fearful, these words did, with great power, suddenly break in upon me, [...] "My grace is sufficient for thee, my grace is sufficient for thee, my grace is sufficient for thee," [...] three times together; and, oh! methought that every word as a mighty word unto me; as my, and grace, and sufficient, and for thee; they were then, and sometimes are still, far bigger than others be.|$|E

She listened to me, looking at me, breaking off little bits of stone and letting them drop down into the valley. At last she got up and nodded at me two or three times silently, with a smile, as if she were applauding me for a solo on the violin. 'You are in love,' she said. 'It's a perfect case!' And for some time she said nothing more. But before we left the place she told me that she owed me an answer to my speech. She thanked me heartily, but she was afraid that if she took me at my word she would be taking advantage of my inexperience. I had known few women; I was too easily pleased; I thought her better than she really was. She had great faults; I must know her longer and find them out; I must compare her with other women--women younger, simpler, more innocent, more ignorant; and then if <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> her the honour to think well of her, she would listen to me again.

Even getting out I had noticed a strange unrest in the border guards and policemen. A bell tolled to signal the approach of a train. The policemen stood, all railway officials rushed out of their boxes. Slowly, majestically, the train rolled in, a special kind of train, a Salon train. The locomotive stopped. A motion was palpable through the ranks of those waiting, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not know why.

40|$|I {{argued in}} 2000 that the French artist ORLAN may have {{moved away from}} her Reincarnation {{performances}} toward her Self-Hybridizations because she thought that in the latter she would be more transparently obvious in meaning and less frequently misunderstood. I may have overstated the ability of audiences to comprehend, however. In this essay I argue that the virtual beauty that ORLAN unfolds in her ongoing series Self-Hybridizations is not a real or actual beauty but rather a fake beauty, causally disembodied, based on the effects she intends to create from an imaginative use of combined hybrid imagery. Subverting the familiar philosophical notions of aesthetic distance and aesthetic appreciation, hers is not a monstrous beauty (as some feminist art theorists contend) but rather a fake beauty that still has aesthetic features worth assessing. I suggest the possibility of generational differences in understandings of the term 'feminist', i. e., shifts in meaning from early feminist theory of the 1970 s to ever-evolving, twenty-first century notions of the term, all of which add to the confusion. As I negotiate this terrain, I hope to steer both critics and viewers more directly {{to the words of}} the artist herself, "I have tried to make my Self-Hybridations as 'human' as possible, like mutant beings, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not think that the confusion could be possible. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{tension between}} privacy and {{disclosure}} in psychoanalysis operates {{in various ways}} in analyst, supervisee, and supervisor. Analysts need to main-tain {{the privacy of their}} patients by keeping their material confidential; they also need to know and share their own internal conscious conflicts to be able to discover unconscious conflicts and their characterological ramifica-tions. Clinical writing is one vehicle for the exploration, discovery, and communication of transference-countertransference issues and other conflicts stimulated by clinical work, but it does not provide the perspec-tive that comes from sharing with another person. Telling a trusted col-league what we think and feel in relation to our patients and ourselves enables us to see our blind spots, as well as providing perspective and affect containment in our work. Mutuality in peer supervision tends to reduce the transference. The special problems of privacy and disclosure in psychoanalytic training are addressed, as are the ways the analyst’s belief in maintaining privacy may affect the analytic process and thera-peutic relationship. I want to begin my discussion of privacy with a disclosure. Many years ago, not long after the termination of my training analysis, I had a patient who was relentlessly plagued by feelings of guilt. My attempts to explore and analyze his intense feelings seemed less and less fruitful over time. I took notes, reread them, thought about him, about our work together, about me. Nothing fresh emerged. I decided to talk with a colleague, but before I initiated the call, I had a dream. I remembered nothing about the dream except this patient’s presence in it. This treatment was on my mind, but I was at a loss to understand what dreaming about the patient meant beyond that.

An adding factor to my glee {{is the fact that}} I begin my classification tests today. It was at a rather inept time as I only had 3 ½ hours sleep last night. I was on guard duty from 2215 to 0215. But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> well on the test. I had the mental part today which was a group of about 10 tests and it took all day! I’m pretty tired now, and still have that god-damned cough, but I’m still happy! I guess that’s what they call moral. Tomorrow I have my psyco-moto test. This is the “penny arcade” of machines that tests my condition, etc. I’ll tell you about it Sunday, darling. By the way these test determine whether I’m going to be a pilot, navigator, or bombardier. I believe I told you about it before. N’est-ce pas? We’re not told our classification ‘til we’re out of college. But we are notified in 7 - 10 days in case of a wash-out. So no news is good news. My guard duty was uneventful except that I can have a weekend pass. That’s good from 1200 Saturday to 0545 Monday. How I got it is narrated below. I was walking my post in a military manner, as it says in General Order # 2, when the N. C. O. D. (Non. Com. Officer of the day) walks toward me. I hollered halt as prescribed. Followed by, “who’s there?!” He told me, “advance and be recognized!” He did. “Recognized!” He then proceeded to examine me as to how well I knew my general orders. That was O. K. Then he asked if he could see my piece, (gun), (Wipe that smile off your face.) Well anyhow I said, “IS that an order or a request?” If it’s a request I’m not supposed to give it to him. Well that slayed him. You see I’m not supposed to know that, but Sargeant Mike taught me. (That’s our drill sarge.) He liked my performance so much he’s entering my name for a week-end pass. Mornin’, here I am a guard! No kiddin’, this guarding business is nothing to fool with. We’re armed with a. 30 caliber Springfield with a 20 inch bayonet on the end. If I challenge someone and he doesn’t halt. I have to run him through with the bayonet. We’re not supposed to just wound him either, we’re supposed to kill him. If I ever do kill anyone on guard duty I’m fined $ 1. 10, given a carton of cigarettes, and shipped somewhere else. Simple as that. Well that’s enough B. S. for tonight beautiful.

40|$|It {{was once}} my dream {{to build the}} theatre of the future: {{to develop a new}} {{organization}} in the theatre community that would provide new ideas and imaginative learning. Reality and research, however, have pointed me in a new direction. From my perspective, we do not currently need another organization to add competition within our theatrical community. Though it is often appealing to start from scratch, what we need most now is to enhance our status and quality. Existing theatres must work toward a balance of competition and collaboration. Disparity is not the issue. Countless theatres in our nation and around the world produce amazing new material and provide incredible environments for their patrons to learn, to explore, and to discover. As technology rapidly creates new expectations of this field, our response must be to expound upon our mission statements and diversify our future options and current product. We need to provide the audiences we so cherish with the best entertainment, education, and escape available. Only when we pay closer attention to our audiences, will our under-funded sector receive more attention. As a young child (and no - 1 do not deny that I am still young and I do intend to remain thus for years to come) I didn 2 ̆ 7 t know I would pursue theatre. The first thing I aspired to be was a dentist, simply because of the magical treasure chest where I chose a treat after each check-up. Next, I {{was going to be a}} country-western singer following in the footsteps of LeAnn Rimes by singing 2 ̆ 2 Blue 2 ̆ 2 at my first-ever theatre audition for Wizard ofOz. Luckily, I was cast (as the tallest and most awkward munchkin) and my life in theatre began. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not know it, however, since I dreamed of being the Chick-Fil-A cow and working at Disney during my summers off. By the time I reached high school, theatre had been eliminated from my school so I continued in choir and performed annually in a community theatre program. Though my dreams were crushed when I learned my height limited me from becoming a princess at Disney (unless you count an evil stepsister) my sights had changed a bit once again. I was approaching graduation and knew without a doubt that I wanted to be a teacher like my dad (then a math teacher and swim coach), mom (a swimming instructor for over thirty years), and brother (a swim coach and instructor). My family, along with my experiences, inspired me. I went to Columbus State University to major in Theatre Education where I could pursue the arts and education. My desire to be a teacher has remained intact though I have discovered a new passion. Through my work with Columbus State University, the Springer Opera House, and with the Georgia Thespian Conference, I realize that I thrive working as an educator in a nontraditional, workshop- style setting. I have also found that the excitement I experience creating large spreadsheets to coordinate volunteers, making show banners, house managing, or writing grants is personally comparable to being on stage. In a roundabout manner, this brings me to this thesis. 1 want to bring more sustainable attention to live theatre. How do we make contact with our cherished audiences and entice them with our art? How is theatre compelling and relatable for an audience? Everyone is an artist within their own field: the mathematician with his calculator, the chef with her ingredients [...] . what is significant about live theatre? What draws people in? As an intern with the Springer Opera House, I worked primarily in marketing, development, and the box office. I learned about various methods to entice and keep up with the audience. What I learned, though, is skewed toward arts management. As an audience member I am reeled into certain productions for different reasons, but as an intern I often cast the same bait. So what metaphorical bait actually attracts the audience? What fills the house of the theatre? Is it the banners or posters? Is it the radio spots? Is it a Facebook page? If we hope to continue to develop our audiences during a time of growing entertainment options, we should find out...|$|E
