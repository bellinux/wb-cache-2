40|$|Background:  Packaging {{problems}} {{are an integral}} part of logistics and the implementation of packaging significantly affects the effectiveness of logistics processes, as a factor which increases the safety and the quality of products being transported. Active packaging is an area of technology needed to meet the requirements of the contemporary consumer. Active packaging creates additional opportunities in systems <b>for</b> <b>packing</b> <b>goods,</b> as well as offering a solution in which the packaging, the product and surroundings interact. Furthermore, active packaging allows packaging to interact with food and the environment and play a dynamic role in food preservation. The main role of antimicrobial packaging is to inhibit the growth of microorganisms that reduce the quality of the packaged product. 	Methods: The application of natural antimicrobial agents appears to be safe for food products. Also, these compounds have potential applications as a natural preservative in the food packaging industry. This study presents some antibacterial agents, namely chitosan, nisin and pectins. 	Results and conclusion: Natural substances used in active packaging can eliminate the danger of chemical substances migrating to food...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel {{concept of}} {{coupling}} the actuators of an automated order picking system <b>for</b> pouch <b>packed</b> <b>goods</b> with an embedded CCD camera sensor {{by means of}} image processing and machine learning is presented. The picking system mechanically combines the conveyance and singularization of a still-connected chain of pouch <b>packed</b> <b>goods</b> in a single machinery. The proposed algorithms perform a per-frame processing of the captured images in real-time to detect the sealed seams of the ongoing pouches. The detections are used to deduce cutting decisions {{in order to control}} the system’s actuators, namely the drive pulley for conveyance and the cutting device for the separation. Within J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2014, 4 246 this context, two controlling strategies are presented as well which specify the interaction of the sensor and the actuators.

Depending on the employed marker, detection rates of almost 100 % with a calculation time of less than 40 ms are possible. From a logistic point of view, sealed seam widths of 20 mm prove feasible...|$|R

40|$|Crystallization is the {{formation}} of solid particles within a homogenous phase. Crystallization is considered a last stage purification step in pharmaceutical, chemical, agrochemical and food industries. Crystallization is mostly used for separation of a pure product from an impure solution and the product formed is suitable <b>for</b> <b>packing</b> and marketing. <b>Good</b> yield and purity are important for crystallization; apart from it crystal size distribution also plays {{a vital role in}} the design of crystallization. The energy required for crystallization is less than distillation. The study is made on crystallization process of sucrose in a continuous rectangular flow chamber. The present work is aimed to compare the simulation results with experimental results and to study the parametric sensitivity on mean crystal diameter of sucrose and total crystal production with variation in inlet velocity of solution, inlet mass fraction of sucrose and wall temperature of crystallizer. The transient simulations are carried out to study the crystallization process. The simulation results when validated against experimental results are found to be consistent. The simulation results show that as the inlet mass fraction of sucrose is increased, then the mean crystal size and total crystal production are observed to be increased. The mean crystal size is increased and total crystal production is decreased with decrease in inlet velocity of solution. The mean crystal size is observed to be invariant with change in wall temperature of the crystallizer but the total crystal production is increased with increase in wall temperature...|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} {{turn of the}} final, Kalkidan Gezahegne (BHR) started quickly to take a two metre lead, covered quickly by 10,000 metre champ Almaz Ayana, {{revealing}} her intent to cover moves. Hellen Obiri (KEN) moved to Ayana's shoulder. Then Sifan Hassan ran around the crowd to take the lead. In control of the front, Hassan didn't speed up, she slowed the pace to a virtual walk. Everyone obliged until the last few metres when Ayana broke free off the front. They passed the first lap in 1:21.77. Ayana's second lap of 1:18.98 didn't improve the pace much, but it separated all three Ethiopians and all three Kenyans to the front. Gezahegne rushed forward to take another temporary lead before fading back through the <b>pack</b> <b>for</b> <b>good.</b> From there it was Ayana setting the pace, but a pack of others, led by Hellen Obiri (KEN) were {{determined not to let}} her get away. Ayana accelerated but Obiri stuck to her, creating a ten second breakaway on the pack led by Hassan. With 300 metres to go, Obiri took off at a pace Ayana could not match, taking the pace from 68 second laps to the last 200 metres in under 30 seconds. Running even faster, Hasan separated from the pack and set off in chase of catching Ayana for silver but arriving two seconds too late.|$|R

Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms rated the album a perfect ten, writing that [...] "All in all, pop rock of the finest quality." [...] At CCM Magazine, Chris Well graded the album a B, writing that the release [...] "is a likable collection of simple, fistpumping anthems that should connect particularly with youth groups." [...] Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today rated the album three-and-a-half out of five stars, writing that [...] "There's much to appreciate musically on Audio Adrenaline's latest, but lyrically it falls short." [...] At Christian Broadcasting Network, Chris Carpenter rated the album three spins out of five, writing that [...] "It just lacks the lyrical creativity that fueled previous Audio A standards."
