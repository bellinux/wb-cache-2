It is found that the latitudinal variation in the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> occurrence is substantially geomagnetically controlled, most frequent in the summer hemisphere within the geomagnetic latitude region between 10 ° and 70 ° and very rare in the geomagnetic equatorial zone. Model simulations show that the summer maximum (winter minimum) in the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> occurrence is very likely attributed to the convergence of the Fe+ concentration flux driven by the neutral wind. In addition to seasonal and spatial distributions, the height-time variations in the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> occurrence in the midlatitude (> 30 °) region in summer and spring are primarily dominated by the semidiurnal tides, which start to appear at local time around 6 and 18 -h in the height range 110 - 120 -km and gradually descend {{at a rate of about}} 0. 9 - 1. 6 -km/h. In the low-latitude (< 30 °) region, the diurnal tide dominates.

The linear growth rate of the instability has a maxima in the vicin-ity of the wavelength observed for the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> structures (short wavelengths). However, the maxima is non-distinct, and simulations have shown that the instability is extremely nonlinear. Therefore, to understand the wavelength depen-dence of the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> instability it is necessary to factor in nonlinear behavior. Simulations have shown that the insta-bility is active at the wavelengths observed in the F layer, and revealed that the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> behavior at these long wave-lengths is so nonlinear that the common, highly localized <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> observation techniques would likely miss the signature, which is highly visible in the F layer. However, there is cur-rently no explanation for why long wavelengths so clearly dominate short (or intermediate) wavelengths in the F layer observations, and this is a weakness in arguments that the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> instability participates in the creation of F-region frontal structures. Herein we remove this weakness by show-ing that longer wavelengths grow to larger amplitudes before eventual nonlinear saturation, and couple more effectively to the F-region...|$|R

Indeed, the Esq layer is associated with equatorial electrojet (EEJ) current instabilities (Fejer and Kelley, 1980; Forbes, 1981). The signatures of the Esq layers in ionograms appears as a scattering of the ionosonde signal covering most of the frequency scale, and occurs during daylight time.

In these locations, the solar eclipse was only partial, with the maximum area of the solar disk obscured by the Moon equal to ~ 54 % at Rome and ~ 45 % at Gibilmanna.

30|$|The {{sporadic}} layers {{are classified}} into several types {{according to the}} different mechanisms of formation and the latitudes at which they are observed. The development of <b>Es</b> <b>layers</b> is strongly associated with particle precipitation at high latitudes (Kirkwood and Nilsson 2000). At middle and low latitudes, a comprehensive study by Whitehead (1989) {{has shown that the}} E region ionization enhancements can be formed due to vertical shear caused by opposite horizontal neutral winds, which in turn can be driven by gravity waves (Hook 1970; Lanchester et al. 1991; Jayachandran 1991) or tidal motions (Chimmonas 1971). The <b>Es</b> <b>layers</b> formed by wind shear lead to ionization enhancements that block the upper ionosphere to low-frequency radio soundings (Devasia et al. 2004) and may lead to amplitude scintillations at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies (Seif et al. 2015). Therefore, these layers are classified as blanketing layers (Esb) (e.g., Reddy and Devasia 1973, 1981; Rastogi 1997; Devasia et al. 2004).

Electric fields on scales larger than (about) 10 km map very efficiently between the <b>Es</b> and F <b>layers,</b> and the two instabilities have a similar geometry, al-lowing them to interact with one another.

For both large and small relative velocities the growth rate was found to be more than double that of the Perkins instability alone, when 6 H 6 PF = 1. 8. However, the characteris-tic eigenmode varies considerably with relative velocity, and different nonlinear behavior is expected in these two cases.
