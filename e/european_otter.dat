5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year, and true gestation lasts 61–63 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10–12 months. Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the <b>European</b> <b>otter,</b> which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition lasts three to eight hours.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of <b>European</b> <b>otter</b> and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E

Vertebrates {{are represented by}} about 200 species, of which 130 are protected. Forty species of mammals include the bear, fox, wolf, wildcat, deer, boar, and marten. The National Park is home to 65 endangered species, including the saker falcon, <b>European</b> <b>otter</b> and European ground squirrel.|$|E
25|$|Human activities, mainly {{cultivation}} of the steppes, {{resulted in the}} disappearance of animals formerly common in the basin, such as tarpan, steppe antelope, saiga antelope, marmots and others. Back in the 1960s–1970s, especially near Oskol River, {{it was not unusual}} to meet bobak marmot, Eurasian deer, wild boar and Russian desman. Current mammals of the basin include European beaver, Dipodidae, suslik, mice, <b>European</b> <b>otter,</b> European mink, weasel and bats.|$|E

25|$|The {{surrounding}} seas are fished for prawns and scallops {{and there}} is a lease for a salmon farm off the south eastern shores of Lunga just north of the Bealach a' Choin Ghlais by the islet Sgeir Mhic an Altair. This part of the seabed is also a haven for the rare seafan anemone Amphianthus dohrnii. The kelp Laminaria hyperborea dominates much of the surrounding infralittoral in areas not swept by the strongest tides. In some sheltered locations with deeper water there are feather stars including Leptometra celtica and the hydroid Lytocarpia myriophyllum. On land the island is home to <b>European</b> <b>otter</b> and red deer. Atlantic grey seals, minke whale, bottlenose dolphin, and harbour porpoise are regular marine visitors. Golden and white-tailed sea eagles are also commonly sighted. The area is of growing importance for various leisure activities including scuba diving and canoeing.|$|E
50|$|This {{part of the}} zoo houses animals {{which usually}} live in the {{temperate}} zone of the world. Animals housed in this area include Przewalski's wild horses, American beavers, American bison, raccoons, sika, bobcats, woodchuck, <b>European</b> <b>otters,</b> Asiatic black bears, red pandas, brown bears, grey wolves, pumas, and Eurasian lynxes.|$|R
50|$|The {{wildlife}} of {{the park}} is diverse and interesting to naturalists. There are sea birds on the islands, <b>European</b> <b>otters</b> and beavers in the rivers and swamps, and interesting birds of prey. In the marshes lives a species of rare carnivorous plant, the sundew, which captures unwary insects.|$|R
5|$|Brown hares and <b>European</b> <b>otters</b> {{are found}} {{all along the}} north Norfolk coast, but red {{squirrels}} disappeared from the Holkham pines by 1981.

500|$|The {{sea otter}} is the {{heaviest}} (the giant otter is longer, but significantly slimmer) {{member of the}} family Mustelidae, a diverse group that includes the 13 otter species and terrestrial animals such as weasels, badgers, and minks. It is unique among the mustelids in not making [...] or burrows, in having no functional anal scent glands, and in being able to live its entire life without leaving the water. The only member of the genus Enhydra, the sea otter is so different from other mustelid species that, as recently as 1982, some scientists believed it was more closely related to the earless seals. Genetic analysis indicates the sea otter and its closest extant relatives, which include the African speckle-throated otter, <b>European</b> <b>otter,</b> African clawless otter and oriental small-clawed otter, shared an ancestor approximately 5 million years ago (Mya).|$|E
500|$|The Parrett then {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), common redshank (Tringa totanus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), common teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy click beetle (Synaptus filiformis), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides), Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important <b>European</b> <b>otter</b> (Lutra lutra) population. 282 American mink (Mustela vison) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles (Arvicola amphibius) to recolonise areas of the Levels {{where they have been}} absent for 10years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some [...] of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area, while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential. Despite this, there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} a {{designated}} site of special scientific interest {{due to the}} fish that it supports. Of particular interest are the resident populations of spined loach (Cobitis taenia) and European bullhead (Cottus gobio) (two internationally notable species of native freshwater fish with a restricted distribution in England), white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) and <b>European</b> <b>otters</b> (Lutra lutra).|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} this study was to explore a {{distribution}} and prevalence of parasitic helmints in population of wild <b>European</b> <b>otters</b> in the Czech Republic. For this purpose organization ALKA wildlife o. p. s. provided 15 cadavers of these animals. This gained experimental material was consequently subjected to a detailed parasitical examination. All examinations and analises were made in the parazitical laboratory of Department of Zoology and Fishers, Faculty of Agrobiology, food and natural resources in Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague. The discovered parazitic organisms were subsequently isolated and determined. This autopsy showed the occurrence of parasitic flukes of genus Metorchis. Prevalence was counted 13. 33 % (two positive samples from all fifteen samples). In the first sample, there were found 17 flukes, in the second sample, there were found 11 flukes. The place of discovery of this samples was southern Bohemia. The occurence of other expected representers of tapeworms, roundworms and acanthocephala were not confirmed. Results can be disorted because of low number of examined biological material. But getting bigger amount of material is a problem because the <b>European</b> <b>otters</b> are protected by law. The results show that in population of wild <b>European</b> <b>otters</b> occur parasitic flukes of genus Metorchis. Since this is the first mention of their occurrence in the Czech Republic, it would be appropriate to study this issue from now to get more results that would be more exact...|$|R

Work by the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Porto and University of Minho have concentrated on a few mammals (Pyrenean desman, <b>European</b> <b>otter,</b> roe deer, and wild boar), reptiles and fish. These studies looked into the numbers of species and factors influencing their habitats.|$|E
2500|$|The park is host to {{many species}} of mammals. The most {{widespread}} are the moose, the roe deer, the mountain hare, the red fox, and the European pine marten. Since the 1980s, one can also see Eurasian beaver near the islands of Torrön and Ängsön as well as near Gysinge. In 2008, it was similarly found that the wild boar was wont to settle the park. More rarely, one sees also the wood lemming in the north part of the park. Four species of mammals present in the park are considered endangered in Sweden. Thus, the Eurasian lynx [...] can be observed regularly around Öbyhalvön, Tinäset and Gärdsvekarna, alongside brown bears and gray wolves, although these are less frequent.

Because the Wieprz with its wide valley has not been regulated, its nature is very diverse. The meandering river with its oxbow lakes is inhabited by numerous birds, <b>European</b> <b>otters</b> and Eurasian beavers.|$|R
2500|$|Larger {{and more}} {{dangerous}} mammalian prey is not infrequently tackled by Eurasian eagle-owl. Nearly thirty species of mammalian carnivores {{have been reported}} in their diet. Many of these are mustelids, which are the smallest type of carnivore but can defend themselves viciously, even the tiny [...] least weasel (Mustela nivalis). Nonetheless, unlike some smaller birds of prey, the Eurasian eagle-owl seems to have no problem subduing various weasels and even martens, some of the latter can nearly equal to their own weight, and will kill the young of much larger species such as <b>European</b> <b>otter</b> (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles). However, the single most widely reported carnivore is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), as they’ve been recorded in the diet from Denmark and Spain to the Russian Far East. Many fox specimens taken by eagle-owls are young individuals or subadults. Some studies posited that the average fox taken as weighing about , about equal to the eagle-owl’s own weight, but another noted fox specimens killed that were estimated to weigh , much larger than the eagle-owls. At least four other species of foxes have been verified as prey in the Middle East and Asia. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), averaging , have been preyed on in Asia as well. Other relatively large carnivores have been hunted as well, including invasive Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) in Spain and masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) in China, both being roughly cat-sized at averages of , respectively. Domestic carnivores including cats (Felis silvestris catus) of all sizes and small dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) or puppies may on occasion become prey for Eurasian eagle-owls. Cats killed have been estimated to weigh from [...] The dogs killed by Bavarian eagle-owls were estimated to average [...] Non-native carnivores such as American mink (Neovison vison) and raccoon (Procyon lotor) have also been preyed on by eagle-owls, which is presumed to incidentally benefit the prey taken in considerably numbers by these rarely checked invasive fur-bearers.|$|E
6000|$|Much more {{interesting}} is the reported existence {{in the mountains of}} the South Island of a small otter-like animal. Dr. Haast has seen its tracks, resembling those of our <b>European</b> <b>otter,</b> at a height of 3,000 feet above the sea in a region never before trodden by man; and the animal itself was seen by two gentlemen near Lake Heron, about seventy miles due west of Christchurch. It was described as being dark brown and {{the size of a large}} rabbit. On being struck at with a whip, it uttered a shrill yelping sound and disappeared in the water.[119] An animal seen so closely as to be struck at with a whip could hardly have been mistaken for a dog--the only other animal that it could possibly be supposed to have been, and a dog would certainly not have [...] "disappeared in the water." [...] This account, as well as the footsteps, point to an aquatic animal; and if it now frequents only the high alpine lakes and streams, this might explain why it has never yet been captured. Hochstetter also states that it has a native name--Waitoteke--a striking evidence of its actual existence, while a gentleman who lived many years in the district assures me that {476} it is universally believed in by residents in that part of New Zealand. The actual capture of this animal and the determination of its characters and affinities could not fail to aid us greatly in our speculations as to the nature and origin of the New Zealand fauna.[120] ...|$|E
