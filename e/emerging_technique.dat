25|$|The {{modes of}} action by which {{antimicrobial}} peptides kill microbes are varied, and may differ for different bacterial species. Some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills E. coli and several filamentous fungi. The cytoplasmic membrane {{is a frequent}} target, but peptides may also interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. The initial contact between the peptide and the target organism is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, {{such as in the}} antimicrobial peptide Piscidin. Their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by ‘barrel-stave’, ‘carpet’ or ‘toroidal-pore’ mechanisms. Alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. Intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. However, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. One <b>emerging</b> <b>technique</b> for the study of such mechanisms is dual polarisation interferometry. In contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic. In general the antimicrobial activity of these peptides is determined by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits bacterial growth.|$|E

5000|$|One kind of {{copolymer}} {{is called}} a [...] "block copolymer". Recently the terminology [...] "block polymer" [...] has been used. Block copolymers {{are made up of}} blocks of different polymerized monomers and is usually made by first polymerizing styrene, and then subsequently polymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) from the reactive end of the polystyrene chains. This polymer is a [...] "diblock copolymer" [...] because it contains two different chemical blocks. Triblocks, tetrablocks, multiblocks, etc. can also be made. Diblock copolymers are made using living polymerization techniques, such as atom transfer free radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and living cationic or living anionic polymerizations.

5000|$|CP {{commonly}} causes hemiplegia. [...] Those with hemiplegia {{have limited}} {{use of the}} limbs {{on one side of}} the body, and have normal use of the limbs on the other side.

[...] An <b>emerging</b> <b>technique</b> called constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is designed to address this. [...] In CIMT, the unaffected limbs are constrained, forcing the individual to learn to use the affected limbs.

50|$|Across {{all living}} organisms, {{regulation}} of gene expression {{is controlled by}} interactions between DNA-binding regulatory proteins (transcription factors) and cis-regulatory elements, DNA sequences in or around genes that act as target sites for DNA-binding proteins. By binding to cis-regulatory sequences and to each other, transcription factors fine-tune transcriptional levels by stabilizing/destabilizing binding of RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter.But despite their importance and ubiquity, {{little is known about}} where exactly each of these regulatory proteins binds. Literature suggests that nearly 8% of human genes encode transcription factors and the functions and specificities of their interactions remain largely unexplored. We are {{on the brink of a}} convergence of high-throughput technologies and genomic theory that is allowing researchers to start mapping these interactions on a genome-wide scale. Only recently has a complete survey of DNA-binding specificities been attempted for a large family of DNA-binding domains. B1H is just one <b>emerging</b> <b>technique</b> among many that is useful for studying protein-DNA interactions.|$|E

Social franchising for essential health services is an <b>emerging</b> <b>technique</b> used by governments and aid-donors in developing countries where a substantial percentage of health services are provided by private sector (including non-profit NGOs and private for-profit) to improve access, equity, effectiveness, and quality.

5000|$|Transition metal {{complexes}} {{are widely}} known to play {{important roles in}} erythropoiesis; as such, inorganic supplementation {{is proving to be}} an <b>emerging</b> <b>technique</b> in blood doping. Particularly of note is the cobalt complex, cobalamin (Vitamin B12) commonly used as a dietary supplement. Cobalamin is an important complex used in the manufacture of red blood cells and thus was of interest for potential use in blood doping. Experimental evidence, however, has shown that cobalamin has no effect on erythropoiesis {{in the absence of a}} red blood cell/oxygen deficiency. These results seem to confirm much of what is already known about the functioning of cobalamin. [...] The signaling pathway that induces erythropoietin secretion and subsequently red blood cell manufacture using cobalamin is O2 dependent. Erythropoietin is only secreted in the kidneys when there is an O2 deficiency, as such, RBC manufacture is independent of the amount of cobalamin administered when there is no O2 deficiency. Accordingly, cobalamin is of little to no value in blood doping.|$|E

5000|$|In metallurgy, {{alpha case}} is the oxygen-enriched surface phase that occurs when {{titanium}} and its alloys are exposed to heated air or oxygen. Alpha case is hard and brittle, and tends to create a series of microcracks which will reduce the metal's performance and its fatigue properties. Alpha case can be minimized or avoided by processing titanium at very deep vacuum levels. However once present on the surface, the currently applied method to remove the Alpha case is by the subtractive methods of machining and /or chem milling. An <b>emerging</b> <b>technique</b> is to subject the metal to an electrochemical treatment in molten salts, such as calcium chloride or lithium chloride at elevated temperatures. This method, as proven in laboratory, is effective in removal of the dissolved oxygen from the alpha case, and hence recovery of the metal. However, the unwanted consequence of the high temperature treatment is {{the growth of the}} grains in the metal. Grain growth may be limited by lowering the molten salt temperature.

5000|$|Traditionally {{effective}} masses {{were measured}} using cyclotron resonance, a method in which microwave absorption of a semiconductor {{immersed in a}} magnetic field goes through a sharp peak when the microwave frequency equals the cyclotron frequency [...] In recent years effective masses have more commonly been determined through measurement of band structures using techniques such as angle-resolved photo emission (ARPES) or, most directly, the de Haas-van Alphen effect. Effective masses can also be estimated using the coefficient γ of the linear term in the low-temperature electronic specific heat at constant volume [...] The specific heat depends on the effective mass through the density of states at the Fermi level and as such {{is a measure of}} degeneracy as well as band curvature. Very large estimates of carrier mass from specific heat measurements have given rise to the concept of heavy fermion materials. Since carrier mobility depends on the ratio of carrier collision lifetime [...] to effective mass, masses can in principle be determined from transport measurements, but this method is not practical since carrier collision probabilities are typically not known a priori.
