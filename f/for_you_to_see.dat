500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was {{directed}} by Ernest Dickerson and written by creator Robert Kirkman and showrunner Glen Mazzara. Mazzara teased the episode {{in a conference call}} with various journalists: [...] "We're proud of this finale, we've been building to it all season, and we can't wait <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. [...] There's more bloodshed coming. They thought they were safe on this farm, they were wrong. [...] We're on a killing spree here. [...] There are answers {{about the nature of the}} virus in the finale. [...] I will guarantee people will watch this finale and want to know what comes next. People will have a lot of questions, but in a good way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I suppose {{your wife}} will {{consider}} it quite proper <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her again at my house?" [...] said Lady Canterbridge, with {{a return of}} conventional levity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here's a store, mother--I {{need not}} go out,' said Hal, passing to a pile in the corner. 'It is too dark <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} been glad <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> Miss Walkingham," [...] said her father. [...] "Pretty manners are improving; besides, old Lady Walkingham begged me to send my daughters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O my child, my lovely boy," [...] {{she almost}} sobbed. [...] "It is my fear <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> {{that makes me}} harsh. If I am angry it is but my love that speaks, my rage <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> another come usurping the place beside thy father that should be thine. Ah! but we will prevail, sweet son of mine. I shall {{find a way to}} return that foreign offal to the dung-heap whence it sprang. Trust me, O Marzak! Sh! Thy father comes. Away! Leave me alone with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'There's no use going there,' {{said the}} captain,--his name was Dork,--'there's nothing on that blasted bit of rock <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> There's no port I could run this steamer into.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{after a long}} pause, {{seeing her}} father said nothing, she added, [...] "Perhaps he was waiting <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me alone. I will go down {{to see if he}} is in the carriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sorry}} {{not to find}} you at home this morning," [...] he continued. [...] "I brought my little racing car round <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> I thought you might have liked to try her." ...|$|E
60|$|Cel. Ay, but {{the truth}} is, I am a kind of scandalous person, and <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> in my company--stay in the walks, by this kiss I'll be with you presently.|$|R
6000|$|Almanz. And {{with what}} dangers are you {{threatened}} here? Am I, alas! a foe <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> fear? <b>See,</b> madam, {{at your feet}} this enemy; [...] [Kneels. Without your pity and your love I die.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can you?--will you?--would it be safe <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> on the island? is your {{presence}} {{known to the}} warriors, and would they be pleased to find {{a woman on the}} war-path with them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{at three}} o'clock this morning. It's {{on the front page}} of the early editions of the evening papers. I brought one in <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> only you were so busy. Look! There it is!" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} sinister in his sneering voice and Wyndham said sharply, [...] "It will be prudent <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Bob does not fall ill again. If I meet with any misfortune, {{he will make}} you accountable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And,' added Hector, {{with the}} {{importance}} of his youthful magisterial dignity, 'I hope I have arranged matters <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. I wrote about it; but I am afraid {{you will not be}} able to see him alone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A day or two, {{waiting for}} a boat. I wonder whether you would stay and dine with us this evening?" [...] Then a thought struck Evelyn, and she added: [...] "That is, if it isn't {{undesirable}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> here." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is {{impossible}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a more noble work of passionate Greek chiaroscuro--rejoicing in light. From this I should like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go instantly to Rembrandt's [...] "Portrait of a Burgomaster" [...] (No. 77 in the Exhibition of Old Masters).|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} you despised yourself," [...] said Attwater. [...] "I saw the blood come into your face to-day when you remembered Oxford. And I could have blushed <b>for</b> <b>you</b> myself, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a man, a gentleman, with these two vulgar wolves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{first thing}} to be done," [...] said she, [...] "is <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Earl of Salisbury and ask the hand of his daughter, {{and at the same}} time {{endeavor}} to induce him to join our party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{an order}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. If it was anyone else, I might have my doubts about {{granting}} it, {{but as you}} are the man against whom he played this scurvy trick, I feel safe in doing so.|$|E
6000|$|... "The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Why, {{it is full}} of dust. I {{must get}} it arranged, and put {{straight}} before you go into it. It is not fit <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> sir. It is not, indeed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Whilst hunting game, Elbeg Khaghan saw {{a drop of}} hare {{blood on}} the snow and asked: [...] "Is there a lady with a face white like snow and cheeks red like blood?” Khutkhai Taifu said: “My Khaghan! I know a lady of such beauty”. Khaghan asked him: “Who is that beauty?”. The Taifu spake: “Forbidden <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her. If thou insistest, I shall tell thee”. And Khutkhai Taifu spake: “Princess Lady Öljeitü Huang, spouse of thy son Prince Kharauchog Duuren Temur Huang Taizi {{possesses}} such beauty.” Curious of the beauty of his son's wife, Elbeg Nigülesügchi Khaghan ordered Khutkhai Taifu of Oirad: “My Taifu who helps see the unseen, who helps reach the unreachable and who makes dreams come true. Find her now.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-night again, Fred," [...] said Barret, almost {{pushing his}} friend out. [...] "I have a {{particular}} reason <b>for</b> not wishing <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the fr-, {{the man who is}} coming in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My darling, I {{thought you}} would grow up to feel as I did; I {{thought you would}} thank me <b>for</b> leading <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{such things as the}} blind world is {{incapable}} of seeing. There I made a mistake; and sorely am I punished for it. Don't visit it upon my head in your recollections when I can no longer defend myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] said he, [...] "there's {{one man in}} {{this town}} that wants {{trimming}} up, and it's <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that he gets it. I'm speaking of James Stanger of the Herald. You've seen how he's been opening his mouth against us again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} reddleman abruptly. [...] "It is getting too dark <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> much of her; and, more than that, I {{have no right}} to allow you. Thank God she sleeps so well: I hope she won't wake till she's home." ...|$|E
6000|$|The old {{man turned}} and {{regarded}} her, {{and his voice}} shook. [...] "He has been dead ten days, and besides he--I would not tell you else, but--I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> then, how now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as I bid you," [...] he said sharply, in {{the same}} language. [...] "Effie, my love, give me a kiss and go home. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> coming <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{am going}} <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> {{of one of}} your faults. I have asked <b>you</b> <b>to</b> walk with me, because I {{supposed}} it would be pleasanter <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have me <b>see</b> <b>you</b> privately, than <b>to</b> bring it up in school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor dear Cecilia. She {{has brought}} {{it on her}} own head. I must get into my train now, as we are just off. I am so much obliged <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> coming <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are to {{lie down}} on the sofa and sleep," [...] said Rosamond, kissing her, and she shook her head, [...] "You must. People want {{strength}} for joy as well as grief. Trust him to me, for there is some one <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know not," [...] he answered; [...] "that is <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> to. Yet this is sure, {{that if a}} tree {{grows up}} before {{the house of a}} man, {{shutting}} it off from the sunlight, when that tree is cut down the sun shines upon his house again." ...|$|E
6000|$|One hour passed, and two, and Fairfax rose reluctantly to his feet. [...] "And Cronje was cornered, eh? Well, {{just wait}} a moment till I run over to Tantlatch. He'll be expecting you, and I'll arrange <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him after breakfast. That will be all right, won't it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{the secret}} doctrines {{might not be}} {{discussed}} in public: [...] "Seek not out {{the things that are}} too hard <b>for</b> <b>thee,</b> neither search the things that are above thy strength. But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence; for it is not needful <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> with thine eyes the things that are in secret." [...] It must be studied only by exemplary scholars: [...] "Ma'aseh Bereshit must not be explained before two, nor Ma'aseh Merkabah before one, unless he be wise and understands it by himself," [...] Further commentary notes that the chapter-headings of Ma'aseh Merkabah may be taught, as was done by Rabbi Ḥiyya. According to Yer. Hagigah ii. 1, the teacher read the headings of the chapters, after which, subject to the approval of the teacher, the pupil read {{to the end of the}} chapter, although Rabbi Zera said that even the chapter-headings might be communicated only to a person who was head of a school and was cautious in temperament.|$|R

6000|$|... 'But if {{everybody}} obeyed that rule,' said Alice, {{who was always}} ready for a little argument, 'and if you only spoke when <b>you</b> were spoken <b>to,</b> and the other person always waited <b>for</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>to</b> begin, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> nobody would ever say anything, so that--' ...|$|R
