2500|$|It {{does get}} easier but it's also <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> {{that makes it}} more {{complicated}} ... You're more confident about what you're doing and having some gravitas, {{but at the same}} time, because we're having more and more expectations put on us by everyone, the complexities are increasing. Even Aussie bands that used to take five or six people on the road are now taking 11. That seems to be the magic number, even for a new starting-off band. What they are doing is working to put on the best show they can. Through that the festival needs more production, more riders, more hotel rooms, more everything.|$|E
2500|$|Monson is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} world's top submission grapplers. He is a multiple event winner at NAGA, Grapplers Quest and FILA, among other submission tournaments. He is nicknamed [...] "The Snowman" [...] for his performance at the 1999 Abu Dhabi Combat Club Submission Wrestling World Championship. The Brazilian fighters at the tournament gave him the nickname because he came in as an unknown, but beat four Brazilians in a row to win the 88–98 kilogram weight class. As he went along in the tournament and continued to beat his opponents, they said he was like a snowball (white, compact, rolling and <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> stronger as the tournament went on).|$|E
2500|$|Aslan then {{commands}} Peter to {{shut the}} door on Narnia, and he leads them into his country, a platonic ideal of Narnia. He greets Emeth, a devout yet kind Tash-worshipping Calormene, telling him that [...] "I and Tash are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him." [...] As they get [...] "further up and further in", the Narnians find Aslan's country <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> better, eventually encompassing Earth as well. Digory, Polly, Peter, Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Jill learn that they have died, or rather, passed into Aslan's country, which is more real than the [...] "Shadowlands" [...] (to use Lewis's own word) from which they have come.|$|E

2500|$|She {{revealed}} that {{after she had}} quit University and moved to London, England to focus on her music, she had completely changed her Personal Appearance. She said; [...] "Doing medicine, I {{had to be very}} conservative in how I looked and dressed. But arriving in London from Scotland, it seemed appropriate to ask myself, OK, if you're no longer a medic, who are you?" [...] Sandé took her middle name Emeli on professionally two years before she hit the limelight as Adele had just risen to prominence. [...] "I changed it as soon as Adele came out. I just thought, 'You've kind of taken the [...] now', so I went with my middle name. She was just <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> bigger, so I thought I just really need it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, Terry Anderson {{established}} {{a company called}} Autonomous Tractor Corporation (ATC) located in North Dakota. The SPIRIT driverless tractor {{is a product of}} ATC. Anderson thought tractors were <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> more expensive while not improving in quality. He thus came out of retirement to create the SPIRIT. The tractors Anderson helped create were initially made to follow a main tractor (that has a driver) but are now moving towards independent functioning. [...] Anderson tested half-scale models of his automated tractor design at his second home in Texas. He presented his model at the Big Iron Farm Show in September 2012. Anderson stated that his goal is to build 25 units of his automated tractor in 2013 and sell them at a discount price for farmers to test.|$|E

60|$|The {{boys who}} could not ride on the hill amused {{themselves}} by making some big snowballs, which they allowed to roll down another hill.

60|$|They ran on for {{a couple}} of hours, seeing nothing but the ranks of {{tumbling}} combers, except at intervals when the haze thinned a little and they made out a shadowy mass which might have been high and rocky land over the port side. In the meanwhile the seas were steadily <b>getting</b> <b>bigger,</b> <b>and</b> a good deal of water came in at irregular intervals. By and by, the boys were kept busy bailing it out, and the Indian who was not steering held the sheet of the larger sail.|$|E
60|$|A {{week later}} {{he and his}} army (nearly ten {{thousand}} holluschickie and old seals) went away north to the Sea Cow's tunnel, Kotick leading them, and the seals that stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next spring, when they all met off the fishing banks of the Pacific, Kotick's seals told such tales of the new beaches beyond Sea Cow's tunnel {{that more and more}} seals left Novastoshnah. Of course it was not all done at once, for the seals are not very clever, and they need a long time to turn things over in their minds, but year after year more seals went away from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the quiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through, <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> fatter and stronger each year, while the holluschickie play around him, in that sea where no man comes.|$|E

[...] "I knew {{he was up to}} some foolishness. Well, I must say I don't think Anne needed any more dresses. I made her three good, warm, serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer extravagance. There's enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist, I declare there is. You'll just pamper Anne's vanity, Matthew, and she's as vain as a peacock now. Well, I hope she'll be satisfied at last, for I know she's been hankering after those silly sleeves ever since they came in, although she never said a word after the first. The puffs have been <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> more ridiculous right along; they're as big as balloons now.

There's lots of them flying round on the pond, all blue, with big eyes, and sort of lace wings, very pretty. I caught one, and looked at him, and I think he was the handsomest insect I ever saw. They catch littler creatures than they are to eat, and have a queer kind of hook thing that folds up when they ain't hunting. It likes the sunshine, and dances round all day. Let me see! what else was there to tell about? Oh, I know! The eggs are laid in the water, and {{go down to the}} bottom, and are hatched in the mud. Little ugly things come out of 'em; I can't say the name, but they are brown, and keep having new skins, and <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> bigger. Only think! it takes them two years to be a dragonfly! Now this is the curiousest part of it, so you listen tight, for I don't believe you know it. When it is ready it knows somehow, and the ugly, grubby thing climbs up out of the water on a flag or a bulrush, and bursts open its back." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{some years}} {{there seems to}} have been a {{complete}} arrest of the British imagination in naval and military matters. That declining faculty, never a very active or well-exercised one, staggered up to the conception of a Dreadnought, and seems now to have sat down for good. Its reply to every demand upon it has been [...] "more Dreadnoughts." [...] The future, as we British seem to see it, is an avenue of Dreadnoughts and Super-Dreadnoughts and Super-Super-Dreadnoughts, <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> bigger in a kind of inverted perspective. But the ascendancy of fleets of great battleships in naval warfare, like the phase of huge conscript armies upon land, draws to its close. The progress of invention makes both the big ship and the army crowd more and more vulnerable and less and less effective. A new phase of warfare opens beyond the vista of our current programmes. Smaller, more numerous and various and mobile weapons and craft and contrivances, manned by daring and highly skilled men, must ultimately take the place of those massivenesses. We are entering upon a period in which the invention of methods and material for war is likely to be more rapid and diversified than it has ever been before, and the question of what we have been doing behind the splendid line of our Dreadnoughts to meet the demands of this new phase is one of supreme importance. Knowing, as I do, the imaginative indolence of my countrymen, it is a question I face with something very near to dismay.|$|E

Because of feeding patterns this resulted in Bass <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> Bluegills getting smaller.
