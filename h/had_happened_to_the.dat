5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation. A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, who said {{that they did not know}} what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E
5|$|Schuyler and {{original}} Degrassi series head writer Yan Moore began {{developing a new}} television drama in 1999. As the months progressed, they {{began to think about}} what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> characters of Degrassi High to develop a school-reunion theme. However, they decided that a series would not work effectively if based around adults instead of children. Moore realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school, and development for the series took a new direction by focusing on Emma and her school experiences.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E

5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{ships of}} the 4th destroyer flotilla formed up behind Commander Walter Allen of Broke, {{who was the}} half-flotilla leader and now assumed command. The ships resumed their original position following the fleet, but failed to report to Jellicoe what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> destroyers, or the sighting of German battleships.|$|E

25|$|When the 14th-century {{church of}} St. Stephanos at Abrakunis was visited in 2005, {{it was found}} to have been {{recently}} destroyed, with its site reduced to a few bricks sticking out of loose, bare earth. A similar complete destruction <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 16th century St. Hakop-Hayrapet church in Shurut. The Armenian churches in Norashen, Kırna and Gah that were standing in the 1980s had also vanished.|$|E
25|$|What <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jews {{from the}} ghetto became known when on March 16 and 17, several vans {{returned}} to the ghetto carrying the personal property {{of the people who}} had been murdered. The clothing bore mudstains and signs of having been hastily removed. For example, stockings were still attached to garters. A detail was assigned to sort and clean these items, many of the items were recognized by name tags and other indicia of ownership.|$|E

She had a previous history of running away, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Initially, it was unknown what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victim, as she may have left home {{to start a new life}} and could possibly be alive.|$|E

25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record of what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician a feel for what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> before <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below.|$|R
25|$|Mitchell's {{original}} plan was for The Woodlands to be annexed {{by the city}} of Houston. In the middle part of the 2000s (decade), some residents feared such an annexation, as <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kingwood development almost a decade before. To counteract any possible move by the city, a movement began to create an independent city government. However, the formation of an independent government would require authorization by the State of Texas and the City of Houston, as Houston held extraterritorial jurisdiction over the area.|$|E
25|$|When the war ended, {{both the}} occupying powers and the {{families}} of the deceased began trying to learn what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bodies of those executed. In many cases it was impossible, as documentation was unavailable and what bodies and samples remained were rarely identifiable. The identities of those Stieve did his research on only became known almost 70 years after the war when a list he had compiled in 1946 for a Protestant minister trying to help some of the relatives of Plötzensee inmates find their remains. They were published in a medical journal by another researcher, Sabine Hildebrandt.|$|E
25|$|I wish to firmly {{state that}} the Friars and Sisters of the {{religious}} community in Bethlehem cannot be considered as hostages. They have freely chosen to remain in that place, the custody {{of which has been}} entrusted to them by the Holy See, and which constitutes their home. The other 200 Palestinians besieged inside the Basilica have taken refuge there by force in order to flee from the sweep and search by the Israeli army, just as <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 5 Italian journalists during {{the first day of the}} siege. Up to now they have not committed any act of violence or abuse of power against the religious community.|$|E

She was given copies of letters and other writings which were extensively quoted from in the book. The original edition of the book was published in 1957, one year before the first peaceful contact with the Huaorani was made. In subsequent publications of the book, epilogues have been added to tell about what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Huaorani tribe since Operation Auca, and what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> missionaries' families.|$|R

500|$|The Australasian {{claimed that}} three policemen {{at the ground}} idled and allowed the rioters to attack the Englishmen. [...] They said that the riot [...] "forever made the match memorable {{in the annals of}} New South Wales cricket", and lamented the fact that [...] "rowdyism became rampant {{for the rest of the}} afternoon". The paper asked the {{question}} [...] "What will they say in England?" [...] Wisden condemned the unrest as a [...] "deplorably disgraceful affair" [...] and described the spectators as a [...] "rough and excited mob". Richard Driver of the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) issued a statement of regret for what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tourists.|$|E
500|$|On-stage gimmicks {{have long}} {{been a part of}} {{performances}} at the competition. Lena Philipsson's use of a microphone stand in her performance of [...] "Det gör ont" [...] at the 2004 competition is an example. When Philipsson hosted Melodifestivalen in 2006, four tongue-in-cheek short films were broadcast during the semifinals to show what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> microphone stand in the years since her win. Pyrotechnics are another common gimmick in Melodifestivalen performances. After the 2007 event, Karolina Lassbo of Dagens Media criticised the festival's musical content and production, arguing that the 1988 competition was [...] "the time when Melodifestivalen was still a schlager competition" [...] and the event had become [...] "a cross between [...] Fame Factory and [...] Stadskampen".|$|E
500|$|Writers often extolled McCain for {{his courage}} {{not just in}} war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him. McCain's shift of {{political}} stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> McCain {{they thought they had}} known. [...] By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies, including, as one writer listed, [...] "the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter...." ...|$|E

500|$|The exposed {{sides of}} the hull were {{protected}} by five layers of [...] wrought iron plates, backed by wood. The armor of the gun turret and the pilot house consisted of ten layers of one-inch plates. The ship's deck was protected by armor [...] thick. A [...] soft iron band was fitted {{around the base of}} the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> older s during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. The base of the funnel (ship) was protected to a height of [...] by [...] of armor. A [...] "rifle screen" [...] of [...] armor [...] high was installed on the top of the turret to protected the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M.

500|$|There {{was long}} {{uncertainty}} about what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earl's body. [...] The French chronicler Jehan de Waurin claimed that Arundel had simply been buried in Beauvais. [...] In the mid-nineteenth century, however, the chaplain of the Duke of Norfolk {{came upon the}} will of Arundel's squire, Fulk Eyton, when he died later in 1454. [...] Eyton maintained therein that he had secured the earl's body and brought it back to England, {{for which he had}} been rewarded with a payment of 1400 Marks. [...] The body was disinterred brought back to England, then entombed in the Fitzalan Chapel of Arundel Castle, as Arundel had expressly wished for in his own will. [...] On 16 November 1857, the tomb in the Arundel chapel carrying the earl's effigy was opened. [...] In it was found a skeleton measuring over six feet, with a missing leg.|$|E
500|$|With {{the team}} in limbo whilst the {{ownership}} dispute was judged, Forti's situation was bleak. The team faced the prospect of further heavy FIA-imposed fines for missing races if the situation did not improve, or even exclusion from the championship for bringing the sport into disrepute, as <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Andrea Moda team in [...] Forti withdrew his team from the sport; it did not make an appearance at the Hungarian GP, the Belgian GP, nor at any further point in the championship. Badoer and Montermini were left without drives, and the promising FG03 chassis would no longer race. By the time Shannon Racing won the court case in September, Forti had ceased to exist. Shannon Racing's teams in the lower motorsport categories also closed down. Coincidentally, Guido Forti had signed the 1997 Concorde Agreement shortly before his team's demise, which could have given his team a chance of surviving if it had made it into that year due to the extra television revenue that was duly granted {{to each of the}} teams {{under the terms of the}} agreement.|$|E
