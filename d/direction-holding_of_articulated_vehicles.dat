40|$|The braking {{coordination}} between tractor and semitrailer {{is vital to}} the safety <b>of</b> <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Traditional evaluation about braking coordination is based on the pressure measurement along air braking pipeline, which needs to change original braking structure to install gauges and cannot directly reflect the final braking coordination of different wheels. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel dynamic measurement system for evaluating the braking coordination <b>of</b> <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> During the brake test, all wheel velocities <b>of</b> the whole <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> are synchronously obtained through a specially designed distributed acquisition platform. To effectively eliminate gross errors and noises in wheel angular velocity data, a 3 -order autoregressive (AR) model and an improved-thresholding wavelet filtering algorithm are developed. Further, a novel direct evaluation method about braking coordination is proposed according to the differences in angular velocity dropping time of all wheels.

40|$|In the {{automotive}} domain, adequate control and diagnosis {{rely on the}} use of state observers and parametric identification systems to estimate the dynamics performances of the vehicle. Unfortunately, the simultaneous use of different methods of observation, estimation and identification is not risk-free.

This paper presents a method of observation and estimation of the dynamic state and parameter identification <b>of</b> an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> simultaneously at very low error rates. This method is based on the HOSM (High Order Sliding Modes) approach, with the application of the STA (Super-Twisting Algorithm).

40|$|Once a {{combined}} vehicle becomes unstable, {{it is very}} difficult for a driver to stabilize it especially under severe driving conditions, such as turning with braking. This is mainly due to the effect of the towed vehicle on the towing vehicle through the hitch jackknifing. This effect makes the handling characteristics of a car-caravan combination different from those of a single vehicle. Therefore, this paper proposes a control design concept for an optimum distribution of longitudinal and lateral forces of the four tires of a towing vehicle. The mean objectives of the control system were to stabilize the motion <b>of</b> an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> utilizing the tires entire ability in both longitudinal and lateral directions as well as to make the handling characteristics <b>of</b> an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> similar to those of a single one. The sliding control law based on vehicle planar equations of motion is used to derive the control laws.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to address the problems}} of modeling, path planning and path following for an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> in a realistic environment and in the presence of multiple obstacles. In greater detail, the problem of the kinematic modeling <b>of</b> an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> is revisited through the proposal of a proper model in which the dimensions and properties of the vehicle can be fully described, rather than considering it as a unit point. Based on this approach, nonlinear and linear error kinematics models are proposed that are also able to account for the effect of the slip angles, a factor that can cause dramatic deterioration in the overall performance of the vehicle. Subsequently, two different concepts for addressing the problem of path following for <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are proposed. The first concept is based on a switching model predictive control architecture, which relies on multiple switching linear error dynamics models <b>of</b> the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> to account for the effect of varying the slip angles and cruising speed as well as the mechanical and physical constraints of the vehicle. The second proposed control concept is a novel nonlinear sliding mode controller that introduces continuous sliding surfaces to reduce chattering effects while tracking a reference trajectory. The sliding mode controller is utilized based on the extracted nonlinear error coordinates <b>of</b> the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The feasibility <b>of</b> this approach has been demonstrated through multiple experimental tests on a small scale using a fully realistic <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Finally, in the path planning part of the thesis, artificial potential field and bug algorithms are addressed. More specifically, the potential field path planning algorithm is modified by considering the nonlinear kinematic model <b>of</b> the <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> and correspondingly adapting the repulsive and attractive coefficients. In the case of the well-known bug algorithm, a suitable navigation method for an <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> for local path planning based on a minimum set of sensors and with decreased complexity for online implementation is also proposed. Furthermore, the performance of the modified potential field method has been experimentally evaluated in multiple path planning scenarios using the previously mentioned small-scale realistic <b>articulated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Godkänd; 2015; 20150508 (thanay); Nedanstående person kommer att disputera för avläggande av teknologie doktorsexamen.
