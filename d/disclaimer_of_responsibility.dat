Peterson has called, [...] "a {{remarkable}} <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the violence," [...] Mielke {{declared that}} Honecker's orders to him, [...] "were built on false situation judgments." [...] He added that Honecker's commands on 7 and 8 October, [...] "were false and undifferentiated condemnations {{of those who}} think differently. Despite this evaluation, {{there was never any}} instructions to use violence against persons. There is nothing in our basic principles to consider a demonstration as part of a possible counterrevolutionary coup." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Hedley Byrne, Hedley Byrne, {{advertising}} agents, {{had been}} indirectly informed by Heller & Partners Ltd, the bankers of Easipower, a company wishing {{to place a}} large order, that Easipower was a [...] "respectably constituted company, considered good for its ordinary business engagements". Hedley Byrne relied on this information and subsequently lost over £17,000 when Easipower went into liquidation. The House of Lords held that Heller owed Hedley Byrne a duty of care as they used a special skill for Hedley Byrne and because this skill was relied upon by the company (although the negligence claim was unsuccessful due to a <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> included in Heller's letter).|$|E

Fairfax, in return sent the names of his commissioners; Thomas Hammond, Henry Ireton, Colonels John Lambert, Charles Rich and Robert Harley, Leonard Watson, Majors John Desborough and Thomas Harrison, Thomas Herbert and Hardress Waller; later, the names of Henry Boulstred, John Mills and Matthew Hale were added.|$|E
40|$|EN] The paper investigates how modal hedges (Coates 1983) {{understood}} as expressions of procedural meaning, i. e. expressions which instruct the addressee/reader how {{to process the}} propositional content of an utterance/statement (Watts 2004) are used in product descriptions, advertisements and consumer instructions leaflets {{for a number of}} products belonging to the Consumer Health Care category for the purposes of complying with consumer protection laws {{on the one hand and}} serving as an implicit <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> manufacturer’s <b>responsibility</b> on the other. The analysis is carried out contrastively for two languages, English and Serbian. The results obtained are discussed and viewed as a matter of cultural variety and difference, especially taking into consideration the fact that consumer protection laws seem to be equally strict in US, UK and Commonwealth, Europe and Serbia...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how new media and privacy policies have penetrated the top twelve online newspaper websites in the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania). New media involves new computer communication {{techniques such as}} social networks, mobile applications, blogs, Really Simple Syndication feeds, and forums. New media {{can be used by}} management as a tool to attract new customers, develop a higher awareness of the organization, and stay engaged with customers, marketers, and employees. Results show that the top twelve Latvian newspaper websites make most use of Facebook and Twitter, whereas Estonian newspaper websites tend to use Really Simple Syndication feeds and forums the most among the three countries. Lithuanian newspaper websites have the edge among mobile phone users. Forums and Really Simple Syndication feeds are the most commonly used new media applications among the newspaper sites. Newspaper websites must often balance privacy with freedom of speech, research the readership, and market readers to others. Unfortunately, privacy policies related to new media tend to be inconsistent across newspaper sites. The sites that are more popular on the Internet tend to have the largest protection against transferring reader-provided personal data to third parties. Estonian newspaper websites tend to have the largest number of privacy protections including limits to reader speech, right to edit reader-provided content, <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> of reader-provided content, policies associated with privacy of personal information protected, and a statement announcing infringements of rules incur legal liability for anyone submitting inappropriate content to the newspaper...|$|E

50|$|A <b>Disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> Opinion, {{commonly}} referred to simply as a Disclaimer, is issued when the auditor could not form and consequently refuses to present an opinion on the financial statements. This type of report is issued when the auditor tried to audit an entity but could not complete the work due to various reasons and does not issue an opinion. The <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> opinion report {{can be traced back}} to 1949, when the Statement on Auditing Procedure No. 23: Recommendation Made To Clarify Accountant's Representations When Opinion Is Not Expressed was published in order to provide guidance to auditors in presenting a disclaimer.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was prompted by}} the rise in litigation against public accountants in recent years. The purpose of the {{research was}} to examine whether (1) changes in financial structure, (2) frequency of switching auditors, and (3) frequency of qualifications to the audit report or <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> opinion {{could be used to}} discriminate between engagements which do or do not result in litigation. It was hypothesized that litigate and nonlitigate companies would report significantly different changes in their financial structure during the four years preceding litigation. It was also hypothesized that litigate and nonlitigate companies could be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} frequency of switching auditors and frequency of qualifications to the audit report or <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> opinion. ^ The results indicate that litigate companies, as a group, grew at a faster rate in both asset base and cost of sales than their nonlitigate counterparts. There appeared to be no significant difference in the frequencies with which litigate and nonlitigate companies switched auditors. The results showed that litigate companies tended to have a higher frequency of qualifications to the audit report or <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> opinion than nonlitigate companies. ^ The results of the research indicated that it may be possible to operationally define a benchmark which public accountants could use to assess the risk of litigation associated with specific engagements. ...|$|R
