40|$|Halftone gravure {{has become}} the {{accepted}} front end imaging procedure for the publication gravure industry. Halftone gravure refers to using screened or halftone film when imaging a gravure cylinder. This procedure has allowed the publication gravure industry {{to benefit from the}} prepress advantages of offset printing. Therefore, the possibilities of an allowable color tolerance between a halftone gravure print and a SWOP standard offset press proof in hue, saturation, and brightness needed to be studied.

The experimental design involved the research of the effects of clear extender varnish modifications of <b>gravure</b> <b>inks</b> used to produce an allowable color tolerance between a gravure print and a SWOP standard offset press proof. It was important to compare the gravure print to the SWOP standard offset press proof because the publication gravure industry recognized the SWOP standard offset press proof as the standard or control parameter.

40|$|The {{high shear}} rate {{environment}} of gravure requires very low viscosity, fluid inks. The {{problems associated with}} low viscosity such as spilling, crawling, scumming and crazing, have hindered the development of UV-curable <b>gravure</b> <b>inks.</b> This led the researcher to study UV-curable gravure ink formulation. The effects of oligomer-to-monomer ratio and pigment dispersion loading on white ultraviolet (UV) -curable gravure ink film properties (surface cure efficiency, abrasion resistance, substrate adhesion, and ink film flexibility) were investigated. In this study, molecules normally used as monomers, in UV-curable systems, were selected as oligomers relative to the selected monomer, Glycerol Propoxylate Triacrylate (GPTA). The selected oligomers were, Trimethylolpropane Triacrylate (TMPTA), Trimethylolpropane Ethoxylate Triacrylate (ETMPTA), and a commercially available oligomer, Commerical Product A, used in flexographic ink applications. The outcome of this research created {{a starting point for}} white UV-curable gravure ink formulation, which will be used in the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s family printing business.

First, silver nano-particle {{dispersion}} had been obtained by liquid chemical reduction method with Ag+ concentration as 2. 7 mol/l and UV-vis, SEM {{were used to}} characterize the silver nano-particles. Then, the dispersion was purified by solvent deposit method for three times with acetone acting as the deposit agent and water-based <b>gravure</b> <b>ink</b> was obtained after adding water, resin, and other additives. The silver content and viscosity of the ink were measured by TG and rheometer. Finally, the ink was used to fabricate transparent conductive film (TCF) with PET as the substrate.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Gravure</b> <b>inks</b> are {{frequently}} applied in multiple layers as prints on packaging materials. The mechanical load exerted {{on to the}} combination of the coatings of gravure ink and the package base due to loading, unloading and transportation may develop stresses. The colored inks generally used onto package for printing are white, yellow, magenta, cyan and black consecutively. The primary purpose of the ink layer is visualization of product information and the secondary purpose is to protect the product from change in ambient conditions. These ink coatings are not long-lasting. If the system is not properly designed, these may lead to failure of the coating layers due to mechanical stress. In the present investigation, mechanical properties of free films of different colored inks are measured individually to design proper ink layers on the package. The measured mechanical properties are modulus of elasticity and poisson’s ratio. The mechanical strains developed in the coating layers are also determined by using finite element method. The numerical results are compared with the experimental findings. The main objective of the investigation is to provide better protection of the packaged product leading extended shelf-life of the product...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{water-based}} inks {{have been}} of more and more interest to the printing and ink industry, because of their environmental benefits. Compared with solvent-based inks, water-based inks have more complex formulations because of their higher surface tensions, lower drying speed, foaming problems, pH balance, and different rheological properties. The transition from solvent-based to waterborne inks has been facilitated by advances in both the chemistry and the printing technologies employed. With the new development in rheology modifiers and their increasing application in water-based <b>gravure</b> <b>inks,</b> a more complete investigation of their chemistry, thickening mechanism and effects on water-based gravure ink systems is necessary. This paper explores the significant effects of various rheology modifiers, including non-associative and associative thickeners, on the rheological properties of a water-based rotogravure ink system. Particular emphasis is given to thickening efficiency (viscosity profiles of each rheology modifier in a model system), pH stability, particle size, system compatibility, temperature stability, and printability on vinyl substrates. Wire-wound lab rods and a Moser Sheet-fed Gravure Proofing Machine were employed to produce printed samples for characterizing {{the performance of the}} formulated inks. The purpose of these investigations is to acquire a complete understanding of rheology modifiers ’ effects on the water-based ink system, as well as to help select appropriate rheology modifiers for water-based ink systems in order to achieve better print quality...|$|E
40|$|The Walker and Fetsko ink {{transfer}} {{equation is}} the most used ink transfer equation to predict the ink and paper behavior on the ink transfer step in the printing process. All previous {{studies have shown that}} this equation is mostly applicable in the three major printing processes, letterpress, lithography and gravure. A study by Schaeffer, Fisch and Zettlemoyer reported extensive measurements for several oil-base ink and paper combination over a range of proof-press printing conditions. Yuri Bery did a series of studies for modifying the Walker and Fetsko equation in <b>gravure</b> <b>inks</b> for Weyerhaeuser Company. All the studies showed that although generally the Walker and Fetsko ink transfer equation can be applied to all three major printing processes, there are always some modifications needed for different rheological characteristics and printing conditions. The trends for the lithographic process is toward Web Offset printing. The components of Web Offset ink is quite different from conventional sheetfed lithographic ink in the pigment and vehicle used. This paper is {{to find out if the}} Walker and Fetsko ink transfer equation can be also applied to the Web Offset ink. By investigating the effect of viscosity - one of the most important characteristics in rheology of ink - on the transfer parameters, the ink transfer mechanism model can be examined to see whether it is the same for oil base ink as for the heat-set Web Offset ink. The result of this experiment showed there is a significant different absorption behavior between coated paper and uncoated paper. This difference is effecting the applicability of the Walker and Fetsko ink transfer equation in this particular type of ink and paper combination...|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{the effect}} of solvent types and pigment types on C-type ester-based <b>gravure</b> <b>inks</b> were studied. Three of the widely used solvent types {{and two of the}} pigment types were used in this study. The {{characteristics}} of the modified inks were investigated by measuring the most important physical properties of the inks: (i) surface energy, (ii) contact angle, (iii) viscosity and (iv) substrate adhesion. The experiment results showed that the ink properties changed significantly depending on the solvent type, while pigment type variation had a negligible effect on the ink properties. From this experiment, the most improved properties were obtained in the ethyl-acetate-based ink. In order to further improve the ink properties without suppressing the advantage of this solvent type, small amounts of various aqueous additives and surfactants were added to find suitable formulations. From this stage of study, three ink formulations with suitable printability and wetting properties were achieved. These formulations were C-type ethyl-acetate-based ink with one of the following surfactants; 0. 8 percent of Zonyl FS- 300, 0. 1 percent of Zonyl FSJ, and 12 percent of hexane. The wetting and print performance characteristics of these formulations were tested by practically using them in the pilot press trials. The results from pilot press trials indicated that the new ink formulations with low concentration aqueous surfactants may be used to minimize printing problems such as pinholing and fish-eye effect. However, even the best performance formulation was found to have quite high temperature sensitivity and surface tension higher than the theoretical upper surface tension limit. These, unfortunately, lead to poor printing quality. Therefore, further study is needed to find a better ink formulation with superior properties that will overcome print quality difficulties and completely solve the printing problems...|$|E

The influence of the pH value to the property of ink was analyzed by testing the pH value, viscosity, stetting, and glossiness of the proofs. The result indicates that changing the pH value of ink will affect the viscosity of ink. The pH value can influent {{the release of the}} resin in the ink to the solvent, so the dryness of ink was also influenced.

30|$|Printed {{electronics}} {{device is}} fabricated by several printing methods including the screen printing, gravure printing, and ink-jet printing [5 – 8]. First, screen printing was widely used from long ago {{because it had}} simple printing tools which included stencil and squeegee. However, screen printing is not suitable for fragile substrate due to inevitable contact of stencil with substrate and is not inexpensive because it accompanies large amount of ink. Furthermore, this printing method has a lower resolution than other printing methods. In <b>gravure</b> printing, <b>ink</b> was directly transferred through engraved roll. For this reason, it easily applies to roll-to-roll (R 2 R) process. Gravure printing has benefit of higher throughput because this printing method have advantages such as printable large area and fast printing speed by continuous process. However, a developed R 2 R printing equipment {{can be used by}} ink of one-type and printed structure can be damaged by contact of substrate with roll. Ink-jet printing technology creates a flexible electronics without contact of nozzle with substrate, which produces single droplet contained metal nano-particle through nozzle. This printing method offers relatively lower throughput than other printing methods, because ink-jet printer restricts the number of nozzles and directly draws a circuits of electronics device. However, the resolution is relatively higher than other printing methods, and various substrates are broadly utilized in order to use benefits of ink-jet printing technology. In addition, ink-jet printing provides distinguished advantage such as drop-on-demand printing, no wastage of ink, various functional inks, and non-contact printing. For this reason, research on ink-jet printing technology is required. In particular, RF performance of printed structure has to be investigated in regard to type of substrate because flexible device is fabricated on flexible substrate rather than rigid substrate.|$|R

Conventional printing method that has been studied {{for this kind of}} printed electronic such as flexographic, micro contact printing, screen printing, <b>gravure</b> and <b>ink</b> jet. In flexographic and microcontact printing, a printing plate is used to transfer the designed and desired pattern to substrate through conformed contact. Therefore printing plate is play a big role in this area. Printing plate making by photopolymer which used in flexographic have limitation in achieving a micro-scale of pattern size. However, printing plate of microcontact printing have an advantages in producing micro, even nano-scale size by PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane). Hence, rapid prototyping 3 D printer was used for developing a PDMS micro-scale printing plate which will be used in reel to reel (R 2 R) flexographic due to high speed, low cost, mass production of this type of printing process. The flexibility of 3 D printer in producing any shape of pattern easily, contributed the success of this study. A nickel plating and glass etching master pattern was used in this study too as master pattern mould since 3 D printer has been reached the micro size limitation. The finest multiple solid line array with 1 mm width and 2 mm gap pattern of printing plate was successfully fabricated by 3 D printer master mould due to size limitation of the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3 D printer nozzle itself. However, the micro-scale multiple solid line array of 100 micron and 25 micron successfully made by nikel platting and glass etching master mould respectively.

PVC and PETG {{are widely used}} shrink films printed by gravure process. The variation in <b>ink</b> transfer from <b>gravure</b> cells on to the substrate results in print mottle. The variation is inevitable and requires close monitoring with tight control on process parameters to deliver good dot fidelity. The electrostatic assist in <b>gravure</b> improves the <b>ink</b> transfer efficiency but is greatly influenced by ESA parameters such as air gap (distance between charge bar and impression roller) and voltage.

40|$|Abstract In <b>gravure</b> offset printing, <b>ink</b> is {{transferred}} {{with the help}} of an offset material from a patterned gravure plate to a substrate. This thesis is concerned with the study and further development of this printing process for electronics; on alumina, glass and polymers. The work has been divided into five parts. In the first section, the printing process is described. The second section describes the composition of the <b>inks</b> for <b>gravure</b> offset printing and the resulting ink properties. It also presents the ink transfer mechanism; the model that explains how the ink {{is transferred}} between an offset material and a substrate. The third chapter details the printing process explained by a solvent absorption mechanism. The forth chapter describes the firing/curing of printed samples and their properties. The last chapter describes applications of the method. The inks used to produce conductors on ceramics (ceramic inks) and conductors on polymers (polymer inks) contain silver particles, and were under development for gravure offset printing. The major achieved properties were the high ink pickup to the offset blanket and high transfer percentage to the substrate. 100 % ink transfer from blanket to substrate for ceramic inks and almost 100 % ink transfer for polymer inks was obtained. The printing of ceramic inks was able to produce 8 μm of relatively thick, 300 μm wide lines with < 10 mΩ/sq. resistance. The minimum line width for conducting lines was 35 μm, with one printing. Multi printing was applied producing as many as 10 times wet-on-wet multiprinted lines with 100 % ink transfer from blanket to substrate resulting in a square resistance of 1 mΩ/sq. Polymer inks were able produce a square resistance of 20 mΩ/sq. for 300 μm wide lines after curing at 140 °C for about 15 min, and the minimum width was down to 70 μm. In the optimised manufacturing process, the delay time on the blanket was reduced to 3 s. In addition to ultra-fine-line manufacturing of conductors, the method enables the manufacture of special structures e. g. laser-solder contact pads with 28 / 28 μm lines/spaces resolution. With industrial printing equipment it is possible to produce 100 m 2 /h with the demonstrated printing properties...|$|R
