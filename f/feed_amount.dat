Each group contained a fistulated cow and groups were allocated to 1 of 3 feeding strategies: (1) control (10 groups) : cows were fed crushed wheat grain twice {{daily in the}} milking parlor and ryegrass silage at pasture; (2) partial mixed ration (PMR; 10 groups) : PMR that was isoenergetic to the control diet and fed twice daily on a feed pad; (3) PMR+canola (4 groups) : a proportion of wheat in the PMR was replaced with canola meal to produce more estimated metabolizable protein than other groups. Supplements were fed to the control and PMR cows at 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 kg of DM/d, and to the PMR+canola cows at 14 or 16 kg of DM/d. The PMR-fed cows had a lower incidence of ruminal acidosis compared with controls, and ruminal acidosis increased linearly and quadratically with supplement fed. Yield of milk fat was highest in the PMR+canola cows fed 14 or 16 kg of total supplement DM/d, followed by the PMR-fed cows, and was lowest in controls fed at these amounts; a similar trend was observed for milk fat percentage. Milk protein yield was higher in the PMR+canola cows fed 14 or 16 kg of total supplement DM/d. Milk yield and milk protein percentage were not affected by feeding strategy. Milk, energy-corrected milk, and milk protein yields increased linearly with supplement fed, whereas milk fat percentage decreased. Ruminal butyrate and d-lactate concentrations, acetate-to-propionate ratio, (acetate + butyrate) /propionate, and pH increased in PMR-fed cows compared with controls for all supplement amounts, whereas propionate and valerate concentrations decreased. Ruminal acetate, butyrate, and ammonia concentrations, acetate-to-propionate ratio, (acetate + butyrate) /propionate, and pH linearly decreased with amounts of supplement fed. Ruminal propionate concentration linearly increased and valerate concentration linearly and quadratically increased with supplement <b>feeding</b> <b>amount.</b> The Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant bacterial phyla identified. The Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were the dominant bacterial families, regardless of feeding group, and were influenced by feeding strategy, supplement <b>feeding</b> <b>amount,</b> or both. The Veillonellaceae family decreased in relative abundance in PMR-fed cows compared with controls, and the Streptococcaeae and Lactobacillaceae families were present in only minor relative abundances, regardless of feeding group. Despite large among- and within-group variation in bacterial community composition, distinct bacterial communities occurred among <b>feeding</b> strategies, supplement <b>amounts,</b> and sample times and were associated with ruminal fermentation measures. Control cows fed 16 kg of DM of total supplement per day had the most distinct ruminal bacterial community composition.

Particle size distribution of powders plays a very important role in determining the critical chemical and physical properties of the particulate systems. Precise determination of particle size distribution depends on effective sampling of the powders, which is more pronounced for the particulate systems with a wide particle size distribution. Predominantly, the significant increase in the total surface area of the powders at nanometer scale particle sizes may lead to improper characterization of the bulk if the sampling technique fails to collect and represent them in the analyses. In this study, effects of sampling on the precision of particle size analysis are studied on a clay sample with a wide particle size distribution (particles ranging from nanometer to micrometer sizes) using light scattering technique in aqueous media. Three different sampling methods are applied to systematically analyze the effect of sampling on particle size measurements including; riffling the original sample into sixteen equal parts, sampling the powder after removing the very fine and very coarse size particles and riffling to sixteen parts and finally by riffling the powder to the exact <b>feed</b> <b>amount</b> of the particle size analyzer. The effectiveness of the applied methods were compared statistically by calculating the coefficient of variance (CV) values of the 10 %, 50 % and 90 % passing particle size data of the sequential runs.

This ensemble is called Family 463; also, these single-sized quantum dots (QDs) are termed as magic-sized quantum dots (MSQDs). A magic-sized quantum dot (MSQD) ensemble {{is similar to}} a regular quantum dot (RQD) ensemble but consisting of single-sized nanocrystals; meanwhile, MSQDs do not grow in size any more with longer reaction periods or higher temperature, after their well development during synthesis. The CdSe MSQDs were synthesized via a noninjection one-pot approach with long reaction periods at elevated temperature, with cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(OAc) 2 ̆ 08272 H 2 ̆ 082 O) and elemental selenium as Cd and Se sources, respectively, one long-chain fatty acid as ligands, and 1 -octadecene (ODE) as a reaction medium. Different carboxylic acids with the carbon-chain length ranging from C 2 to C 24, the number of which refers to the total number of carbons, were investigated. Deficient acid <b>feed</b> <b>amount</b> with respect to Cd is crucial for the formation of the CdSe MSQDs, leading to the resulting Cd precursor Cd(OAc) x(OOC-(CH 2 ̆ 082) n-CH 3) 2 ̆ 082 -x (with tunable activity). It was also found that the fatty acids of C 12 -C 18, with low acid-to-Cd and high Cd-to-Se feed molar ratios and the growth temperature of 200 - 240 0 C, are optimum for MSQD Family 463, regarding the yield, purity, and their bandgap photoluminescent (PL) efficiency. Interestingly, in the initial stage of the formation at the growth temperature of 140 - 160 0 C, there may be an 2 ̆ 01 cisomer competing 2 ̆ 01 d process. 93 C solid-state cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicates that the capping carboxylate groups are firmly attached to the nanocrystals, which allows cross-polarization from 9 H of the alkyl chains to 993 Cd. Thus 993 Cd NMR is able to distinguish surface (422 ppm) bonding to both -COO and Se and bulk (680 ppm) Cd species bonding to Se only. The CdSe MSQD Family 463 possesses long shelf-storage stability. The synthetic approach introduced here is ready and reproducible, featuring large-scale production.

Veal calves are typically fed only twice a day, and their meals comprise of large quantities of milk replacer supplemented by solid feed, with little structure to chew on (e. g. Brscic et al., 2011). The inability to perform highly-motivated natural behaviours, such as rumination in cattle, leads {{to the development of}} repetitive, invariant behaviours with no obvious function, termed stereotypies (e. g.

Groups were compared using t test and RM ANOVA. Weight gain was similar in both groups (C 1862 %; U 1662 % of initial body weight). Glucose area under the curve (AUC) was unchanged in C (AUC pre 818634, post 801633 mmol. min. l 21), but increased by 20 % in U (pre 830625, post 1010619 mmol. min. l 21; p, 0. 0001), with an inadequate insulin response to glucose load (log(AUC insulin first 40 minutes) post intervention C 1. 4960. 04 vs U 1. 3660. 04 ng. min. ml 21; p = 0. 03). Insulin tolerance and diurnal variation of plasma cortisol concentrations were not different between groups. Unpredictable feeding impairs insulin response to glucose in growing lambs despite high quality food and normal weight gain. Irregular eating warrants investigation as a potentially remediable risk factor fo...|$|E
40|$|Background: Changes in the survival-rate {{during the}} larval phase may {{strongly}} influence the recruitment level in marine fish species. During the larval phase different 'critical periods' are discussed, e. g. the hatching {{period and the}} first-feeding period. No such information was available for the Baltic cod stock, a commercially important stock showing reproduction failure during the last years. We calculated field-based mortality rates for larval Baltic cod during these phases using basin-wide abundance estimates from two consecutive surveys. Survey information was corrected by three dimensional hydrodynamic model runs. Results: The corrections applied for transport were of variable impact, depending on the prevailing circulation patterns. Especially at high wind forcing scenarios, abundance estimates {{have the potential to}} be biased without accounting for transport processes. In May 1988 mortality between hatch and first <b>feeding</b> <b>amounted</b> to approximately 20...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the cell concentration in fermentation, feeding strategy and <b>feeding</b> <b>amount</b> were optimized. The result showed that glucose feedback feeding strategy is the best one, and glucose concentration should be controlled at 6. 0 g/L during the fermentation of B. subtilis B 579. The final cell concentration was 9. 5 × 10 ^ 9 CFU/mL, which represented a 1. 9 -fold increase when {{compared with those of}} before optimized. Feed-batch fermentation in 7 L fermenter was conducted under the following condition: temperature 37 °C, pH 7. 0, DO 10 %, then supplemented glucose to the fermenter during the fermentation, and kept the glucose concentration at 6. 0 g/L, after 35 h fermentation the final cell concentration was 3. 9 × 10 ^ 10 CFU/mL, which represented a 3. 8 -fold increase compared with those of before optimized...|$|R
40|$|The grain {{required}} to balance a ration high in corn silage {{is much different}} from the grain needed when <b>feeding</b> high <b>amounts</b> of alfalfa hay.
