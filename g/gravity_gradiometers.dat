Similar to optical interferometers, {{atom interferometer}}s measure {{the difference in}} phase between atomic matter waves along different paths. Atom interferometers have many uses in fundamental physics including measurements of the gravitational constant, the fine-structure constant, the universality of free fall, and have been proposed as a method to detect gravitational waves.

50|$|A gravity {{gradiometer}} can independently determine {{the components of}} the gravity vector on a real-time basis. A gravity gradient is simply the spatial derivative of the gravity vector. The gradient {{can be thought of as}} the rate of change of a component of the gravity vector as measured over a small distance. Hence, the gradient can be measured by determining the difference in gravity at two close but distinct points. This principle is embodied in several recent moving-base instruments. The gravity gradient at a point is a tensor, since it is the derivative of each component of the gravity vector taken in each sensitive axis. Thus, the value of any component of the gravity vector can be known all along the path of the vehicle if <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometers</b> are included in the system and their outputs are integrated by the system computer. An accurate gravity model will be computed in real-time and a continuous map of normal gravity, elevation, and anomalous gravity will be available.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of a seesaw-lever force-balancing suspension for a silicon gravity-gradient sensor, a gravity gradiometer, that {{is capable of}} operation over a range of gravity from 0 to 1 [*]g. This allows for both air and space deployment after ground validation. An overall rationale for designing a microelectromechanical systems(MEMS) gravity gradiometer is developed, indicating that a gravity gradiometer based on a torsion-balance, rather than a differential-accelerometer, provides the best approach. The fundamental micromachined element, a seesaw-lever force-balancing suspension, is designed with a low fundamental frequency for in-plane rotation to response gravity gradient but with good rejection of all cross-axis modes. During operation under 1 [*]g, a gravitational force is axially loaded on two straight-beams that perform as a stiff fulcrum for the mass-connection lever without affecting sensitive in-plane rotational sensing. The dynamics of this suspension are analysed by both closed-form and finite element analysis, with good agreement between the two. The suspension has been fabricated using through-wafer deep reactive-ion etching and the dynamics verified both in air and vacuum. The sensitivity of a gravity gradiometer built around this suspension will be dominated by thermal noise, contributing in this case a noise floor of around 10 [*]E/Hz−−−√ 10 [*]E/Hz (1 [*]E[*]=[*] 10 − 9 /s 2) in vacuum.

Next, an integral curvefit procedure is developed for calculating the harmonic coefficients of the gravitational field from known gradiometer data. The procedure only requires calculation of a theoretical observation matrix, thus the orbit determination part of the algorithm is the rate determining step.

Amelioration of this noise requires near simultaneous strain measurements on more than one interferometer baseline, necessitating, for example, more than two satellites for a space-based detector, or two interferometer arms for a ground-based detector. We describe a new detection strategy based on recent advances in optical atomic clocks and atom interferometry which can operate at long-baselines and which is immune to laser frequency noise. Laser frequency noise is suppressed because the signal arises strictly from the light propagation time between two ensembles of atoms. This new class of sensor allows sensitive gravitational wave detection with only a single baseline.
