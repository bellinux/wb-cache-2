40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effects of applying intelligent agent techniques to an online learning environment. The <b>knowbots</b> (or Knowledge Robots) created for the research were intelligent software agents that automated the repetitive tasks of human facilitators {{in a series of}} online workshops. The study specifically captured experimental results of using <b>knowbots</b> in multiple sessions of an ALN (Asynchronous Learning Network) online workshop, Getting Started Creating Online Courses. The study used experimental groups and comparison groups to examine the association between the use of <b>knowbots</b> and workshop completion rates. Also examined were {{the effects of}} <b>knowbots</b> on other factors such as facilitation time and learner satisfaction. The findings indicated that the use of <b>knowbots</b> was positively associated with higher learner completion rates in the workshops. In addition, <b>knowbots</b> implemented a learning-support tool that reminded learners about deadlines. The support <b>knowbots</b> were found to be effective autonomous motivators. In sum, the results of this research suggest that the application of agent technology to online learning holds promise for improving completion rates, learner satisfaction, and motivation...|$|R

One module is a user agent module that runs on the KIS mail host machine. The second module is a remote server module (possibly on a different machine) that interrogates various database services across the network and provides the results to the user agent module in a uniform fashion. Interactions between the two modules can be via messages between <b>Knowbots</b> or by actual movement of <b>Knowbots.</b>|$|R

40|$|Humans are {{not able}} to cope with the {{exponential}} growth of information and the increasing speed of information and business processes fostered by information and communication technologies. Technical support not only for information storage and retrieval but also for information selection, process planning, and decision support is needed. Moreover, the use of a (desktop) computer is restricted in many ways. In this paper, it is predicted that smart and mobile computing units embedded in a variety of things, such as TV sets and cars, will bring computing power close to their users. It is also predicted that users will get closer to computing power by using natural language and by using their social skills in computer mediated communication. A holistic architecture of knowledge robots (<b>knowbots)</b> is described based on multi-agent platforms and distributed computational intelligence. <b>Knowbots</b> consist of a self-learning artificial brain, speech recognition and synthesis, direct access to other software agents and computer programs, and direct connections to networks of human users. It is pointed out that a newly defined partnership between men and machine is a possible way to keep control of the exploding 'infoverse'. Reasoning and simulation mechanisms of currently unthinkable complexity will take over the control of process planning and information exchange.

Newsday commented [...] "game is great, because four kids can play it together on the computer, and it has more than 1,000 questions in seven subject areas, so you are never bored". SuperKids gave the game a rating of 4 out of 5 for educational value, 4.5 out of 5 for kid appeal, and 4 out of 5 for ease of use. Infotech said it was a gaming title of interest. ThinkQuick was selected as one of the games offered for this project where games were donated to the Harmony Public Library for students' learning. Teacher Librarian deemed it [...] "another Carmen Sandiego hit" [...] and a [...] "CD-ROM title of interest". The Daily Herald wrote that the [...] "high-qualify, easy-to-use" [...] title [...] "shows why Carmen Sandiego franchise has been so successful", praising the gameplay mechanic whereby players are alternating between competing in a trivia contest and coorperatively catching Carmen's crooks.

40|$|The World-Wide Web (WWW) is an ever growing, distributed, non-administered, global {{information}} resource. It resides on {{the worldwide}} computer network and allows access to heterogeneous information: text, image, video, sound and graphic data. Currently, this {{wealth of information}} is difficult to mine. One can either manually, slowly and tediously navigate through the WWW or utilize indexes and libraries which are built by automatic search engines (called <b>knowbots</b> or robots). We have designed and are now implementing a high level SQL-like language to support effective and flexible query processing, which addresses the structure and content of WWW nodes and their varied sorts of data. Query results are intuitively presented and continuously maintained when desired. The language itself integrates new utilities and existing Unix tools (e. g. grep, awk). The implementation strategy is to employ existing WWW browsers and Unix tools to the extent possible. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to get past Carmen's Know-Bots and {{correctly}} answer questions to capture Carmen's Master Thieves. At the beginning of each mission, Chase Devineaux, the ACME Detective Agency's top agent will describes the suspect and the vital stolen knowledge. There are three difficulty levels, that cater for three age groups respectively and start players with a certain number of Energy Points. <b>KnowBots</b> will try to stop the ACME agent from disabling them (or delay the destruction and automatic surrender of 1/2 of the code that reveals the suspect's location) by challenging them to several Jeopardy!- like rounds of questions in the subject areas of History, Geography, Math, Crime Scene (which is similar to a memory game), English, Life Science, Physical Science or Art and Music. If the player(s)answer correctly, they gain a certain amount of Knowledge Points dependent on the type of question being asked (For example, Multipick questions are worth 950 Knowledge Points and Rapid Fire Sort questions are worth 200 Knowledge Points apiece). If they get a question incorrect, they lose one point of Capture Energy, which is essential to the capture of the Master Thief. Once at the Master Thief's hideout, the player needs to solve a unique puzzle to enter.|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} {{new field of}} artificial life attempts to study and understand biological life by synthesizing artificial life forms. To paraphrase Chris Langton, {{the founder of the}} field, the goal of artificial life is to “model life as it could be so as to understand life as we know it. ” Arti-ficial life is a very broad discipline which spans such diverse topics as artificial evolution, artificial ecosys-tems, artificial morphogenesis, molecular evolution, and many more. Langton offers a nice overview of the different research questions studied by the discipline [6]. Artificial life shares with artificial intelligence (AI) its interest in synthesizing adaptive autonomous agents. Autonomous agents are computational systems that inhabit some complex, dynamic environment, sense and act autonomously in this environment, and by doing so realize a set of goals or tasks for which they are designed. The goal of building an autonomous agent is as old as the field of AI itself. The artificial life community has initiated a radically different approach to this goal, which focuses on fast, reactive behavior, rather than on knowledge and reasoning, as well as on adaptation and learning. Its approach is largely inspired by biology, and more specifically the field of ethology, which attempts to understand the mechanisms animals use to demonstrate adaptive and successful behavior. Autonomous agents can take many different forms, depending {{on the nature of the}} environment they inhabit. If the environment is the real phys-ical environment, then the agent takes the form of an autonomous robot. Alternatively, one can build 2 D or 3 D animated agents that inhabit simulat-ed physical environments. Finally, so-called <b>knowbots,</b> software agents or interface agents are disembodied entities that inhabit the digital world of computers and computer networks [8]. There are obvious applications for all these types of agents. For example, autonomous robots have been built for surveillance, exploration, and other tasks in environments that are unac-cessible or dangerous for human beings. There is a long tradition of build...|$|R
