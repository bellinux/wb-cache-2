5|$|Pemex {{disallowed}} {{release of}} specific data but let Penfield and company official Antonio Camargo present their results at the 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysicists conference. That year's conference was underattended and their report attracted scant attention. Coincidentally, many experts in impact craters and the K–Pg boundary were attending a separate conference on Earth impacts. Although Penfield <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of geophysical data sets, {{he had no}} rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to the Luftwaffe the Grimbergen Airfield {{was almost}} {{completely}} abandoned. The Evere airfield was located to the south. It {{was one of}} the most densely populated airfields in Belgium and <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of targets. The main force consisted of 60 Spitfire XVIs of No. 127 Wing RAF. Also present were B-17s and B-24s of the Eighth Air Force. Overall, well over 100 aircraft were on the field.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test at Trent Bridge, Hassett {{came in on}} {{the second}} day with Australia at 4/185 in reply to England's 165. Australia had been scoring slowly due to England's use of leg theory. Hassett almost holed out early when he edged a ball just wide of the wicket-keeper. Hassett and Bradman were heckled for their slow batting but they {{remained}} unhurried in the face of England's stifling tactics Australia <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of time after bowling out their opponents easily. Hassett had a period of 20 minutes without scoring.|$|E

5|$|Hassett {{came in at}} 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hooked Hollies for two fours just before stumps. On the second morning, Morris registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in Ashes matches. The innings had taken 208 minutes and included four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped the former for 37. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of time to complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller made five, before Harvey came to the crease and hit two quick boundaries before being dismissed. Hollies took both wickets.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Allies {{lost some}} 8,000,000 tons of shipping, {{and though they}} {{replaced}} 7,000,000 tons, U-boats still managed to sink 1,160 out of the 1,664 Allied ships lost. Most of these sinkings {{took place in the}} mid-Atlantic gap, well within range of long-range Sunderlands and Liberators, only the Command lacked these aircraft in quantity. Following the entry of the United States of America into the war, German U-boats <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of targets. Coastal Command found it difficult to maintain strength. Its units now operated from the United States, West Africa, the Mediterranean, Iceland, Russia, Gibraltar, North Africa and the Middle East. Squadrons were also sent to the Pacific Theatre of Operations.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Forbes named Rowling as {{the first}} person to become a U.S.-dollar billionaire by writing books, the second-richest female {{entertainer}} and the 1,062nd richest person in the world. Rowling disputed the calculations and said she <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of money, but was not a billionaire. The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £600million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK. In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her US$160 million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK meant she was no longer a billionaire. In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.|$|E

5|$|Hassett came in {{with the}} score at 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77 and Hassett 10. The next day, the pair took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of time to complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to string together substantial partnerships and Australia ended at 389. When England batted again, Allan Watkins pulled Doug Ring to the leg side and straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The home team were eventually out for 188 and Australia thus sealed the series 40 with an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{also studied}} living languages, {{political}} economy, and public rights. The authors that most influenced him were Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Adam Smith, and François Quesnay. Belgrano translated Quesnay's book Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole (General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom) to Spanish. His main {{interest in the}} works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity. Like many South American students, he became interested in physiocracy, which stated that new wealth came from nature, that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed, and that the state should not interfere at all with it. By that time, South America <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy. Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by Adam Smith could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani, who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations, and Antonio Genovesi, who thought that the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by the state, such as the provision of free education for some. During his time in Europe, Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of Salamanca devoted to Roman legislation, forensic practice and political economy.|$|E

25|$|Dehydration {{may also}} have been a factor. Amundsen's team <b>had</b> <b>plenty</b> of fuel due to better {{planning}} and soldered fuel cans.

Aside of horses, boats would have played a considerable role in Alodian infrastructure as well.|$|E
