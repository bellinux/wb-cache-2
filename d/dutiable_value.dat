The social services budget, used to fund the country's successful conditional cash transfer (CCT) program named the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), has within 5 years shot up by 9 times to cover what is now 4.62 million households.Purisima helped President Aquino achieve a strong fiscal position for the Philippines by cracking down on corruption, plugging revenue leakages, and strengthening tax administration and enforcement capabilities.

Since inception in 2003 until end-2015, RIPS has charged a total of 271 personalities, 158 of which came from 2010-2015 alone.
