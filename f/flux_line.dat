40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{physical}} {{processes involved in}} the Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) and the Aharonov-Casher (A-C) effects, showing that an incomplete A-B effect knowledge can lead a totally wrong conclusion on the A-C effect. Based on this we demonstrate that the Magnus force, the net force, is the only transverse force on a moving vortex, in analogous to the net charge in A-C effect. This conclusion has been arrived both theoretically and experimentally. Let us begin with a well accepted situation, {{the connection between the}} A-B effect [1] and the A-C effect [2]. The A-C phenomenon is the effect of charges on a moving magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>line,</b> the dual effect of A-B phenomenon of the magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>line</b> effect on moving charges. Within the non-relativistic formulation, those two effects can be formally related to each other by a Galilean transformation. However, the crucial difference between A-B and A-C effects in real calculations is that, for the A-B effect a moving charge ‘sees ’ the net magnetic flux, but for the A-C effect a moving magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>line</b> ‘sees ’ the net charge. It is rather easy to conceive the situation of a <b>flux</b> <b>line</b> in a condensed matter: suppose one knows perfectly well a large A-B effect for conduction electrons, can he draw a definite conclusion on the A-C effect for the moving <b>flux</b> <b>line?</b> The answer is NO, because the net charge for the A-C effect comes from various contributions, and the contribution from conduction electrons is only one of them. For example, the A-C effect can be zero in the case of charge neutrality, and, be either positive or negative depending on the net charge feel by the <b>flux</b> <b>line.</b> Until all charges, valence electrons, ionic background, quarks, [...] , have been considered, the A-B effect for conduction electrons alone can not yield any information on the A-C effect for a moving <b>flux</b> <b>line.</b> This illustrates the pitfall in using the incomplete A-B effect information to 1 deduce the A-C effect.
