5|$|Because of {{the treacherous}} {{conditions}} in which this breed of dog was used, coupled with a succession of accidents, talk of the whole stock becoming extinct was raised as early as 1839. However at some point prior to 1847 a pestilence swept through the region and reduced the number down to a single specimen, which forced the canons into crossing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> breeds.|$|E
5|$|Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei {{became an}} {{important}} film in Vadivelu's career. It continued a trend of films with different themes that focused on social issues. K. Jeshi of The Hindu placed it in a category of films that discuss social issues like Sethu... (1999), Kaadhal (2004), Veyil (2006), Mozhi (2007) and Paruthiveeran (2007). Another critic from The Hindu, Sumit Bhattacharjee, compared <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> period films like The Ten Commandements (1956) Ben-Hur (1959) Titanic (1997), Gladiator (2000), 300 (2007) and Jodhaa Akbar (2008).|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Canterbury City Council began {{a public}} {{consultation}} {{to discuss the}} regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the shopping centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier and replacing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of Red Dead Redemption began in 2005. Rockstar Games published Red Dead Redemption on May 18, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. One of their studios, Rockstar San Diego, oversaw the work, sharing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> studios around the world. The development team considered the game a spiritual successor to Red Dead Revolver. Red Dead Redemption was delayed numerous times through its four-year development, often attributed to technological problems.

Red Dead Redemption was officially announced in 2009; it was heavily promoted and widely anticipated.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The purée {{can be used to make}} blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E
