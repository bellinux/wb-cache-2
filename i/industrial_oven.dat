40|$|AbstractSearching {{for optimal}} baking {{conditions}} for cereal products in industrial ovens {{by trial and}} error is a very costly process. Therefore, a procedure involving a change of scale is often needed, where the baking cycle can be optimized in a much smaller sized pilot oven. The quality and sensory attributes of baked cereal products are linked to the heat flux received by the product during baking. However, the net flux seen by the product can involve complex combinations of heat and mass transfer, chemical reactions and changes in the product over time. A tractable change of scale between the <b>industrial</b> <b>oven</b> and the pilot is based on a simpler flux measurement, which basically takes the process conditions into account. In this article we define baking conditions in the industrial line by measuring the convective and radiative fluxes received by commercial sensors lying on the conveyor belt amongst the products. We show that reproducing these fluxes in a small-sized pilot leads to products with similar color and mass loss to those in the <b>industrial</b> <b>oven.</b> This change of scale (down-scaling) means that baking conditions in the pilot can be optimized with respect to the product properties and the optimized baking cycle can then be replicated in the <b>industrial</b> <b>oven</b> (up-scaling). In order to validate this approach suitable tools are required to quantify the product properties. We highlight the use of image analysis to quantify macroscopic properties (e. g. color) and microscopic properties such as the size distribution of 3 D air cells in the bread upon which sensory and mechanical properties depend...|$|E

40|$|Da bi opravili analizo spreminjanja vsebnosti trihotecenskih mikotoksinov deoksinivalenol (DON) in nivalenol (NIV) v pridelovalni in predelovalni verigi, smo pšenico pridelovali v poljskih poskusih na majhnih parcelicah, jo poželi in očistili z različnimi napravami za čiščenje, nato smo jo zmleli v različne vrste moke in nazadnje spekli kruh. Izvedli smo tudi poskus skladiščenja moke v različnih skladiščnih razmerah. Štiri kultivarje pšenice z različno stopnjo odpornosti (tolerantnosti) na okužbe z glivami, ki povzročajo fuzariozo klasa (FHB), smo gojili v poljskih poskusih. Med cvetenjem smo pšenico okužili s sporami gliv iz rodu Fusarium. Požeto zrnje smo prečistili s pomočjo posebne čistilne naprave, ki je ločila zrnje v štiri velikostne razrede (F 1 > 2, 4 mm, F 2 2, 0 – 2, 4 mm, F 3 1, 8 – 2, 0 mm, F 4 2. 4 mm, F 2 2. 0 – 2. 4 mm, F 3 1. 8 – 2. 0 mm, F 4 < 1. 8 mm). All of {{the four}} grain size {{fractions}} were divided manually further in 4 sub-fractions according to the rate of FHB symptom expression (grain without any visible symptoms, grain with changes of colour without changes of shape, grain with changes in colour and moderate changes in shape or size and heavily infected malformed grain). Deoxynivalenol (DON) content in grain of different fractions was determined by HPLC-UV analysis. A comparisons between initial DON concentration before cleaning and DON concentration in individual fractions after cleaning were done. The cleaning efficacy (rate of DON concentration reduction) due to the cleaning and separating of grain in size fractions was higher in semi tolerant and susceptible cultivars than in FHB tolerant cultivar. In consequence of the low cleaning efficiency, cleaned grin of tolerant cultivar, without any symptom of FHB, contained twice more DON (870 –– 1350 µg/kg) than cleaned and visually healthy grain of semi tolerant cultivar (160 – 570 µg/kg) and contained comparable amount of DON as susceptible cultivar (905 – 1140 µg/kg). Results of trial demonstrate the existence of FHB tolerant cultivar which can bear a high portion of visually healthy grain containing high levels of DON. That grain can not be removed during the standard grain cleaning process. Such tolerant cultivars can contribute a lot to minimisation of yield loss due the FHB, yet they are not suitable for utilisation in the whole-grain wheat flour production. Experiment with milling and baking has showed, that this procedures significantly affect retention of trichothecene toxins (DON and NIV). Impact of three milling techniques (industrial roller-grinder – IRG, grain hammer crasher – IHC, traditional millstone –OMS) and two baking techniques (<b>industrial</b> <b>oven,</b> traditional ceramic stove heated by wood) was observed. Initial values of DON and NIV in grain sample (2500 kg) ranged from 1400 – 1900 µg/kg and 130 – 200 µg/kg, respectively, and were after processing 310 – 370 µg/kg and < 50 – 70 µg/kg in standard industrial flour, 1060 – 1400 µg/kg and 60 – 87 µg/kg in industrial wholegrain flour and 1100 – 1770 µg/kg and 80 – 95 µg/kg in traditional wholegrain fluor, respectively. Six diferent types of bread samples were prepared from this flours and analysed. The average reduction in DON concentration after baking (70 min. at 195 – 235 °C) was 47. 2 % for bread baked in the <b>industrial</b> <b>oven</b> and 48. 7 % for bread baked in the ceramic stove. Concentrations of DON in bread from industrial flour baked in <b>industrial</b> <b>oven</b> were under 500 µg/kg, but values in bread prepared from traditional wholegrain flour were higher (850 – 950 µg/kg). In the flour storage experiment, we didn’t notice any significant differences between storing flour at 10 °C and 25 °C. After 120 days of storage, the concentrations of DON and NIV decreased between 0 % and 29 % compared to the initial values, depending on the combination of experimental factors.

However, multiple operational modes may exist due, for example, to several suppliers of raw materials or seasonal changes.

This paper proposes a new method to identify whether there is one cluster, the most common case, or more than one cluster.

Unlike the many existing clustering methods, the proposed method has the following three features that are critical when analyzing baseline data.

40|$|AbstractMaca, Lepidium meyenii Walpers (Brassicaceae), is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} plant {{native to the}} high plateaus of the Peruvian central Andes. Its underground storage hypocotyls have been a traditional medicinal agent and dietary staple since pre-Columbian times. Reported properties include energizing and fertility-enhancing effects. Published reports {{have focused on the}} benzylalkamides (macamides) present in dry hypocotyls as one of the main bioactive components. Macamides are secondary amides formed by benzylamine and a fatty acid moiety, with varying hydrocarbon chain lengths and degree of unsaturation. Although it has been assumed that they are usually present in fresh undamaged tissues, analyses show them to be essentially absent from them. However, hypocotyls dried by traditional Andean postharvest practices or <b>industrial</b> <b>oven</b> drying contain up to 800 μgg− 1 dry wt (2. 3 μmolg− 1 dry wt) of macamides. In this study, the generation of macamides and their putative precursors were studied during nine-week traditional drying trials at 4200 m altitude and in ovens under laboratory conditions. Freeze–thaw cycles in the open field during drying result in tissue maceration and release of free fatty acids from storage and membrane lipids up to levels of 1200 μgg− 1 dry wt (4. 3 μmolg− 1 dry wt). Endogenous metabolism of the isothiocyanates generated from glucosinolate hydrolysis during drying results in maximal benzylamine values of 4300 μgg− 1 dry wt (40. 2 μmolg− 1 dry wt). Pearson correlation coefficients of the accumulation profiles of benzylamine and free fatty acid to that of macamides showed good values of 0. 898 and 0. 934, respectively, suggesting that both provide sufficient substrate for amide synthesis during the drying process...|$|E

40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>ovens</b> play a {{significant}} role in many manufacturing and process industries. Despite the desire to enhance sustainability throughout this sector, research looking to improve the sustainability of <b>industrial</b> <b>ovens</b> is in its infancy. This paper presents seven sustainability indicators to assess potential oven investment; these include system air flow, production efficiency, operating costs, quality, capital investment, toxicity and employment opportunity. The indicators are straightforward, can be scored with readily available data and have been weighted by industrial experts. A hybrid multi-criteria approach using Fuzzy set theory and Monte Carlo simulation has been developed to help evaluate the sustainability of alternative improvement options. The approach is required as previous methodologies only present desirability as a singular figure; and therefore decision makers are not provided with sufficient information on associated risk. The presented approach incorporates uncertainty throughout, and gives option desirability in terms of mean, standard deviation and variance. The risks using this method are better understood and can significantly aid industrial decision makers. The sustainability indicators and hybrid approach have been demonstrated using a case study in the manufacturing industry; to identify the most sustainable way to increase cure conversion within an oven. Amongst the three options: increasing oven size, increasing oven temperature and new product formulation, increasing oven temperature shows the highest desirability, while new product formulation though has a lower desirability has the highest certainty. Furthermore, a cumulative desirability distribution plot gives a basis to select option that is aligned with the business's risk strategy...|$|R
