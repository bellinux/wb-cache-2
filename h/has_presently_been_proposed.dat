40|$|In the 19 th century {{approximately}} 40 {{fish species}} (excluding freshwater species) {{were recorded in}} the lower Zeeschelde between the Dutch/Belgian border and Antwerpen. In comparison with the 19 th century and {{the first half of}} the 20 th century the total number of fish species in the Beneden-Zeeschelde has decreased considerably.

40|$|Theories {{of gravity}} for which gravitons {{can be treated}} as massive {{particles}} <b>have</b> <b>presently</b> <b>been</b> studied as realistic modifications of General Relativity, and can be tested with cosmological observations. In this work, we study {{the ability of a}} recently proposed theory with massive gravitons, the so-called Visser theory, to explain the measurements of luminosity distance from the Union 2 compilation, the most recent Type-Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) dataset, adopting the current ratio of the total density of non-relativistic matter to the critical density (Ω_m) as a free parameter. We also combine the SNe Ia data with constraints from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and CMB measurements. We find that, for the allowed interval of values for Ω_m, a model based on Visser's theory can produce an accelerated expansion period without any dark energy component, but the combined analysis (SNe Ia + BAO + CMB) shows that the model is disfavored when compared with ΛCDM model.

40|$|Modified gravity, {{known as}} f(R) gravity, <b>has</b> <b>presently</b> <b>been</b> applied to Cosmology as a {{realistic}} alternative to dark energy. For {{this kind of}} gravity {{the expansion of the}} Universe may accelerate while containing only baryonic and cold dark matter. The aim of the present investigation is to place cosmographic constraints on the class of theories of the form f(R) =R - α/R^n within the Palatini approach. Although extensively discussed in recent literature and confronted with several observational data sets, cosmological tests are indeed inconclusive about the true signal of n in this class of theories. This is particularly important to define which kind of corrections (infra-red or high-energy) to general relativity this class of theory indeed represent. We shed some light on this question by examining the evolution of the deceleration parameter q(z) for these theories. We find that for a large range of α, models based on f(R) = R - α/R^n gravity in the Palatini approach can only have positive values for n, placing thus a broad restriction on this class of gravity.

40|$|Vegetative cell {{division}} in Bacillus subtilis takes place precisely {{at the middle}} of the cell to ensure that two viable daughter cells are formed.

The existence of positive regulators has been inferred, but none <b>have</b> <b>presently</b> <b>been</b> identified in B. subtilis. Noc and the Min system belong to negative regulators; Noc prevents division from occurring over the chromosomes, and the Min system inhibits cell division at the poles. Here we report that the morphogenic protein, RodZ, an essential cell shape determinant, is also required for proper septum positioning during vegetative growth. In rodZ mutant cells, the vegetative septum is positioned off center, giving rise to small, round, DNA-containing cells. Searching for the molecular mechanism giving rise to this phenotype led us to discover that RodZ directly interacts with MinJ. We hypothesize that RodZ may aid the Min system in preventing non-medial vegetative division...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since the 1970 's, global {{efforts have}} been going on to replace the high-enriched (> 90 % 235 U), low-density UAlx {{research}} reactor fuel with high-density, low enriched (< 20 % 235 U) replacements. This search is driven by the attempt to reduce the civil use of high-enriched material because of proliferation risks and terrorist threats. American initiatives, such as the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) and the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) program have triggered the development of reliable low-enriched fuel types for these reactors, which can replace the high enriched ones without loss of performance. Most success <b>has</b> <b>presently</b> <b>been</b> obtained with U 3 Si 2 dispersion fuel, which is currently used in many research reactors in the world. However, efforts to search for a replacement with even higher density, which will also allow the conversion of some high flux research reactors that currently cannot change to U 3 Si 2 (eg.
