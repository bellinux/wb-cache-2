2500|$|... "Cadet, <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{have come}} to class wearing the uniform of our {{probable}} military adversary!" [...] (most probably, the instructor means jeans made in the United States) The [...] reply is: [...] "Because they are a probable war trophy!" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. JUNO. That's {{the correct}} {{thing to say}} to a woman of my age. But it doesn't <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> seem to have put your scruples in your pocket when you met me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] Wingate expostulated, [...] "you can't {{threaten}} me, Dredlinton. You {{asked for}} what you got. Why not save time and <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have dragged your wife's name into this business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Considered as testimony, what you've said is sure {{important}} an' conclusive. But I'm calculatin' thet {{the court}} will want to hev <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> stayed from eleven-thirty till one-thirty in thet waitin'-room alone with Stewart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] Tallente interrupted, [...] "one {{never knows}} {{what one is}} up against {{when you are in}} the {{opposite}} camp, Miller. Would <b>you</b> mind <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have sought me out in this singular fashion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} said before; but since I have little faith in such predictions, suppose you change the subject by <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> hold me prisoner, and how long I am {{to be kept in}} this uncomfortable position?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{examined}} it again, and, after comparing my letters with {{those on the}} sovereigns, said: [...] "Pray tell me, now, what you have written here, and <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> write in two different ways?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{the devil}} {{do you expect}} {{we are going to}} escape to? We're helpless. You've got to tow us into somewhere, and <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> fired on us. Mr. Wardrop, we're helpless, aren't we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You quite {{misunderstand}} me, my dear sir," [...] said Sir Robert's hurried voice; [...] "he {{told me you}} had pledged him to secrecy, and he only revealed it to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{wished to}} see me." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the "numbers problem," {{the problem of}} <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should save more people rather than fewer when forced to choose. Existing non-consequentialist approaches to the problem appeal to fairness to <b>explain</b> <b>why.</b> I argue {{that this is a}} mistake and that we can give a more satisfying answer by appealing to requirements of charity or beneficence...|$|R
5000|$|Lawrence Schick {{comments}} that [...] "the rules are really secondary to such guideline sections as 'Acting Appropriately Stupid' (<b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't run away when you suspect there are blood-sucking monsters around) and 'Crummy Endings' (tricks for the GM to pull when a scenario goes wrong, e.g., 'Suddenly {{the sun rises}} and all the monsters shrivel up and die')." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll tell father {{you folks}} {{want to stay}} all night, and that's as much as I need say. If <b>you</b> count on <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have come, it's none of my business. The officer what hired me said I was to keep quiet about {{everything}} I'd seen down to the camp, so I might as well begin by holding my tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are choicely met, Ser Ramiro," [...] I greeted him. Then, {{seeing that}} he only stared, and made no shift to speak: [...] "Maybe," [...] quoth I, [...] "you'll <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> detain me. I am in haste." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you will," [...] he said. [...] "How are {{you going}} to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{recognised}} me as an old pal before lunch if I'm a crook after lunch. You can't give me away without giving yourself away. If I'm not Lord Wisbeach, then you're not Jimmy Crocker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Eric, I want to {{know what}} all this is about. What scrape have you got into? You write me a letter, entreating me in the name of {{friendship}} to come to you at once. Accordingly I come post haste. You seem to be in excellent health yourself. <b>Explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have inveigled me hither." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess it's quite simple, but {{you make}} us tired," [...] the latter said. [...] "You'll {{tell us where}} the chest is, and just fill in that check, with a letter vouching for the bearer and <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> want so much in a hurry. Then, as I said before, you'll ride south with us {{a day or two}} while we arrange for cashing it, after which we'll let you go safely, on our honor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to me, my child," [...] and now {{the little}} woman spoke {{with a degree of}} {{firmness}} which sounded strangely from one so mild, [...] "you are not to go away this day, no matter what may be done later. We will talk about my plan after dinner, and then perhaps you'll feel like <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> think it necessary to go further in search of work after I have given you a chance to earn what you and the dog may need." ...|$|R
25|$|Without {{mentioning}} them by name at all, <b>explain</b> to us <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{are different}} from your opponent.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are wise {{you will}} at once efface yourself. Write to her if you will--make your act of contrition by letter. I will <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have gone without seeing her. I will {{tell her that}} you did so upon my advice, and I will do it tactfully. I am a good diplomat, Gervais. Trust me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As an under-study?" [...] said he, smiling. [...] "Well, if I {{can tell}} them you are out of {{condition}} and not feeling like yourself, {{that will make it}} all right, and will also <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> kept yourself away all the afternoon." [...] With this he left me, promising to return when the guests had departed. It was a long time before he came back, and it was then really dark.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most extraordinary," [...] said Miss Halcombe [...] "I {{should not}} have thought it {{possible}} {{that any of the}} boys had imagination enough to see a ghost. This is a new accession indeed to the hard labour of forming the youthful mind at Limmeridge, and I heartily wish you well through it, Mr. Dempster. In the meantime, let me <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> see me here, and what it is I want." ...|$|E
5000|$|The rear {{licence plate}} is state supplied, while the front plate is owner supplied. This has its {{influence}} on {{the look of the}} front plate, which can be identical to the rear one or similar to a European licence plates with a blue EU flag in it. This <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> often see scratched, dirty, or old number plates on new cars in Belgium. The rear plate is usually mounted on a base plate which displays the letter [...] "B" [...] and usually an advertisement for the car dealer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{thought you}} loved me.' She came closer. She pulled at his sleeve. Her voice {{took on a}} note of soft raillery. 'Don't be absurd, Bill! You mustn't behave like a sulky schoolboy. It isn't like you, this. You surely don't want me to humble myself more than I have done.' She gave a little laugh. 'Why, Bill, I'm proposing to you! I know I've treated you badly, but I've <b>explained</b> <b>why.</b> <b>You</b> must be just enough {{to see that it}} wasn't {{altogether}} my fault. I'm only human. And if I made a mistake I've done all I can do to undo it. I--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, senorita; you can {{go after}} a while. But first you must give me a kiss. Then I will <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> I had <b>you</b> come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{question}} your evidence, Doctor," [...] said Scroggs, {{for the time}} was not arrived that he dared treat him roughly; [...] "nor do I doubt {{the existence of the}} Plaat, since it is your pleasure to swear to it. I would only have you, for your own sake, and the satisfaction of all good Protestants, to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have kept back such a weighty point of information from the King and country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} that," [...] I continued, [...] "and I {{understand your}} feeling of duty. But {{you have other}} duties besides those you owe to your sisterhood. You made me a promise, which I accepted with an honest and confiding heart. If you cannot do what you promised, {{you owe it to}} me to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> cannot do it. I do not know what has happened to change your views and her views, and, so far as I am concerned, the whole world. You can set me right; you can explain everything to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Highness, I {{alone can}} <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> became {{separated}} from your twin. By {{means of a}} fairy enchantment, which I learned years ago, I worked upon you a spell, which compelled your brain to work independent of your sister's brain. It {{seems to me that}} it is better each person should think her own thoughts and live her own life, rather than be yoked to another person and obliged to think and act as a twin, or one-half of a complete whole. And since you are now the one High Ki, and the acknowledged ruler of this country, I will agree to work the same fairy spell on all your people, so that no longer will there be twin minds in all this Land of Twi." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will tell}} you what it is. I want you to <b>explain</b> to me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real reason." ...|$|R
40|$|Why {{can your}} brain store a {{lifetime}} of experiences but process only a few thoughts at once? In this article we discuss “cognitive capacity” (the number of items that can be held “in mind” simultaneously) and suggest that the limit is inherent to processing based on oscillatory brain rhythms, or “brain waves,” which may regulate neural communication. Neurons that “hum” together temporarily “wire” together, allowing the brain to form and re-form networks on the fly, which may explain a hallmark of intelligence and cognition: mental flexibility. But this comes at a cost; {{only a small number}} of thoughts can fit into each wave. This <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should never talk on a mobile phone when driving...|$|R
6000|$|BANNING. It's bad, Mrs. More--bad. There's no disguising it. That {{speech was}} moon-summer madness--Ah! it was! Take {{a lot of}} <b>explaining</b> away. <b>Why</b> did <b>you</b> let him, now? <b>Why</b> did <b>you?</b> Not your views, I'm sure! ...|$|R
6000|$|Under the new Post Office, one evening, Mrs. Landys-Haggert {{turned on}} him, and spoke her mind shortly and without warning. [...] "Mr. Hannasyde," [...] said she, [...] "will you {{be good enough}} to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have {{appointed}} yourself my special cavalier servente? I don't understand it. But I am perfectly certain, somehow or other, that you don't care the least little bit in the world for me." [...] This seems to support, by the way, the theory that no man can act or tell lies to a woman without being found out. Hannasyde was taken off his guard. His defence never was a strong one, because he was always thinking of himself, and he blurted out, before {{he knew what he was}} saying, this inexpedient answer, [...] "No more I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Dinah, {{that their}} passions {{will be so}} much aroused at the {{wholesale}} murder of the whites that they will shoot every black they come across, man or woman, and you would be shot long before you could {{get close enough to}} <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> had come. No, I think the only thing to be done, as far as I can see, is that you should go down {{from time to time to}} let us know how things are going. I do not think that the whites are likely to get very far along the road. You may be sure that when the troops started from the town news was sent at once to the leaders, and it is likely that they will move a great number of men down to oppose them, and will likely enough drive them back. However, the great thing for us is to know where they are and what they are doing. It is likely that now the whites have advanced there will no longer be any watch kept to prevent people, in hiding like ourselves, from going down to the town; if you find out that that is so, we will put madame on her barrow again, and carry her down. Of course we should have to chance being met when going through the forest, but we must risk that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Giuliani, can you <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> being {{a lifelong}} Yankees fan, that this year, after the Yankees lost everything, you rooted for the Red Sox in the postseason? Can {{you explain that}} {{position}} for me? ...|$|E
3000|$|Cells in {{the liver}} and the {{pancreas}} contain both the gene for the protein serum albumin that makes up blood plasma and the gene for protein amylase that helps digest starch. However, only the liver produces the protein serum albumin and only the pancreas produces amylase. Can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why?</b> Can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> how this happens? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dislike explanations," [...] she said, sharply. [...] "Nobody {{ought to}} know that better than you. Perhaps the lady's letter will <b>explain</b> for <b>you.</b> <b>Why</b> have <b>you</b> not looked at it yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't tell you. It is an instinct. By and by {{you will}} just {{naturally}} KNOW {{one from the}} other, but you never {{will be able to}} <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> or how <b>you</b> know them apart' ...|$|R
