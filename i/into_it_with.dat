5|$|One of SSI's first grants {{funded the}} {{development}} of the mass driver, a device first proposed by O'Neill in 1974. Mass drivers are based on the coilgun design, adapted to accelerate a non-magnetic object. One application O'Neill proposed for mass drivers was to throw baseball-sized chunks of ore mined {{from the surface of the}} Moon into space. Once in space, the ore could be used as raw material for building space colonies and solar power satellites. He took a sabbatical from Princeton to work on mass drivers at MIT. There he served as the Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace during the 1976–77 academic year. At MIT, he, Henry H. Kolm, and a group of student volunteers built their first mass driver prototype. The eight-foot (2.5m) long prototype could apply 33g (320m/s2) of acceleration to an object inserted <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> <b>With</b> financial assistance from SSI, later prototypes improved this to 1,800g (18,000m/s2), enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet (160m) long could launch material off the surface of the Moon.|$|E

25|$|The Sparviero had an all wood, low mounted {{cantilever}} wing of isosceles trapezoidal plan, {{built around a}} single spar and covered with stressed plywood skin, with differential ailerons and trailing edge flaps. The fuselage was a ply skinned wooden monocoque, built in two sections which bolted together just aft of the wings. The forward part held the cabin, which seated four in two pairs, with access via two wide doors over the wings. The roof line of the cabin continued aft into that of the rear fuselage. The Sparviero was initially powered by a 250hp (187kW) Hirth inverted V-8 air-cooled engine, though it was the intention to replace this with a 260hp (194kW) Lycoming horizontally opposed engine in production models and the prototype received one later. Fuel was fed from three tanks, two in the wings {{and one in the}} fuselage. The tail unit was conventional, with the tailplane just above the fuselage. The latter tapered in height rearwards and the fin merged <b>into</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a dorsal fillet. The empennage construction was {{similar to that of the}} wing, except that the control surfaces were fabric covered. The tricycle undercarriage was retractable and fitted with hydraulic brakes.|$|E
25|$|Women {{also played}} an {{important}} role in British industrial production during the war, in areas such as metals, chemicals, munitions, shipbuilding and engineering. At the beginning of the war in 1939 17.8% of women made up employment in these industries and by 1943 they made up 38.2%. With the start of the war there was an urgent need to expand the country’s labour force and women were seen as a source of factory labour. Before the war women in industrial production were exclusively on assembly, which was seen as cheap and undemanding work but during the war women were needed in other areas in the production process that were previously done by men such as Lathe operators. The Ministry of Labour created training centres that gave an introduction to the engineering process, and by 1941 women were allowed entrance as the importance of the engineering industry grew and became a large source of female employment. Areas such as aircraft manufacture, light and heavy general engineering and motor vehicle manufacturing all saw an increase in female employment during the war. Aircraft production saw the largest rise in female employment as it rose from 7% in 1935 to 40% in 1944. At the start of the war men who were already in engineering were prevented from going to war because engineering was seen as an important industry to war production but in 1940 there became a need for more female workers to supply the necessary labour for factory expansion. By 1941 with the shortage of skilled labour the Essential Workers Order was introduced which required all skilled workers to register and prevented workers from quitting from jobs that were deemed essential to the war effort without agreement from a National Service Officer. The Registration for the Employment Order in 1941 and the Women of Employment Order in 1942 also attempted to get more women into the workforce. The Women of Employment Order required women ages 18–45 to register for labour exchanges and by 1943 the maximum age was raised to 50, which brought an additional 20,000 women into the workforce. Aircraft production was given the top labour priority and many women were diverted <b>into</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> some even being transferred from agricultural production.|$|E

500|$|The backless {{evening gown}} that Sévérine is wearing {{when she first}} meets Bond was created from black satin and {{decorated}} {{with a total of}} 60,000 Swarovski crystals. The crystals were applied to tulle in a tattoo design that was directly inspired by prints from Swarovski's Paris atelier; they appear on the [...] "arms, neckline, back and sides" [...] of the garment. The dress took six months to complete. Temime designed it based on Rita Hayworth's black dress from the 1946 film Gilda. Designer Stephen Webster created the jewelry for the outfit by looking to modern Gothic style for inspiration. Marlohe said that she had an influence on the final design of the dress. It took a long time for her to get <b>into</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> help from the film's crew; she was sewn into one part of it. Despite this, she said she felt comfortable in it.

On 12 April, he became battalion intelligence officer and he was promoted to lieutenant on 1 May. Coming to the attention of his brigade commander, Brigadier General John Gellibrand, Savige was attached to 6thInfantry Brigade headquarters as a trainee brigade intelligence officer. [...] "We expected a lot of the new B.I.O.," [...] Gellibrand later recalled, [...] "and we got it." [...] Savige served in operations at Pozières and Mouquet Farm in July and August 1916.

Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming <b>into</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary.

500|$|An {{aggressive}} right-handed all-rounder, Loxton {{tended to}} bat in the middle-order, and bowled {{after the new}} ball pacemen. As well as being a belligerent batsman, he was a right-arm fast-medium swing bowler known {{for his ability to}} move the ball, and a powerful outfielder. He had a strong arm and exploited his power frequently, {{to the extent that the}} Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon complained about the jarring impact of his unnecessarily strong throws when the batsmen were already home and no run out was possible. Loxton was known for his energetic and aggressive approach to cricket, and liked to attack and intimidate opposition batsmen. In one match in the late-1950s, he bowled an eight-ball over at New South Welshman Norm O'Neill consisting entirely of bouncers aimed at the upper body. Loxton was not afraid of opposition bowlers doing the same to him; he had a penchant for trying to hook bouncers out of the ground. He was a predominantly back-foot player whose initial foot-movement tended to be back and towards and then across the stumps. When he committed to a back foot shot, Loxton often made such a decisive retreat that he almost stepped onto his stumps. One painter once captured the Victorian almost disturbing the woodwork with his right leg, leading Loxton to quip [...] "That's what I call using the crease". Hassett said that his fellow Victorian [...] "really used to give everything he had all the time... Put him on to bowl and he'd bowl his hardest, no matter how he felt." [...] Bradman said that Loxton [...] "never shirked the issue" [...] and that [...] "he’d throw himself <b>into</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> everything he had. This is one of the reasons he was a great team man. You could call on him at any stage and he’d give you his very best." [...] Bradman said that the Victorian all-rounder [...] "was never a great cricketer in the sense that some others were great, but he was a very good player and what he lacked in ability he made up for in effort". He further added that the Victorian was [...] "the very essence of belligerence...His whole attitude suggests defiance and when he hits the ball it is the music of a sledgehammer." [...] Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, while agreeing that Loxton was always energetic, regarded his bowling as being too dull and predictable to have any major impact at the highest level, and thought that the Victorian all-rounder’s career would have been best served by saving his energy purely for batting.|$|E
