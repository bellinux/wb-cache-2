Studies have shown improvement in the load-carrying capacity of dowel type connections which are reinforced using self-tapping screws. However, there are many variations in <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> screw; the pilot tests for this study have shown that thread configuration can affect the effectiveness of reinforcement. Based on current knowledge, it is difficult to predict which <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> are more suitable and effective for reinforcement in dowel-type connections. In this paper, embedment tests have been carried out to investigate the influence <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> configurations on the performance of self-tapping screws as reinforcement. Further tests were performed to investigate whether the effect identified from the embedment tests can be applied to connections in tension.

40|$|AbstractThread milling {{has become}} quite popular {{in recent years}} as an {{alternative}} to tapping or other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>threading</b> because <b>of</b> diversity and complexity of parts and flexibility of the process in industries such as biomedical applications, aerospace and die-mold manufacturing. Today the design of the tooth profile is, however, predominantly feasible by the expertise and “trial and error” principle. Presented in this paper are a novel methodology to design the tooth profile <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> mill by comparing the “to-be” thread profile and the “as-is” thread profile which is analyzed by means of NC cutting simulation. The simulation kernel enables to continually subtract the swept volume <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> milling cutter undergoing helical movement from the workpiece and to calculate the virtual workpiece (VWP). Combined with the standardized “to-be” thread profile, the tooth profile <b>of</b> to-be-designed <b>thread</b> mill is adaptively modified until the thread profile on VWP and the “to-be” thread profile become congruent with each other. The proposed methodology could be integrated into CAD/CAM systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{rule-based}} language for programming heterogeneous sensor actuator networks. Rules are declarative statements which are evaluated using sensor readings spanning multiple sources. We combine our declarative rules {{system with the}} notion of frequency based operation and communication to allow a compiler to emit a work schedule optimized for minimal power consumption. Combining rules with frequency information also removes the need for concurrency in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>threads.</b> The language presented in this paper is compiled to an intermediate byte-code which can be executed by a reconfigurable virtual machine. Our language is designed to be reliable, energy efficient and expressive, which is achieved through predictable execution, enabling compile time checks and optimizations. 1...|$|R

When rolling {{thread shaft}} in cross wedge rolling, <b>forming</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> is {{affected}} by many process parameters such as the thread helix angle, which is a special and complex parameter. However, there is few study of the effect <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> helix angle on thread shaft forming. In this paper how thread helix angle affects axial metal flow was analyzed {{from the perspective of}} rolling force and the <b>forming</b> process <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> shaft was simulated with different helix angles by the deform- 3 D software. Through the measurement of the point coordinates, the effect of the helix angle on the axial metal flow of rolled pieces was analyzed. Finally, the conclusion was obtained that helix angle causes the asymmetry of axial metal flow with small difference values for asymmetry and the axial metal flow of rolled pieces increases as the helix angle increases. The rolling thread segment can be ensured in the middle of rolled pieces by moving the blank a suitable distance in the reverse direction of the axial flow direction...|$|R

The spider sits stretched out, near the web, waiting for the prey, difficult to detect due to the stick like shape adopted. If an insect flies into the web it is caught in the silk and the spider bites it injecting venom which liquifies the prey's internal organs. The spider then wraps the insect in silk like a parcel and stores it close to the web. The spider then repairs the web.|$|R
