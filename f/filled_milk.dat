25|$|The case {{dealt with}} a federal law that {{prohibited}} <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> (skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat to resemble milk or cream) from being shipped in interstate commerce. The defendant, a company that traded in a form of <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> consisting of condensed skim milk and coconut oil, argued that the law was unconstitutional because of both the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequently, {{most states}} have {{eliminated}} restrictions on <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> and several states have gone against the Supreme Court and struck down restrictions on <b>filled</b> <b>milk.</b> Even the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois that originally {{ruled that a}} rational basis supported the <b>Filled</b> <b>Milk</b> Act reversed their decision in Milnot Co. v. Richardson, 350 F.Supp. 221 (S.D. Ill. 1972). Further, the United States Department of Agriculture has broadly refused to consider <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> products to be [...] "in imitation or semblance of milk" [...] and therefore has declined {{to see them as}} within the statute. The Milnot Company, which still exists, in this case was a descendant of the original Carolene Products Company.

5000|$|<b>Filled</b> <b>milk</b> is any milk, cream, or {{skim milk}} {{that has been}} reconstituted with fats, usually {{vegetable}} oils, from sources other than dairy cows. [...] Pure evaporated <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> is generally considered unsuitable for drinking because of its particular flavor, but is equivalent to unadulterated evaporated milk for baking and cooking purposes. Other <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> products with substituted fat are used to make ice cream, sour cream, whipping cream, and half-and-half substitutes among other dairy products. Coconut oil <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> became a popular cost-saving product sold throughout the United States in the early 20th century. Coconut oil could be cheaply imported, primarily from the Philippines (at the time under American rule), and this product was able to undercut the market for evaporated and condensed milk. At the time, liquid milk was not widely available or very popular because of the rarity of refrigeration and the problems of transportation and storage.|$|E

Many states also passed bans or restrictions on the sale and production of <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> products. The issue of <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> came to the forefront in United States v. Carolene Products Co. wherein Carolene Products Co. was indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois for violation of the Act by the shipment in interstate commerce of certain packages of [...] "Milnut," [...] a compound of condensed skimmed milk and coconut oil made in imitation or semblance of condensed milk or cream.

These responsibilities were entrusted to the Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture in 1907 and were organized into a Food, Drug and Insecticide Administration in 1927, renamed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1931.

This album was his attempt [...] "to create a picture in music of what could be up there in outer space", he explained. [...] "At first I was going to record it with music that was completely out of this world but realized that it would have very little entertainment value so I kept the construction of the music down to earth". He achieved this as a sound engineer by blending the Blue Men's skiffle/rock-and-roll style with a range of sound effects created by such kitchen-sink methods as blowing bubbles in water with a straw, draining water out of a sink, shorting out an electrical circuit and banging partly <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> bottles with spoons; however, one must listen carefully to detect these prosaic origins in the finished product. Another feature of the recordings is the early use of stereophonic sound.|$|E

The diffusion coefficients of triolein migration into chocolate were calculated and correlated with a temperature dependent liquid fat contents within chocolate.

The results are useful to optimize storage temperature and to evaluate quality decrease of multi-layer or coated products...|$|E

40|$|Packaging {{plays an}} {{important}} role in protecting and preserving the quality of food and is therefore significant in any food manufacturing and distribution process. The shelf life of any food is limited due to the occurrence of many deteriorative processes and reactions within the food material. These include physical and chemical reactions and interactions between food and the ambient environment across the packaging material. Milk powder like any other food, is prone to such reactions and interactions with package resulting in degradation of its edible quality due to changes in smell, colour and texture, which ultimately renders it nutritionally and economically unacceptable. During distribution and storage the packaging system needs to stabilize the powder by ensuring optimum storage conditions are maintained. To ensure maximum shelf life it is essential to apply packaging systems that are optimally designed, to meet the requirements with respect to manufacturing as well as product protection in the distribution environment. In this thesis, the interactions between ambient environmental conditions, packaging material properties and the shelf life of a particular <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> powder were investigated. Consequently, the requirements for a packaging system that can provide a two-year shelf life for the powder were determined. The <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> powder is manufactured and packaged in bulk in Europe, imported into Africa via sea freight containers to be repacked into small portion packs and distributed in multiple African countries. Because of Africa's tropical conditions the packaged product is exposed to rather high levels of relative humidity and temperature during transportation and storage which influences the stability of the powder. The storage stability of the <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> powder along with the barrier characteristics of the packaging was assessed in order to evaluate the theoretical shelf life of the powder in its current packaging system...|$|E
40|$|Locative verbs such as pour (1 a) {{and fill}} (1 b) {{have one of}} the two {{following}} types of argument structure: a moving object precedes a location (Figure-frame) or vice versa (Ground-frame). The question is to know how children acquire these structures. Interestingly, English-speaking children between three and six years of age (3; 0 - 6; 0) tend to overgeneralize the Figure-frame, as shown in (1 c) (Bowerman 1982; Gropen et al. 1991; Kim, Landau et Phillips 1999).

40|$|The {{effect of}} four storage {{temperature}} modes (6, 12, 20 and 30 °C) on sensory properties of chocolate products and their colour {{changes in the}} experiment {{over a period of}} 6 months. The results were evaluated with regard to the production technology and composition of chocolate products. The experiment was performed on <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> chocolate product called Orion Pistachio made in four versions such as a standard containing cocoa mass of 35 % referred to retempered variant (RS) and not treated by retempering (NS variant) and with higher proportion of cocoa mass (45 %) stated as retempered variant (R 45) and not treated by retempering (N 45 variant). Retempering means the exposure of products for 24 hours at 24 °C immediately after the production and packaging. The results show that the technology of retempering can effectively increase the resistance of chocolate products to the fat bloom as reflected in the improved colour stability. Sensory most acceptable products were stored at 6 and 12 °C throughout the experiment...|$|E
