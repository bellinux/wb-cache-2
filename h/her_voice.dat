5|$|Turunen's {{voice is}} {{described}} by critics as remarkably powerful and emotional. Sometimes it is stated that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> is too trained or operatic for metal music, but even critics who do not like classical voices admit that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> suits the kind of metal songs she sings unusually well.|$|E
5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness {{that at times}} was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E

5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> for both speaking and singing. She explained the loss of <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, {{the death of her}} parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> box. In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series Why Not? with Shania Twain. Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E
