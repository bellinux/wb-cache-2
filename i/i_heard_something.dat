2500|$|On 15 March 2012, in a {{keynote speech}} to an {{audience}} at the South by Southwest music festival, Bruce Springsteen discussed the Animals' influence on his music at length, stating, [...] "To me, the Animals were a revelation. They were the first records with full-blown class consciousness that I'd ever heard." [...] He said of [...] "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" [...] (written by two New York songwriters, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil): [...] "That's every song I've ever written... That's 'Born to Run,' 'Born in the U.S.A.,' everything I've done for the past 40 years including all the new ones. That struck me so deep. It {{was the first time}} I felt <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> come across the radio that mirrored my home life, my childhood." [...] Saying that his album Darkness on the Edge of Town was [...] "filled with Animals," [...] Springsteen played the opening riffs to [...] "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" [...] and his own [...] "Badlands" [...] back to back, then said, [...] "Listen up, youngsters! [...] This is how successful theft is accomplished!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the months}} {{preceding}} the band's full formation, Love and Erlandson would write and {{record in the}} evenings at a rehearsal space in Hollywood, loaned {{to them by the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers; during the day, Love worked as a stripper to support the band and purchase amplifiers and their backline for live shows. Hole's first official rehearsal took place at Fortress Studios in Hollywood with Love, Erlandson and Lisa Roberts on bass. According to Erlandson, [...] "these two girls show up dressed completely crazy, we set up and they said, [...] "okay, just start playing something." [...] I started playing and they started screaming {{at the top of their}} lungs for two or three hours. Crazy lyrics and screaming. I said to myself, [...] "most people would just run away from this really fast. But <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> in Courtney's voice and lyrics." [...] Initially, the band had no percussion until Love met drummer Caroline Rue, and later recruited a third guitarist, Mike Geisbrecht. Hole's first show took place at Raji's, a small bar in Hollywood, in September 1989. By early 1990, Geisbrecht and Roberts had both left the band, which led to the recruitment of bassist Jill Emery.|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2011, Common {{released}} his first single, titled [...] "Ghetto Dreams", from his next album. A second single,"", {{was released on}} October 4, 2011. On December 20, 2011, Common {{released his}} ninth solo album titled The Dreamer, The Believer. Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label's first compilation album, 2012's Cruel Summer. Common released a song entitled [...] "Sweet", from The Dreamer/The Believer, which included lyrics critical of rappers who sing, although this criticism was not aimed specifically at Canadian recording artist Drake. Drake took offense and responded by releasing [...] "Stay Schemin'", a song with Rick Ross and French Montana. Common fans only had to wait two-and-a-half days for him to respond to Drake's diss track. On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying [...] "It's over. But {{it was all in}} the art of hip hop. He said some things to me so I had to say some things back...I wouldn't say [...] but I know <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> that I felt was directed to me so I addressed it. That's all. But you know, thank God we were able to move forward from it and all is good." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of Moissan, but I {{knew his}} {{artificial}} diamonds were very small. I shook my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know but}} what he did," [...] said Snap. [...] "Perhaps he woke me up and then ran away. <b>I</b> {{certainly}} <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> or felt something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mother, <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> to-day which <b>I</b> feel persuaded {{you don't}} know, and which I {{think you should}} know, of the antecedents of that man I saw here.' ...|$|R
60|$|SMITH. Yes. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> about {{a nephew}} and niece from Ireland.|$|E
6000|$|Surely <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something.</b> Was it a {{bustle of}} {{footsteps}} below stairs? Yes! I hear the horses' feet--I hear the rolling wheels---- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{turned to}} cross the street. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> buzz like a bee, and then I took a long, {{pleasant}} ride with Santos-Dumont.|$|E
6000|$|... "A strange story," [...] said Hugh, [...] "though <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> like it {{in other}} cities through which we have passed. Well, till to-morrow at this hour, friend Basil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rubbish," [...] I said, though <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of {{all that}} story and remembered that Zikali had {{mentioned}} this Nada, comparing her beauty to that of another whom once I knew.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was dressed}} in a white Shroud, and in that only. <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of the story which goes behind that strange costume, and shall later on send it to you. {2} ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's it, is it!" [...] cried {{one of the}} men. [...] "Seems to me <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> about that. Your uncle {{played the}} regular hero act." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I heard. And <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> else," [...] {{continued}} {{the boy from}} Crumville. [...] "When you called to the man to stop he answered back, didn't he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{about ten}} minutes' {{conversation}} I rose to go, and as I did so <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> which--I cannot describe it--something which seemed to--but I really cannot describe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{say he is}} very cunning of fence," [...] {{said the}} king; [...] "and besides, <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of a diamond sword that he stole from the King of the Golden Mines." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} bit creepy all alone on the wharf that night. I don't deny it. Twice <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>'eard</b> <b>something</b> coming up on tip-toe behind me. The second time I was so nervous that I began to sing to keep my spirits up, and I went on singing till three of the hands of the Susan Emily, wot was lying alongside, came up from the fo'c'sle and offered to fight me. I was thankful when {{daylight}} came.|$|R
6000|$|... "`Yes; <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of {{that sort}} from the {{students}} at college, who say that boiling brings flesh more easily away from the bone. But I don't know much about it,' replied Peterkin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] he said, {{or rather}} hesitated, [...] "but don't let me {{interrupt}} your plans. I thought <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> about--about. Salisbury. I {{have something to do}} there." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{seemed to}} {{struggle}} with himself, for <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> like the low, bitter murmur of doubt. [...] "What's the good?" [...] His next words {{came out with a}} hesitating effort.|$|E
60|$|As we {{mounted the}} stairs, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> above me {{that sounded like}} the {{creaking}} of a door. The host heard it also, for he stood suddenly still, his glance very questioning.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I shall not. No one did it," [...] {{said the}} girl, magnanimously. She looked down sidelong at her draperies. [...] "I {{was so afraid}} I had torn my dress! <b>I</b> {{certainly}} <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> rip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{come about}} that little wretch," [...] Miss Milray began, after kissing Clementina. [...] "I didn't know {{but you had}} <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> hadn't, or <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> you hadn't. You know I belong to the Hinkle persuasion: I think Belsky's run his board--as Mr. Hinkle calls it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought I {{would run}} across to see you. <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> so--so--to your discredit, and I know it can't be true! I {{know you are}} {{constancy}} itself; but your constancy produces strange effects in people's eyes!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> like a groan, Captain Spike. I {{wish you}} would let me come out, sir, and I'll go for the chisel myself; them men will never find it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been in New York {{a couple}} of days," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "I want to look around a bit before I invest anything. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of this company before I reached here." ...|$|E
60|$|I listened, and, by Jove, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something,</b> too. My {{room was}} just over the dining-room, and the sound came up to us quite distinctly. Stealthy footsteps, by George! And then a chair falling over.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you think," [...] said I to {{my young}} hostess, [...] "that {{it would do}} {{to tell her that}} <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of her strange history and misfortunes, and wished to offer her a little help? Is she very poor?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of the Heatherstones and of {{the strange}} {{seclusion}} in which they lived, so that I was very much pleased at this opportunity of making their closer acquaintance, and lost no time in complying with her request.|$|R
6000|$|... "If he {{does not}} come by tea-time, we will go and look after him. It seems to me <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> about Sam's troubling him before, haven't I?" [...] asked Miss Celia, ready to defend her protege against all unfair persecution.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> drop," [...] said Dick, as {{the boys}} {{returned}} to the rooms, to put on some clothing. [...] "Hello, here they are! A bunch of keys!" [...] And he held them up.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{heard it}} from the library only last night. I passed the doors as I was going to bed, and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> wailing and praying just as plainly as I hear you. It may be a woman----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is curious, for I {{did when}} I was half asleep fancy that <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of the sort. I waited quite a time, {{but there was}} no more of it, so I {{concluded}} that it was all a dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somewhat curious, certainly," [...] said Media.--"But me-thinks, Babbalanja, {{that somewhere}} <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> about organic functions, so called; which {{may account for}} the {{phenomena}} you mention; and <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> too, me-thinks, of what are called reflex actions of the nerves, which, duly considered, might deprive of its strangeness that story of yours concerning Grande and his body." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, dame," [...] said I, [...] "it {{is a long}} lane {{that has}} no turning. I will not keep from you that <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of this poor fellow, Chrystal Croftangry. He has sown his wild oats, as they say, and has settled into a steady, respectable man." ...|$|R
6000|$|Truly, sir, I {{begin to}} {{understand}} somewhat now. Yes, <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, {{but it will be}} still pricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir? ...|$|R
