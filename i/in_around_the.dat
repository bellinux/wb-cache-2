5|$|The {{city walls}} were rebuilt {{a number of}} times, {{including}} by the Byzantine Empire <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 8th century AD, the Arabs <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 11th century, and the Kingdom of Sicily in the medieval period until the 15th century. Most of the extant fortifications were built by the Order of Saint John between the 16th and 18th centuries.|$|E
5|$|As the VOR {{system was}} phased <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, the LFR was {{gradually}} phased out, mostly disappearing by the 1970s. There are no remaining operational LFR facilities today. At its maximum deployment, there were nearly 400 LFR {{stations in the}} U.S. alone.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. This was done to make the city's perimeter more easily defensible, and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the retrenchment was built by the Arabs, {{it has been suggested that}} it was actually built by the Byzantine Empire <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 8th century, when the threat from the Arabs increased.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} public houses in 1764; The Sluice at Clayhithe which catered {{to the river}} traffic, closed <b>in</b> <b>around</b> 1830, <b>The</b> Chequers, which {{probably}} opened around 1800 and closed <b>in</b> <b>around</b> 1873, and <b>The</b> Crown and Punch Bowl inn which opened in a 17th-century building <b>in</b> <b>around</b> 1764. <b>The</b> Plough and Fleece, occupying a 16th-century building, opened as a pub in the 19th century.|$|R

5|$|Desperate, yet determined, {{units of}} FANK soldiers, {{many of whom}} had run out of ammunition, dug <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> capital and fought until they were overrun as the Khmer Rouge advanced.

5|$|Joseph-François Dailly, {{the first}} actor {{to play the}} role of Passepartout <b>in</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> World in Eighty Days, was cast as Valdemar; another cast member of Around the World, Augustin-Guillemet Alexandre, played {{opposite}} him as Tartelet. Paul-Félix Taillade, who had appeared in The Children of Captain Grant, was cast as Doctor Ox, and Marie Daubrun, a well-known féerie actress who was also the mistress and muse of Charles Baudelaire, played Eva. The production was directed by Paul Clèves (born Paul Collin), the director of the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin from 1879 to 1883. Oscar de Lagoanère, a prolific composer and music director, wrote the music for the play.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E

5|$|The text is {{attributed}} to Yajnavalkya, a revered Vedic sage in Hinduism. He is estimated to have lived <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 8th century BCE, and is associated with several other major ancient texts in Sanskrit, namely the Shukla Yajurveda, the Shatapatha Brahmana, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Dharmasastra named Yājñavalkya Smṛti, Vriddha Yajnavalkya, and Brihad Yajnavalkya. He is also mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas, {{as well as in}} ancient Jainism texts such as the Isibhasiyaim. These references to Yajnavalkya in other texts, in addition to the eponymous Yoga Yajnavalkya, may be to different sages with the same name.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the army}} {{boundary}} on the right, the ROK 1st Division continued its attack northwest and {{advanced to the}} edge of Ka-san. The ROK 11th Regiment seized Hill 755 about dark on September 14, and small elements of the ROK 15th Regiment reached the stone ramparts of the Ka-san area at the same time. The ROK and North Korean troops fought during the night and on into the 15th at many points along the high mountain backbone that extends southeast from Ka-san to Hills 755 and 783 and on to P'algong-san. Prisoners taken by the ROK's estimated that there were about 800 North Koreans on this high ridge. The ROK 1st Division later estimated that approximately 3,000 North Koreans were inside Ka-san's walled perimeter and about 1,500 or 2,000 outside it near the crest. At this time the bulk of the NK 1st Division was gradually withdrawing into Ka-san and its vicinity. Indications were that the NK 13th Division also was withdrawing northward. Aerial observers on the afternoon of September 14 reported that an estimated 500 North Korean troops were moving north from Tabu-dong. While these signs were hopeful, Walker continued to prepare for a final close-in defense of Taegu. As part of this, fourteen battalions of South Korean police dug <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E

5|$|After the {{engagement}} at Le Cornet Malo, C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen {{back to their}} headquarters at Cornet Farm, just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. They therefore dug <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> farmhouse, which lay on the Rue du Paradis, {{the boundary between the}} Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The Norfolks' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30 but despite no support and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17:15, when they ran out of ammunition. During the battle the Germans attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed. SS-Standartenführer Hans Friedemann Götze, commander of the Totenkopf Division's third regiment, was killed in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|During the morning, while a {{diversionary attack}} {{was made by}} the 2/23rd Battalion, and patrols from the 2/24th to the north {{attempted}} to break through, a company from the 2/48th, under the command of Captain Deane Hill, attempted to reach the summit at Sattelberg. Two platoons launched attacks during the early afternoon, but were beaten back by the twenty Japanese defenders that were dug <b>in</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> spur. Late in the afternoon, a third platoon, 11 Platoon, under the command of Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Tom Derrick, attempted another attack from further {{to the right of the}} position but it too was checked by machine-gun fire and lobbed grenades. As the light began to fade, Derrick reported his lack of progress to his company commander and was subsequently ordered to withdraw, so that another attempt could be made in the morning. Derrick's response to this order was to obfuscate, however, and instead of withdrawing, he subsequently led his platoon forward, attacking 10 Japanese positions with grenades as his men supported him with Bren and Owen submachine-gun fire.|$|E
