40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are (i) to assess the actual economic implications of the new European banana policy on prices, consumption and trade in Germany within a theoretical and quantitative analysis; (ii) to elaborate the welfare implications of the European banana market policy on the German banana market from the national compared with the EU's point of view. The new European banana market policy led {{to the introduction of}} a tariff quota system on the formerly unprotected German banana market. This caused a substantial increase in German import prices for bananas, e. g. in 1994 by 95 % compared with the hypothetical situation without trade protection. Further consequences were a strong reduction <b>of</b> <b>import</b> demand and clearly rising import expenditures, by 22 % and 53 % respectively in 1994. The new banana protection on the German market caused substantial losses in consumer surplus: 1039 mill. DM in 1994, as well as deadweight losses. The size of the deadweight losses was clearly higher from the German than from the EU's point of view. High quota rents of European traders and budgetary gains at the EU level compensated a substantial part of German consumer's welfare losses at the EU level. This is much less the case for Germany, given the allocation <b>of</b> <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> in the European banana trade and the common financial system in the EU. Strong and untargeted redistributive consequences were induced by the new European banana policy even within the EU.

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{migration}} is taboo in Japanese {{society is a}} long-held view that has arguably kept this important topic out of mainstream political debates for decades.

This paper proposes that public opinion, particularly among the younger generation, is much more open to the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>importing</b> human capital than is commonly thought; therefore, the time is ripe for a more forthright public debate on immigration that will facilitate greater strategic planning and policymaking more in line with Japan's national interests...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>importing</b> the Internet based {{information}} sources into {{the educational process}} is a controversial one. The Internet is generally regarded by teachers as a socialization space more than a valuable learning environment. Moreover the {{information sources}} posted on the Internet are sometimes questionable as quality and thus hardly usable for educational purposes. Nevertheless, the electronic space is intrinsic to the youngsters’ daily life. Despite its shortcomings, it includes sources of information that are easily accessible and diverse in form and authoring. The issue is then about the educational principles and frameworks that allow the teacher to use Internet in education in a controlled and effective manner. The present paper researches the views of secondary school teachers regarding the school effectiveness of the WebQuest technique as a pedagogical frame for active web based learning...|$|R

The <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> why and how I/E may be a useful theoretical approach to human computer interaction are addressed. Specific problems encountered in importing I/E into HCI are then described. An Interface Evaluation Experiment is discussed.

They further argue that protectionism is often a temporary fix to larger, underlying problems: the declining efficiency and quality of domestic manufacturing. American competition advocacy began to gain significant traction in Washington policy debates in the late 1970s and early 1980s {{as a result of}} increasing pressure on the United States Congress to introduce and pass legislation increasing tariffs and quotas in several large import-sensitive industries. High level trade officials, including commissioners at the U.S. International Trade Commission, pointed out the gaps in legislative and legal mechanisms in place to resolve <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>import</b> competition and relief. They advocated policies for the adjustment of American industries and workers impacted by globalization and not simple reliance on protection.|$|R

Legal education without a sociological perspective will not provide the theoretical tools to understand the complexities of the social world that go beyond the normative and formal logic. This article reveals the difficulties to tackle the conflictual relationship between Law and Sociology of Law, which is a consequence of the epistemological irony of the adoption of philosophical positivism by legal scholars. If Social Science tends to ignore Law as a founding element of social practices, many sociological paradigms mobilized Law as common thread to explain social facts and changes.

We further envision increased interoper-‐ ability of the SO with other OBOs, which would benefit applications beyond sequence annotation. ...|$|R

The factors <b>of</b> <b>import</b> substitution are presented. The main factor is the increase of economic and social security by the modernization of Russian economy. Today, a critical measure of the country’s economic security increase is the implementation <b>of</b> <b>import</b> substitution policy. The <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> economic modernization remains of current interest but stays unsolved, especially in the branches where the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>import</b> substitution is crucial: industry, agriculture, etc. The types of economic activity that can be labeled as open to import substitution are the ones with the high or medium indicators of competitiveness, investment and innovation activity. Within those types, the import substitution policy can be implemented without a threat to economic security. The analysis of the main features <b>of</b> <b>import</b> substitution such as the levels of competitiveness, innovations and investment by the types of economic activity, — is the basis to work out a smart import substitution policy, which will carry no threat to the country’s economic security. The main types of economic activity with the high dependency on import are metallurgical production, chemical industry, wood processing, electrical machines and equipment production, machinery and equipment production, textile manufacture, fishery and fish farming. In the result of the analysis, the following conclusions are drawn: the level of investment for all the types of economic activity presented is critically law; according to the level of innovation and competitiveness, metallurgic production is seen more advantageous on the back of negative dynamics and chemical industry as less advantageous. The other types of activity will face a threat to economic security if the policy <b>of</b> <b>import</b> substitution is implemented without government financin...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of contemporary sugar trade policy in Indonesia highlights {{problems in the}} institutional framework for trade policy making. The institutions through which sugar trade policy is formulated entrench the interests <b>of</b> rent-seeking bureaucrats, <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> holders and traders {{to the detriment of}} consumers and downstream producers of processed products. Moreover, the resulting trade policy regime has problematic effects on sugarcane farmers. The structure of regulatory intervention is due less to democratic pressures than to the inclusion of vested interests in the institutions that formulate policy. Further, the lack of effective mechanisms for inter-ministerial coordination and for resolving conflicting policy preferences among ministries hinders the development of coherent trade policy and obstructs reform efforts. An institutional framework that facilitates representation of all interests affected by sugar trade policies and public scrutiny of the effects of policy intervention is likely to deliver better outcomes for consumers and producers alike. ...|$|R
