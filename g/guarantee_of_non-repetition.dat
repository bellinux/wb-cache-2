40|$|Since its {{independence}} in 1960, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has undergone egregious {{violations of human}} rights and humanitarian law. This study appraises the responses to international crimes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1990 and 2010. It appears from the study that mass atrocities have taken place recurrently during the above period. Millions of people have either died or forcibly fled from their homes as a result of international crimes. This study distinguishes two eras: pre-ICC and post-ICC in relation with the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) 1 July 2002. For the pre-ICC era, it argues that criminal prosecutions (though possible) are no longer opportune, but suggests a focus on the issue of reparation for victims. It mentions that the DRC was unwilling rather than unable to prosecute international crimes prior to the ICC era. It recalls that the UN does not need to appoint an ad hoc tribunal because it has restored peace by non-coercive means. As for the post-ICC era, this study questions the ability of the DRC, the ICC and the UN to counter international crimes. The deterrent effect of national prosecution is lower than that of the ICC, but the ICC suffers from congenital weaknesses, hampering its efficacy. The study highlights the UN s failure to protect civilians. The study suggests a focus on the <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repetition</b> as genuine response to post-ICC crimes. It suggests a strengthening of traditional institutions aimed at protecting civilians (including states and the UN). Furthermore, it suggests the enhancement of judicial bodies at both domestic and international level, including by a lowering of political involvement in judicial matters.

In 2012, the Colombian Congress passed a legal framework for peace, which essentially provided amnesty for those accused of international crimes. While amnesty trades justice for peace, the forgiveness law proposal for Colombia would secure justice and peace together. Unlike amnesty, the forgiveness law proposal is lawful under international law, for it <b>guarantees</b> prosecution <b>of</b> international crimes, discovery of the truth, a fair trial, adjudication of individual criminal responsibility, redress for victims, <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repetition,</b> and mercy for perpetrators.

40|$|The {{strengthening}} of {{international criminal law}} through an increased focus {{on the right to}} reparation and rehabilitation for victims of crimes against humanity represents an important challenge to health professionals, particularly to those in the field of trauma research and treatment. A brief outline of some developments in the field of internatinal law and justice for victims of gross human rights violations is presented, with a focus on the right to reparation including the means for rehabilitation. The fulfillment of this right is a complex endeavor which raises many questions. The road to justice and reparation for those whose rights have been brutally violated is long and burdensome.

40|$|World history {{contains}} countless {{records of}} atrocities committed by humans against humans. Examples this century include the holocaust of World War II, repression and torture under Pinochet's Chile, Argentina's 'dirty war', the forced removal of Aboriginal {{children from their}} families in Australia and widespread and systematic persecution under the South African apartheid regime. The nations responsible have by various processes and procedures sought to respond to these human rights abuses {{in order to move}} on from their pasts. This article examines in detail the responses made by Australia and South Africa to human rights abuses emanating from the removal policies and apartheid policies respectively. The response by the Australian government involved a National Inquiry, while the South African government established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. These mechanisms operated within the international law of reparations framework for victims of human rights abuses. In accordance with this law, reparation includes all types of redress - restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and, satisfaction and <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repetition</b> and consists <b>of</b> material and non-material redress. This article commences with a discussion on the obligations on States under international law to provide reparations for human rights abuses.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the concept <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repetition</b> (GNR) in {{international}} law and to consider how to apply GNR in violations {{of the right to}} health. GNR are, together with compensation, restitution and satisfaction, forms of reparation. Although international tribunals and UN bodies have increasingly made use of this form of reparation, there is no clarity about both the legal status of the obligation to provide GNR, and the scope and reach of this obligation. Moreover, as economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) are often targeted with the claim that their redress requires complex and expensive forms of reparation, {{there is a lack of}} clarity as to whether GNR are applicable to this type of rights and, if they are, how so. This thesis aims to make a twofold contribution to the literature. On the one hand it aims to unpack the elements of the duty of states to provide GNR in international law, whilst on the other, it aims to show a practical application of this form of remedy in a particular ESCR: the right to health. It is argued in this thesis that the obligation to provide GNR has been increasingly recognised in public international law and international human rights law. This thesis will also argue that GNR are best granted in cases of large-scale, gross and serious violations of human rights and when there is a risk of repetition. It will also argue that GNR are equally applicable to all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights; and that there is nothing in either the nature or the concept of the right to health that prevents the application of GNR to the redress of violations to the this right...|$|R
40|$|The Americas, home {{to perhaps}} the most concerted {{domestic}} court effort to prosecute past atrocity crimes in recent times, also has a two-tier regional human rights system that {{came of age in}} the era of mass violations in 1970 s and 1980 s Latin America. Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR) jurisprudence since the late 1990 s can be understood as creating a strong presumption of a present duty to prosecute such crimes, and to actively guarantee corresponding rights to truth, justice, reparations and <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repetition</b> – transitional justice rights – to affected individuals or groups. The recent, 2013, IACtHR verdict in the case Garcia Lucero et al vs. Chile is somewhat unusual in that it deals with the specific reparations needs of a Chilean survivor of dictatorship-era torture now resident in the UK. In doing so, the case challenges conceptions of sufficiency in reparations policy and the geographical reach of state duties in this regard. Perhaps even more strikingly, the verdict also suggests that the Chilean state to have initiated justice proceedings – including a criminal investigation – as soon as one of its administrative reparations programmes received official notification of the allegations of torture made by Mr. García Lucero. The implications of such a verdict are substantial not only for Chile – where at least 100, 000 individuals have made similar applications, and 40, 000 have had their survivor status recognised by a truth commission – but also in raising questions about the judicial status of truth commission proceedings, and the necessarily inter-related nature of truth, justice and reparations dimensions of public policy about past atrocity. The paper considers how these challenges have and may in future play out in Chile’s current treatment of survivors of past torture, and considers the conditions under which resort to regional human rights instances such as the IACtHR may have impact in producing change at state or substate level, whether in the ‘host’ country or elsewhere in the region...|$|R
40|$|At its fifty-third session (2001), the International Law Commission (ILC) finally {{adopted a}} {{complete}} {{text of the}} Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The purpose of those Draft Articles is to define “the secondary rules” which are aimed at determining the legal consequences of a failure to fulfill the obligations established by “the primary rules”. This paper attempts to assess the final results of the ILC’s codification works which had taken nearly 50 years. The term “international responsibility” covers the new legal relations which arise under international law by reason of the internationally wrongful act of a state. They occur between a state which has committed such an act and an injured state or states. An internationally wrongful act of a state occurs when conduct consisting of an action or its omission is attributable to the state under international law and constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that state. The content of new rights and obligations is specified in Part Two (Content of the International Responsibility) and Part Three (Implementation o f the International Responsibility) of the Draft Articles. The obligations of the responsible state to cease the wrongful conduct if it is continuing; to offer appropriate assurances and <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repetition</b> if circumstances so require, and to make full reparation for the injury caused are the core legal consequences of an internationally wrongful act. A serious breach of an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of general international law may entail further consequences. In {{the event of a}} serious breach of ius cogens rules all states are obliged to cooperate in order to bring such a breach to an end, not to recognize as lawful the situation created by that act and not to render aid or assistance to the responsible state to maintain the situation so created. The implementation of state responsibility is, in the first place, an entitlement of “the injured state”. This concept refers to the state whose individual right has been infringed by the internationally wrongful act or which has been particularly affected by it. In case of breaches of obligations protecting the collective interests of a group of states or the international community as a whole, responsibility may be invoked by states which are not themselves “injured” in the sense of Articl...|$|R

To {{get the full}} text please contact the other at babiker 69 @hotmail. com•	The author argues that amongst the factors which {{have led to the}} increase of tribal conflict in southern Sudan is the dissolution or weakening of native administration as in the case in northern Sudan. Native administration weakened in the south due to political manipulation and exploitation of the southern tribes in order to realize political objectives. In this context the author has referred to southern tribes which have played an important and key roles in the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement and the subsequent division of the south into regions so as to avoid domination of certain tribes (i. e. Dinka). •	The author has also focused on dispute resolution mechanisms in southern Sudan through Agaweed system which is also followed in other parts of Sudan (i. e. Darfur, southern Kordofan, and central Sudan). In this respect, the author argues that the Agaweed mechanism in the south is key and fundamental in resolving tribal conflicts and other types of disputes. The author also pays special attention to tribal Courts in the south which entrusted to apply customary laws in most civil cases. The Sultans courts, for example, play pivotal role in issuing judgements. These courts constituted from Agaweed members who are neural to the dispute in question. •	The author argues that tribal dispute resolutions is normally realized through certain steps or procedural measures including the following: (a) outreach to the parties to the conflict to convince them to come to the negotiation table; (b) conclude an immediate ceasefire without conditions; (c) identify loss of life and property; (c) offer condolences to families of the victims and provide necessary support; (d) invite the parties and listen to their concerns and grievances; (e) reach a consensus on contentious issues; (f) set up special arbitration or conciliation committees; (g) provide diya (blood money) and other forms of reparations in accordance with recognized customs of the disputing parties; (h) provide <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repetition</b> that the conflict will not resume; (i) parties to the dispute sign an agreement including modalities of implementation or follow up to what shall be honoured and implemented; (j) the government or rebel movement controlling the territory may attend to witness singing of the agreement. The ultimate purpose of the above steps is not to punish one of the parties or to take sides but to resolve the root causes of the dispute in accordance with the recognized tribal customs. •	The author strongly argues that dispute resolution based on tribal customs is essential to ensure communal peace as well as conflict prevention. Therefore, strengthening these tribal mechanisms through dissemination of tribal 'conciliatory' customs is of utmost importance. Traditional mechanisms can be regarded as a national heritage and aids the federal system of government...|$|R

In Brazilian case, the transitional governments and subsequent civil administrations dealt with the disappearance cases discussing the relevance of compensation under {{the decisions of the}} Amnesty Commission and the Special Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances. It is evident that Brazilian Human Rights organizations and activists have pursued a wide range of reparative goals corresponding to what the UN calls restitution, satisfaction, and <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-repetition.</b> In according to the document, restitution involves, “whenever possible, restor[ing] the victim to the original situation before the gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of humanitarian law occurred”. It also involves satisfaction measures which tends to encompass still more specific instances of restitution, such as “the search for the whereabouts of the disappeared for the bodies of those killed [and] assistance in the recovery, identification and reburial of the bodies in accordance with the expressed or presumed wish of the victims. The core value of transitional justice is the notion of justice: not necessarily criminal justice, but other forms of justice as well. This notion and the political transformation, such as regime change or transition from conflict, are thus linked toward a more peaceful, certain and democratic future. This thesis aims at understanding, from an anthropological perspective, the meaning of the actions for providing reparations to families of people who disappeared in circumstances of conflict or repression under former dictatorship. The research highlights that the impact of disappearances on the families is still devastating and long lasting, leaving them in a terrible limbo, unable to find closure. It also highlights that the victims are seeking the truth about what happened to the victims, because those actions would encompass the initiative that would allow to the actors in a country to investigate past abuses and seek redress for victims. These processes aim to enable societies to examine and come to terms with past crimes and human rights violations in order to prevent their recurrence. They help create documentation that prevents repressive regimes from rewriting history and denying the past. They can also help victims obtain closure by knowing the truth about what actually happened (such as to “disappeared” people) and understanding the atrocities they endured. Truth-seeking measures may include freedom of information legislation, declassification of archives, investigations, and truth commissions. At the same time, it reaches beyond the immediate communities of the disappeared, affecting entire societies grappling with the legacy of unresolved crimes and the obligation to provide families with the truth about the fate of their loved ones. Thus, from the “native” point of view, the former commissions restored only material damage, discarding the damages, which were the major injuries sustained by victims of political persecution.

The focus of debate now turns to the UNGA Sixth Committee, which will have to decide what to make of the Draft Articles. The ILC itself recommended an initial resolution taking note of the Articles, with subsequent consideration (after a period of years) of a possible diplomatic conference with a view to concluding a convention. This modest proposal allows for further reflection on the text and may help to avoid possibly divisive and inconclusive debate in the Sixth Committee. At the same time it allows time for better understanding of the many changes made as compared with the first reading text (1996) ...|$|R
