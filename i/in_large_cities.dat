5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Percherons {{also began to}} be {{exported}} from the United States to Great Britain, where {{they were used to}} pull horse-drawn buses <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>cities.</b> The first Percherons imported to Britain included some of the thousands of crossbreds from the United States. In Britain, many of the horses, once they finished their bus-pulling career, were sold to farmers. Other imported horses were sold to the British Army, and in 1900, 325 horses were shipped to South Africa for use in the Boer War.|$|E
5|$|People {{who live}} <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> {{have a higher}} rate of COPD {{compared}} to people who live in rural areas. While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in exacerbations, its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear. Areas with poor outdoor air quality, including that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of COPD. The overall effect in relation to smoking, however, is believed to be small.|$|E
30|$|The {{location}} also positively moderates {{the relation}} between EO and venture performance. Firms located <b>in</b> the <b>larger</b> <b>city</b> are more innovative, proactive, competitive and autonomous than firms established in regional towns. These are because of high competition <b>in</b> the <b>large</b> <b>city,</b> which encourage firms to innovate {{a new way of}} doing things and technology that helps to produce new products, and to search for new markets. A risk is associated with activities that have good promise to return. As a result, firms <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> <b>cities</b> are more autonomous and risk takers. In general, firms involved with the manufacturing sector and adopting strong EO tend to perform more than their relatives. Besides, firms located <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> <b>cities</b> that adopt EO grow much better than enterprises established in regional towns. More specifically, the performance of ventures <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> <b>cities</b> is better than the ventures in regional towns because of the better practice of EO <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> <b>cities.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>cities.</b> The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.|$|E
5|$|Republican leaders {{struggled}} {{to come to}} terms with popular sentiment; some wanted passionate armed struggle; others a more reasoned approach. Some leaders, such as the leftist Tan Malaka, spread the idea that this was a revolutionary struggle to be led and won by the Indonesian pemuda. Sukarno and Hatta, in contrast, were more interested in planning out a government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy. Pro-revolution demonstrations took place <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>cities,</b> including one led by Tan Malaka in Jakarta with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>large</b> <b>cities,</b> a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

5|$|The Percheron is {{the most}} famous and populous of all French draft breeds in the world today. They were used to improve both the Ardennes and Vladimir Heavy Draft horses, and to create the Spanish-Norman breed, a cross between the Andalusian and the Percheron.

The Percheron is still used extensively for draft work and, like other draft breeds, it is also used in France for meat production.
