Outside of court, LaRouche denied all the charges, calling them [...] "an all-out frame-up by a state and federal task force," [...] {{and said that the}} federal government was trying to kill him. [...] "The purpose of this frame-up is not to send me to prison. It's to kill me," [...] LaRouche said.

500|$|When Stickells {{expressed}} concern that the arrest might jeopardize the concert that was scheduled for that night at Maple Leaf Gardens, the booking detective assured them that he would [...] "get it done as quickly" [...] as he could because his children had tickets for the event; he commented: [...] "they'll <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I don't get [...] out." [...] Management at the Gardens pressured the Toronto police department to release him, complaining that the sell-out crowd of 18,000 fans might riot if they canceled the show. He was released by 8 p.m. and escorted to the venue by the police, who remained at the arena throughout the performance. He displayed a jovial attitude during the concert, joking with the audience and singing in a mock operatic style for comedic effect. In light of the arrest, he altered the lyrics to [...] "Red House", singing [...] "soon as I get out of jail, I wanna see her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lagun Ein's honesty {{almost got}} him {{executed}} in 1408. That year, Ava forces invaded the southern country, and got bogged down amidst the monsoon season. When King Minkhaung {{asked for a}} truce, Razadarit planned to assassinate him at the negotiating table. Lagun Ein was the lowest ranking member of the 30-member Hanthawaddy delegation led by Byat Za to negotiate the ceasefire terms with their Ava counterparts, and {{to set up a}} meeting between the two kings. During the negotiations, the Ava commander Thado routinely asked Lagun Ein if Pegu was negotiating in good faith. Lagun Ein answered with brutal honesty: [...] "Fool, this is war. You'll <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> you can. I'll kill you if I can. How can you trust anyone?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Sackveille-West's novel Challenge also bears {{witness to}} her affair with Trefusis: Sackville-West and Trefusis had started {{writing this book}} as a {{collaborative}} endeavour, and the male character's name, Julian, had been Sackville-West's nickname when passing as a man. Challenge is a roman à clef with the character of Julian being only a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Trefusis. Notably, Sackville-West in Challenge defends Trefusis against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Trefussis a [...] "swine" [...] and a [...] "pig", and in the book Julian goes {{out of his way}} to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig. In the book, Julian says that [...] "Eve is not a 'little swine', she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine". Reflecting her obsession with the Romany people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romany woman with an [...] "insinuating femininity" [...] that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence. [...] Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: [...] "Don't please dedicate it to Violet, it would <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> you did". When Challenge was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romany reading: [...] "This book is yours, honored witch. If you read it, you will find your tormented soul changed and free". Throughout their relationship, Trefusis was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally attempts to drown herself in the sea while Julian tries to come to her rescue. As Eve changes her mind about taking her life and tries to swim ashore as Julian swims out to her, it is too late and she is swept away by the tide to drown. The book's ending reflected Sackville-West's guilt about breaking her relationship with Trefusis. Her mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita's son Nigel Nicolson (1973, p.194) praises his mother: [...] "She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything… How could she regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?" ...|$|E
