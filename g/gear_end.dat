The Stig's primary {{role on the}} show is at the Top Gear test track at the show's base at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey. His two main functions are to post lap times for featured performance cars in the [...] "Power Laps" [...] segment, and to train celebrity guests to set lap times in the [...] "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" [...] segment.|$|E
50|$|A rag joint {{refers to}} certain {{flexible}} joints (flexure bearings) found on automobiles and other machines. They are typically found on steering shafts that connect {{the steering wheel}} to the steering gear input shaft, usually at the steering <b>gear</b> <b>end.</b> They provide {{a small amount of}} flex for a steering shaft within a few degrees of the same plane as the steering gear input shaft. It also provides some damping of vibration coming from the steering system, providing some isolation for the steering wheel.|$|E
50|$|The band {{broke up}} after a van {{accident}} occurred while driving back to Nashville. The driver swerved to avoid a deer on the interstate, and the van and trailer filled with their <b>gear</b> <b>ended</b> up in a ditch. Van Vliet was hospitalised for three days with lung damage. With no vehicle, no gear, and no vocalist, {{they had decided to}} disband.|$|R
50|$|In July 1980, about 500 fans {{attending}} a Ted Nugent {{concert at the}} Sportatorium rioted after deputies from the Broward County Sheriff's Office arrested 15 people suspected of smoking marijuana and took them to a command trailer. The crowd held 35 deputies and 15 prisoners at bay in the trailer for nearly an hour. One deputy was injured by rocks and bottles thrown by the crowd. An additional 20 people were injured before deputies in riot <b>gear</b> <b>ended</b> the violence after 21 additional arrests.|$|R
5000|$|The Top <b>Gear</b> <b>ending</b> credits {{are also}} adapted {{to suit the}} programme's {{resemblance}} to Ground Force - the presenters' names were listed as Alan Clarkson, Handy Hammond and Charlie May (references to Ground Force presenters Alan Titchmarsh, Tommy Walsh and Charlie Dimmock respectively). The {{rest of the crew}} were all listed as having the first name [...] "Monty". This 'mocking' was also used in special editions such as the Top Gear Polar Special, in which the presenters' first names were changed to 'Sir Ranulph', as a reference to Sir Ranulph Fiennes.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962 Juy {{broke with}} {{tradition}} {{and made his}} front and rear derailleurs with nylon frames. [...] A historian of bicycle derailleurs, Michael Sweatman, says: [...] "He did not do things by halves - instead of dipping in a toe and using the odd plastic part - he jumped in up to his neck and made the entire parallelogram - both knuckles and both parallelogram plates - out of polyoxymethylene (which Du Pont branded as 'Delrin'). It was a bold, dynamic, modern and, ultimately, disastrous move."Production of all Simplex <b>gears</b> <b>ended</b> in the 1990s. A street in Dijon is named in Juy's memory.|$|R
50|$|Following this {{incarnation}} of the <b>Gears,</b> which <b>ended</b> in 1983, several other hockey teams played in Saginaw in the 1980s and 1990s, including the Generals ('85-'87), Hawks ('87-'89), Wheels ('94-'96), Lumber Kings ('96-'98), and a second {{incarnation of}} the Gears ('98-'99).|$|R

50|$|In Pastry Panic, {{the core}} {{gameplay}} revolves around a dinosaur-lizard hybrid named Dino eating as many sweets {{as possible to}} score points, while also consuming all of the bolts that appear on-screen. When the bolt counter hits zero, too many pieces of metal have escaped, clogging the <b>gears</b> and <b>ending</b> the game.|$|R

2500|$|The Veyron {{also won}} the award for [...] "Car of the Decade" [...] in Top <b>Gears</b> <b>end</b> of 2010 award show. Clarkson commented [...] "It was a car that just rewrote the rule book really, an amazing piece of engineering, a genuine Concorde moment". When the {{standard}} version was tested, it did not reach {{the top of the}} lap time leader board, with a time of 1:18.3, which was speculated as being due to the car's considerable weight disadvantage against the other cars towards the top. The Super Sport version later achieved the fastest ever time of 1:16.8 (later beaten by the Ariel Atom V8, the McLaren MP4-12C, the Pagani Huayra, the BAC Mono, the Lamborghini Aventador, McLaren 675LT and the Lamborghini Huracán), as well as being taken to a verified average top speed of [...] by Raphanel on the programme, thenceforth retaking its position as the fastest production car in the world.|$|R

His clients have included MoveOn.org, Americans United for Change, and USAction. He organized a successful campaign to stymie the privatization of Social Security.

50|$|The {{first attempt}} to {{establish}} the record was flown on July 10, 1923. Maughan took off from Mitchel Field, Long Island, at 4:56 a.m. The Allegheny Mountains were obscured by a thick undercast, and unable to navigate by landmarks, Maughan flew by dead reckoning, arriving at McCook Field 90 minutes behind schedule, where a broken tail fin rib caused an additional delay. The engine of the PW-8 quit in flight over Illinois because of a clogged fuel line, and Maughan made a forced landing in a farm field, damaging the landing <b>gear</b> and <b>ending</b> the attempt.|$|R
50|$|Allen {{attempted}} three {{races and}} started two in 1998, {{his last year}} in this series. Driving the No. 78 Church's Chicken Chevy at Talladega, Allen managed a 7th-place finish, a career-best.

5000|$|Leonard Pierce of The A.V.

He recovered to seventh place but Ferrari switched their two drivers allowing the championship to go to Räikkönen. Hamilton took the record of Youngest World Drivers' Championship runner-up, at 22 years and 288 days, previously held by Kimi Räikkönen at 23 years and 360 days (since beaten by Sebastian Vettel in 2009).|$|R

5000|$|Some designs use [...] "stepped-planet" [...] {{which have}} two differently-sized <b>gears</b> on either <b>end</b> {{of a common}} casting. The large end engages the sun, while the small end engages the ring gear. This may be {{necessary}} to achieve smaller step changes in gear ratio when the overall package size is limited. Compound planets have [...] "timing marks" [...] (or [...] "relative gear mesh phase" [...] in technical term). The assembly conditions of compound planetary gears are more restrictive than simple planetary gears, and they must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and ring <b>gear</b> at opposite <b>ends</b> of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. Compound planetary gears can easily achieve larger transmission ratio with equal or smaller volume. For example, compound planets with teeth in a 2:1 ratio with a 50T ring gear would give the same effect as a 100T ring gear, but with half the actual diameter.|$|R

It's a real showpiece of formalism <b>geared</b> to psycho-lyrical <b>ends,</b> exactly as Eisenstein intended, except that Dostoievskian soul-torments replace Leninist collectivism to which the 'official' montage-masters tuned their lyres." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Kojima's account, {{the port}} was {{developed}} by another Konami division at Tokyo which was given the source code from the MSX2 version {{without the consent of}} the original team. Many changes were made during the porting process that later led to this version being publicly disowned by Kojima himself. Masahiro Ueno, who worked as a programmer for the NES version, has stated that the staff who worked on the port were given a three-month deadline and were ordered make the port as different as possible from the MSX2 version by Konami executives.
