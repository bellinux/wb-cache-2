Heteropods were collected during {{day and night}} periods using paired, opening-closing BONGO nets at 50-m depth intervals between the surface and 200 m and at 200-300 m and 300-400 m.

There was an apparent partial populational migration from a <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> of 45-90 m during the day to 0-45 m at night.

Mean densities were computed (as numbers of individuals beneath 100 m2 of ocean surface) during day and night periods at each station. As in the 1990 study, Atlanta lesueurii was the most abundant species in the fall, {{although it was a}} close second to Atlanta plana in the spring. Comparisons were made using the nighttime density data to avoid issues such as daytime net avoidance and to include increased nighttime abundances resulting from possible nocturnal vertical migrator species. Atlanta lesueurii was found to be most abundant at the offshore (15 nm) station during both seasons. Offshore to inshore abundance decreased most dramatically in the fall; from mean nighttime densities of 480 (15 nm) to 124 (5 nm) to 37 (1 nm) individuals beneath 100 m2 of ocean surface. At the 15 nm station the species ranged downward to the greatest depths; to the 120-160 m <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> in the spring and to the 80-120 m <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> in the fall.

To study net rates of microbial activities in deep sediments, we developed a robust approach that is well suited to use over {{a broad range of}} sediment depths. Our approach is based on a finite-difference solution to a continuity equation that considers molecular diffusion, sediment burial, fluid advection, and reaction under the assumption of steady state. Numerical procedures are adopted to identify the maximum number of <b>depth</b> <b>intervals</b> with statistically different reaction rates. The approach explicitly considers downcore variation in physical properties and sample spacing. Uncertainties in the rate estimates are quantified using a Monte Carlo technique. We tested our approach using synthetic concentration profiles generated from analytical solutions to the continuity equation. We then applied the approach to concentration profiles of dissolved sulfate, sulfide, methane, and manganese in the 420 -m thick sediment column of eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean Drilling Program Site 1226. Our results indicate that (i) sulfate reduction and iron reduction occur at most sediment depths, (ii) net methane production occurs in discrete <b>depth</b> <b>intervals</b> and (iii) manganese reduction occurs near the seafloor and deep in the sediments. These results provide quantitative evidence that multiple respiration pathways co-exist in the same <b>depth</b> <b>intervals</b> of these deep subseafloor sediments...|$|R

50|$|Conversion to {{the angle}} of {{disparity}} dγ is performed by inserting the position difference dz in the formulawhere a is the interocular separation of the observer and z {{the distance of the}} fixed peg from the eye. To transfer dγ into the usual unit of minutes of arc, a multiplicative constant c is inserted whose value is 3437.75 (1 radian in arcminutes). In the calculation a, dz and z must be in the same units, say, feet, inches, cm or meters. For the average interocular distance of 6.5 cm, a target distance of 6m and a typical stereoacuity of 0.5 minute of arc, the just detectable <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> is 8 cm. As targets come closer, this interval gets smaller by the inverse square of the distance, so that an equivalent detectable <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> at ¼ meter is 0.01 cm or the depth of impression of the head on a coin.

This required drilling on an ice flow divide. 3) A site with high annual ice accumulation and thick ice was needed to provide a high time resolution record extending ~80,000 years into the past. This required drilling in West Antarctica which has higher ice accumulation rates than East Antarctica. 5) Other requirements included simple basal topography, avoiding the <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> of brittle ice during the deglacial part of the record, and logistics considerations.|$|E

Microfiche. xvi, 189 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmA {{series of}} four {{experiments}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the influence. of three video system parameters on the scaling of depth intervals with a stereoscopic (stereo) television display. A geometrical model of TV stereoscopy is presented which describes the influence of variations of the three video system parameters on retinal disparities. Experiment One investigated the independent and interactive effects of camera interaxial separation and lens magnification on <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> scaling. Experiment Two investigated the effects of camera convergence angle on <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> scaling. Experiments Three and Four partially replicated the video system parameters used in Experiment One under more complex scene conditions. For all experiments, ocular fatigue induced by various combinations of video system parameters was also measured. Four trained observers participated in Experiments One and Two. An additional observer participated in Experiments Three and Four. The apparatus used to produce depth intervals in the televised scene was a Howard-Dolman two-rod device. Rods were set to a pre-selected <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> and observers were required to verbally report perceived <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> and match the <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> haptically {{by means of a}} sliding peg device. Stereoscopic TV imagery was provided by means of a beamsplitter camera station and a polarizer display station. All experiments included monoscopic (2 -D) and direct view control conditions. Ocular fatigue tests which were administered included a questionnaire, flicker fusion threshold adjustments, and a near-far test of oculomotor adjustment time. Multifactorial repeated-measures analyses of covariance were performed on data derived from all experiments with a. 05 level set for statistical significance. For Experiments One, Two, and Three stereoscopic imagery produced <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> estimates which were superior to those found under monoscopic viewing conditions. In addition, increasing camera separation and thereby increasing disparities beyond "natural stereo" values produced improvements in <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> estimation. Camera convergence exerted a significant effect on performance with camera convergence in front of objects to be compared in depth providing highest accuracy. Lens magnification, which affected retinal disparities, was not found to exert a significant influence on <b>depth</b> <b>interval</b> estimation. For all experiments, no evidence of ocular fatigue was found under any conditions tested. Results are discussed in light of previous studies of depth resolution with stereo TV displays, geometrical models of retinal disparities, and models to account for the discrepancies in depth perception observed between stereo TV and direct viewing conditions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} {{perceive}} depth in a random-dot stereogram {{is a valuable}} test for the perception of retinal image disparities, whether they arise from the viewing of a stereogram or from the viewing of a real 3 -D object. However, a stereogram cannot {{be regarded as a}} proper model for the perception of depth {{in the case of a}} real 3 -D object. This conclusion comes out most clearly in relation to changes in viewing distance. Whereas the viewing of real objects and stereograms both obey the rules of size constancy, this is not the case with depth constancy. With changes in viewing distance, the viewing of real objects obeys the rules of depth constancy. By contrast, the magnitude of the <b>depth</b> <b>intervals</b> in a stereogram are not constant but appear to increase in direct proportion to the increase in viewing distance. In a stereogram these changes in the amplitude of the <b>depth</b> <b>intervals</b> are based on the same mechanisms as those responsible for size constancy...|$|R
