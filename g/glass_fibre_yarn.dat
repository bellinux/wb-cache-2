40|$|The {{increase}} of production of woven structures from natural fibres for reinforced composites can be noticed in different sectors of economy. This {{can be explained by}} limited sources of raw materials and different environmental issues, as well as European Union guidelines for car manufacture [4]. This research produced 2 D textile structures of hemp yarn and polypropylene yarn and tested the impact of added <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>yarn</b> on the mechanical properties of the woven structures and the composites produced from them. The woven structures were manufactured using hand looms or industrial looms (CТБ- 175) using one layer technique. The mechanical testing of the reinforcements showed that the parameters of the looms had significant impact on the properties of the reinforcements. However, the desired improvement of strength by adding glass fibre to the fabric was not achieved. The one, two, three and four layer composites were produced in a hydraulic press using reinforcements woven from hemp yarn and polypropylene yarn. The mechanical testing of composites showed that the tensile strength of the composites and the tensile stress at maximum load depends on number of the reinforcement layers, but the tensile extension of the composites and the modulus of elasticity are not closely related to the number of reinforcement layers, but rather on elasticity of yarn used in weaving. Swelling of composites in water was detected...|$|E

30|$|Labanieh et al. (Labanieh et al. 2017) {{recently}} {{studied the}} effect of adding two layers of biased (+θ°/−θ°) yarns to a classical ORT architecture on the mechanical response in tension and short beam testing. Three ORT architectures were experimentally tested, two of which included the biased in-plane yarns while the last one represented a classical ORT architecture for baseline comparison. In-plane <b>yarns</b> were <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>yarns</b> while the binder yarns were Kevlar yarns. The two multiaxial ORT architectures were different from the stacking sequence point of view. One of them (referred to as IMA) had the biased layers (+θ°/−θ°) adjacent to each other while they were separated by a 0 ° layer in the second architecture (referred to as MA). So from the testing point of view, off-axis yarns experienced bi-axial stress state when the global loading direction was along the warp or the weft. The “as manufactured” internal microstructure was examined by optical microscopy at different sections and fibre volume fraction was determined experimentally (~ 50 %). During testing, full strain mapping was captured with DIC for monotonic and “loading/unloading” tension. In the case of off-axis loading, a significant difference was observed between the multiaxial ORT specimens and the classical ORT. Classical ORT stress-strain response was significantly non-linear compared to the two multiaxial counter parts with much higher strain to failure and much lower strength. This distinguished behaviour of the classical ORT was attributed to the absence of reinforcing fibres along this off-axis (45 °) loading direction. Modulus degradation due to damage evolution was measured through the “loading/unloading” tensile test in the warp, weft and off-axis direction and recommended by the authors for incorporation in modelling {{the effect of}} damage in 3 D woven composites. The reader is referred to the original article for extensive discussion of ILSS data of the specified architectures.|$|R
30|$|As {{the main}} {{advantage}} of 3 D woven composites is clearly their out-of-plane enhanced properties, many researchers for example (Ji et al. 2007; Luo et al. 2007; Hao et al. 2008; Walter et al. 2009; Gerlach et al. 2012; Seltzer et al. 2013; Umer et al. 2016) studied {{the effect of}} the z-binding yarns on the impact damage behaviour and the energy absorption of those material systems. Impact testing in literature was classified based on the impact velocity to low (< 10  m/s) as reported in (Umer et al. 2016), high (~ 20 to 50  m/s) as in (Ji et al. 2007; Hao et al. 2008) and ballistic (~ 900  m/s) as discussed in (Walter et al. 2009). Hao et al. (Hao et al. 2008) studied the behaviour of ORT woven <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite plate and T-beams subjected to quasi-static indentation and impact loadings. Global response in the form of load displacement and energy absorption curves was evaluated, and Finite Element Modelling (FEM) results were validated against them. The implemented model correlated well with their experimental findings. In addition, damage mechanisms {{in the case of the}} T-beam and the plate were compared. They reported higher energy absorption by the T-beam as opposed to the composite plate, for the same loading level. Another study by Ji et al. (Ji et al. 2007) investigated the quasi-static indentation and impact behaviour of a circular plate made of ORT woven <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite. The quasi-static indentation test was carried out using a MTS machine while the impact test was done using a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus. The damaged surfaces of the specimens were characterised afterwards and energy absorption was calculated to verify FEM models they produced. Luo et al. (Luo et al. 2007) carried out quasi-static indentation and transverse impact tests for ORT hybrid woven composites with aramid and <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>yarns.</b> The focus of this study was the strain rate sensitivity effect on energy absorption. It was reported that the higher the impact velocity (20, 40, 55  m/s), the higher the energy absorbed (~ 8, 12, 18  J) by the composite. Regarding the damage/failure mechanisms, the quasi-static loaded specimens suffered from tensile failure on the bottom side and compressive failure on the top side. In the case of impact damage, three damage mechanisms were captured: matrix cracking, fibre breakage and fibres pull-out. In contrast to the response of the laminated composites, {{the effect of the}} through-thickness binder was significant as it supressed the delamination. An interesting study by Seltzer et al. (Seltzer et al. 2013) revealed the damage mechanisms of 3 D S 2 -glass, carbon and hybrid woven composites by X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) due to low-velocity impact. In addition, they compared the energy absorption of the 3 D woven composites with that of 2 D laminated counterparts. They reported that the energy absorbed by the 3 D woven composites was approximately twice the energy absorbed by the 2 D laminated composite. The X-ray images demonstrated that this higher energy absorption was due to the binding yarns delaying the delamination and providing integrity to the structure. The existence of binding yarns resulted in dissipating the energy by other damage mechanisms such as tow splitting, out-of-plane shear and extensive fibre breakage.|$|R

A number of processes for recycling GRP are available or under development. However, nearly all options deliver recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> which are not cost-performance competitive due to the huge drop in performance of recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> compared to its original state. A breakthrough in the regeneration of recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> performance has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling such GRP composites. This presentation will review the status of the ReCoVeR project which is focussed on the enabling cost-effective regeneration of the performance and value of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> obtained from thermal recycling of end-of-life GRP and GRP manufacturing waste. Highlights of our latest results will be presented with emphasis on our breakthrough treatments to regenerate the properties of thermally conditioned <b>glass</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
