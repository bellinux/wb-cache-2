500|$|At the University of Chicago, {{where she}} earned an M.A. in 1936, Brodie lost {{her faith in}} {{religion}} entirely. In 1975, she recalled, [...] "It was like taking a hot coat off in the summertime. The sense of liberation <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago was exhilarating. I felt very quickly that I could {{not go back to}} the old life, and I never did." [...] She continued to write to Jensen until shortly before she married Bernard Brodie on her graduation day, August 28, 1936.|$|E
500|$|Wan {{pitched the}} idea to Whannell of two men chained to {{opposite}} sides of a bathroom with a dead body {{in the middle of}} the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. [...] "It was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," [...] Whannell said.|$|E

500|$|By 1926 Joyce {{had largely}} {{completed}} both Parts I and III. Geert Lernout asserts that Part <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> <b>at</b> this early stage, [...] "a real focus that had developed {{out of the}} HCE [...] sketch: the story of HCE, {{of his wife and}} children. There were the adventures of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker himself and the rumours about them in chapters 2–4, a description of his wife ALP's letter in chapter 5, a denunciation of his son Shem in chapter 7, and a dialogue about ALP in chapter 8. These texts [...] formed a unity." [...] In the same year Joyce met Maria and Eugène Jolas in Paris, just as his new work was generating an increasingly negative reaction from readers and critics, culminating in The Dials refusal to publish the four chapters of Part III in September 1926. The Jolases gave Joyce valuable encouragement and material support throughout the long process of writing Finnegans Wake, and published sections of the book in serial form in their literary magazine transition, under the title Work In Progress. For the next few years Joyce worked rapidly on the book, adding what would become chapters I.1 and I.6, and revising the already written segments to make them more lexically complex.|$|E

Tho from the conversations <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> Batavia with a Dutch Gentleman {{of a very}} liberal disposition who was several years resident in Japan, Isaac Titsingh, I collected nothing that could induce me to depend on a favorable reception there, I learned nothing to deter me from the trial. The risk would, at least, be personal, as we have hitherto there no trade to lose. And no moment, if any, could be so propitious for opening up a new trade with them , as when, from the present general confusion of affairs of the Dutch East India Company, their connection with the Japanese is greatly on the decline." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Ken Nelson took a {{hands-off}} {{approach to}} producing Haggard. In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: [...] "The producer <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> that time, Ken Nelson, was {{an exception to}} the rule. He called me 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty-four, twenty-five year old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me." [...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs—he was a great writer." ...|$|E

"Donahue was right," [...] {{said the}} young man, frankly; [...] "I {{was brought up}} on the Bowery. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been news-boy, teamster, pugilist, member of an {{organized}} band of 'toughs,' bartender, and a 'sport' in various meanings of the word. The experience certainly warrants the supposition that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> least a passing acquaintance with a few phases of Bowery life. I will be pleased to place whatever knowledge and experience <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> the service of my friend Donahue's friends." ...|$|R

2500|$|Fisher was {{appointed}} to command [...] as flag captain to the Admiral of the North America and West Indies Station, Astley Cooper Key, from 2 March 1877 to 4 June 1878. Bellerophon {{had been in the}} dockyard for repairs, so the new crew was less than perfect in carrying out their duties. Fisher told them I intend to give you hell for three months, and if you have not come up to my standard in that time you'll have hell for another three months. Midshipman (later Admiral) A. H. Gordon Moore reported, Fisher was a very exacting master and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> times long and arduous duties, long hours at the engine room telegraphs in cold fog, etc., and the least inattention was punished. It was, I think, his way of proving us, for he always rewarded us in some way when an extra hard bit of work was over.|$|E
2500|$|Like Walter Scott and Landor, Southey {{connects the}} events {{surrounding}} Napoleon with the Moors' invasion of Spain within his work. In a letter to Landor, Southey described the rape scene: [...] "here you have {{a part of the}} poem so difficult to get over even tolerably that I verily believe if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> first thought of making Roderick any thing more than a sincere penitent this difficulty would have deterred me from attempting the subject." [...] To overcome the problem with having his main character rape a woman, Southey decided to put some of the responsibility on Florinda and make Roderick more sympathetic. It is also possible that there are autobiographical elements to the scene, especially with Roderick's problematic marriage to a woman he did not love as possibly describing the events of his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge's life and his love for Sara Hutchinson. This would allow Southey to deal with events from his life in a poetic form.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the diary}} she often talks {{about keeping the}} [...] "boys" [...] and the [...] "baby" [...] (Alfred) safe during the siege and retreat:This was Johnny's fourth birthday, a sad one to us all. We managed to get some toys for Johnny from a {{merchant}} inside. (16 July)Johnny was not well to-day, and I feared he might be sickening for small-pox. (31 July)Johnny's rosy cheeks, which he never lost, excited great admiration; he passed {{most of his time}} in the square next to us with the Sikhs, who were very fond of him, and used to give him chappatties (native bread), though they could not have had much to eat themselves, poor men! (28 August) [...] Mrs. Case and Johnny were walking in the square next to ours to-day, when a Sikh officer passed them, and directly afterwards he was hit in the arm by a bullet. No place was really safe, and I never liked having the children out of my sight. (18 October) During the siege, we had picked up a little white hen, which used to run about and pick up what it could. Just before Colonel Campbell became so very ill, we had decided to kill and eat it, when one morning Johnny ran in and said, 'Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!' We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days. The hen laid one every day for him till he died, and then ceased for the rest of the siege; but we would not kill it then. (12 November) <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> first put the two boys into a dhoolie with their ayah, but they got separated from us, and it was fully a quarter of an hour before I found them, so I would not let them go from me again [...] [...] [...] poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it [...] than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. [...] (19 November) ...|$|E
