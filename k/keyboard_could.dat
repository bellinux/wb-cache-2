50|$|The iPad <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> be undocked {{from the}} bottom of the screen, and could be split into two half-keyboards.|$|E
5000|$|Only a <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> be {{used for}} the {{majority}} of the gameplay, since most of the user input was by text. A joystick could {{be used for}} the arcade sequence.|$|E
50|$|One {{limitation}} {{is that when}} connected to a remote computer the remote keyboard layout is always used. This means typing some characters on your local <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> result in the wrong character being printed on the remote computer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{quotation}} attributed [...] to a 1996 {{speech by}} Robert Wilensky stated, [...] "We've {{heard that a}} million monkeys at a million <b>keyboards</b> <b>could</b> produce the complete works of Shakespeare; now, thanks to the Internet, we know that is not true." ...|$|R
25|$|In live performances, {{multiple}} electronic <b>keyboards</b> <b>could</b> {{be played}} together at one time, each by one musician, forming a keyboard ensemble. Keyboard ensembles are mostly performed within a band on an elaborate stage, with some can even {{serve as a}} simpler substitute to the more conventional orchestra, replacing stringed and wind instruments.|$|R
50|$|The typewheel, {{like the}} later typeball of the IBM Selectric typewriter, {{was the central}} {{component}} of all the Blick machines. It could be easily removed, allowing users to select a large variety of fonts and typeface. Later in the companies production history the basic machines <b>keyboards</b> <b>could</b> easily be adapted to other languages at the Blickensderfer factory simply by changing the removable keytop covers and adding the corresponding language typewheel.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{originally}} {{looked like}} an early pizza box form factor workstation, but a late change was the introduction of vertical supports {{on either side of}} the case to provide a [...] "garage" [...] under the main section of the system where the <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> be stored.|$|E
50|$|RADIAS {{also takes}} {{advantage}} of KKS Korg Komponent System which allows the user to detach the RADIAS-R module from the dedicated RADIAS-KB keyboard. The RADIAS-R module could be bought separately but the <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> not. The RADIAS-R module can be installed on the M3-73 or M3-88 and played simultaneously with the Korg M3 module using the M3's keyboard.|$|E
5000|$|The American company's {{first major}} product, the Otrona Attaché, {{came out in}} April 1982 and folded up {{to the size of}} a fat {{briefcase}} painted off-white with orange trim. When set up for use, the carrying handle swung under the chassis to prop it up for easier viewing. A <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> be removed from one end, revealing a small 5 inch monochrome CRT and two 360Kb [...] "half-height" [...] 5.25 inch floppy disk drives.|$|E
50|$|A true, 3-octave master <b>keyboard</b> which <b>could</b> control {{up to four}} Wasps or Gnats using EDP's {{proprietary}} {{digital control}} system.|$|R
40|$|Connecting small, mobile {{computers}} to other computers, especially when these connections are not preconfigured, {{is a critical}} element in the user experience of multi-device applications. We empirically studied the user performance and experience of such connections using WiFi phones with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Universal Serial Bus (USB), Bluetooth radio, and wired connections in a docking cradle. Results show that the gain of easier information access by connecting phones to larger displays and <b>keyboards</b> <b>could</b> outweigh the cost of making the connection for text entry with as few as a dozen characters...|$|R
5000|$|Some models sold from 1983 onwards {{included}} a cartridge bay to accept Casio ROM Packs which contained sheet {{music in a}} digital format. The <b>keyboards</b> <b>could</b> play the notes automatically, or (with {{the exception of the}} PT-50) illuminate LEDs above each key to teach the user how to play the song. Most keyboards came with one ROM Pack as standard, but a large number of additional packs, covering a wide range of musical genres, were available to purchase separately. The last ROM Pack model was the CT-840, which came out in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Although the PC/XT and AT {{used the}} same style of {{keyboard}} connector, the low-level protocol for reading the keyboard was different between these two series. The AT keyboard uses a bidirectional interface which allows the computer to send commands to the keyboard. An AT <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> {{not be used in}} an XT, nor the reverse. Third-party keyboard manufacturers provided a switch on some of their keyboards to select either the AT-style or XT-style protocol for the keyboard.|$|E
50|$|Montal's {{patented}} inventions included double escapement (repetition) action {{designs for}} both grands and upright; a grand piano with inverted soundboard (the soundboard above the strings); a transposition system whereby the piano <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> be shifted sharp or flat by several semitones; {{a system of}} adjustable iron bars (contre-tirage/counter-tension) to allow for adjustment of the case to match environmental condition; a soft pedal (pédale d’expression) that moved the hammers closer to the string and reduced key dip proportionally; and others.|$|E
50|$|On {{the plus}} side, the ECS did include a {{built-in}} BASIC that was somewhat functional, if idiosyncratic and occasionally buggy, {{and a second}} AY-3-8910 sound chip which expanded the system's audio capabilities to six-voice synthesized sound and, when paired with the optional 49-key Music Synthesizer <b>keyboard,</b> <b>could</b> potentially turn the Intellivision into a polyphonic synthesizer for playing, recording, or learning music. It would also allow two additional hand-held Game Controllers to be connected {{in place of the}} alphanumeric keyboard, which opened up the possibility of four-player games.|$|E
50|$|Badarou's <b>keyboard</b> playing <b>could</b> also {{be heard}} on albums by Robert Palmer, Marianne Faithfull, Herbie Hancock, M (Pop Muzik), Talking Heads, Foreigner, Power Station, Melissa Etheridge, Manu Dibango and Miriam Makeba.|$|R
50|$|By early 2006, the Isomorphic Conspiracy had {{discovered}} that such keyboards also had the same fingering in every tuning, too—or, at least, every tuning of what the Conspiracy came to call the syntonic temperament. This consistency of fingering across tunings, which they called tuning invariance, enables a performer, using an isomorphic keyboard and compatible synthesizer (or software synthesizer), to play a given tonal piece in any {{of a wide range}} of tunings. The Conspiracy turned its attention to identifying the means by which different isomorphic <b>keyboards</b> <b>could</b> be compared, and identified the Wicki/Hayden keyboard as being optimal for the syntonic temperament's wide tuning range.|$|R
5000|$|Ada Wilson in The Rough Guide to Rock {{wrote that}} the album [...] "failed to {{recapture}} Ultravox!'s on-stage energy". In his retrospective review, Dave Thompson, writing for AllMusic, opined [...] "it was Ultravox! who first showed the kind of dangerous rhythms that <b>keyboards</b> <b>could</b> create. The quintet certainly had their antecedents - Hawkwind, Roxy Music and Kraftwerk to name but a few - but still it was the group's 1977 eponymous debut's grandeur (courtesy of producer Brian Eno), wrapped in the ravaged moods and lyrical themes of collapse and decay that transported '70s rock from the bloated pastures of the past to the futuristic dystopias predicted by punk." ...|$|R
50|$|The base-model Tandy 2000 {{supported}} only a text-mode {{display in}} monochrome. The Tandy VM-1 monitor used the 8-pin video port on the computer's rear panel. The text-mode address space {{was in a}} different location but third-party memory-resident software hacks remedied this by copying the PC-compatible text-mode memory to the Tandy 2000's text space {{at a rate of}} 5-10 times per second. This sometimes caused some choppiness in the display. It produced a fast text display rate—often too fast to read—but the 'HOLD' key on the <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> be used to pause text output.|$|E
50|$|This {{model was}} criticized for its uncomfortable keyboard—while {{mechanical}} in nature, lack of keycaps lead to the same unsatisfactory tactile response, that was seen as unacceptable when the machine was used in home or educational settings, although such <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> be easily sealed completely, so this version found widespread use as an industrial controller. Other points of criticism included the archaic FOCAL programming language supplied by default, and the complete lack of peripherals and software. While all hardware was well documented and easy to work with, the machine was delivered without any programming tools.|$|E
5000|$|An upgrade kit {{was offered}} for the earlier Macintosh 128K and Macintosh 512K/enhanced, which {{includes}} a new motherboard, floppy disk drive and rear case. The owner retained the front case, monitor, and analog board. Because of this, there is no [...] "Macintosh Plus" [...] {{on the front of}} upgraded units, and the Apple logo is recessed and in the bottom left hand corner of the front case. However, the label {{on the back of the}} case reads [...] "Macintosh Plus 1MB". The new extended Plus <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> also be purchased. Unfortunately, this upgrade cost almost as much as a new machine.|$|E
5000|$|In the Paris {{performance}} of Jean Michel Jarre's album Waiting for Cousteau, musicians have attached Atari ST machines with unidentified MIDI software to their <b>keyboards,</b> as <b>could</b> {{be seen in}} the TV live show and video recordings.|$|R
50|$|Fickenscher also {{invented the}} Polytone, a <b>keyboard</b> {{instrument}} that <b>could</b> produce sixty distinct tones {{within the scope}} of an octave.|$|R
50|$|Carries from lower-order digits came in via one {{planetary}} differential per dial. If one {{held down}} the + bar, in neighboring columns {{to the left}} (with zeros {{for them in the}} <b>keyboard),</b> one <b>could</b> see two or maybe three higher-order dials moving at the speeds one would expect.|$|R
5000|$|The Chord Organ {{incorporated}} {{elements of}} both the Novachord and the Solovox in that the right-hand 37-note <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> play both chords and single notes. An [...] "Organ" [...] section provided String and Flute sounds which were polyphonic, while a [...] "Solo" [...] division permitted the organist to play single-note melodies superimposed over the polyphonic [...] "Organ" [...] division. The Solo division operated essentially identically to the Solovox - one group of controls determined the register or pitch in which the Solo division would sound while another group of controls allowed the player to filter the sound in various ways ("timbre" [...] controls).|$|E
5000|$|There is {{an effect}} section that emulates popular [...] "stomp box" [...] effect pedals from the '70s and {{amplifiers}} including the famous Leslie rotary speaker cabinet. These {{can be applied}} to piano, organ or samples. Reverb and Delay effects are also available. As with other Clavia products, it is distinctive for its red color. Unlike the Clavia Nord Stage, earlier models could only play one instrument at a time, although a second <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> be attached via MIDI as an additional organ manual. The Electro 5 allows for a maximum of two sound sources to be used simultaneously in layered or split-keyboard configuration.|$|E
50|$|The TAM {{came with}} a unique 75 key ADB {{keyboard}} which featured leather palm-rests and a trackpad instead of a mouse. The trackpad could be detached from the keyboard if desired, with a small leather insert found underneath the keyboard ready to fill the gap. When not required, the <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> slide under the TAM's head unit, leaving the trackpad exposed for continued access. The TAM also {{came with a}} remote control (standard with the Apple TV/FM Tuner card), but also featured buttons on the front panel that could control sound levels, CD playback, brightness, contrast, and TV mode. The pre-installed operating system was a specialized version of Mac OS 7.6.1, which allowed control over those features.|$|E
5000|$|In early designs, some {{characters}} were produced by printing two symbols with the carriage {{in the same}} position. For instance, the exclamation point, which shares a key with the numeral 1 on modern <b>keyboards,</b> <b>could</b> be reproduced by using a three-stroke combination of an apostrophe, a backspace, and a period. A semicolon ( [...] ;) was produced by printing a comma ( [...] ,) over a colon (:). As the backspace key is slow in simple mechanical typewriters (the carriage was heavy and optimized {{to move in the}} opposite direction), a more professional approach was to block the carriage by pressing and holding the space bar while printing all characters that needed to be in a shared position. To make this possible, the carriage was designed to advance forward only after releasing the space bar.|$|R
5000|$|Atlas Autocode had {{the choice}} of three: {{keywords}} could be [...] using backspace and overstrike on a Flexowriter <b>keyboard,</b> they <b>could</b> be introduced by a , or they could be typed in [...] with no delimiting character ("uppercasedelimiters" [...] mode, in which case all variables {{had to be in}} lower case).|$|R
50|$|In 1987, Atari Corp. {{released}} the XE Game System console, which {{was essentially a}} repackaged 65XE (the then-current iteration of the 8-bit computer line) with a detachable <b>keyboard</b> that <b>could</b> run home computer titles directly, unlike the 5200. Anderson wrote in 1984 that Atari could have released a console compatible with computer software in 1981.|$|R
50|$|CV, {{as applied}} to control of other {{parameters}} usually follows a pattern of minimum to maximum voltage. For example, the Moog modular synthesizers also use the 0-5v control voltage for all other parameters. They are represented on the front panel of many synthesizers as knobs, but often a patch bay allows the input or output of the related CV to synchronize multiple modules together. So, for example, the pitch voltage from a <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> {{also be used to}} control the rate of an LFO, which could be applied to the volume of the oscillator output, creating a tremolo that becomes faster as the pitch rises. Modules that can be controlled by CV include VCF, VCA, high and low frequency oscillators, ring modulators, sample and hold circuits and noise injection.|$|E
50|$|Sequencer. Ensoniq's {{approach}} for sequencing was somewhat {{different from other}} manufacturers. Instead of offering a linear set of tracks for recording, the TS required the user to record short sequences (12 tracks each) {{to use as a}} base for song structure, then chaining them and optionally layering another 12 linear tracks on top of the chained blocks. The sequencer editing options included quantization with audition, controller editing and scaling and MIDI functions per track, as well as copying whole or parts of tracks to anywhere else. The <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> store up to 30 songs with 100 sequences per song, memory-permitting, and everything was kept in memory when the synth was turned off. Modern synthesizers, with larger and better sequencers, demand the user to save their work before power down, since the sequencer memory is not backed up.|$|E
5000|$|The medieval Organetto [...] was a {{portable}} pipe instrument, allied to the later classical pipe organ, and pumped with the hand. It is referenced in the Roman de la Rose: [...] "There are easily manageable organs which are portable and are pumped and {{played by the}} same person, who also sings either the soprano or tenor part."It {{was among the most}} popular instruments in Europe from the 13th to the 16th century. The organetto was relatively lightweight and could be carried with a sling to use in religious processions or other occasions. Bellows provide the wind supply, and a button-type <b>keyboard</b> <b>could</b> be used across approximately two octaves. The organetto could only play one note at a time, and was used for a single part in a polyphonic piece, motet or chanson, and for monophonic dance music.|$|E
50|$|Using {{a feature}} called multi-sampling, the Mirage was also capable of {{assigning}} multiple samples to different keys across its keyboard. Using this technique, the Mirage essentially {{turned into a}} polyphonic mult-timbral MIDI sound module complete with a velocity-sensitive <b>keyboard</b> that <b>could</b> be used to drive other MIDI sound modules as well its own sound engine.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>keyboard</b> {{computer}} that <b>could</b> plug into {{a television set}} like the Apple II and TRS 80 but also plug into a computer monitor to display high resolution graphics.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. The {{aim of the}} study was to {{investigate}} as to whether piezoelectric energy harvesting could be a viable contributor to a source of renewable energy for the future. Here, a keyboard usage study was conducted using a data gathering computer program called WhatPulse in which participants and their keyboards were monitored for one week. The results were used in conjunction with power output figures from work done by Wacharasindhu and Kwon (2008) who prototyped a piezoelectric keyboard and found it was capable of producing 650 µJ of energy per keystroke. The results from this study suggest piezoelectric <b>keyboards</b> <b>could</b> not be used to create self-sustaining systems for any of the devices proposed. Further uses for the stored energy have been suggested but the question to the viability of piezoelectric keyboards as a useful energy source looks discouraging. Other applications for the technology could be explored to enhance power output and utilise larger amounts of vibrational energy...|$|R
