25|$|On 16 February, {{just prior}} to a ceasefire for the Tet New Year festival, the Australian command had {{received}} information from an agent about the location of large weapon caches {{in the north of}} AO Tiki, and a large Viet Cong force was also expected to be in position. B and W Companies 4 RAR/NZ, each accompanied by a tracker team and a Centurion tank troop from B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment were subsequently tasked to patrol to the area by separate routes. Accompanied by the Hoi Chanh, B Company—under the command of Major Bill Reynolds—crossed an open area during the early afternoon and moved into some dense vegetation, patrolling up to an occupied communist position unaware. Well concealed in bunkers the Viet Cong successfully initiated a command-detonated <b>directional</b> <b>mine</b> and opened fire with small-arms and RPGs, killing one Australian and wounding five others. In response the Australian tanks—under the command of Second Lieutenant Brian Sullivan—moved forward to support the infantry, and in the ensuring battle two were damaged, including one which was knocked out by a rocket propelled grenade which penetrated the turret and inflicted severe injuries on the crew. Yet under the leadership of Reynolds, B Company fought to regain its balance following the initial onslaught, and was able to withdraw under the fire of the surviving tanks which engaged the bunkers at point-blank with their 20 pounder main armament, using solid shot and canister anti-personnel rounds which stripped the undergrowth. The Australian casualties were moved back to safety by stretcher bearers who had moved forward under covering fire, and the damaged tank was also successfully recovered.|$|E

25|$|Modified long-armed {{demining}} bulldozers {{are being}} used {{in a number of}} countries. They have the capability to remove vegetation before demining and can withstand antipersonnel and antitank landmines. Their long arms provide the benefit of reducing damage to the main body, especially to the operator's cab. Three inch (7.62cm) thick bulletproof glass protects the operator from <b>directional</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{no clear}} {{division}} between a booby trap and buried conventional land mines triggered by a tripwire or <b>directional</b> <b>mine.</b> Other, similar devices include spring-guns and mechanisms such as the SM-70 directional antipersonnel mine.|$|E
50|$|Alternative traps are mines such as {{the crowd}} control munition, gas mine or the <b>directional</b> <b>mine,</b> {{such as the}} SM-70, which was used on the inner German border to prevent {{refugees}} from escaping East Germany. Crowd control munition and gas mines can be less lethal, while concussion mines are meant to kill. The latter are thus only used in military perimeter defenses.|$|E

[...] It weighs 20 kg, with a pre-fragmented plate which breaks into 1,600 hexagonal shaped fragments weighing 5.7 grams per fragment. Lethal distance is 150 metres, with 2 fragments per square metre. Remote controlled. Marconi developed a proximity fused version.|$|E

50|$|The Kebithigollewa {{massacre}} {{happened when}} a state owned bus {{was struck by}} two Claymore <b>directional</b> <b>mines.</b> 68 Sinhalese men, women and infants were killed {{as a result of}} this attack. The United States condemned the attack, noting: “This vicious attack bears all the hallmarks of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

50|$|Around 1952 Norman MacLeod, at {{his company}} the Calord Corporation, {{began working on}} a small <b>directional</b> <b>mine</b> for use by infantry. It is not clear if the United States Picatinny Arsenal took the concept from the Canadian weapon and asked Norman MacLeod to develop it, or if he {{developed}} the design independently and presented it to them. MacLeod designed a weapon called the T-48; broadly similar to the final M18A1, it lacked {{a number of the}} design details that made the M18A1 effective.|$|E
5000|$|When an {{explosive}} device is triggered {{only by the}} action of a member of the guerrilla force after identifying a legal target, as with the command-detonated mode of the M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine, the device is not considered a mine {{within the context of the}} Ottawa Treaty. Such devices often are used to initiate combat in an ambush, combining surprise with an intense burst of fragments.

This bomb exploded 10 meters away from Thandikulam Agriculture Farm School which is managed by the Sri Lankan Government at around 9.45am. Sri Lanka Police and Security forces alleged that this Claymore type <b>directional</b> <b>mine</b> was placed by the LTTE, which is a rebel group banned as a terrorist organisation by 32 countries including the United States, India and the member states of the European union. But LTTE denied these allegations.|$|E

The light blue or black plastic M33 Inert AP Mine is the training and practice version of the M18 Claymore. Some inert mines were green with a light blue band. It does not contain an explosive or pyrotechnic filler of any kind. It is packed in a Claymore bag with inert M10 simulated detonator cap wire, an M57 [...] "clacker" [...] firing control, and an M40 circuit test kit.|$|E

50|$|The {{requirement}} for kinetic energy {{was based on}} the fact that 58 foot pounds is required to deliver a potentially lethal injury. Given the requirements of weight and fragment density, approximately 700 fragments were needed, with the ability to aim the mine with an accuracy of around two feet (0.6 m) at the center of the target zone. The team at Aerojet were given access to all previous research into <b>directional</b> <b>mines,</b> including the M18 and the Phoenix, as well as German research. Dr. John Bledsoe led the initial project.|$|R

A further 67people (1.35%) were intercepted at the fence (shot and/or arrested). A total of 229people– just 4.6% of attempted escapees, representing less than one in twenty– made it across the fence. Of these, the largest number (129, or 55% of successful escapees) succeeded in making it across the fence in unmined sectors. 89people (39% of escapees) managed to cross both the minefields and the fence, but just 12people (6% of the total) succeeded in getting past the SM-70s booby-trap mines on the fences.|$|R

50|$|PADMINE is an anti-personnel <b>directional</b> {{fragmentation}} <b>mine</b> {{produced by}} the United Kingdom, similar to the Claymore in cosmetic design with two swivelling legs, inserted into soft-ground. Its lethality out to 50 metres arrives {{in the form of}} 650 steel balls and it is activated by remote control or trip wire.|$|R
50|$|The mine has {{conventional}} {{or advanced}} seismic influence fuzing. It is a hand laid <b>directional</b> fragmentation <b>mine</b> which is normally command actuated (always secure command wires). The MON-50 {{is known to}} be used with the VP13 seismic controller which prevents close approach for any clearance operations, or to a variety of BT fuzes.|$|R
50|$|The M18A1 Claymore is a <b>directional</b> anti-personnel <b>mine</b> {{developed}} for the United States Armed Forces. Its inventor, Norman MacLeod, named the mine after a large Scottish medieval sword. Unlike a conventional land mine, the Claymore is command-detonated and directional, meaning it is fired by remote-control and shoots a pattern of metal balls into the kill zone like a shotgun.|$|R

5000|$|The MAPED F1 is a claymore shaped plastic bodied <b>directional</b> anti-personnel <b>mine</b> {{which is}} {{designed}} to wound or kill by fragmentation. It has been the standard <b>directional</b> anti-personnel <b>mine</b> of the French army since the late 70s. The mine body is flat on the back and convex on the front, it has a small aiming sight on the top left corner and plastic lugs in the bottom corners for attaching a pair of [...] "A" [...] frame support legs. The mine contains a plastic explosive charge to propel 500 steel ball fragments to a range of 50 meters in a 60' arc. It is battery powered and is normally actuated by breakwire, but tripwire and command actuation is also possible. The mine is surface mounted and it can be located visually or with metal detectors under most field conditions. The MAPED F1 can be defeated by blast overpressure from explosive breaching systems like the Giant Viper and MICLIC unless it is set up for command actuation.|$|R
