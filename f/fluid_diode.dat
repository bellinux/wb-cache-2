40|$|The {{emergence}} of distributed hydraulic systems in aerospace and other high-tech industries requires {{the development of}} compact high-efficiency hydraulic pumps with high reliability, low weight, and a reduced number of moving parts. This paper presents a compact high-frequency solid-state pump concept ideally suited for incorporation in distributed hydraulic systems. The driving element of this pump is a high-frequency solid-state induced-strain actuator of either piezo-electric or piezo-magnetic characteristics. An essential feature of the proposed pump is the solid-state <b>fluid</b> <b>diode.</b> The use of a solid-state <b>fluid</b> <b>diode</b> {{eliminates the need for}} mechanical check valves and thus enables the solid-state actuation element to act at its kHz resonant frequency. This paper describes the importance of distributed hydraulic systems and outlines the advantages of using active-material in hydraulic power generation. A review {{of the state of the}} art in piezo-pumps is presented next. This is followed by the description of the proposed high-frequency solid-state modular pump incorporating a novel solid-state <b>fluid</b> <b>diode.</b> Schematic diagram and results of preliminary flow analysis are provided. A comprehensive list of references is also included...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, there has been {{significant}} development {{in the field of}} applications for piezoelectric materials. This thesis focuses on using these materials in a piezohydraulic pump system. Piezopump systems typically operate by pushing fluid through check valves to produce positive fluid flow. The accompanying hydraulic system utilizes a control valve, hydraulic accumulator, and hydraulic actuator. The function of the piezopump is to convert the very small displacements of the piezoelectric stack actuators into useful work. This paper details the design, construction, and testing of four such possible pumping systems. 	The first system was a thin diaphragm piezo pump which utilized conventional check valves to rectify the flow. This pump was the next generation system in a series of piezopumps designed at Georgia Tech. Its peak performance with a driving voltage of 150 V was a flowrate of 140 cc/min with a blocked pressure of 1. 38 MPa (200 psi.). The key features of this system were its aluminum construction and ease of assembly. 	A new technology was developed which used a resonant fluid cavity to build usable pressure for a pumping system. Two half wave resonators were build to operate at frequencies of 20 kHz and 1 kHz. These systems produced good pressure during resonance, but attempts to rectify these high frequency pulses were unsuccessful. Rectification methods such as reed valves, vortex <b>fluid</b> <b>diodes,</b> and nozzle/ diffuser arrangements were discussed. A reed valve system was developed and tested. A fourth piezoelectric system was developed which used the driving elements and the reed valves originally designed for the resonant systems. This non resonant reed valve pump produced good results. This pump systems produced 338 cc/min at a frequency of 400 Hz. It also produced a blocked pressure of 250 psi. There are many applications for these miniature high flow pumping systems. The technology in the reed valve pump is scalable, and the size of this particular system may be reduced dramatically to offer even more space saving potential. M. S.

40|$|Existing {{microfluidic}} devices transport fluids by {{a variety}} of physical means. Among them, pump-based and capillary-based fluid delivery systems are commonly adapted to move fluids. The pump-based systems intrinsically require sub systems consisting of mechanical and/or electrical instruments, which poses tremendous difficulties to system-level miniaturization. Herein, the investigations of two capillary-based microfluidic platforms are described. The first platform encapsulates biological reagents by capillary force in carefully designed microchannels, and detects biomolecules by moving magnetic beads in it. The second platform provides functional microfluidic devices made of paper—a fabric and abundant material that autonomously wicks fluids. Chapter 1 describes the development of the polymer-based platform, whereas Chapter 2 and 3 present the paper-based platform. ^ Specifically, Chapter 1 reports a the polymer-based microfluidic device for immuno-diagnostics. Rather than handling fluid reagents against a stationary solid phase, the platform manipulates analyte-coated magnetic beads through stationary plugs of fluid reagents to detect an antigenic analyte. These isolated but accessible plugs are pre-encapsulated in a microchannel by capillary force. We call this platform microfluidic inverse phase enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (μIPELISA). μIPELISA has distinctive advantages in the family of microfluidic immunoassay. In particular, it avoids pumping and valving fluid reagents during assaying, thus leading to a lab-on-a-chip format that is free of instrumentation for fluid actuation and control. We use μIPELISA to detect digoxigenin-labeled DNA segments amplified from E. Coli O 157 :H 7 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and compare its detection capability with that of microplate ELISA. For 0. 259 ng per 2 ̆ 6 mgr;L− 1 of digoxigenin-labeled amplicon, μIPELISA is as responsive as the microplate ELISA. Also, we simultaneously conduct μIPELISA in two parallel microchannels. ^ Chapter 2 reports a fluidic diode, valves and a circuit fabricated entirely on a single layer of paper to control wicking of <b>fluids.</b> Our fluidic <b>diode</b> is a two-terminal component that promotes or stops wicking along a paper channel. We further constructed a trigger valve and a delay valve based on the fluidic diode. Furthermore, we demonstrate a high-level functional circuit, consisted of a diode and a delay valve, to manipulate two fluids in a sequential manner. Our study provides new, transformative tools to manipulate fluid for microfluidic paper-based devices. ^ Chapter 3 reports the 3 D counterparts of the fluidic components described in the previous chapter. By using printing, stacking and taping, we create channels defined by wax contours in multilayer of paper to further reduce the footprints of microfluidic paper-based devices. This fabrication method is simple with a high yield: the channels are ready for assembling in minutes, and the typical turn-round time from a design to an end assembly is less than an hour. We believe these features are attractive for rapid prototyping of microfluidic paper-based devices. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{optimization}} study of an intermittent-flow multistage fluidized {{ion exchange column}} was performed using a stochastic approximation method.

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} an explosion {{of interest in the}} field of droplet-based microfluidics for their multifarious applications. Despite rapid innovations in strategies to generate small-scale liquid transport on such devices, the speed of motion is usually slow, the transport distance is limited, and the flow direction is not well controlled because of unwanted pinning of contact lines by defects on the surface. Here we report a new method of microscopic liquid transportation based on a unique topological structure that breaks the contact line pinning through efficient conversion of excess surface energy to kinetic energy at the advancing edge of the droplet whilst simultaneously arresting the reverse motion of the droplet via strong pinning. What results is a novel topological <b>fluid</b> <b>diode</b> that allows for a rapid, directional, and long-distance transport of virtually any kind of liquid without the need for an external energy input...|$|E
40|$|Fluid diodes are fluidic {{devices that}} enhance fluid flow in a {{particular}} direction while inhibiting it {{in the opposite direction}} without the use of moving parts. This is accomplished through the use of nozzle shaped geometry {{on one side of the}} diode, and cusp shaped geometry on the opposing side. Fluid meets very little resistance as is travels though the nozzle side of the diode. The cusps on the other side of the diode reduce the effective flow area, thereby inhibiting flow. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a <b>fluid</b> <b>diode</b> installed in a reconstructed cardiovascular system of an infant diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The <b>fluid</b> <b>diode</b> is not used inside the heart, but rather inside a shunt connecting the ventricle to the pulmonary artery. Currently, patients are experiencing regurgitant blood flow inside this shunt, which is known as a Sano shunt. This regurgitant volume increases the workload of the ventricle, which can lead to myocardial hypertrophy and eventual cardiac failure [1, 2]. The principle objective of this thesis is to characterize the performance of certain diodes by testing them experimentally using a mock circulatory system. Experiments were performed on three different size diodes-in-shunts as well as three different size empty shunts. The data from each diode-in-shunt test was compared to the data from each empty shunt test in order to determine if any performance gain was present. The regurgitant fraction (RF%) as well as the individual systolic and diastolic flow volumes were used to evaluate the performance of both the diodes-in-shunts as well as the empty shunts. The earlier experiments were conducted with the diode situated in the middle of the shunt. By moving the diode to the entrance of the shunt, the RF% was improved by as much as 51 %. However, with only three different size diodes-in-shunts as well as three different size empty shunts available for testing, it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions as to whether or not a diode can maintain the same systolic flow levels while reducing diastolic flow levels. Further testing using different diameter diodes is required. Advisor: Kevin Col...|$|E
