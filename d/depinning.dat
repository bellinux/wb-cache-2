5000|$|The most {{intriguing}} properties of density waves are their dynamics. Under an appropriate electric field or magnetic field, a density wave will [...] "slide" [...] {{in the direction}} indicated by the field due to the electrostatic or magnetostatic force. Typically the sliding will not begin until a [...] "depinning" [...] threshold field is exceeded where the wave can escape from a potential well caused by a defect. The hysteretic motion of density waves is therefore not unlike that of dislocations or magnetic domains. The current-voltage curve of a CDW solid therefore shows a very high electrical resistance up to the <b>depinning</b> voltage, above which it shows a nearly ohmic behavior. Under the <b>depinning</b> voltage (which depends on {{the purity of the}} material), the crystal is an insulator.|$|E
50|$|Pinning {{force is}} a force acting on a pinned object from a pinning center. In solid state physics, this most often refers to the vortex pinning, the pinning of the {{magnetic}} vortices (magnetic flux quanta, Abrikosov vortices) by different kinds of the defects in a type II superconductor. Important quantities are the individual maximal pinning force, which defines the <b>depinning</b> of a single vortex, and an average pinning force, which defines the <b>depinning</b> of the correlated vortex structures and {{can be associated with}} the critical current density (the maximal density of non-dissipative current). The interaction of the correlated vortex lattice with system of pinning centers forms the magnetic phase diagram of the vortex matter in superconductors. This phase diagram is especially rich for high temperature superconductors (HTSC) where the thermo-activation processes are essential.|$|E
40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the simultaneous}} {{effect of a}} regular and a random pinning potentials on the vortex lattice structure at filling factor of 1. This structure is determined by a competition between the square symmetry of regular pinning array, by the intervortex interaction favoring a triangular symmetry, and by the randomness trying to <b>depin</b> vortices from their regular positions. Both analytical and molecular-dynamics approaches are used. We construct a phase diagram of the system in the plane of regular and random pinning strengths and determine typical vortex lattice defects appearing in the system due to the disorder. We find that the total disordering of the vortex lattice can occur either in one step or in two steps. For instance, {{in the limit of}} weak pinning, a square lattice of pinned vortices is destroyed in two steps. First, elastic chains of <b>depinned</b> vortices appear in the film; but the vortex lattice as a whole remains still pinned by the underlying square array of regular pinning sites. These chains are composed into fractal-like structures. In a second step, domains of totally <b>depinned</b> vortices are generated and the vortex lattice <b>depins</b> from regular array.

40|$|We use an {{harmonic}} {{technique to}} probe the dynamics of a liquid-liquid interface in a capillary. The capillary pressure drop induced by a harmonic displacement of the fluids is recorded {{as a function of}} the excitation amplitude and frequency. At low frequency there is an amplitude threshold above which the contact line <b>depins</b> and slides, and this threshold is related to the static hysteresis of the contact angle. When the contact line <b>depins,</b> the damping due to its motion is measured from the component of the capillary pressure in phase with the fluids velocity. At frequencies higher than one hertz we observe a phenomenon of dynamic pinning. The behaviour of the damping suggests that the variation of the contact angle with the three-phase line velocity is frequency-dependent...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the flux-line lattice in the superconducting film with the periodic system of artificial pinning sites is studied theoretically using the London model. The existence of different vortex phases (pinned square phase, <b>depinned</b> deformed triangular phase, and "intermediate" phase) is revealed. The phase diagrams of the vortex lattice are obtained. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{critical}} currents {{related to}} the escape (<b>depinning)</b> of the phase from two different wells of the Josephson potential. The lowest critical current can be seen experimentally only at low damping (low temperature). The measurements of the critical current {{can be used to}} determine the (unknown) state (+φ or -φ) of φ junction.|$|E
50|$|However, since {{impurities}} are randomly {{distributed throughout}} the crystal, a more realistic picture must allow for variations in optimum CDW phase φ with position - essentially a modified sine-Gordon picture with a disordered washboard potential. This {{is done in the}} Fukuyama-Lee-Rice (FLR) model, in which the CDW minimizes its total energy by optimizing both the elastic strain energy due to spatial gradients in φ and the pinning energy. Two limits that emerge from FLR include weak pinning, typically from isoelectronic impurities, where the optimum phase is spread over many impurities and the <b>depinning</b> field scales as ni2 (ni being the impurity concentration) and strong pinning, where each impurity is strong enough to pin the CDW phase and the <b>depinning</b> field scales linearly with ni. Variations of this theme include numerical simulations that incorporate random distributions of impurities (random pinning model).|$|E
50|$|Linear chain {{compounds}} exhibiting CDW transport have CDW wavelengths λcdw = π/kF incommensurate with (i.e., not {{an integer}} multiple of) the lattice constant. In such materials, pinning {{is due to}} impurities that break the translational symmetry of the CDW with respect to φ. The simplest model treats the pinning as a sine-Gordon potential of the form u(φ) = u0- cosφ, while the electric field tilts the periodic pinning potential until the phase can slide over the barrier above the classical <b>depinning</b> field. Known as the overdamped oscillator model, since it also models the damped CDW response to oscillatory (ac) electric fields, this picture accounts for the scaling of the narrow-band noise with CDW current above threshold.|$|E

50|$|Building on this picture, {{as well as}} a 2000 {{article on}} time-correlated soliton tunneling, a more recent quantum model proposes Josephson-like {{coupling}} (see Josephson effect) between complex order parameters associated with nucleated droplets of charged soliton dislocations on many parallel chains. Following Richard Feynman in The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. III, Ch. 21, their time-evolution is described using the Schrödinger equation as an emergent classical equation. The narrow-band noise and related phenomena result from the periodic buildup of electrostatic charging energy and thus do not depend on the detailed shape of the washboard pinning potential. Both a soliton pair-creation threshold and a higher classical <b>depinning</b> field emerge from the model, which views the CDW as a sticky quantum fluid or deformable quantum solid with dislocations, a concept discussed by Philip Warren Anderson.|$|E
50|$|Early quantum models {{included}} a soliton pair creation model by Maki and a proposal by John Bardeen that condensed CDW electrons tunnel coherently through a tiny pinning gap, fixed at ±kF unlike the Peierls gap. Maki's theory lacked a sharp threshold field and Bardeen only gave a phenomenological {{interpretation of the}} threshold field. However, a 1985 paper by Krive and Rozhavsky pointed out that nucleated solitons and antisolitons of charge ±q generate an internal electric field E* proportional to q/ε. The electrostatic energy (1/2)ε± E*2 prevents soliton tunneling for applied fields E less than a threshold ET = E*/2 without violating energy conservation. Although this Coulomb blockade threshold can be {{much smaller than the}} classical <b>depinning</b> field, it shows the same scaling with impurity concentration since the CDW's polarizability and dielectric response ε vary inversely with pinning strength.|$|E

If the temperature is higher than 300 K, the motion of a screw dislocation is no longer restricted to a single glide plane due to cross slip on the void surface.

The tracks' related enhancement of the critical currents is much smaller for {{the case of the}} thin films. We interpret this thickness dependence as resulting from a competition between the pinning of the correlated structures, related to total sample thickness, and surface boundary conditions, which force the vortices to <b>depin</b> from the columnar defects near the sample surface.
