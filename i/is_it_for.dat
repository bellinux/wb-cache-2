25|$|For Kangaroo Books (their logo looked amazingly {{like that}} of America's Pocket Books), McLoughlin painted a few {{paperback}} covers but primarily produced joke books. The publisher paid £18 each for these which included writing about 50 jokes, illustrating them, and producing the cover. After doing the first joke book, probably Laughter for the Home Front, solo, McLoughlin enlisted the aid of his brother Colin (b. 2 November 1925) with the writing chore. Thus began a working relationship between the McLoughlin brothers that would last at least into the 1950s and that produced New Laughs for All, Laugh While You Work, You've Had It, and This <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> Kangaroo.|$|E

500|$|In Lauper's first {{effort at}} {{writing for the}} stage, she found that it {{required}} a sustained effort to write songs for the different characters. [...] Lauper joked about the difficulty of writing her first score: [...] "How much of a stretch <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me to write songs about fashion, funny relationships, people changing their minds and shoes?" [...] The first song that Lauper wrote was the opening number, which included {{a wide range of}} voices. Her process was to conceive a song and sing it into her iPhone, and orchestrator Stephen Oremus would write it down. Oremus would then [...] "'blow up' the vocal line into harmonies, create the incidental music that linked scenes and songs" [...] and orchestrate the material. The songs range in style [...] "from pop to funk to new wave to tango, with highly personal lyrics". [...] New York Times critic Melena Ryzik wrote: [...] "Though there are plenty of hooky, rousing numbers, the emotional heart of Kinky Boots is several ballads about the weight of parental expectations." [...] The musical uses a twelve-piece orchestra consisting of keyboards, percussion, bass, guitars, reeds, violin, viola, cello, trumpet, and trombone.|$|E

500|$|In a 3 September 2013 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it {{likely would have}} never happened. Jones said [...] "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band". Jones also stated that the Sound System box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. [...] "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me, and I say that with an exclamation mark." [...] Jones said.|$|E

But Rajamouli excels in story-telling. The way he has used the {{flashback}} as a flip switch, going back and forth and taking the viewer through a 400-year journey in a jiffy is interesting. The rest is about how well technology, creativity, imagination and innovation are leveraged to present what is an eye-pleasing experience for viewers." [...] B. V. S. Prakash of The Times of India wrote, [...] "Despite a few narrative lapses, the much-hyped semi-periodic epic lives up to expectations. Unlike his previous action-centric films, director Rajamouli dishes a heart-touching love story in a lavish canvas convincingly. Also kudos for the way he has visualised and presented the film." [...] He added, [...] "After not-so-impressive Chirutha, Ram Charan Tej returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. Similarly, Kajal known for simple lover girl roles transforms into a determined princess and truly impresses. Dev Gil is adequate as the ruthless villain", and rated the film 3 out of 5.|$|E
2500|$|In spring 1822 Lord Milton gave to Fitzwilliam {{a list of}} English boroughs {{and their}} Members' {{political}} party. It showed that boroughs with smaller populations had more government supporters than those with larger populations, which had more Whig MPs. Milton therefore asked Fitzwilliam to support reform which would strengthen the Whig aristocracy. Fitzwilliam conceded that such a scheme would improve the system, as he wrote to Lord Grey on 22 March, [...] "but ninety other plans would do as much, and with me the question is, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> {{the advantage of the}} country, and {{for the good of the}} public to moot the subject at all—where are you to limit alterations, at what point are they to stop?"

Leaving him, Hai Ning also decides to write the new book herself – a book about online dating and marriage – with a simple online ad that states: “Female, 32 years old.

Hoping to be friends first before marriage.” As Hai Ning begins to meet with an endless stream of potential marriage candidates and then meets Benjamin (Christopher Lee), will he help Hai Ning finish her the experiment and the book? ...|$|E
2500|$|Cyril of Alexandria, his {{antagonist}} Theodoret, and Theodore of Mopsuestia, who was {{loose from}} all tradition, {{had the same}} clear belief. Cyril writes [...] "It is demonstrative of the gentleness and long-suffering of God, that Elias also the Tishbite shall shine upon us, to foreannounce when the Judge shall come {{to those in the}} whole world. For the Son shall come down, as Judge, in the glory of the Father, attended by the angels, and shall 'sit on the throne of His glory, judging the world in righteousness, and shall reward every man according to his works.' But since we are in many sins, well <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> us, that the divine prophet goes before Him, bringing all those on earth to one mind; that all, being brought to the unity through the faith, and ceasing from evil intents, may fulfill that which is good, and so be saved when the Judge cometh down. The blessed John the Baptist came before Him [...] "in the spirit and power of Elias." [...] But, as he preached saying, 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight,' so also the divine Elias proclaims His then being near and all-but-present, that He may 'judge the world in righteousness.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Verve's members {{sometimes}} expressed bitter sentiments {{about the}} band's later years. In his only interview after the split, McCabe said of Urban Hymns: [...] "By the time I got my parts in there it's {{not really a}} music fan's record. It just sits nicely next to the Oasis record", though conceding, [...] "I'm {{not going to say}} it was bad. I mean, we were good as far as pop goes". During his solo career, Ashcroft expressed regret at having asked McCabe to return for the album instead of releasing it under his own name, saying: [...] "Imagine being the guy that's written an album on his own, bottles it near the end, feels like there's unfinished business, rings Nick McCabe up who adds some guitars, puts it out as the Verve and the same problems arise again. Imagine being that mug. I've now got to rewrite history. Everyone thinks those songs are somehow associated with another bunch of people that I'm not with now". Jones claimed that [...] "The Verve were going off in a direction of strings and ballads, and that's not where I was coming from at all. Loud guitars <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me", though noting that this was not why the band split up.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinction}} between the decorative and the fine arts has essentially arisen from the post-Renaissance art of the West, where the distinction is {{for the most part}} meaningful. This distinction is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most highly regarded works– or even all works– include those in decorative media. [...] For example, Islamic art in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, often using geometric and plant forms, as does the art of many traditional cultures. The {{distinction between}} decorative and fine arts is not very useful for appreciating Chinese art, and neither <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> understanding Early Medieval art in Europe. In that period in Europe, fine arts such as manuscript illumination and monumental sculpture existed, but the most prestigious works tended to be in goldsmith work, in cast metals such as bronze, or in other techniques such as ivory carving. Large-scale wall-paintings were much less regarded, crudely executed, and rarely mentioned in contemporary sources. They were probably seen as an inferior substitute for mosaic, which for this period must be viewed as a fine art, though in recent centuries mosaics have tended to be seen as decorative. The term [...] "ars sacra" [...] ("sacred arts") is sometimes used for medieval Christian art done in metal, ivory, textiles, and other high-value materials but not for rarer secular works from that period.|$|E
