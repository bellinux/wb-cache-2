5000|$|Sendzimir process (named after Tadeusz Sendzimir) {{is used to}} {{galvanize}} a steel strip by using {{a small amount of}} aluminum in the zinc bath and producing a coating with essentially no <b>iron-zinc</b> <b>alloy.</b> The process guarantees high resistance and durability characteristics. About 75% of hydrogen was needed in the original Sendzimir process but all the newer nonoxidizing methods of degreasing require only 7 - 15%.|$|E
40|$|Theη toG phase {{transformation}} in electrodeposited <b>iron-zinc</b> <b>alloy</b> coatings is a rapid diffusional {{phase transformation}} {{occurring in the}} nanometer-scale microstructure of the coatings. Iron-supersaturated zinc, orη phase, undergoes a decomposition process to an iron-deficient Γ-like, orG, phase at temperatures near 150 it°C. The phase transformation is preceded by a polygonization process, driven by strain energy and/or supersaturation in the material. TheG phase nucleates on boundaries within theη phase and grows into 30 - to 80 -nm equiaxed grains. The activation energy for the transformation varies with iron content, which may indicate that solute effects influence boundary diffusion of zinc...|$|E
40|$|The iron content, phase constitution, and {{microstructure}} of electrodeposited <b>iron-zinc</b> <b>alloy</b> coatings deposited from chloride baths were investigated. It {{was found}} that the iron content of the coatings varied with the current density used during processing and that coatings containing 6 to 13 wt pct Fe consisted of nonequilibrium phases, η andG. η phase, hexagonal close-packed (hcp) zinc supersaturated with iron to about 8 wt pct Fe, contained nanometer-size crys-tals divided by 30 -nm-wide growth steps. Within the growth steps, an amorphous phase was present. TheG phase, a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase similar to equilibrium γ phase, existed as equiaxed 30 - to 80 -nm-wide grains in 10 and 13 wt pct Fe coatings. It is suggested that the microstructure of higher iron content coatings resulted from a recovery/polygonization process...|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} hot-dip {{galvanizing}} {{results in a}} metallurgical bond between zinc and steel {{with a series of}} distinct <b>iron-zinc</b> <b>alloys.</b> The resulting coated steel can be used {{in much the same way}} as uncoated.|$|R
