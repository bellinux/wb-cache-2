The <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>issue</b> occurs when {{the terms of the}} controversy are defined by the judge, through a decree of the judge. Further on, this part explains the trial of the litigation, especially the absence of a party, the intervention of a third person and the proofs. There are six kinds of proof: declarations of the parties, documents, testimonies, experts, judicial examination and inspection, and presumptions. After taking evidence the acts are published, the case concluded and then discussed. The case ends with the sentence of the judge. The sentence can be challenged by complaint of nullity and by appeal. Finally the res inducta and restitutio in integrum, the execution of the judgement, the judicial expenses and gratuitous legal assistance are regulated. As an alternative to this contentious trial there is the possibility of an oral contentious process.|$|R

The following BA degree paper {{focuses on}} the treating of the institute <b>of</b> compulsory <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> parties. The institute is dealt with from both perspectives, the theoretical {{as well as the}} practical one. According to the institute <b>of</b> compulsory <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> parties, the persons who are – by the rules of substantive law – defined as being compulsory joinders need to participate in a law suit. These persons can collaborate in the law suit either on the active, or on the passive side of the dispute, otherwise it is implied that not the right client is being prosecuted. The introductory chapter deals with the theoretical basis of the institute <b>of</b> <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> parties, and its variations. The thesis then proceeds with the treatment of the institute <b>of</b> compulsory <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> parties, limiting itself on the effects of the institute, which reflect themselves in a law suit as well as in a legal relationship between compulsory <b>joinders</b> <b>of</b> parties. The last chapter deals with the presentation of case law in the fields of law of succession, family law, property law, and law of obligations.

40|$|Playing off {{the strict}} {{requirements}} of federal diversity jurisdiction, plaintiffs can structure their suits to prevent removal to federal court. A common way to preclude removability is {{to join a}} nondiverse party. Although plaintiffs {{have a great deal}} of flexibility, they may include only those parties that have a stake in the lawsuit. Put another way, a court will not permit a plaintiff to join a party to a lawsuit when that party is being joined solely to prevent removal. The most useful tool federal courts employ to prevent this form of jurisdictional manipulation is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21. Rule 21 permits a federal court to drop a joined party if that party fails the permissive <b>joinder</b> rules <b>of</b> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20. Federal courts have an additional tool to scrutinize joined defendants: the fraudulent joinder doctrine. The doctrine permits a federal court to look beyond the face of the complaint to determine whether the plaintiff has a colorable claim against the nondiverse defendant. If not, the court ignores this diversity-destroying defendant and the suit remains in federal court. Ultimately, federal courts use this robust tool only to scrutinize the <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> defendants, leaving some plaintiff-based manipulation unchecked. This Note argues that federal courts should correct this deficiency and extend the fraudulent joinder doctrine to police sham plaintiffs. Extending the doctrine in this manner would prevent jurisdictional gamesmanship, provide defendants with a fair opportunity to remove to a neutral forum, and supply clear standards for courts to deploy in scrutinizing the <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> sham plaintiffs...|$|R

40|$|Well over {{a century}} ago, legal and policy analysts {{realized}} that the days of purely individual action in matters of business and labor were over, and that legal rules must adapt to {{the social and economic}} power of large corporations. Among the rules that changed were archaic limitations on <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> claims and parties in litigation and laissez faire “liberty of contract” doctrines invalidating labor legislation. Recently, lawyers representing large corporate employers have urged a revival of old rules limiting class actions and labor rights. But, as this Article will show, {{it is not at all}} clear that their clients will benefit from the legal regime the lawyers have created. As long as employers have large workforces working under uniform policies, they will face dozens or hundreds of similar claims challenging pay practices, discrimination, and harassment. Group adjudication arose to address efficiently the many similar claims that arise when large institutions adopt uniform policies. Individual arbitration of such claims may result in fewer claims being filed, especially if confidentiality provisions keep co-workers from learning from each other about how to assert successful claims. But unless or until employers figure out a way to shift all the costs of dispute resolution onto the claimaints (and thus far courts have resisted such efforts), and to silence all claimants and their lawyers, employers will face many similar claims, will be paying part or all of the costs of lots of identical arbitrations, and will be paying lawyers to handle them separately rather than on a classwide basis. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects the right of employees to engage in “concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. ” The National Labor Relations Board (“the Board”) has long held that protected activity includes asserting claims in courts, agencies, and in arbitration. In D. R. Horton, the Board found the NLRA to prohibit enforcement of an employer-imposed requirement that employees waive their right to bring a collective action challenging their working conditions. On petition for review, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the Board’s determination, holding that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) requires enforcement of the mandatory arbitration agreement, including its class action waiver. This Article explains why collective action waivers or requirements to arbitrate individually are unenforceable under the National Labor Relations Act and the Norris LaGuardia Act. The Article also explains why arbitration agreements requiring claims to be brought by individuals are not covered by the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Concepcion and Italian Colors to the extent they prohibit <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> fewer parties than would be required to bring a large class action and, therefore, remain protected by labor law. The Article notes the inconsistency in the FAA cases about whether agreements can waive the right to file charges with some agencies and courts rather than others and therefore critiques the Fifth Circuit’s ruling that the FAA trumps the employees’ rights under NLRA sections 7 and 8 (a) (1) to file group actions in court or arbitration but does not trump section 8 (a) (4), which protects the right to file unfair labor practice charges. Finally, the Article raises some questions about the practical wisdom of the courts’ willingness to allow employers to require employees to pursue claims only as individuals. State and federal courts universally allow liberal <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> plaintiffs and defendants because it is more efficient and avoids some truly thorny issues about the preclusive effect of judgments. The Fifth Circuit majority’s assumption, like the Supreme Court majority’s in Concepcion, that individual determination of claims is better suited to arbitration is simply wrong in many cases. Unless employers can opt out of the usual rules for the binding effects of judgments and the usual rules for <b>joinder</b> <b>of</b> claims and parties, the notion that individual arbitration is superior for everyone (including employers) is simply wrong...|$|R
