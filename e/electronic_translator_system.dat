40|$|Ubiquitous {{computer}} network shall include {{wide variety of}} devices. This means that the ubiquitous network certainly increases the heterogeneity of nodes connected to the Internet, while {{increasing the number of}} nodes. This paper proposes a system architecture to solve this architectural challenge by the introduction of two sub-systems: ”Configurable Plug-In <b>Translator</b> <b>System</b> ” and ”Dynamic Management Script Resolver System”. The <b>translator</b> <b>system</b> provides generalized interfaces to applications, by absorbing the heterogeneous low-level interfaces with script execution engine. Here, the behavior of every remote node is described by the script language. The resolver system achieves a global scale script repository, using DNS, inheriting the advantages of DNS, i. e., scalability, robustness and authority management capability. The integration of these two sub-systems autonomously provides application software with generalized interfaces to access any remote device node on the global Internet. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{students}} who use pocket electronic dictionaries (ED), electronic spellers, grammar checkers and <b>electronic</b> language <b>translators</b> in ESL classrooms has increased over the past few years. However, very few studies investigated the role of electronic dictionaries, electronic spellers, grammar checkers and <b>electronic</b> language <b>translators</b> in ESL. Two studies by Tang (1997) and Aust (1993) investigated the use of pocket ED's by ESL students at the secondary and undergraduate levels. Tang's study examined ED features, uses, effectiveness as a tool for learning, and students’ perceptions of ED usefulness. Aust's study examined measures of consultation, study time, efficiency and comprehension, and use of bilingual and monolingual ED's. Another study by Zupanicic (1995) compared the use of an electronic speller and a personal spelling dictionary in increasing elementary students' awareness of standard spelling.
