40|$|A {{concept for}} forced reentry of small orbital debris with {{characteristic}} dimension ~ 10 cm from the highly populated sun synchronous orbit by injecting micron scale dust grains to artificially enhance drag is discussed. The drag enhancement {{is most effective}} when <b>dust</b> grains <b>counter</b> rotate {{with respect to the}} debris resulting in hypervelocity dust/debris impacts. While the natural drag on small debris with ballistic coefficient ~ 5 kg/m 2 in orbits with perigee above 900 km is negligible, it is sufficient to decay the orbit of the injected dust grains at a significant rate. This offers a unique opportunity to synchronize the rates of descent of the dust and debris to create a sweeping (snow-plow-like) effect on the debris by a descending narrow dust layer. The dust density necessary to de-orbit small debris is sufficiently low such that the orbits of active satellites which have larger ballistic coefficients are minimally affected. If deemed necessary, contact of the injected dust with active satellites may be avoided by maneuvering the satellite around the narrow dust layer...|$|R

30|$|Dust {{particles}} (or micrometeoroids) {{around the}} Moon, {{which we call}} lunar ambient dust particles, include interplanetary dust (IPD), β meteoroids, interstellar dust (ISD), and possibly lunar dust that originates from the surface materials of the Moon. According to a direct measurement of the accretion rate to the Earth by Love and Brownlee (1993), several {{thousands of tons of}} dust particles may fall onto the Moon every year, supplying materials to its surface layer. When the inflow dust particles hit the surface of the Moon, or any other airless body (Mercury, asteroids, etc.), the resulting melting and vaporization redden materials on the surface. Therefore, the reflectance spectrum of lunar surface materials can be changed from their primordial characteristics by the hypervelocity impact of dust particles because of the space weathering (Hapke et al., 1975; Keller and McKay, 1993; Sasaki and Hiroi, 2008). This change might cause a problem in estimating mineralogi-cal composition from the reflectance spectrum of the Moon. The quantitative relation between dust flux and reflectance change is uncertain since the flux of the inflow dust colliding with the lunar surface has not yet been quantitatively estimated for different dust sizes. Therefore, an in-situ measurement of “inflow” dust particles is very important for an understanding of the material composition of the lunar surface. The regolith on the lunar surface may be accelerated to energetic lunar dust by some mechanisms. As a result, some lunar material possibly leaves the gravitational influence of the Moon (like lunar meteorites). Although the escaping mass flux is still uncertain, primordial surface materials might be exposed by such a mass-loss mechanism from the lunar surface. Thus, the “outflow” dust particles are another important factor to understand the chemical composition of material of the lunar surface. There have been several past missions for dust observation around the Moon, but we need further data to improve the statistics for a quantitative study of lunar ambient dust particles; in particular, the outflow dust particles. The next Japanese lunar mission SELENE- 2, after the successful mission Kaguya (formerly known as SELENE), is planned to be launched in the mid 2010 s and to consist of a lander, a rover, and an orbiter, as a transmitting satellite to the Earth (Matsumoto et al, 2008). Here, we propose a cosmic-dust particle detector LDM (Lunar Dust Monitor) to be onboard the orbiter. In a lunar orbit that is far further from the Earth and, in particular, the earth's geosynchronous orbit, cosmic-dust observation takes place in a clean environment, which is not influenced by a background of man-made space debris. As for dust observation in a debris-free environment for one year, cosmic-dust observation with a large detection area is certainly of significance. Recently, large-detection-area <b>dust</b> <b>counters</b> have been proposed for future space missions in Earth orbit (Sternovsky et al., 2007; Grün et al, 2009). If those missions are realized, many subjects that have been neglected due to insufficient statistics of dust observation might be solved. The detection area of the LDM proposed here is smaller than those mentioned above, but still has larger detection area than those used in past dust missions in lunar orbit. In this paper, we summarize the observational significance of lunar ambient dust and present an overview of our instrument proposed to the SELENE- 2 mission, which has a large detection area thereby enabling a significant amount of data to be obtained.|$|R
40|$|In August/September of 2001, the R/P FLIP and CIRPAS Twin Otter {{research}} aircraft {{were deployed}} {{to the eastern}} coast of Oahu, Hawaii, {{as part of the}} Rough Evaporation Duct (RED) experiment. Goals included the study of the air/sea exchange, turbulence, and sea-salt aerosol particle characteristics at the subtropical marine Pacific site. Here we examine coarse mode particle size distributions. Similar to what has been shown for airborne <b>dust,</b> optical particle <b>counters</b> such as the Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP), Classical Scattering Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (CSASP) and the Cloud Aerosol Spectrometer (CAS) within the Cloud Aerosol and Precipitation Spectrometer (CAPS) instrument systematically overestimate particle size, and consequently volume, for sea salt particles. Ground-based aerodynamic particle sizers (APS) and AERONET inversions yield much more reasonable results. A wing pod mounted APS gave mixed results and may not be appropriate for marine boundary layer studies. Relating our findings to previous studies does much to explain the bulk of the differences in the literature and leads us to conclude that the largest uncertainty facing flux and airborne cloud/aerosol interaction studies is likely due to the instrumentation itself. To our knowledge, there does not exist an in situ aircraft system that adequately measures the ambient volume distribution of coarse mode sea salt particles. Most empirically based sea salt flux parameterizations can trace their heritage to a clearly biased measurement technique.

Two monitoring campaigns of particulate matter were performed. The first one {{was carried out in}} a cellular office mainly occupied by a single person; it lasted 45 days with a sampling time-step of 1 minute. The second one was performed in an open-plan office occupied by 6 - 8 persons during 155 days with an hourly time step sampling. The indoor air particulate matter was sampled using an optical particle <b>counter</b> (<b>Dust</b> Monitor 1. 108, Grimm) which provided the number of particles per liter, for 15 size bins within a size range of 0. 3 - 20 µm. In addition, several other parameters were measured during the two campaigns. The concentration of CO 2 was monitored as a tracer of the human activity in both cases, and indoor and outdoor climatic parameters for the open-plan office. The sources of variability of the concentration of particles are unknown in both cases; we attempt to estimate them by inverse modeling using only receptor information (without a priori knowledge of the pollutant transformation or transportation). The studies on outdoor environment use mainly chemical mass balance (CMB) or Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to assess the contribution of the various sources. Some other methods were developed in the field of Signal Processing for the same purposes, e. g. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF). The latter methods have not been used in the field of indoor air quality for source identification and apportionment. We attempt to evaluate their potential in the indoor environment. In this study, we compare the results obtained using four different methods: principal component analysis (PCA), ICA, PMF and NNMF. These results obtained are both the time variation of identified sources and their contribution for each particle size. The interpretation of the source temporal profiles is realized {{with the help of the}} other parameters such as CO 2. For example, the first principal component of PCA is highly correlated to CO 2 level, and indicates a human activity source profile.
