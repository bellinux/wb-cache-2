There are several ways to calculate the earthing resistance theoretically, but in practice it differs by various factors. In these factors the contact resistance between the earth and the grounding electrode is given much weight. Here it has been assumed that the earthing resistance is composed of one resistance which may be calculated by the resistivity of the ground and of another that may be the contact resistance between the earth and the earthing electrode，and {{in the area of the}} volcanic ashes the contact resistance between the simple grounding bar and the earth has been got experimentaly for the shallow part of the ground.

40|$|Surface {{discharge}} at the oil-pressboard interface {{leads to}} the development of a conducting path that is generally accepted as white marks due to localized heating. The visible white marks are believed to be due to partial discharge (PD) energy that is high enough to dry out the pressboard through vaporizing the moisture and breaking oil molecules to generate gases in the pressboard pores. A long period of electrical stress applied to a surface discharge experiment using a needle-bar electrode configuration has led to the formation of full-gap white marks on the pressboard surface that bridged the needle tip and <b>earth</b> <b>bar.</b> During the surface discharge, leakage current may occur intermittently that sometimes is visible in the form of full discharge of arcing at the oil-pressboard interface bridging the needle tip and <b>earth</b> <b>bar.</b> This condition is expected to be similar to that of dry-band arcing from inclined-plane tracking experiments for outdoor insulation. This paper explains the surface discharge experiment and details the obtained leakage current characteristics in terms of waveforms and frequency spectra. Correlation between leakage current measurements using a shunt resistor and PD signal detection has been undertaken in order to identify the useful information for condition monitoring of surface discharge in a large transformer. An equivalent circuit to represent the leakage current occurrence at the oil-pressboard interface without considering the superimposed pulses due to individual PD events is also proposed.

5000|$|A {{system could}} be made entirely ungrounded. In this case a fault between one phase and ground would not cause any {{significant}} current. In fact, {{this is not a}} good scheme. Commonly the neutral is grounded (earthed) through a bond between the neutral <b>bar</b> and the <b>earth</b> <b>bar.</b> It is common on larger systems to monitor any current flowing through the neutral-to-earth link and use this as the basis for neutral fault protection. The connection between neutral and earth allows any phase-to-earth fault to develop enough current flow to [...] "trip" [...] the circuit overcurrent protection device. In some jurisdictions, calculations are required to ensure the fault loop impedance is low enough so that fault current will trip the protection (In Australia, this is referred to in AS3000:2007 Fault loop impedance calculation). This may limit the length of a branch circuit. In the case of two phases sharing one neutral, the worst-case current draw is one side has zero load and the other has full load, or when both sides have full load. The latter case results in 1 + 1@120deg = 1@60deg, i.e. the magnitude of the current in the neutral equals that of the other two wires.|$|R

40|$|Creeping {{discharge}} at the oil-pressboard interface is {{a serious}} fault condition because {{it can lead to}} catastrophic failure under normal operating conditions of large transformers. Creeping discharge leads {{to the development of a}} conducting path that is generally accepted as white marks on a board surface due to localised heating. The visible white marks indicate a drying out process of the pressboard through moisture evaporation and the breaking of oil molecules to generate gases in the pressboard pores. The processes can continue from minutes to months or even years until failure. Characterising this type of faulty condition in a condition monitoring programme is important for transformer life management. This paper explains the behaviour of surface discharge observed during a surface discharge experiment at the oil-pressboard interface using a needle-bar electrode configuration. Correlation between partial discharge (PD) activities and measured data in terms of phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns have been undertaken. The experimental results also show a decreasing trend of the average discharge magnitude during the formation of the white marks that propagate towards the <b>earth</b> <b>bar.</b> This finding is qualitatively comparable to on-line problems reported previously, i. e. there was a falling trend and no obvious evidence of imminent failure from the monitoring data of PD activity of a large power transformer that eventually suffered from an unexpected fault...|$|R

Now Chapter 41 of BS 7671 : 2008 requires that additional protection by means of a 30 mA 40 ms residual current protection device be provided for final circuits supplying general purpose socket outlets that are intended for use by ‘Ordinary persons’. However, there are few publications and little information available on the theory describing how touch voltage of a dangerous magnitude could be transferred from a faulty circuit onto the exposed-conductive-parts of Class 1 equipment of another healthy circuit. This paper summarises the theory of transfer touch voltage calculations and expands on it to show how to carry out a sensitivity analysis in relation to the design parameters that are being used by designers and installers. Based on the results of a real case study, it appears that there is sufficient evidence to show that it may not be sufficiently safe to use the nominal external earth fault loop impedance quoted by the electricity utility companies for adopting a low touch voltage design. Practical application: The touch voltage sensitivity equation derived in this paper is a powerful tool for designers and installers of electrical installations to investigate and identify the sensitivity of resulting touch voltages of any electrical circuits.

40|$|Surface {{discharge}} at the oil-pressboard interface {{is classified}} {{as one of the}} most dangerous fault conditions of large transformers. Surface discharges can be sustained for long periods without surface flashover or breakdown as long as the surface breakdown voltage is not exceeded [1]. Damage at the pressboard surface due to surface discharge is a function of applied voltage and time. If an applied voltage, above the surface partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) but less than surface flashover voltage persists, the resulting discharges can develop a creeping path due to the drying out of the pressboard by localized heating (forcing oil and water out of the pressboard pores) and the carbonization of the oil and cellulose [1]. The drying of pressboard during the surface discharge process has been observed as the development of white marks on the pressboard surface [1]. A surface discharge experiment using a needle-bar electrode configuration has been developed. A shunt resistor that has been extensively used to measure leakage current for outdoor insulation systems [2] is used in the experiment. The leakage current is also measured using a commercial partial discharge detection system to allow comparison of the leakage current waveform from the oscilloscope against the corresponding phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) pattern obtained. Figure 1 shows an example of measured leakage current during the occurrence of full-length discharge. It has been found that after long periods of surface discharge, temporary full-length discharges may occur across the pressboard surface bridging the needle tip and the earth without resulting in complete electrical breakdown. The full-length discharges occur when the white marks have reached the <b>earth</b> <b>bar</b> and travel along the same path as the white marks [3]. The occurrence of this full-length discharge leads to small leakage current (mA range) flowing to earth that is unlikely to trip the earth fault protection relays [3]. Although the currents are relatively small, identifying their presence and relating them to forms of PD activity at the pressboard oil interface is important as it may provide a mechanism for earlier detection of creep stress failure...|$|R
