A spectral shift in narrow band exposing radiation is used to test significance of <b>exponential</b> <b>absorption</b> on linearity of photoconduction transfer. Variations in development electrode spacing and development time test for nonlinearity induced by temporal and spatial frequency dependent depletion of electrodeveloper particles.

Results for edge and sinusoidal image transfer indicated nonlinear depletion effects shortly after development initiation. Increased development times reduced adjacency effects for edge distributions and lower harmonic distortions for sinusoidal image distributions.

Abundant source of green energy is sun light, which can be harvested in many different procedures. Solar panel is proved the most effective method for extracting energy from sun light. The second-generation thin film solar cells are increasingly promising for their cheaper production and better efficiency. Cells based on (i) polycrystalline CdTe, (ii) polycrystalline CuInGaSe 2 (CIGS) and (iii) hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H) absorbers are the three most potential photoconductors for thin film solar cells because of their excellent efficiency. A realistic first principle analytical (preferably) model is essential for properly understanding the operating principles of a solar cell and optimizing its overall efficiency. Until now, few models were proposed in the literature but those models are either oversimplified or having too many fitting parameters. In this thesis we have proposed an analytical model to study the current-voltage characteristics of pin/nip structured cell especially CdS/CdTe thin film solar cells by incorporating <b>exponential</b> photon <b>absorption,</b> carrier trapping and carrier drift in the CdTe layer. An analytical expression for the external voltage dependent photocurrent is derived by solving the continuity equation for both electrons and holes. The overall load current is calculated considering the actual solar spectrum. The recombination current in the depletion region dominates over the ideal diode current in CdTe solar cells. The solar cell efficiency depends critically on the transport properties of the carriers that drift towards the back contact. The photon absorption capability over a wide spectrum and good carrier transport properties of the absorber layer are equally important for achieving higher efficiency.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of solar cell {{has been on}} the rise over the past few years. In order to be the substitute the fossil fuels, the energy production cost from solar cells must be reduced further. A lot of effort has been made by the scientific community to produce cheap and green energy from solar cells. High absorption coefficient and cost effective deposition technique have made polycrystalline CdTe a suitable applicant for thin-film solar cell technology. On the other hand, bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on blends of conjugated polymers (P 3 HT) and fullerene derivatives (PCBM) have shown great potential to produce efficient organic solar cells. Low availability of Te and need for enhancement of deposition speed influence to reduce the CdTe absorber layer. However, the overall cell efficiency of CdTe/CdS thin-film solar cell deteriorates unpredictably when the absorber width is reduced to sub-micron level. Deterioration of charge transport properties and their effects on voltage-dependent charge collection in submicron CdTe solar cells are believed to be responsible for this detrimental current-voltage. An analytical model for voltage-dependent photocurrent has been proposed in this thesis, considering partial depletion of the absorber and both electron and hole drift and diffusion in the depleted region and field free region, respectively, by solving continuity equations with proper boundary conditions. <b>Exponential</b> photon <b>absorption</b> and actual solar spectrum are considered to compute the photocurrent densities at entire output voltages.

Løvborg (1984) indicates that all elements with an atomic number less than 30 will have comparable mass attenuation coefficients. In the absence of water and soil, superficial and bedrock materials will have comparable attenuation coefficients at a given source concentration. Attenuation in dry materials is therefore controlled by density alone.

Additional attenuation effects are introduced when the material contains water (Løvborg 1984; Grasty 1997). The additional sensitivity of wet soil was investigated by Beamish (2013, 2014 a) who provides a set of exponential decay curves as a function of soil type (e.g. density) and degree of saturation.

The results indicate the presence of a low energy absorption tail, and <b>exponential</b> <b>absorption</b> that is proportional to degree of disorder in the film. The average defect density of the film as deposited was 1. 1 x 10 ^ 20 cm 2 ̆ 23. Annealing the film at 760 C increased the degree of disorder resulting in an average defect density of 3. 4 x 10 ^ 20 cm^- 3. Subsequent annealing at 800 C and 850 C systematically decreased the degree of disorder and the average defect density. The real part of permittivity (e 1) of the annealed films over this frequency range varies approximately +- 0. 5 from the e(infinity) of 4. 84...|$|E
40|$|Continuous (CW) and {{pulsed light}} {{were used for}} the noninvasive {{measurement}} of hemoglobin oxygenation in tissues. A dual wavelength method of continuous illumination spectroscopy used 760 nm (deoxyhemoglobin peak) and 800 nm (an oxyhemoglobin-deoxyhemoglobin isosbestic point) to measure the kinetics and extent of oxyhemoglobin deoxygenation in brains during mild ischemia/hypoxia. Absorption and scattering were modeled in an artificial milk/yeast blood system, which gave an <b>exponential</b> relationship between <b>absorption</b> and optical path length to a depth of 7 cm. Time-resolved spectroscopy (10 -ps resolution) afforded a display of the times and distances of arrival of photons emitted by the cat brain in response to a 10 -ps input pulse. The emitted photons rose to a peak in a fraction of a nanosecond and declined exponentially over a few nanoseconds. The half-time of exponential decay corresponds to photon migration over a distance of 4 cm. Exponential light emission continued for several more nanoseconds when the brain was encased by the skull, which {{plays a key role in}} prolonging light emission. The exponential decline of light intensity has a value [exp(-microL) ], where L is the path length determined from the time/distance scale and mu is the characteristic of the migration of light in the brain. The factor mu is increased by increasing absorption, and mu' = epsilon C where epsilon and C are the Beer-Lambert parameters of extinction coefficient (epsilon) and concentration (C). Thus, deoxyhemoglobin can be quantified in brain tissues...|$|R

The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. We present {{broadband}} {{observations and}} spectral modeling of PKS B 0008 - 421, and identify {{it as an}} extreme gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) source. PKS B 0008 - 421 {{is characterized by the}} steepest known spectral slope below the turnover, close to the theoretical limit of synchrotron self-absorption, and the smallest known spectral width of any GPS source. Spectral coverage of the source spans from 0. 118 to 22 GHz, which includes data from the Murchison Widefield Array and the wide bandpass receivers on the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We have implemented a Bayesian inference model fitting routine to fit the data with various absorption models. We find that without the inclusion of a high-frequency <b>exponential</b> break the <b>absorption</b> models can not accurately fit the data, with significant deviations above and below the peak in the radio spectrum. The addition of a high-frequency break provides acceptable spectral fits for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption and double-component synchrotron self-absorption models, with the inhomogeneous free-free absorption model statistically favored. The requirement of a high-frequency spectral break implies that the source has ceased injecting fresh particles. Additional support for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption model as being responsible for the turnover in the spectrum is given by the consistency between the physical parameters derived from the model fit and the implications of the exponential spectral break, such as the necessity of the source being surrounded by a dense ambient medium to maintain the peak frequency near the gigahertz region. The discovery of PKS B 0008 - 421 suggests that the next generation of low radio frequency surveys could reveal a large population of GPS sources that have ceased activity, and that a portion of the ultra-steep spectrum source population could be composed of these GPS sources in a relic phase...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{remote sensing}} {{is used to}} study {{parameters}} related to water colour. The colour data obtained this way {{can be converted to}} spatial and temporal distribution patterns of parameters related to water colour. The result of this conversion are quantitative images which can {{play an important role in}} calibration and validation of hydrodynamic and ecological models. Yellow substance is one of the important constituents in the water column influencing the water colour. It absorbs light increasingly with decreasing wavelength; in this way it interferes with remotely sensed data of chlorophyll a and suspended matter in the visible domain. Furthermore, yellow substance affects the ecology of water bodies and affects the penetration of UV-light in natural waters. The collection of dark coloured organic compounds of soil and sedimentary accumulations is called yellow substance. The main components are humic and fulvic acids. Most yellow substance in natural waters is of terrestrial origin, but in open oceans yellow substance may also be derived from decomposition products of marine organisms. The residence time of yellow substance in oceans is estimated at 150 - 900 years; it thus forms a semi-conservative property in the marine environment. In this research absorption spectroscopy was used to measure the spatial and temporal variation in the concentration of yellow substance in the southern North Sea in samples taken in 1993 and 1994. Spectra obtained in this way are exponential and can be described by two parameters, the absorption coefficient at a reference wavelength, normally 380 nm, and the slope of the <b>exponential.</b> The <b>absorption</b> coefficients decreased from on-shore to off-shore stations. The highest coefficients for the absorption by yellow substance were found at the Texel transect, high coefficients were also found at the on-shore stations of the Noordwijk and Walcheren transects and at the Marsdiep station. In the Channel the lowest coefficients were measured, at many off-shore stations low coefficients were also obtained. The output of rivers was clearly •the main source of yellow substance in the North Sea. Especially at the on-shore stations this influence was very large, but other factors such as origin of water masses may play a role too. The content of yellow substance from the several rivers discharging into the North Sea depends on the characteristics of the catchment area, such as forests, agricultural land and cities, of these rivers. Yellow substance concentration and salinity had a strong negative correlation. Chlorophyll a and suspended matter, however, did not show any correlation with yellow substance. Although degradation of phytoplankton results in yellow substance, the yellow substance component of the water due to degradation of marine organisms is very small relative to the riverine input. The values for the slope, calculated for the whole absorption spectrum of yellow substance, were higher than values. This is due to the tendency of the spectra to increase at lower wavelengths. A bump at 275 nm, which is thought to be the result of absorption by dissolved DNA, is another reason for the increase of the slope. If the slope is calculated for segments (360 - 440 nm and 440 - 540 nm) of the spectrum, measured values were in the same range as the values in previous research. ...|$|R
