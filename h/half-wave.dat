This consisted of a folded dipole with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two <b>half-wave</b> unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front. These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from {{the leading edge of the}} wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.|$|E

40|$|Slow {{oscillations}} (< 1 Hz) in the non-rapid {{eye movement}} (NREM) sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) result from slow membrane potential fluctuations of cortical neurones, alternating between a depolarized up-state and a hyperpolarized down-state. They {{are thought to}} underlie the restorative function of sleep. We investigated the behaviour of slow oscillations in humans under increased sleep pressure to assess their contribution to sleep homeostasis. EEG recordings (C 3 A 2) of baseline and recovery sleep after sleep deprivation (eight healthy males, mean age 23 years; 40 h of prolonged wakefulness) were analysed. <b>Half-waves</b> were defined as positive or negative deflections between consecutive zero crossings in the 0. 5 - 2 Hz range of the band-pass filtered EEG. Increased sleep pressure resulted in a redistribution of <b>half-waves</b> between 0. 5 and 2 Hz: the number of <b>half-waves</b> per minute was reduced below 0. 9 Hz while it was increased above 1. 2 Hz. EEG power was increased above 1 Hz. The increase in frequency was accompanied by increased slope of the <b>half-waves</b> and decreased number of multi-peak waves. In both baseline and recovery sleep, amplitude and slope were correlated highly over a broad frequency range and positive <b>half-waves</b> were characterized by a lower frequency than the negative ones, pointing to a longer duration of up- than down-states. We hypothesize that the higher frequency of slow oscillatory activity after prolonged wakefulness may relate to faster alternations between up- and down-states at the cellular level under increased sleep pressure. This study does not question slow-wave activity as a marker of sleep homeostasis, as the observed changes occurred within the same frequency range...|$|R

25|$|In <b>half-wave</b> {{rectification}} of a single-phase supply, {{also called}} uncontrolled one-pulse midpoint circuit, either the {{positive or negative}} half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Mathematically, it is a ramp function (for positive pass, negative block): passing positive corresponds to the ramp function being the identity on positive inputs, blocking negative corresponds to being zero on negative inputs. Because only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, mean voltage is lower. <b>Half-wave</b> rectification requires a single diode in a single-phase supply, or three in a three-phase supply. Rectifiers yield a unidirectional but pulsating direct current; <b>half-wave</b> rectifiers produce far more ripple than full-wave rectifiers, and much more filtering is needed to eliminate harmonics of the AC frequency from the output.|$|E
25|$|Dipoles whose {{length is}} {{approximately}} half the wavelength {{of the signal}} are called <b>half-wave</b> dipoles and are widely used as such or {{as the basis for}} derivative antenna designs. These have a radiation resistance which is much greater, closer to the characteristic impedances of available transmission lines, and normally much larger than the resistance of the conductors, so that their efficiency approaches 100%.

However, when the terrain is considerably uneven (n[*]>[*] 4), an increasing number has a positive impact on the cost due to the possibility of installing the towers in the elevated areas. This leads to reducing the tower height and reducing their total cost despite the large number.|$|R

Moro kalis blades generally range in size from 18 to 26 inches (46 to 66 cm), though as with all Moro weapons there are exceptions. Generally however, the larger blades are found on later pieces, while the oldest Moro kalis tend to be of smaller stature.

25|$|Neglecting {{electrical}} inefficiency, {{the antenna}} gain {{is equal to}} the directive gain, which is 1.5 (1.76 dBi) for a short dipole, increasing to 1.64 (2.15 dBi) for a <b>half-wave</b> dipole. For a 5/4 wave dipole the gain further increases to about 5.2 dBi, making this length desirable for that reason even though the antenna is then off-resonance. Longer dipoles than that have radiation patterns that are multi-lobed, with poorer gain (unless they are much longer) even along the strongest lobe. Other enhancements to the dipole (such as including a corner reflector or an array of dipoles) can be considered when more substantial directivity is desired. Such antenna designs, although based on the <b>half-wave</b> dipole, generally acquire their own names.|$|E

After the extraction of a large set of candidate spikes based on a crude shape model consisting of two <b>half-waves,</b> more detailed modeling of the spike waveform is performed in order to discover the non-linear structure of the data and map it to a lower dimensional space. Dimensionality reduction is performed by locality preserving projections. The main advantage of LPP is its linearity and more importantly that it is defined everywhere in ambient space rather than just on the training data points. Thus, LPP may be simply applied to any new data point to locate it in the reduced representation space. Also, LPP is derived by preserving local information; hence, it is less sensitive to outliers than PCA.|$|R

(x 1) has {{extremes}} as {{a function}} of the radial coordinate, there can exist a transverse resonator (or azimuthal waveguide), that is a transparent region bounded on both sides by cut-off surfaces. In this case the wave is channeled along the azimuth and trapped between the cut-off shells, being a standing wave in the direction transverse to the magnetic shells (Vetoulis and Chen, 1994; Leonovich and Mazur, 1995; Denton and Vetoulis, 1998; Klimushkin, 1998). As is evident from Fig. 2, one such region is located in the vicinity of the plasmapause and the other can be located in the vicinity of the ring current. The eigenfrequency of the resonator is determined from the condition that the number of <b>half-waves</b> between the cutoff surfaces should be an integer.

Moreover, we show how a picture of Aharonov-Bohm interference of two <b>half-waves</b> acquiring Dirac's magnetic phase when passing {{on either side of the}} solenoid emerges from the quantum propagator, and that the typical scale of the resulting interference pattern is fully determined by the ratio of the angular part of Hamilton's principal function to Planck's constant.

40|$|Learning {{is assumed}} to induce {{specific}} changes in neuronal activity during sleep that serve the consolidation of newly acquired memories. To specify such changes, we measured electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence during performance on a declarative learning task (word pair associations) and subsequent sleep. Compared with a nonlearning control condition, learning performance was accompanied with a strong increase in coherence in several EEG frequency bands. During subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep, coherence only marginally increased in a global analysis of EEG recordings. However, a striking and robust increase in learning-dependent coherence was found when analyses were performed time-locked to the occurrence of slow oscillations (< 1 Hz). Specifically, the surface-positive <b>half-waves</b> of the slow oscillation resulting from widespread cortical depolarization were associated with distinctly enhanced coherence after learning in the slow-oscillatory, delta, slow-spindle, and gamma bands.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for the stability analysis of doubly curved orthotropic shells with simply supported boundary condition and under impact load {{from the viewpoint}} of nonlinear dynamics is studied. The nonlinear governing differential equations are derived based on a Donnell-type shallow shell theory, and the displacement is projected onto the space spanned by the eigenfunction of the linear operator of the motion equation. To analyze the influence of each single mode pair on the response to impact loading, only one term composed of two <b>half-waves</b> is used in developing the governing equation, whereas the first mode pair, which is close to the membrane state, is used in the numerical examples. For the first case analyzed, it turns out that two centers and one saddle will occur if damping is ignored, whereas the two centers become two focuses and the saddle point remains if damping is considered.

40|$|For a non-circular {{cylinder}} {{the radius}} of curvature changes around the circumference. Therefore for constant stiffness non-circular cylinders, some specific locations in the circumference {{are more prone to}} buckle. The same problem exists for circular cylinders with non-uniform loading in the cross-section like a cylinder under bending. This explanation brings to the mind the idea of tailoring the material such that the material potential is used more efficiently and if possible all parts of the cylinder contribute in the buckling phenomenon. Since the changes in the {{radius of curvature}} and/or loading happens in the circumferential direction, tailoring the material properties in the circumferential direction is a logical pattern. By assigning a certain number of <b>half-waves</b> in the longitudinal direction, the buckling eigen-value problem is solved to find the buckling load and circumferential mode shapes. The inverse of buckling load is approximated using a homogeneous, conservative formulation to increase the computational efficiency during optimisation. This is a hybrid approximation expanded in terms of stiffness linearly and reciprocally. Multi-modal optimisation problem is formulated to minimise inverse of critical buckling factor.
