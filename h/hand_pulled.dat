2500|$|The San Rafael Fire Department {{was first}} {{organized}} on December 5, 1874 when William Miller and J.B. Rice posted a {{notice in the}} Marin County Journal, calling for volunteer firemen. [...] The organisation was first named the [...] "San Rafael Hose Company Number One" [...] but was then renamed the [...] "San Rafael Hose, Hook and Ladder Company" [...] to show the range of their equipment. [...] There were 45 volunteers {{from a variety of}} trades including a justice of the peace and a school superintendent and were led by sheriff James Tunstede. [...] Their first major appliance was a hose cart which was pulled by hand to a hydrant. [...] The water supply of San Rafael used gravity to provide pressure and so a pump was not required. [...] By the 1890s, the Company had 90 volunteer members, two <b>hand</b> <b>pulled</b> hose carts, two hose carriages and one hook and ladder wagon that was pulled by a rented team of horses when needed.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Cornwallis {{brought on}} the Battle of the Assunpink Creek when he {{launched}} a major push with 8,000 troops and 28 guns. The alcoholic Fermoy abandoned his troops, leaving the capable Hand in charge. There was a clash at Little Shabbakunk Creek, where Cornwallis was forced to unlimber his artillery. As soon as British pressure became too great, <b>Hand</b> <b>pulled</b> back his men to a second blocking position. Later, they fell back to a third position at Stockton Hollow, outside Trenton. As dusk fell, superior British numbers forced Hand's troops into a hurried retreat through the town. During the withdrawal, the British captured Haussegger {{and some of his}} men near the lower fords of Assunpink Creek. Mark M. Boatner III wrote that the unit [...] "disgraced itself". That evening, columns of British and Hessians tried to storm the bridge and the lower fords, but were stopped with heavy losses. Washington posted German Battalion at the bridge in the second line, behind Scott's troops. The next day, 3 January, the battalion was present at the Battle of Princeton.|$|E
60|$|And in {{the spacious}} {{solitude}} {{of the museum}} gallery devoted to the Raphael cartoons sat Lewisham, plunged in gloomy meditation.

6000|$|... 'No, it's mine,' cried Val, as his <b>hand</b> <b>pulled</b> her out, and {{the others}} extricated themselves, still laughing, go that they could hardly stand, and Fly declaring, 'Oh, daddy, daddy, it is such fun! I am so glad we came,' and taking a {{gratuitous}} leap into the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "On the {{staircase}} he stopped suddenly, so that I very nearly blundered into him. He stood looking back right {{into my face}} and listening. 'I could have sworn,' he said. His long hairy <b>hand</b> <b>pulled</b> at his lower lip. His eye {{went up and down}} {{the staircase}}. Then he grunted and went on up again.|$|E
60|$|The Doctor {{bent his}} head again over his accounts. The tramp, sitting in the doorway, reached out his <b>hand,</b> <b>pulled</b> a young wheat-stalk that had sprung up near the doorstep, and slowly nibbled it. He did not raise {{his eyes to the}} Doctor, but sat, a {{familiar}} culprit awaiting sentence, without fear, without hope, yet not without a certain philosophical endurance of the situation.|$|E

60|$|But {{the man who}} {{was still}} half in and half out of the coach, and who had hold of Mademoiselle's wrist did not obey his mates immediately. He drew her nearer to him and {{suddenly}} threw his rough, begrimed arms round her, and with one <b>hand</b> <b>pulled</b> back her hood, then placing two fingers under her chin, he jerked it up till her face was level with his own.|$|E
60|$|He {{was in this}} {{condition}} on the night in which his victim {{made up his mind}} to rob him. Despair and brandy had united to render Brixton utterly reckless; so much so, that instead of creeping stealthily towards his enemy's tent, an act which would probably have aroused the suspicion of a light sleeper, he walked boldly up, entered it, raised Gashford's unconscious head with one <b>hand,</b> <b>pulled</b> out the bag of gold with the other, put it on his shoulder, and coolly marched out of the camp. The audacity of the deed contributed largely to its success.|$|E
60|$|An hour passed, and {{a shadow}} came along our line, darting from cover to cover. It was Lieutenant Bayley, {{and he sent}} me back to find the Colonel and {{to tell him that}} the men had but a few rounds left. I sped through the streets on the errand, spied a Creole company waiting in reserve, and near them, behind a warehouse, a knot of backwoodsmen, French, and Indians, lighted up by a smoking torch. And here was Colonel Clark talking to a big, {{blanketed}} chief. I was hovering around the skirts of the crowd and seeking for an opening, when a <b>hand</b> <b>pulled</b> me off my feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "When she moves," [...] he muttered, [...] "her <b>hands</b> <b>pull</b> the string. Her hands send {{a message}} up: up {{and up to the}} bell." [...] He paused, and pointed to the cell-door.|$|R
50|$|The Derby Brewing Company {{joined forces}} with Everardsin 2011 in a £400,000 project to restore the Queen's Head. The deal saw the two breweries share the cost of buying and {{revamping}} the grade II-listed alehouse which dates back to 1835. The pub features 10 <b>hand</b> <b>pulls</b> featuring Derby Brewing Company beers, hand selected guest ales and a <b>hand</b> <b>pull</b> cider plus beers, wines and spirits from around the world. As part of the restoration, the pub returned to its original layout, with a central entrance leading directly into anewly-positioned bar area. The pub re-opened on 17 November 2011.|$|R
60|$|That very afternoon, as {{the reader}} may remember, Kenyon felt Hilda's <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> at the silken cord that was {{connected}} with his heart-strings, {{as he stood}} looking towards Rome from the battlements of Monte Beni.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall see." [...] He {{pushed past}} the servant and {{rushed into the}} drawing-room, {{followed}} by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his <b>hand,</b> <b>pulled</b> out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to [...] "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." [...] My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way: ...|$|E
6000|$|They separated, and {{the latter}} soon found himself among the boulders, where he {{continued}} to search--actively at first, but more lazily as time passed by. Presently {{he came to a}} wild spot where the stream was overhung by bushes. He turned over a small stone. Beneath it was a hole or [...] "pocket". He stooped quickly, and pulled out a nugget of gold {{about the size of a}} thimble. He stooped again, and, inserting his <b>hand,</b> <b>pulled</b> at something that would not come. His heart gave a jump and appeared to get into his throat, where it apparently remained, while the blood rushed to his forehead. Another pull, and out came a mass of solid gold, about the size of his own fist! A cheer rose to his lips, but he checked it. [...] "P'r'aps there's more!" [...] he said. Yes, the greedy little wretch said that! But there was no more in that pocket.|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{areas in}} the upper Midwest have been invaded by spotted knapweed, and {{effective}} management strategies are required to reestablish native plant communities. We examined effects of mowing, mowing plus clopyralid, or mowing plus glyphosate in factorial combination with <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> and burning on knapweed abundances on a knapweed-infested site in western Michigan. We applied mowing and herbicide treatments in summer 2008, and seeded all plots with native grasses and forbs in spring 2009. We conducted the knapweed pulling treatment from 2009 to 2012 in July. The prescribed burn was conducted in April 2012. By 2012, <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> reduced adult knapweed densities to 0. 57 [*]±[*] 0. 12 m− 2 (0. 053 [*]±[*] 0. 011 ft− 2) (mean[*]±[*]SE), which was 5. 8 % of nonpulled treatments, juvenile densities to 0. 29 [*]±[*] 0. 07 m− 2 (2. 1 % of nonpulled treatments), and seedling densities to 0. 07 [*]±[*] 0. 06 m− 2 (2. 6 % of nonpulled treatments). After 3 yr, <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> reduced seed bank densities to 68 [*]±[*] 26 m− 2 as compared to 524 [*]±[*] 254 m− 2 in nonpulled treatments and 369 [*]±[*] 66 m− 2 in adjacent untreated areas of the study site. Without <b>hand</b> <b>pulling,</b> effects of mowing or mowing plus glyphosate were short-lived and allowed knapweed to rapidly resurge. In comparison, although a single mowing plus clopyralid treatment maintained significantly reduced densities of knapweed for 4 yr, by 2012 knapweed biomass in the nonpulled clopyralid treatment was approximately 60 % {{of that in the}} other nonpulled treatments. Burning had minimal impacts on knapweed densities regardless of treatment combination, probably as a result of low fire intensity. Results demonstrated that persistent <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> used as a follow-up to single mowing or mowing plus herbicide treatments can be an effective practice for treating isolated spotted knapweed infestations or for removing small numbers of knapweed that survive herbicide applications...|$|R

60|$|But look! here is poor Carlo's organ; {{and while}} the silent crowd {{surrounds}} him, there he stands, looking mildly but inquiringly about him; his right <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> and twitching the ivory knobs {{at one end of}} his instrument.|$|R
60|$|Linda {{stood for}} a moment at the door, and then putting up her <b>hand,</b> <b>pulled</b> down the heavy iron bell-handle, which itself was a gem of art, {{representing}} some ancient and discreet burgher of the town, wrapped in his cloak, and almost hidden by his broad-brimmed hat. She heard the bell clank close inside the door, and then the portal was open, as though the very pulling of the bell had opened it. The lock at least was open, so that Linda could push the door with her hand and enter over the threshold. This she did, and she found herself within a long narrow court or yard, round which, one above another, there ran galleries, open to the court, and guarded with heavy balustrades of carved wood. From the narrowness of the enclosure, the house on each side seemed to be very high, and Linda, looking round with astonished eyes, could see that at every point the wood was carved. And the waterspouts were ornamented with grotesque figures, and the huge broad stairs which led to the open galleries on the left hand were of polished oak, made so slippery with the polishers' daily care that it was difficult to tread upon them without falling. All around the bottom of the court there were open granaries or warehouses; for there seemed to be nothing that could be called a room on the ground floor, beyond the porter's lodge; and these open warehouses seemed to be filled full with masses of stacked firewood. Linda knew well the value of such stores in Nuremberg, and lost none of her veneration for Herr Molk because of such nature were the signs of his domestic wealth.|$|E
60|$|We {{travelled}} a month more {{through the}} Emperor of China's dominions; and at length coming {{to one of}} their towns about a day and a half's journey from the city of Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. The person I spoke to would have brought me one, but, like a fool, I must go along with him, about two miles from the village. My old pilot and I walked on foot, forsooth, for some variety, when coming to the place where the camels were kept as in a park guarded by Chinese soldiers, we there agreed and bought one, which the Chinese man that came along with me led along the road. But we had not gone far, before we were attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horseback, two of whom seized the man, took the camel from him, and rode away, while the other three approached us, the first of whom suddenly seized me as I was drawing my sword, the second; knocked me down, but my old trusty Portuguese taking a pistol out of his pocket, which I knew nothing of, and coming up to the fellow that struck me, he with one <b>hand</b> <b>pulled</b> him off his horse, and then shot him dead upon the spot; then taking his scymitar, he struck at the man that stopped us, but missing him, cut off one of his horses ears, the pain of which made him throw his rider to the ground. The poor Chinese who had led the camel, seeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and seizing upon his pole-ax, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked his brains out. But there was another Tartar to deal with, who seeming neither inclined to fight nor fly, and my old man having begun to charge his pistol, the very sight of it struck such a terror into the wretch, that away he scoured, leaving my old pilot, rather my champion and defender, an absolute victory.|$|E

50|$|Pigmentograph is a {{printing}} technology {{developed by the}} artist as a trace-print technique in the 1970s, and designated as Pigmentograph in 1980. The image is drawn or painted on a carrier template or film. Subsequently, the printing forms, the color separations of the motive, are cut and stung in the positive negative procedure. During the printing-process color is brushed by hand through the printing forms and fixed afterwards. There is practically no limitation of the size, {{the number of the}} colors, or <b>hand</b> <b>pulled</b> prints. In comparison to industrial screen printing, a Pigmentograph cannot be automated.
