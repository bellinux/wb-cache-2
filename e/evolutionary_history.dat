In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred <b>evolutionary</b> <b>history,</b> as shown below where the species is divided into six groups.

5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While {{it is difficult to}} determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in <b>evolutionary</b> <b>history,</b> this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E
5|$|Good {{evidence}} exists for {{the appearance of}} gastropods (e.g. Aldanella), cephalopods (e.g. Plectronoceras, ?Nectocaris) and bivalves (Pojetaia, Fordilla) towards {{the middle of the}} Cambrian period, c. , though arguably each of these may belong only to the stem lineage of their respective classes.

40|$|International audienceEvolutionary systems biology aims {{to uncover}} the general trends and {{principles}} governing the evolution of biological networks. An essential {{part of this process}} is the reconstruction and analysis of the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>histories</b> of these complex, dynamic networks. Unfortunately, the methodologies for representing and exploiting such complex <b>evolutionary</b> <b>histories</b> in large scale studies are currently limited. Here, we propose a new formalism, called EvoluCode (Evolutionary barCode), which allows the integration of different evolutionary parameters (eg, sequence conservation, orthology, synteny …) in a unifying format and facilitates the multilevel analysis and visualization of complex <b>evolutionary</b> <b>histories</b> at the genome scale. The advantages of the approach are demonstrated by constructing barcodes representing the evolution of the complete human proteome. Two large-scale studies are then described: (i) the mapping and visualization of the barcodes on the human chromosomes and (ii) automatic clustering of the barcodes to highlight protein subsets sharing similar <b>evolutionary</b> <b>histories</b> and their functional analysis. The methodologies developed here open the way to the efficient application of other data mining and knowledge extraction techniques in evolutionary systems biology studies. A database containing all EvoluCode data is available at: [URL]...|$|R

5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in <b>evolutionary</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, a tree-like topological {{structure}} of relationships among species is assumed in traditional phylogenetic analyses, but recombination, hybridization, gene conversion, and gene transfer can all lead to <b>evolutionary</b> <b>histories</b> {{that are not}} adequately modelled by a single tree (Bryant & Moulton, 2004). It is quite likely that binary trees constructed in common analyses failed to reflect the complexity of true <b>evolutionary</b> <b>histories</b> of organisms (Morrison, 2011). Phylogenetic networks can break the restrictive supposition that the topological structure must be tree-like {{and can be used}} to visualize genealogical relationships among organisms (Huson et al., 2010). In addition, another advantage of phylogenetic network is to highlight conflicts for different taxa (Hall, 2011).|$|R
5|$|The {{existence}} {{of resistance to}} batrachotoxins {{and the use of}} those toxins as chemical defences by several bird families have led to competing theories as to its <b>evolutionary</b> <b>history.</b> Jønsson (2008) suggested that it was an ancestral adaptation in Corvoidea songbirds, and that further studies would reveal more toxic birds.

5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body.

5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's <b>evolutionary</b> <b>history</b> was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>history</b> of organisms, their phylogeny.

40|$|One of {{the central}} {{problems}} in computational biology is the reconstruction of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>histories.</b> While models incorporating recombination and homoplasy have been studied separately, a missing component in the theory is a robust and flexible unifying model which incorporates both of these major biological events shaping genetic diversity. In this article, we introduce the first such unifying model and develop algorithms to find the optimal ancestral recombination graph incorporating recombinations and homoplasy events. The power of our framework is the connection between our formulation and the Directed Steiner Arborescence Problem in combinatorial optimization. We implement linear programming techniques as well as heuristics for the Directed Steiner Arborescence Problem, and use our methods to construct <b>evolutionary</b> <b>histories</b> for both simulated and real data sets...|$|R

5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish).
