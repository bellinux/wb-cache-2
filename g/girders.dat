In their struggle, the truck {{goes out of}} control and lands in a {{construction}} site. When Spider-Man tries to web him up, it proves to be ineffective as Sandman can slip through them; the villain then starts to attack Spider-Man with <b>girders.</b> Meanwhile, at the soda shop, Harry tries to impress the jocks, catching Kenny's girlfriend Glory's attention. Kenny plays a prank on Harry, which enrages Glory and she asks Harry to take her home. Back on the construction site, Spider-Man gets out from the pile of <b>girders</b> and gets the head on Sandman. He lures him up to the roof and encasing him in cement from the nearby cement maker.|$|E

When load is applied in top-down direction trying to bend <b>girder</b> force is acting on upper rod of any <b>girder</b> as compression stress, and on lower part as tension. This stress tends to decrease <b>girder</b> width making it less rigid (<b>Girder</b> of zero width has zero flexural strength). In {{order to prevent}} this upper and lower rod {{has to be kept}} apart. In classical framework <b>girder</b> this is ensured by triangular framework. In tensairity <b>girder</b> gas pressure in air bag is used instead. Lower rod loaded in pure tension can be replaced by rope or the airbag membrane itself. This leads to much better strength-to-weight ratio ...|$|R
5|$|In 1873, in {{an effort}} to improve {{navigation}} around the bridge and reduce accidents, two of the piers were removed, making the widest span a more easily navigated , and the bridge deck was strengthened with iron <b>girders</b> to compensate for the missing piers.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipping}} and receiving ramp, which served the entire World Trade Center complex, occupied the eastern {{quarter of the}} 7World Trade Center footprint. The building was open below the 3rd floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp. The spray-on fireproofing for structural steel elements was gypsum-based Monokote, which had a two-hour fire rating for steel beams, <b>girders</b> and trusses, and a three-hour rating for columns.|$|E
5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and <b>girders</b> for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and <b>girders</b> per week.|$|E

Taking Sutong Bridge as an example, numerically identifies the three component coefficients of <b>girder</b> with different angles of attack, comparing to the <b>girder</b> with guide plates and the <b>girder</b> with central slot, it is found that the guide plates has little influence to the three component coefficients of <b>girder</b> and the central slot can obviously increase the wind resistance capacity of <b>girder,</b> provides the wind-resistant basis for <b>girder</b> of large-span bridge design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} {{behavior of}} incrementally launched bridges {{in the construction}} stages depends on different parameters.

Parametric analysis on the effect of internal force of an 8 × 60 m-span concrete continuous box <b>girder</b> bridge was carried out. The results show that bending moment increases following the increase of weight and stiffness of corresponding segment of main <b>girder.</b> The phenomenon is even more obvious in the negative bending moment region of main <b>girder</b> segment nearby the launching nose. The bending moment of main <b>girder</b> reduces significantly when the stiffness ratio among launching nose and main <b>girder</b> is less than 0. 15. While, the negative bending moment of main <b>girder</b> reduces significantly when the length ratio among launching nose and main span is more than 0. 58...|$|R

5|$|After {{duplication}} in 1890, {{the original}} lattice-girder Como Bridge across the Georges River was laid as gauntlet track. This arrangement remained {{in place for}} many decades, causing a notorious bottleneck on the line, until the New South Wales Government commissioned John Holland & Co {{to build a new}} bridge in 1969. Construction of the new bridge, made of prestressed concrete box <b>girders,</b> commenced in 1969 and was first used by the 18:17 service from Como on 19 November 1972. The old bridge, as well as a former alignment of the line between Mortdale and Oatley replaced in 1905, is now used as a rail trail for pedestrians and cyclists.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side of the}} <b>girders</b> along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower {{for the work of}} the department came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel <b>girders</b> had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} {{the theory and}} calculation of a crane rail combined with the upper zone of a crane runway <b>girder</b> under a local torque.
