25|$|Shyness (also called diffidence) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of apprehension, lack of comfort, or awkwardness {{especially}} {{when a person}} is around other people. This commonly occurs in new situations or with unfamiliar people. Shyness can be a characteristic of people who have low self-esteem. Stronger forms of shyness are usually referred to as social anxiety or social phobia.|$|E
25|$|TOT {{states should}} be {{separated}} from FOK (feeling of knowing) states. FOK, in contrast, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that one {{will be able to}} recognize - from a list of items - an item that is currently inaccessible. There are still currently opposing articles of the separability of the process underlying these concepts. However, {{there is some evidence that}} TOTs and FOKs draw on different parts of the brain. TOTs are associated with the anterior cingulate, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right inferior cortex while FOKs are not.|$|E
25|$|Actors form {{schools or}} are {{associated}} with a particular theatre. Every actor has a stage name, which is different from the name they were born with. These stagenames, most often those of the actor's father, grandfather, or teacher, are passed down between generations of actors' lineages, and hold great honor and importance. Many names {{are associated with}} certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations; there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor to previously hold that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career.|$|E

25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the strike, Pittston was a strong coal company and the area was full of strikers protesting. [...] Since the strike, many of Pittston's coal plants have been sold to Alpha Natural Resources, which is now in the nation’s top three coal companies, in order to pay for the health care for the miners. After the strike ended, Moss 3 was {{demolished}} and a new plant was built and named after it, and the recreational park that became Camp Solidarity has been reclaimed by nature and is now an open field. Though the physical aspects of the area have changed since the strike has ended, what has not changed <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that the miners of Pittston accomplished – a win for their own benefits as well as benefits for the UMWA. The union’s actions during the strike made it possible for thousands of miners to receive health care and retirement funds for years to come.|$|E
500|$|Hajime Isayama {{created a}} 65-page {{one-shot}} version of Attack on Titan in 2006. Originally, he also offered {{his work to}} the Weekly Shōnen Jump department at Shueisha, where he was advised to modify his style and story to be more suitable for Jump. He declined and instead decided {{to take it to}} the Weekly Shōnen Magazine department at Kodansha. Before serialization began in 2009, he had already thought of ideas for twists, although they are fleshed out as the series progresses. The author initially based the scenery in the manga on that of his hometown, which is surrounded by mountains. While working at an internet cafe, Isayama encountered a customer who grabbed him by the collar. It was this incident that showed him [...] "the fear of meeting a person I can't communicate with," [...] which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that he conveys through the Titans. When designing the appearances of the Titans, he uses several models such as martial artist Yushin Okami for Eren Yeager's Titan form as well as Brock Lesnar for the Armored Titan. George Wada, the anime's producer, stated that the [...] "Wall of Fear" [...] was influenced by the isolated and enclosed nature of Japanese culture. He also said that the inner feelings of every individual is one of the series' main influences. Isayama later would confirm that Attack on Titan was inspired in part by Muv-Luv Alternative, the second visual novel in the Muv-Luv visual novel series.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{emotions}} are present after {{the act of}} infidelity.  Emotions are complex components. A lasting effect of the transgression. Jealousy is a common emotion after infidelity. The definition of jealousy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> or showing suspicion of someone’s unfaithfulness in a relationship or losing something or someone’s attention. Individual differences were predictors of jealousy, which differed for men and women. Predictors for men were sex drive, attachment avoidance and previous acts of infidelity. Predictors for women were sex drive and relationship status. Attachment and sexual motivations likely influence the evolved jealousy mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{military}} representatives {{have said}} that religious accommodation requests to waive the prohibition for beards could be considered on a case-by-case basis, but only from those already in the military. However, critics have noted that such a policy would require an applicant to be a hypocrite: requesting a shaving waiver {{based on the fact}} that he cannot shave, but first shaving in order to enlist and qualify to submit a request. According to some commentators, the real reason beards have been prohibited <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that they [...] "are unseemly and make service members appear sloppy." [...] Army Regulation 670-1 states that [...] "personal appearance"—including [...] "strict grooming standards"—is an [...] "essential part of discipline" [...] and [...] "a neat and well-groomed appearance by all soldiers is fundamental to the Army and contributes to building the pride and esprit essential to an effective military force." ...|$|E
2500|$|SputnikMusic {{rated the}} album 4 out of 5, commenting, “Ulver {{have taken a}} decidedly more subtle {{approach}} to songwriting and the mood they’re attempting to create, but what a mood it <b>is.</b> <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> that you get while listening to this album could best be summed up by the word “serenity”.

Whereas on Blood Inside and Perdition City the albums commanded your attention due to their frequent shift from soft to loud sections and their regular use of discordant sounds, Shadows of the Sun will easily fade away from your attention if you don’t give it the awareness it deserves.” ...|$|E
