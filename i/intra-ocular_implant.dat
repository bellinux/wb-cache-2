50|$|In November 2011, The International <b>Intra-Ocular</b> <b>Implant</b> Club (IIIC) became {{incorporated}} as a Private Limited Company under English law.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Intra-Ocular</b> <b>Implant</b> Club {{was founded}} in 1966 by the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeons Sir Harold Ridley and Peter Choyce, to promote {{research in the field}} of intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.

The founders saw the club as a forum to allow free and unhindered exchange of ideas about IOLs and implantation surgical techniques. From the outset it was international in its membership and it set itself a parental and advisory role for the then nascent national societies to develop in each country for intraocular implant surgeons.

40|$|Abstract. With 30 million {{interventions}} a year worldwide, cataract {{surgery is}} one of the most frequently performed procedures. Yet, no tool currently allows teaching all steps of the procedure without putting pa-tients at risk. A particularly challenging stage of this surgery deals with the injection and deployment of the <b>intra-ocular</b> lens <b>implant.</b> In this paper we propose to rely on shell theory to accurately describe the com-plex deformations of the implant. Our approach extends the co-rotational method used in finite element analysis of in-plane deformations to incor-porate a bending energy. This results in a relatively simple and compu-tationally efficient approach which was applied to the simulation of the lens deployment. This simulation also accounts for the complex contacts that take place during the injection phase. ...|$|R

We measured sleep quality, quality of life, and gait speed {{before and after}} cataract surgery to evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} procedure on systemic health. The study was conducted on more than 200 cataract patients undergoing <b>intra-ocular</b> lens <b>implant</b> surgery. Patients were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (VFQ- 25; vision-related quality of life) before and then 2 and 7 months after surgery. Four-meter gait speed was also determined. Significant improvements were noted in PSQI, VFQ- 25, and gait speed. Our results indicated cataract surgery was effective on systemic health indices in addition to visual restoration. We published our results in three international journals and number of Japanese journals and meetings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{present report}} {{concerns}} what is, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, the first case of post-traumatic cilia that has remained inert for approximately 50 years after its inoculation into the eye. Case presentation A 69 -year-old Caucasian woman whose right eye had been struck by a dining fork approximately 50 years earlier was examined on presentation two years ago. In her right eye, both uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuities were 0. 1 (in decimal notation). Along with a nuclear cataract, a straight linear extension was found extending beneath the iris at the nine o'clock position reaching the center of the pupil, which appeared to be a cilium measuring 7 mm. After the removal of the cilia, an uncomplicated phacoemulsification was performed and a posterior chamber <b>intra-ocular</b> lens was <b>implanted.</b> Her post-operative course was uneventful, and visual acuity remained 1. 0 for the 22 -month follow-up period. Conclusions Intra-ocular cilia can be tolerated for as long as 50 years without causing any ocular reaction. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of research {{presented in this}} thesis is to elucidate the effect of polymer composition and structure on the photo-Fries rearrangement in polymers bearing aryl ester moieties. Towards this end, a systematic study wherein constraint, proximity, and dielectric constant were varied was carried out. This study was enabled by the synthesis of poly(phenylacrylate), poly(p-acetoxystyrene) and copolymers of phenylacrylate or p-acetoxystyrene with ethylacrylate, butylacrylate and 2 - hydroxyethylmethacrylate. In addition, siloxane polymers with pendant aryl ester groups were also synthesized. Varying constraint by tethering aryl esters to the polymer backbone at the ester group, tethering aryl esters to the polymer backbone through the aryl group and varying the Tg of polymers {{had no effect on}} the rate of the photo-Fries rearrangement. The hydration state of hydrophilic copolymers had no effect on conversion but did increase formation of cage escape products and changed the ratio of products formed. Decreasing the proximity of aryl ester units relative to one another lead to increased ultimate conversion in the rearrangement. Altering from a carbon to siloxane polymer backbone may have had an effect on the initial rate of rearrangement but the effect could not be isolated from other variables (proximity and Tg). Refractive index changes (n) which occurred as the polymers underwent rearrangement were also evaluated. Refractive index changes between 0. 01 and 0. 07 were observed, with the n being controlled in a dose dependent manner. Findings discussed here may be significant in the development of holographic imaging systems, optical data storage devices, waveguides and <b>intra-ocular</b> lens <b>implants</b> where materials capable of significant refractive index modulation are desirable...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{compared}} post-operative {{quality of}} life and sleep according to the type of cataract opacity and color of the <b>implanted</b> <b>intra-ocular</b> lens (IOL). Methods: This is a cohort study and participants were 206 patients (average age 74. 1 years) undergoing cataract surgery with the implantation of a clear ultra-violet (UV) -blocking IOL (C) or a yellow blue-light-blocking IOL (Y). Participants were evaluated using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ- 25) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) before surgery and 2 and 7 months after surgery. Changes in sub-scale scores of VFQ- 25 and PSQI were compared. Results: Sub-scale analyses for improvement after surgery revealed significant differences in ocular pain scores on the VFQ- 25 (Y>C; the higher the score, the better the outcome). Furthermore, there were {{significant differences between the two}} IOLs in terms of the sleep latency score (C>Y) and sleep disturbances score (C>Y). A posterior sub-capsular cataract was significantly correlated with improvements in ocular pain and sleep latency scores. These effects were successfully represented by the change in scores rather than absolute post-operative scores because individual standard of response may often change after intervention, recognized as a response shift phenomenon in patient-reported outcome study. Regarding seasonal differences, patients who had surgery in summer exhibited relatively better sleep quality than those who had surgery in winter. Conclusions: Analysis of sub-scales of health indices demonstrated characteristic prognoses for each IOL and cataract type. Cataract surgery may potentially contribute to systemic health in older adults...|$|R

40|$|Congenital ectopia lentis (EL) is an ocular condition, which {{typically}} causes a high grade of refractive errors, mainly myopia and astigmatism. These might {{be difficult to}} compensate for, especially in children, who might develop ametropic amblyopia. Surgery on ectopic lenses has previously been controversial, due {{to the risk of}} sightthreatening complications. In paper I we studied retrospectively visual outcomes and complications in children, who were operated for congenital EL, and who had en scleral-fixated capsular tension ring (CTR) and an <b>intra-ocular</b> lens (IOL) <b>implanted</b> at the primary surgery. Thirty-seven eyes of 22 children were included. Visual acuity (VA) improved in all eyes, and only few had persistent amblyopia {{at the end of the}} follow-up. A great majority of the eyes had postoperative visual axis opacification (VAO), which was expected, since the posterior capsule was left intact at the primary surgery. Two eyes required secondary suturing for IOL decentration. No eye had any serious complications such as retinal detachment, glaucoma or endophthalmitis. Congenital ectopia lentis is often an indicator of a systemic connective tissue disorder, and Marfan syndrome (MFS) is diagnosed in 70 % of the cases. This genetic disorder affects basically all organ systems in the body, EL and dilatation of the ascending aorta being the cardinal signs. MFS is associated with markedly decreased life expectancy due to the cardiovascular complications. Therefore, an early and accurate diagnosis is of importance. In paper II we measured the accommodative power, lens thickness, anterior chamber depth (ACD), and pupil size in these eyes, using an optical coherence tomography (OCT). Thirty-one eyes of 31 cases of MFS were included, and these were compared to non-affected controls. We found that the lens was significantly thicker in MFS at all stages. The pupil size was significantly smaller in MFS at baseline, decreased less in accommodation and dilated more during dilatation. No significant difference was seen in the accommodative power or ACD. No difference was seen in any parameter between the MFS eyes with, and without EL. We conclude, that even though the lens and the pupil seem to be affected in MFS, these eyes seem to have the same ability to accommodate as normal subjects. The observed changes seem to be associated to MFS independently of EL. In paper III we studied the corneal curvature, thickness and endothelial cell density (ECD) in 39 MFS eyes and compared those to non-affected controls. We found significantly lower keratometric (K) values and corneal thickness in MFS, but no difference in the ECD. No significant difference was found in these parameters between MFS eyes with and without EL. We also reported on generally increased corneal astigmatism in MFS, especially in eyes with EL. In paper IV we described the ocular characteristics in 102 eyes of 56 cases of MFS. We found increased axial length, but mostly only moderate myopia, which seemed to be compensated by the flat cornea. The majority of the eyes had EL, or were pseudophakic due to EL. Other associated diagnosis included amblyopia, glaucoma, retinal detachment and strabismus. In conclusion, we found that surgery for EL in children, including CTR and IOL gives good visual development and no serious complications. Also, most of the ocular changes in MFS seem to be connected to MFS itself, rather than EL...|$|R

It includes removal of a tooth from the patient or a donor. After removal, a lamina of tissue cut from the tooth is drilled and the hole is fitted with optics. The lamina is grown in the patients' cheek {{for a period of}} months and then is implanted upon the eye. The procedure was pioneered by the Italian ophthalmic surgeon Professor Benedetto Strampelli in the early 1960s.

50|$|Born in a Parsi {{family in}} the western Indian state of Maharashtra, Mehta {{graduated}} in medicine (MBBS) from the Christian Medical College and secured his post graduate degree (MS) from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh. Moving to UK, he obtained a Diploma in Ophthalmology (DO) from the Moorefield’s Eye Hospitals and Institute of Ophthalmology, London where he {{had the opportunity to}} train under renowned ophthalmologist, Harold Ridley, and secured another Diploma from Dublin, before going to US for advanced training. He returned to India in 1971 and started working on intraocular lenses (IOL) which was not available in India at that time. He founded Colaba Eye Hospital where he introduced the posterior chamber implant and started working on the development of a soft implant in 1976. The efforts resulted in the presentation of a paper at the All India Ophthalmological Society in 1977 and subsequently at the American <b>Intra-ocular</b> <b>Implant</b> Society, San Francisco in 1978. He also developed a round intraocular lens, a first time in India, which was surgically implanted in 1983. Keiki Mehta BP Valve Glaucoma Shunt is another of his inventions, which is a valved implant used in the treatment of glaucoma.|$|E
40|$|Background & {{objective}} Endophthalmit{{is due to}} Propionibacterium acnes following cataract surgery has infrequently been reported. This is due to {{the difficulty}} in isolating this organism because of its sequestration in the posterior capsular bag. The objective was to isolate and identify this rare micro-aerophilic organism, P acnes from 2 cases of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery with <b>intra-ocular</b> <b>implant.</b> Methods Thorough clinical examination was conducted on the two cases of endophthalmitis occuring after 2 and 3 months of surgery respectively. Vitreous specimens were cultured under micro-aerophilic conditions. Bacterial identification and antibiotic sensitivity were performed by recommended procedures. Results P. acnes was isolated on both the occasions. Both the isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime, but resistant to vancomycin and aminoglycosides. Interpretation & Conclusion P. acnes can cause post-operative endophthalmitis and should be suspected especially in late onset cases. Being sequestered in the capsular bag, it can create serious problems in management...|$|E
