5|$|Day-to-day {{life at the}} Glidden House {{was mostly}} {{carried out in the}} home's {{basement}} which contained a full kitchen, <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> living room. The upper floors were used for guests and for sleeping quarters. In 1877 Glidden's daughter, Elva, married William H. Bush in the homestead.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor is the upper hall and the captain's chamber, used in the 16th century as a living and working space by the castle's commander, and {{converted}} into a <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> a bedroom in the 19th century. On the opposite side to the captain's private chamber are two other bedrooms, possibly originally {{for the use of}} the castle's lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|On the house's {{east side}} are three rooms, whose {{original}} presence {{is open to}} debate. The three rooms are interconnected, another common French colonial element. The room adjacent the porch {{was used as the}} Glidden's <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> is where the large brick fireplace, which replaced the marble one in 1909, is located. The 1909 fireplace is of the American Craftsman style. At the end of the hall, near the kitchen, there is a full bathroom.|$|E

5|$|An {{economic}} {{boom in the}} south {{following the end of}} World War I greatly increased Southern's revenues. Harrison {{spent a good deal of}} time traveling around the southern United States, endeavoring to increase southern industry. When he traveled, he used two private railroad cars, named the Carolina and the Virginia. Other railroad presidents used only one, which made Harrison's practice unique. The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> observation area.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} {{operating}} year, a stable {{was built for}} the lodge, at the lodge's south driveway about 100 yards from Scarborough Road. In 1909 an addition was built (of 62 by 126 feet) and the entire structure became used for an automobile garage. The interior of the old stable was replaced. The east end held a commercial kitchen, <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> a billiard and smoking room. The west end held a repair shop. The {{front of the building}} held supply rooms, closets, and an office. The upstairs held bedrooms and bathrooms for the chauffeurs.|$|E

5|$|Obama {{hosted the}} White House Passover Seder for all {{eight years of}} his administration. Among the annual traditions for the White House Seder were Obama's {{imitation}} of Pharaoh, Chaudhary's speech on the Hillel sandwich, and the hiding of the afikoman {{under the watchful eye}} of a Secret Service member. The Seder convened in the Old Family <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>and</b> lasted for two hours. During Obama's last year in office in 2016, the Seder was held on April 26, the sixth day of Passover, due to Obama's previously scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia on the first and second nights of Passover.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{is located on}} Broad Street {{in the town of}} Montgomery, Powys, a short distance from Montgomery Castle. There is a separate <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> bar/lounge area in the restaurant. The dining room has low-slung beams, and an open brick fireplace, around which are placed Laura Ashley sofas. The chestnut wood flooring of the restaurant was created from a fallen tree on the Francis family farm. There is room to serve up to 40 diners, with 12 members of staff working there. There are three en-suite rooms available to hire on a hotel basis.|$|E
5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E
50|$|The inn has {{seventeen}} guest <b>rooms,</b> {{a formal}} <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> breakfast <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> lounge areas. The property has {{a swimming pool}} overlooking Frenchman Bay.|$|R

50|$|That {{renovation}} also enclosed {{the second}} floor sleeping porch. Presently, it has seven bedrooms, {{each with its own}} bathroom, as well as a commercial kitchen, two <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> three <b>rooms</b> used for office space.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine (1694–1749) oversaw a remodelling {{of the north}} of the house, that added a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms to the {{pediment}} of the north facade. In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James Townsend, the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance. An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> breakfast parlour on the ground floor, with a library and billiard room on the first floor.|$|E
5|$|The Rudd Center for Professional Wine Studies, {{a two-story}} {{distillery}} building dating to around 1889, {{is used for}} the Professional Wine Studies program and was named after the Rudd family of Rudd Farms. The building has sensory analysis classrooms with wireless keypad response systems, built-in light boxes, and expectoration stations. The Rudd Center contains a pantry, a 4,000-bottle wine cave and private <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> a terrace. Karen MacNeil is the creator and chairman of the center. The building opened in 2003 for a wine professional credential; the school began its wine and beverage certification program in 2010. In 2013 the school began a wine, beverage, and hospitality concentration in its bachelor's degree program.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
5000|$|... 1961 - Residential area {{built for}} Salesian staff. Form Six was added and {{enrolment}} passed 360. Furthermore, another wing with two classrooms, a kitchen, <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> a shower block {{was added to}} the complex.|$|R
50|$|The {{top floor}} of the tower is {{occupied}} by the China Club. Only club members have access. The club features a bar, restaurant with private <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> meeting <b>rooms.</b> The club opened on 19 May 2001.|$|R
50|$|Furniture: a 15-piece <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> suite <b>and</b> eight curio cabinets.|$|R
5|$|This design {{followed}} the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms {{scattered over the}} two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on {{the first and second}} floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to {{the east side of the}} house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> bedroom on the second. This older concept is more clearly exemplified at the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall in neighbouring Derbyshire.|$|E
5|$|Carlton {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the other six residents, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke his arm in the process. Carlton then entered the other <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E
5|$|The 1902 Education Act {{also made}} it a legal {{requirement}} for the County Council to provide an equal educational opportunity for girls. A conference was held in October 1903 to discuss the founding of a girls' school, and by January 1905 Wisbech High School for Girls was established in Harecroft House on the North Brink. The house had been donated on a long-term lease for the purpose by the Peckover family. Harecroft House had been built in 1844 by Algernon Peckover, and his descendants {{lived in the house}} until the death of Susannah Peckover in 1903, after which it was left vacant. The first headmistress was Beatrice Sparks, who was the first woman to complete the Oxford Tripos in mathematics. New schoolrooms were added to the High School in 1906, 1913, 1922 and 1936, when a mixed-use gymnasium and hall was constructed. This hall was, until recently, used as the school <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> will from 2017 be the school's library. Originally, the High School was also able to take boarders, which continued until after World War II.|$|E
50|$|Another popular {{attraction}} is the House of Blues, {{a venue for}} live music and a restaurant, with a capacity of approximately 1,800. On {{the top floor of}} the hotel is the House of Blues Foundation <b>Room,</b> featuring a <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> private <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> a balcony looking down the Las Vegas Strip.|$|R
50|$|In modern homes, butler's pantries {{are usually}} located in {{transitional}} spaces between kitchens <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> used as staging areas for serving meals. They commonly contain countertops, and storage for candles, serving pieces, table linens, tableware, wine, <b>and</b> other <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> articles. More elaborate versions may include dishwashers, refrigerators, or sinks.|$|R
50|$|The highest {{possible}} recognition is {{tried to be}} achieved with the guests by the uniform interior design of all restaurants with the same colors and dark wood furniture and by using large open <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> open kitchens.|$|R
5|$|The {{central and}} largest {{room in the}} house is the great hall which was the {{original}} <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the service rooms. The staircase {{to the north of the}} hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E
5|$|The fair {{planners}} {{also sought}} two other properties near {{the southwest corner}} of the grounds. They failed completely to make any inroads with the Seattle Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church, who had recently built Sacred Heart Church there; they did a bit better with the Freemasons' Nile Temple, which they were able to use {{for the duration of the}} fair and which then returned to its previous use. It served as the site of the Century 21 Club. This membership organization, formed especially for the fair, charged $250 for membership and offered lounge, <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> other club facilities, as well as a gate pass for the duration of the fair. The city ended up leasing the property after the fair and in 1977 bought it from the Masons. The building was eventually incorporated into a theater complex including the Seattle Children's Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Carl G. Fisher, who was {{responsible}} for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought Adams Key, once known as Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922. The two-story club building had ten guest rooms, a <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included Warren G. Harding, Albert Fall, T. Coleman du Pont, Harvey Firestone, Jack Dempsey, Charles F. Kettering, Will Rogers and Frank Seiberling. Israel Jones' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934. Among the Joneses' clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family. The Joneses also provided the club with fish, lobster and crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club. Clients guided by the Joneses included then-senators John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Herman Talmadge and George Smathers through the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The {{residence}} on {{the first}} floor has a kitchen, living <b>room,</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> an open verandah balcony, three bedrooms and a bathroom. The living <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> main bedroom open by French doors onto the verandah balcony. There are glazed fanlights above these French doors and side lights to those off the <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> The pole connecting the residence and the station below is housed in a cupboard adjacent to the bathroom. The interiors are clad with tongue and groove boarding and the ceilings sheeted and battened. The kitchen cupboards, linen cupboard, <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> cupboard <b>and</b> main bedroom wardrobe remain. The terrazzo floor to the bathroom survives.|$|R
25|$|After {{the repeal}} of Prohibition in 1933, the Candlelight in Brooklyn added a {{cocktail}} lounge. Expanding from the building’s basement into its upper floors, the restaurant eventually had five <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> a summer garden, serving 500 customers daily.|$|R
50|$|The home's {{interior}} {{has four}} {{rooms on the}} main floor and three on the second floor. Interior features include an open staircase with turned balusters, pocket doors, dual fireplaces in the living <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> an oriel window.|$|R
