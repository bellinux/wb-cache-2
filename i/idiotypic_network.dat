40|$|Hoffmann (1982) {{analysed}} a {{very simple}} model of suppressive <b>idiotypic</b> immune <b>networks</b> and showed that idiotypic interactions are stabilizing. He concluded that immune networks provide a counterexample to the general analysis of large dynamic systems (Gardner and Ashby, 1970; May, 1972). The latter is often verbalized as: an increase in size and/or connectivity decreases the system stability. We here analyse this apparent contradiction by extending the Hoffmann model (with a decay term), and comparing it to an ecological model that {{was used as a}} paradigm in the general analysis. Our analysis confirms that the neighbourhood stability of such <b>idiotypic</b> <b>networks</b> increases with connectivity and/or size. However, the contradiction is one of interpretation, and is not due to exceptional properties of immune networks. The contradiction is caused by the awkward normalization used in the general analysis...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model for the {{evolution}} of networks of occupied sites on undirected regular graphs. At every iteration step in a parallel update I randomly chosen empty sites are occupied and occupied sites having degree outside of a given interval (t_l,t_u) are set empty. Depending on the influx I and the values of both lower threshold and upper threshold of the degree different kinds of behaviour can be observed. In certain regimes stable long-living patterns appear. We distinguish two types of pattern: static patterns arising on graphs with low connectivity and dynamic patterns found on high connectivity graphs. Increasing I patterns become unstable and transitions between almost stable patterns, interrupted by disordered phases, occur. For still larger I the lifetime of occupied sites becomes very small and network structures are dominated by randomness. We develop methods to analyze nature and dynamics of these network patterns, give a statistical description of defects and fluctuations around them, and elucidate transitions between different patterns. Results and methods presented can be applied to a variety of problems in different fields and a broad class of graphs. Aiming chiefly at the modeling of functional networks of interacting antibodies and B-cells of the immune system (<b>idiotypic</b> <b>networks)</b> we focus on a class of graphs constructed by bit-chains.

40|$|Extensive idiotypic {{connectivity}} {{has been}} discovered between the antibodies composing the immune responses against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and alpha- 1, 3 -dextran. The idiotypic connections form an elaborate network linking these disparate antigen systems, {{and there is an}} hierarchical organization of the antibodies in this network. The key anti-Ids that interconnect these two responses are more crossreactive, lower-affinity antibodies. Interestingly, 15 % of patients with MG, which is caused by autoantibodies against the AChR, have serum antibodies against DEX. Control sera are negative for anti- DEX antibodies. Certain anti-DEX antibodies also bind to anti-AChR antibodies via idiotypic interactions. These findings suggest a model for the initiation of autoimmunity in MG. Antibodies made in response to DEX epitopes on the surface of certain bacteria would elicit the production of anti-Ids. However, some of these anti-Ids would also be autoantibodies against the AChR.

We then show that when the total number of clones in a network is conserved, the dynamics of the network can be represented by the dynamics of a replicator equation. The number of equilibria and their stability are then characterized using methods developed for the study of second-order replicator equations.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a model where idiotypes (characterizing B lymphocytes and antibodies of an immune system) and anti-idiotypes {{are represented by}} complementary bit strings of a given length d allowing {{for a number of}} mismatches (matching rules). In this model, the vertices of the hypercube in dimension d represent the potential repertoire of idiotypes. A random set of (with probability p) occupied vertices corresponds to the expressed repertoire of idiotypes at a given moment. Vertices of this set linked by the above matching rules build random clusters. We give a structural and statistical characterization of these clusters, or in other words of the architecture of the <b>idiotypic</b> <b>network.</b> Increasing the probability p one finds at a critical p a percolation transition where {{for the first time a}} large connected graph occurs with probability 1. Increasing p further, there is a second transition above which the repertoire is complete in the sense that any newly introduced idiotype finds a complementary anti-idiotype. We introduce structural characteristics such as the mass distribution and the fragmentation rate for random clusters, and determine the scaling behavior of the cluster size distribution near the percolation transition, including finite size corrections. We find that slightly above the percolation transition the large connected cluster (the central part of the <b>idiotypic</b> <b>network)</b> consists typically of one highly connected part and a number of weakly connected constituents and coexists with a number of small, isolated clusters.

40|$|<b>Idiotypic</b> <b>network</b> models {{give one}} {{possible}} {{justification for the}} appearance of tolerance for a certain category of cells while maintaining immunization for the others. In this paper, we provide new evidence that {{the manner in which}} affinity is defined in an <b>idiotypic</b> <b>network</b> model imposes a definite topology on the connectivity of the potential <b>idiotypic</b> <b>network</b> that can emerge. The resulting topology is responsible for very different qualitative behaviour of the network. We show that using a 2 D shape-space model with affinity based on complementary regions, a cluster-free topology results that clearly divides the space into distinct zones; if antigens fall into a zone in which there are no available antibodies to bind to, they are tolerated. On the other hand, if they fall into a zone in which there are highly concentrated antibodies available for binding, then they will be eliminated. On the contrary, using a 2 D shape space with an affinity function based on cell similarity, a highly clustered topology emerges {{in which there is no}} separation of the space into isolated tolerant and non-tolerant zones. Using a bit-string shape space, both similar and complementary affinity measures also result in highly clustered networks. In the networks whose topologies exhibit high clustering, the tolerant and intolerant zones are so intertwined that the networks either reject all antigen or tolerate all antigen. We show that the distribution and topology of the antibody network defined by the complete set of nodes and links-an autonomous feature of the system-therefore selects which antigens are tolerated and which are eliminated. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|International audienceFunctional imaging of {{subtilisin}} Carlsberg {{active center}} by the <b>idiotypic</b> <b>network</b> yielded a catalytic anti-idiotypic antibody with endopeptidase, amidase, and esterase activities. A monoclonal antibody inhibitory to subtilisin (Ab 1 5 -H 4) was employed as the template for guiding the <b>idiotypic</b> <b>network</b> {{to produce the}} catalytic anti-idiotypic Ab 2 6 B 8 -E 12. Proteolytic activity of 6 B 8 -E 12 was demonstrated by zymography using self-quenched fluorescein-BSA conjugate and in a coupled assay detecting Ab 2 - dependent RNase A inactivation. Cleavage of peptide substrates by 6 B 8 -E 12 revealed distinct patterns of hydrolysis with high preference for aromatic residues {{before or after the}} scissile bond. Catalytic activity of Ab 2 was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a mechanism-based inhibitor of serine hydrolases. 5 -H 4 and 6 B 8 -E 12 were cloned, produced in Escherichia coli as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), and purified. Kinetic parameters for amidolytic and esterolytic activities were similar in Ab 2 and its scFv derivative. Although the antigen-specific portion of 6 B 8 -E 12 possesses no primary structure similarity to subtilisin, it mimics proteolytic and amidolytic functions of the parental antigen, albeit with 4 orders of magnitude slower acceleration rates. The lack of detectable endopeptidase activity of 6 B 8 -E 12 scFv raises interesting issues concerning general evolution of catalytic activity. The in silico 3 D models of Ab 1 and Ab 2 revealed strong structural similarity to known anti-protease antibodies and to abzymes, respectively.

40|$|The {{concept that}} immune {{responses}} to self antigens are regulated by anti-idiotypic networks has attracted renewed interest following reports of circulating factors within IgG fractions of serum that impair detection of autoantibodies with autoantigen. Thus, preclearance of sera with bead-immobilised monoclonal autoantibodies to the Type 1 diabetes autoantigen GAD 65, or prebinding of serum antibodies to protein A Sepharose prior to addition of antigen, increases immunoreactivity detected in serum samples {{consistent with the}} trapping on the beads of anti-idiotypic antibodies that block antibody binding to the autoantigen. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies to another major target of autoantibodies in Type 1 diabetes, IA- 2. As previously observed for GAD 65, preadsorption of serum samples with immobilised monoclonal IA- 2 autoantibody, or prebinding to protein A Sepharose, resulted in substantial increases in subsequent immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled IA- 2 in a proportion of samples. However, control experiments indicated that the increases seen on pre-incubation with immobilized autoantibodies were caused by displacement of the antibody by serum IgG, whereas impaired detection of immunoreactivity in liquid-phase radiobinding assays was the result of formation of insoluble complexes that bind poorly to protein A. The results emphasise the importance of direct demonstration of specific binding of antibodies to the idiotype in the study of <b>idiotypic</b> <b>networks</b> in autoimmunity.

40|$|A Cayley tree {{model of}} <b>idiotypic</b> <b>networks</b> that {{includes}} both B cell and antibody dynamics is formulated and analyzed. As in models with B cells only, localized states {{exist in the}} network with limited numbers of activated clones surrounded by virgin or near-virgin clones. The existence and stability of these localized network states are explored {{as a function of}} model parameters. As in previous models that have included antibody, the stability of immune and tolerant localized states are shown to depend on the ratio of antibody to B cell lifetimes as well as the rate of antibody complex removal. As model parameters are varied, localized steady-states can break down via two routes: dynamically, into chaotic attractors, or structurally into percolation attractors. For a given set of parameters, percolation and chaotic attractors can coexist with localized attractors, and thus there do not exist clear cut boundaries in parameter space that separate regions of localized attractors from regions of percolation and chaotic attractors. Stable limit cycles, which are frequent in the two-clone antibody B cell (AB) model, are only observed in highly connected networks. Also found in highly connected networks are localized chaotic attractors. As in experiments by Lundkvist et al.

40|$|Abstract—Jerne’s <b>idiotypic</b> <b>network</b> theory postulates {{that the}} immune {{response}} involves inter-antibody stimulation and suppression {{as well as}} matching to antigens. The theory has proved the most popular Artificial Immune System (AIS) model for incorporation into behavior-based robotics but guidelines for implementing idiotypic selection are scarce. Furthermore, the direct effects of employing the technique have not been demonstrated {{in the form of}} a comparison with non-idiotypic systems. This paper aims to address these issues. A method for integrating an idiotypic AIS network with a Reinforcement Learning based control system (RL) is described and the mechanisms underlying antibody stimulation and suppression are explained in detail. Some hypotheses that account for the network advantage are put forward and tested using three systems with increasing idiotypic complexity. The basic RL, a simplified hybrid AIS-RL that implements idiotypic selection independently of derived concentration levels and a full hybrid AIS-RL scheme are examined.

To investigate the nature of these Id' molecules, spleens from such anti-idiotype-treated mice were fused with the SP 2 / 0 myeloma to produce monoclonal Id' antibodies. All four monoclonal Id' antibodies were found to react with goat and rabbit anti- 11 - 4. 1 in addition to the pig anti-idiotype used for their induction and one of the four, J 1 - 8 - 1, reacted with syngeneic BALB/c anti- 11 - 4. 1. Partial amino acid sequences were determined for the heavy and light chains of these monoclonal antibodies. J 1 - 8 - 1 heavy chain had an NH 2 -terminal amino acid sequence identical to that of 11 - 4. 1 for the 39 NH 2 -terminal residues assigned, whereas its light chain and the heavy and light chains of the other Id' molecules differed markedly from those of the 11 - 4. 1 antibody.
