25|$|The wrestling mask {{has always}} held a sacred place in lucha libre, {{carrying}} {{with it a}} mystique and anonymity beyond {{what it means to}} wrestlers elsewhere in the world. The ultimate humiliation a luchador can suffer <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match. Following a loss in a Lucha de Apuesta match the masked wrestler would be forced to unmask, state their real name and then would be unable to wear that mask while wrestling anywhere in Mexico. Since 2007 the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) has held a special annual show where they received a waiver to the rule from the State of Mexico Wrestling Commission and wrestlers would be allowed to wear the mask they previously lost in a Lucha de Apuestas.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds and levels of loss in Albee’s play A Delicate Balance. Most obvious {{is the loss of}} balance that has been precariously maintained by Agnes, the main character in the play and mistress of the house in which the play takes place. Agnes begins the play musing about sanity, a condition, at least in Agnes’s mind, that can easily be lost. Agnes wonders what would happen if she were to lose her sense of the rational. Who would take care of things? The way in which Agnes maintains the delicate balance in her home, as well as the delicate balance of her sanity, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> contact with her own emotional reality. She also tries to convince everyone else to suppress his or her emotions. Agnes believes that by saying that the emotions are gone, circumstances will return to some condition that resembles normalcy.|$|E

[...] "I believe that England is sick of her Colonies," [...] he wrote, [...] "and to be a Colonist, whatever your POSITION & CHARACTER when at Home – <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> Caste the moment you become a bona fide settler."

500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{controversy}} of his game, Ledonne became an unwitting spokesman for the games industry, facing the medium's opponents in debates and forums. The furor resulting from Slamgate was called out by Ledonne and others in the media as a sign that video games had not yet outgrown the traditional stereotype of children's games. Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that despite being confused and tawdry, Super Columbine Massacre [...] "symbolizes a growing understanding that videogames have more to say than 'shoot the enemies and pick up health.'" [...] Authors Andreas Jahn-Sudmann and Ralf Stockmann consider controversial video games such as Super Columbine Massacre and the Grand Theft Auto [...] "Hot coffee mod" [...] evidence of sociopolitical tensions present between gamers and older generations.

500|$|After leaving Naples, the Shelleys {{settled in}} Rome, {{the city where}} her husband wrote where [...] "the meanest streets were strewed with {{truncated}} columns, broken capitals...and sparkling fragments of granite or porphyry...The voice of dead time, in still vibrations, is breathed from these dumb things, animated and glorified [...] as they were by man". Rome inspired her to begin writing the unfinished novel Valerius, the Reanimated Roman, where the eponymous hero resists the decay of Rome and the machinations of [...] "superstitious" [...] Catholicism. The writing of her novel was broken off when her son William died of malaria. Shelley bitterly commented that she come to Italy to improve her husband's health, and instead the Italian climate had just killed her two children, leading her to write: [...] "May you my dear Marianne never know what it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> two only and lovely children in one year-to watch their dying moments-and then at last to be left childless and forever miserable". To deal with her grief, Shelley wrote the novella The Fields of Fancy, which became Matilda dealing with a young woman whose beauty inspired incestuous love in her father, who ultimately commits suicide to stop himself from acting on his passion for his daughter, while she spends {{the rest of her}} life full of despair about [...] "the unnatural love I had inspired". The novella offered a feminist critique of a patriarchal society as Matilda is punished in the afterlife though she did nothing to encourage her father's feelings.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{his time}} as vice president, Quayle was widely {{ridiculed}} {{in the media and}} by many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and generally incompetent. Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayle's incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either self-contradictory ("The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. ... No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), self-contradictory and confused ("I have made good judgments in the past.

2500|$|Vis-a-vis Great Powers and the South, {{however, the}} {{situation}} was quite different.

Diệm, despite his personal rigidity, distrust of those outside his immediate circle, and minority ethnicity and religion, was, most [...] importantly to the U.S., neither pro-Communist nor pro-French. That he was a nationalist was secondary. The ideal of U.S. policy was for Diệm to form a representative government, oust Bảo Đại, and introduce democracy. French relations with the U.S., with France seen as an important anti-Communist resource in Europe, complicated the situation. The French ambassador to the U.S. warned John Foster Dulles that American support was being offered to Diệm without conditions that he form a stable and representative government. Guy le Chambre, French minister for the Associated States (i.e., Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) reportedly felt Diệm would lead the country into disaster, but, since the U.S. had so visibly supported him, [...] We would prefer to lose in Vietnam with the US than to win without them...we would rather support Diệm knowing he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> and thus keep Franco-US solidarity than to pick someone who could retain Vietnam for the free world if this meant breaking Franco-US solidarity.|$|E

2500|$|Yamada is a {{high school}} girl who is best {{described}} as oversexed, flirtatious and lustful. She is particularly vain and is unabashed in flaunting her looks in public. Her goal in high school is {{to have sex with}} 100 guys; however, her insecurities as a virgin causes her to turn down any advances. She believes the first step towards realizing her dreams <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> her virginity to an inexperienced boy; this leads her to pursue Takashi Kosuda after she accidentally falls on him at the bookstore. Through the course of the series, Yamada tries to make advances on Kosuda, and becomes overly jealous whenever other girls interact with him. She eventually acknowledges she has feelings for him. Despite living at home with her younger sister, Yamada is unashamed in her licentious habits. She is an excellent student, although that is partly attributed to her ability to read and memorize articles about sex. At the conclusion of the manga series, author Yoko Sanri noted that she never managed to reveal Yamada's given name. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network describes her as [...] "single-minded in her determination to get down and dirty" [...] and [...] "rather refreshing to see a girl so comfortable with her sexuality and wants, even if we don't share them". [...] Yamada is voiced by Yukari Tamura in Japanese, and by Brittney Karbowski in English.|$|E
