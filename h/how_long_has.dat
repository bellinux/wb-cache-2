5|$|The 1994 live double album A Night in San Francisco {{received}} favourable reviews as well {{as commercial}} success by reaching number eight on the UK charts. 1995's Days Like This also had large sales – though the critical reviews were not always favourable. This period also saw a number of side projects, including the live jazz performances of 1996's <b>How</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Has</b> This Been Going On, from the same year , and 2000's The Skiffle Sessions – Live in Belfast 1998, all of which found Morrison paying tribute to his early musical influences.|$|E

2500|$|Staind's vocalist Aaron Lewis {{rejected}} the nu metal label, saying, [...] "if we get called a 'nu metal' band one more time, I don't {{even know what}} I'm going to do!" [...] Chino Moreno, vocalist of Deftones, {{rejected the}} nu metal label saying [...] "We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't {{going to be with}} them". As Deftones abandoned the nu metal sound of their early work, Moreno tried to distance himself from nu metal bands and began to criticize the bands and their albums, including Korn's 2002 album Untouchables; he said, [...] "As Korn go on, it's the same things—bad childhoods and mean moms. It gets too old after a while. How old is Jonathan ? Thirty? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>has</b> it been since he lived with his parents?" [...] Davis responded saying, [...] "Obviously, Chino hasn't listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they're nothing about my parents or my childhood." [...] Moreno also said, [...] "A big problem for me was opening for Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, two bands that wouldn't exist if it weren't for me, straight up!". Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park spoke about the nu metal label in an interview with NME, saying [...] "We never held the flag for nu-metal—it was associated with frat rock. Arrogant, misogynistic, and full of testosterone; we were reacting against that." [...] Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit said that he [...] "never liked or condoned" [...] the term [...] "nu metal" [...] in any way, and said he does not understand [...] "how so many bands that sound nothing alike can be put into" [...] the nu metal genre. Mike Wengren of Disturbed said that he doesn't think Disturbed [...] "were ever a nu-metal band to begin with".|$|E
