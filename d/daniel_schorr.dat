25|$|Schorr {{attracted}} {{the anger of}} Richard Nixon's White House. In 1971, after a dispute with White House aides, Schorr's friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing about it. Later, during the Watergate hearings, {{it was revealed that}} Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as Nixon's Enemies List, and <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr</b> was on that list. Famously, Schorr read the list aloud on live TV, surprised to be reading his own name in that context. Schorr won Emmys for news reporting in 1972, 1973, and 1974.|$|E
50|$|The news {{broadcasts}} {{which make}} up {{a significant part of}} the film are different: the German version, as a ZDF production, uses that network and its on-air personalities for the segments, while the English version shows various reporters working for an unnamed American network (for the opening scene, the English version shows <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr's</b> full report, while the German one has a ZDF report before switching to Schorr for the nuclear explosion).|$|R
5000|$|Segment A {{begins at}} 6:30 {{past the hour}} (duration 11:29). It is here that the most {{important}} news of the day is placed. Regular features (such as, before his death, <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr's</b> weekly news wrap-up) appear in this segment. At eighteen minutes past the hour, a two-minute station break starts. The first minute is a music bed solely for use of the member stations. The second minute, from nineteen to twenty past, is a [...] "headlines" [...] segment in which the NPR newscaster on staff that morning recaps the major stories of the hour. Some stations decide to use the entire two minutes for local purposes, taking the opportunity to deliver their own headlines, underwriting or events calendars.|$|R
25|$|<b>Daniel</b> Louis <b>Schorr</b> (August 31, 1916 – July 23, 2010) was an American {{journalist}} who covered world news {{for more than}} 60 years. He was most recently a Senior News Analyst for National Public Radio (NPR). Schorr won three Emmy Awards for his television journalism.|$|R
500|$|In 2009, Nielsen Online {{reported}} that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent. Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about {{ten percent of}} all Internet users. In 2009, Twitter won the [...] "Breakout of the Year" [...] Webby Award. During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition, the journalist <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr</b> stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact-checking and other editorial improvements. In response, Andy Carvin gave Schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on Twitter and said users wanted first-hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories. On November 29, 2009 Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor, declaring it [...] "a new form of social interaction". Time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its 2010 Time 100; to {{determine the influence of}} people, it used a formula based on famous social networking sites, Twitter and Facebook. The list ranges from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey to Lady Gaga and Ashton Kutcher. The U.S. government, seeing social media's role in the 2010 Arab Spring revolts, covertly developed a Cuban alternative to Twitter called ZunZuneo as part of a long-term strategy to [...] "stir unrest". The service was active from 2010 to 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{introduction}} and a pre-recorded version of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] (which was a tradition whenever a new Turner-owned network launched) that was played afterward, {{the husband and}} wife team of Dave Walker and Lois Hart anchored the channel's first newscast. Among the first segments was an interview with then-President Jimmy Carter by <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The book {{highlights}} the Bay of Pigs Invasion as the Central Intelligence Agency's attempt to entrap Kennedy into a full-scale US invasion of Cuba. Citing <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr's</b> conclusion that [...] "In effect, President Kennedy {{was the target}} of a CIA covert operation that collapsed when the invasion collapsed", the book argues that the result of this operation was Kennedy's avowed intention [...] "to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds." [...] The forced resignation of CIA Director Allen Dulles and several deputies served notice that this statement might be followed through. The book describes Kennedy's conflict with the military, including over the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (ratified by the Senate in September 1963), and a back-channel to Fidel Castro in September 1963, via William Atwood, aimed at normalising relations, and National Security Action Memorandum 263 (beginning withdrawal from Vietnam). The book also cites an April 1962 confrontation with the US steel industry, led by U.S. Steel, which together with five other steel companies declared a price increase shortly after an agreement had been brokered to avoid them, in order to control inflation. The Kennedy administration raided corporate offices, issued subpoenas, and tasked the Defense Department with overseas marketing of its steel. Shortly after the steel industry backed down, Henry Luce's Fortune published an editorial, headlined [...] "Steel: The Ides of April", stating that the price rise had been conceived in political terms as a means to either damage the President's credibility, or to unite the business world against him.|$|R
2500|$|Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr</b> said [...] "Hunt tells {{most of his}} Watergate venture fairly straight". Contrasting this opinion, Politico's James Rosen {{described}} the chapters regarding Watergate as the [...] "ost problematic" [...] and wrote: [...] "There are numerous factual errors– misspelled names, wrong dates, phantom participants in meetings, fictitious orders given– and the authors never substantively address, only pause occasionally to demean, the vast scholarly literature that has arisen {{in the last two}} decades to explain the central mystery of Watergate." [...] Rosen's review was not entirely negative and he indicated that the book [...] "succeeds in taking readers beyond the caricatures and conspiracy theories to preserve the valuable memory of Hunt as he really was: passionate patriot; committed Cold Warrior; a lover of fine food, wine and women; incurable intriguer, wicked wit and superb storyteller." [...] Dennis Lythgoe of Deseret News said [...] "he writing style is awkward and often embarrassing", but that [...] "the book as a whole is a fascinating look into the mind of one of the major Watergate figures". In National Review, Mark Riebling praised American Spy as [...] "the only autobiography I know of that convincingly conveys what it was like to be an American spy." [...] The Boston Globe writer Martin Nolan called it [...] "admirable and important" [...] and said that Hunt [...] "presents a livelier, tabloid version of the 1970s". According to Nolan: [...] "It is the best moment-by-moment depiction of the June 17, 1972, burglary of Democratic National Committee headquarters I have ever read." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr,</b> {{reviewing}} Falk's Revolutionaries and Functionaries, {{stated that}} Falk's definition of terrorism hinges on some unstated definition of [...] "permissible"; this, says Schorr, makes {{the judgment of}} what is terrorism inherently [...] "subjective", and furthermore, he claims, leads Falk to label some acts he considers impermissible as [...] "terrorism", but others he considers permissible as merely [...] "terroristic".|$|E

5000|$|I like {{to think}} of it as the only show on public radio other than [...] "Car Talk" [...] that both <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr</b> news analyst and Kurt Cobain singer/guitarist of Nirvana could listen to.
