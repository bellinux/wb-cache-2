40|$|This CICAD 1 on {{heptachlor}} {{was prepared}} by the Fraunhofer Institute of Toxicology and Experimental Medicine, Hanover, Germany. It is an update of the Environmental Health Criteria document on heptachlor (IPCS, 1984) and includes data from the IARC (2001) and JMPR (1992) reports. A comprehensive literature search of relevant databases was conducted from 2000 up to February 2004 to identify any relevant references published subsequent to those incorporated in these reports. Information on the source documents is presented in Appendix 2. Information on the peer review of this CICAD is presented in Appendix 3. This CICAD was considered and approved as an international assessment {{at a meeting of}} the Final Review Board, held in Hanoi, Viet Nam, on 28 September - 1 October 2004. Participants at the Final Review Board meeting are presented in Appendix 4. The International Chemical Safety Card on heptachlor (ICSC 0743), produced by the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS, 2003), has also been reproduced in this document. Heptachlor (CAS No. 76 - 44 - 8) is a chlorinated dicyclopentadiene insecticide that is persistent in the environment and accumulates in the food-chain. Although its use has been banned or severely restricted in many countries since the 1980 s, it is still detected as a contaminant in some food commodities. This is due to its persistence, but it also suggests the illegal use of this pesticide in the recent past or present (or maybe its permitted use in some countries). Heptachlor is one of several organochlorine pesticides that are persistent in the environment. Concentrations in body tissues and in the environment of all these compounds together are several times greater than those of <b>heptachlor</b> and/or <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> (a persistent <b>heptachlor</b> metabolite) alone. Heptachlor released into the environment can be transformed by abiotic processes, such as the transformation by photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, and it is transformed in the presence of water to compounds such as 1 -hydroxychlordene or <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> (such as, for example, in moist soils). In addition, it can be removed to some extent from aquatic systems by evaporation and has a limited potential to leach from soil into groundwater due to its elevated soil sorption coefficient. It is not readily biodegraded, but it is transformed biologically (i. e. by bacteria, fungi, plants, animals), mainly to the stable <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide.</b> The data available on the bioconcentration potential of this lipophilic chlorinated hydrocarbon indicate that it and its stable epoxide will bioaccumulate, which can be shown from the extent of heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide still detected in environmental samples. The main exposure routes for heptachlor are probably via application-related inhalation or skin penetration, from extended exposure to dusts containing heptachlor in, for example, homes treated with this compound to control termites, and indirectly by uptake from food contaminated with heptachlor from crops or from other foods via the food-chain. However, heptachlor is a component of technical chlordane as well as a metabolite of chlordane, and thus identification of <b>heptachlor</b> or <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> does not always signify unequivocally that the primary exposure was to <b>heptachlor</b> (or <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide)</b> per se. A survey of recent studies shows that <b>heptachlor</b> and/or <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> are found in all environmental compartments - air, water, soil, and sediment - as well as in plants (vegetables), fish and other aquatic organisms, amphibians and reptiles, birds and bird eggs, and aquatic and terrestrial mammals. They are found particularly in adipose tissues, where they accumulate. They pass up the food-chain. They are detected in human serum, adipose tissue, including breast tissue, and human breast milk. Heptachlor is readily absorbed via all routes of exposure and is readily metabolized. The major faecal metabolites include <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide,</b> 1 -hydroxychlordene, and 1 -hydroxy- 2, 3 -epoxychlordene. In liver microsomes incubated with heptachlor, 85. 8 % was metabolized to <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> in rats, but only 20. 4 % in humans. Other metabolites identified in the human liver microsome system were 1 -hydroxy- 2, 3 - epoxychlordene (5 %), 1 -hydroxychlordene (4. 8 %), and 1, 2 -dihydroxydihydrochlordene (0. 1 %). <b>Heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> is metabolized slowly and is the most persistent metabolite; it is stored mainly in adipose tissue, but also in liver, kidney, and muscle. Females appear to store more <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> than males. A period of 12 weeks was required for complete disappearance from the fat after discontinuing heptachlor feeding in rats. In humans and laboratory animals, placental transfer of <b>heptachlor</b> and/or <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> has been shown. Acute oral LD 50 s for heptachlor for the rat and mouse are 40 - 162 and 68 - 90 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The acute toxicity of heptachlor in animals is associated with central nervous system disturbances, such as hyperexcitability, tremors, convulsions, and paralysis. The acute toxicity of <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> is greater than that of heptachlor, whereas that of the other metabolites is much less. In animals fed heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide by diet, gavage, or subcutaneous injection, there is a sharp dose-response curve for mortality. Usually, no marked differences were seen between the treated animals and the controls with respect to body weights and food consumption. However, liver enlargement has been described, associated with accentuated lobulation, and histopathological findings showed enlargement of centrilobular and midzonal hepatocytes. Fertility studies in rats injected with heptachlor subcutaneously resulted in LOAELs of 5 mg/kg body weight per day for suppression of reproductive hormone levels, disruptions in female cyclicity, and delays in mating behaviour. In developmental toxicity studies, there were usually no clinical signs of maternal toxicity (dose-related alterations in weight gain) until mortality occurred [NOAEL for maternal toxicity = 3 mg/kg body weight per day]. In one study, reduced litter sizes were noted, but postnatal mortality of the pups was the most obvious finding [NOAEL for pre- or postnatal survival of pups = 6 mg/kg body weight per day]. No teratological effects were observed. There is accumulating evidence that the nervous system and its development are influenced by cyclodiene pesticides. The profile of effects produced by repeated heptachlor administration to female rats consisted of altered activity, hyperexcitability, and autonomic effects [NOAEL = 2 mg/kg body weight per day]. Neurotoxicological studies on perinatal heptachlor exposure in the rat (0. 03, 0. 3, or 3 mg/kg body weight per day) suggested developmental delays, alterations in GABAergic neurotransmission, and neurobehavioural changes, including cognitive deficits at all doses. Immunological studies in rats indicate the suppression of the primary IgM and secondary IgG anti-sheep red blood cell responses following perinatal exposure to all tested doses (0. 03, 0. 3, or 3 mg/kg body weight per day) of heptachlor. Heptachlor, technical-grade <b>heptachlor,</b> <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide,</b> and a mixture of <b>heptachlor</b> and <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> have been tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in several strains of mice and rats. Heptachlor/heptachlor <b>epoxide</b> and technical-grade <b>heptachlor</b> were shown to be carcinogenic in male and female mice but not in rats. In an initiation-promotion assay, heptachlor was active as a promoter after initiation by N-nitrosodiethylamine. Heptachlor shows mostly negative responses in in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity testing. Heptachlor causes in vitro inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication, also suggesting a non-genotoxic carcinogenic mechanism. Available epidemiological data do not show a clear relationship between adverse health effects and exposure to heptachlor. A tolerable intake was therefore developed from experimental studies. As hepatic tumours induced by heptachlor in mice are likely to be induced by a nongenotoxic mechanism and as non-neoplastic effects were observed at doses 1 / 20 th of those inducing tumours, nonneoplastic effects (i. e. histopathological effects in the liver, neurotoxicological effects, and immunotoxicological effects) were used to derive the tolerable intake. The NOAEL for hepatic effects observed in dogs was 25 ?g/kg body weight per day, and that for neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity observed in studies in rats was 30 ?g/kg body weight per day. Applying an uncertainty factor of 10 for each of inter- and intraspecies variation and an additional factor of 2 for inadequacy of the database to the NOAEL in dogs gives a tolerable intake of 0. 1 ?g/kg body weight per day for the non-neoplastic effects. Daily dietary intakes of <b>heptachlor</b> and <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> in Poland were estimated at 0. 51 - 0. 58 ?g per person (about 0. 01 ?g/kg body weight, assuming a mean weight of 64 kg). This value is 10 -fold less than the tolerable intake of 0. 1 ?g/kg body weight. However, if food is contaminated with heptachlor, such as fish from contaminated rivers (e. g. concentrations in fish in the 0. 1 - 1 mg/kg range reported recently in some areas), vegetables from fields contaminated with heptachlor (up to 16 mg/kg), or contaminated milk (e. g. in the microgram per kilogram to milligram per kilogram range in some regions), then the dietary intake of this chemical would be much higher, and there would be a likely health risk if the contaminated food is ingested for a long period of time. For breast-fed children, taking the highest reported values for <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> in human breast milk and assuming a daily milk consumption of 150 g/kg body weight and an average milk fat content of 3. 1 %, a mean intake of 1. 5 ?g/kg body weight can be calculated. This value is more than 10 -fold higher than the tolerable intake of 0. 1 ?g/kg body weight per day and, if the concentrations reported are correct, should be a cause of concern. The acute toxicity of heptachlor was tested using a variety of aquatic species from different trophic levels. Heptachlor was shown to be toxic to fish and other aquatic species. However, there is a great deal of variability in the levels of toxicity reported, possibly due to evaporation of heptachlor, thereby reducing the actual concentration of the test compound from the nominal test concentration over time. For the freshwater environment, 23 toxicity values were chosen to derive a guidance value. A guidance value for heptachlor, based on the species sensitivity distribution, for the protection of 99 % of species with 50 % confidence was derived at 10 ng/l. In many locations, freshwater heptachlor concentrations exceed the guidance value; the highest reported heptachlor concentration measured in fresh surface water, 62 000 ng/l, exceeds it more than 1000 -fold. For the marine environment, 18 toxicity values were chosen to derive a guidance value. A guidance value for heptachlor, based on the species sensitivity distribution, for the protection of 99 % of species with 50 % confidence was derived at 5 ng/l. For seawater, the highest reliable value for heptachlor present is about 0. 15 ng/l, so the guidance value is not exceeded, suggesting a low risk for the marine environment. From the few data available, heptachlor appears to exhibit moderate toxic effects upon terrestrial vertebrates. None of the studies appears reliable enough to serve as a basis for a quantitative risk characterization. It should be remembered that heptachlor is used as a termiticide. In studies on rats, heptachlor has been shown to be neurotoxic and immunotoxic at 0. 03 mg/kg body weight per day. The Göksu Delta, Turkey, which is one of the most important breeding and wintering areas for birds in the world, is contaminated by organochlorine pesticides from soils from agricultural areas that have been transported to the delta by the Göksu River. From this region, levels of heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide have been detected in birds and bird eggs in the lower milligram per kilogram range. The effect of such concentrations of heptachlor on the bird populations can only be speculated at present due to lack of data; however, there is a potential risk for the terrestrial environment in this location...|$|R

40|$|Drinking water, cowpea and maize grains were sampled in some {{potentially}} exposed agro-ecological {{areas in}} Togo and analysed for their contamination by some common organochlorine pesticides. A total of 19 organochlorine pesticides were investigated in ten subsamples of maize, ten subsamples of cowpea and nine subsamples of drinking water. Analytical methods included solvent extraction of the pesticide residues and their subsequent quantification using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of pesticides were also determined. Pesticides residues {{in drinking water}} (0. 04 - 0. 40 μg l- 1) were higher than the maximum residue limit (MRL) (0. 03 μg l- 1) set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Dieldrin, endrin, <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> and endosulfan levels (13. 16 - 98. 79 μg kg- 1) in cowpea grains exceeded MRLs applied in France (10 - 50 μg kg- 1). Contaminants' levels in maize grains (0. 53 - 65. 70 μg kg- 1) were below the MRLs (20 - 100 μg kg- 1) set by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WHO. EDIs of the tested pesticides ranged from 0. 02 % to 162. 07 % of the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). Population exposure levels of dieldrin and <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> were higher than the FAO/WHO standards.

40|$|Pesticide {{residues}} in meat is {{of growing}} concern due to {{possible adverse effects}} on humans. Pesticide levels were assessed in five edible cattle parts: muscle, liver, kidney and tongue tissues to determine human health risk associated with consumption of these tissues. Health risk estimates were analysed using estimated daily intake (EDI), hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) for two (2) age/weight categories: 1 – 11 years/ 30  kg for children while 70  kg was used for adult. Risks were categorized for non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health effects and measured at the average, maximum, 50 th and 95 th percentiles of the measured exposure concentrations (MEC). Total pesticide residues ranged from 2. 38 to 3. 86  μg/kg (muscle), 3. 58 to 6. 3  μg/kg (liver), 1. 87 to 4. 59  μg/kg (kidney) and 2. 54 to 4. 35  μg/kg (tongue). Residual pesticide concentrations in the tissues were in the order: Liver > Tongue > Muscle > Kidney. The concentrations of all the assessed pesticides observed in the tissues were however lower than the recommended maximum residual limits (MRLs). Human health risk estimations for the children showed EDI values for <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide,</b> aldrin and dieldrin exceeding threshold values. Non-cancer risk posed to children on consumption of contaminated cattle parts showed HQ values for <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide,</b> aldrin, dieldrin and HI values for organochlorines exceeding 1, indicating the possibility of non-carcinogenic health risks to consumers especially children from consumption of cattle meat from the selected abattoirs...|$|R

40|$|Average daily dietary {{exposures}} to 11 contaminants were estimated for approximately 120, 000 U. S. adults by combining data on annual diet, {{as measured by}} a food frequency questionnaire, with contaminant residue data for table-ready foods that were collected {{as part of the}} annual U. S. Food and Drug Administration Total Diet Study. The contaminants included in the analysis were four heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury), three organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion), and four organochlorine pesticides (dieldrin, p,p'-DDE, lindane, <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide).</b> Dietary {{exposures to}} these contaminants were highly variable among individuals, spanning two to three orders of magnitude. Intraindividual exposures to the metals, organophosphates, and organochlorines were estimated to be strongly correlated; Pearson's correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 28 for lindane:dieldrin to 0. 84 for lead:mercury. For some of the compounds (e. g., arsenic and dieldrin), a substantial fraction of the population was estimated to have dietary intakes in excess of health-based standards established by the EPA. Before use for risk assessment or epidemiologic purposes, however, the validity of the exposure estimates must be evaluated by comparison with biological indicators of chronic exposure. Because of their low detection rate in table-ready foods, the estimated distributions of exposures for dieldrin, p,p'-DDE, <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide,</b> lindane, diazinon, and chlorpyrifos were found to be sensitive to assumed values for nondetect samples. Reliable estimates of the population distribution of dietary exposures to most other contaminants cannot be made currently, due to their low rate of detection in table-ready foods. Monitoring programs that use more sensitive study designs and population-based assessments for other subpopulations should be a priority for future research...|$|R
30|$|In a {{case study}} in Guanajuato (in the centre of Mexico and its former breadbasket), (Pérez Espejo and Pérez Espejo 2011) found that in the {{national}} drinking water the maximum limits had been exceeded by <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide,</b> lindane, and methoxychlor. All these pesticides are restricted or they are prohibited in Mexico. She also detected triazines and carbamates, for which there are still no standards in Mexico. But insufficient legal enforcement and the absence of laboratories means there is no control of these toxins. This diffuse pollution in agriculture exists {{in many parts of the}} world, while there is little awareness of the environmental impacts of pesticides because of a low level of education, especially among farmers who believe that more chemicals and fertilizers will increase their harvest.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Although <b>heptachlor</b> <b>epoxide</b> (HE) is {{the major}} {{metabolite}} of organochlorine pesticide heptachlor in soil, there is very limited information on the biodegradation of HE by microorganisms, and no systematic study on the metabolic products and pathways for HE transformation by fungi has been conducted. In this study, the metabolism of HE was performed with Cordyceps brongniartii ATCC 66779, which is capable of degrading polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin. This fungus removed about 27 % and 21 % of HE in PDB and BSM medium, respectively, after 20 days of incubation. Three hydroxylated products including heptachlor diol, 1, 2 -dihydroxydihydrochlordene and trihydroxychlordene were detected as metabolites of HE using GC/MS analysis, suggesting that HE was metabolized to hydrophilic products via hydrolysis, dechlorination and hydroxylation...|$|R
