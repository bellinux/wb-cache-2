30|$|Brodie method [73], Staudenmaier method [74] and <b>Hummers</b> method [75] {{are three}} main ways to form GO. <b>Hummers</b> method is {{becoming}} the most popular approach to synthesize GO {{by virtue of its}} merits, including rapid, easy and relatively safe properties.

40|$|Abstract Graphene nanosheets were {{produced}} after synthesizing graphene oxide via <b>Hummer’s</b> method and a modified <b>Hummer’s</b> method. The obtained graphene after reduction was dispersed in 1 -propanol {{to get a}} coating solution. Mild steel coupons were coated with the graphene solution via dip coating method. Corrosion {{studies were carried out}} at different environments like water (pH 6. 0), HCl (0. 1  N), NaCl (3. 5  wt%) and NaOH (1  M).
