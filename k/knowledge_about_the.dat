5|$|The game {{provides}} {{several options}} for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the security systems and turrets.

Early in the game, the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.|$|E

Molloy (1995) reported on the captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and associated field studies related to factors influencing the distribution of Succinea sp. B. Confusion on snail identification may have affected the results of Thomee's and Aloi's work, but by the time Molloy's study was initiated, the identification problems had been resolved.|$|E
