5|$|Jaws is a 1974 {{novel by}} American writer Peter Benchley. It {{tells the story}} of a great white shark that preys upon a small resort town and the voyage of three men trying to kill it. The novel grows out of Benchley's {{interest}} in shark attacks after <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the exploits of shark fisherman Frank Mundus in 1964. Doubleday commissioned him to write the novel in 1971, a period when Benchley struggled as a freelance journalist.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brant's {{force was}} part of a {{combined}} British and Indian army being raised to counter Clark's offensive. Brant had too few men to challenge Clark, but when he intercepted messengers traveling between Clark and Lochry, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> Lochry's smaller group bringing up the rear. When Lochry landed to feed his men and horses, Brant launched his overwhelmingly successful ambush. Because Clark had been able to recruit {{only a fraction of the}} men he needed for his campaign, the loss of Lochry's men resulted in the cancellation of Clark's expedition.|$|E

5|$|Stratton {{was exposed}} to {{multiple}} influences through his life. As an undergraduate student of Howison, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> philosophy and religion. At Yale and later at Wundt's lab, he switched to experimental psychology and studied perception, memory and emotion. His exposure to World War I, serving in the Army then, focused his mind on issues {{of war and peace}} and international relations. Stratton's later work reflected these elements of his experience. He was also a scholar of the classics and translated some Greek philosophers.|$|E
5|$|The king, {{shocked and}} dejected, {{returned}} to the palace since he had already anointed his son, Devavrata, as heir apparent. Devavrata was distressed by his father's condition; <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the promise asked by the fisherman-chief from a minister. Immediately, Devavrata rushed to the hut of the fisherman-chief and begged for Satyvati's hand on his father's behalf. The fisherman repeated his condition and told Devavrata that only Shantanu was worthy of Satyavati; he had rejected marriage proposals from even Brahmarishis like Asita.|$|E
5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as well, as they are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E

5|$|Bayona {{cut parts}} of the script, {{including}} {{the outcome of the}} other orphanage children, because he wanted to focus on the character of Laura and what happens to her. To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time. To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993). Del Toro offered to co-produce the film as soon as <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> it. For the rest of his crew, Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1970, South Vietnamese and U.S. units {{unleashed}} a limited, multi-pronged Cambodian Campaign that Washington hoped would solve three problems: First, {{it would provide}} a shield for the American withdrawal from Vietnam (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops) in Cambodia; second, it would provide a test for the policy of Vietnamization; third, it {{would serve as a}} signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business. Despite Nixon's appreciation of Lon Nol's position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country. <b>He</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself learned about it from a radio broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Rejecting his mother's {{proposal}} of sending him {{to study in}} Spain at the University of Salamanca and Alcalá de Henares, alongside his cousin Manuel Belgrano, he enrolled in jurisprudence studies in the University of Chuquisaca, in the Upper Peru (modern Bolivia). There, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the ongoing French Revolution, and the new ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. He also learned about the 1782 Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II and the oppression of the indigenous peoples, which influenced his actions in his future Upper Peru campaign. Before returning to Buenos Aires, he visited Potosí and witnessed the use of slave labor in the mines.|$|E

5|$|Since Ramanujan's {{father was}} at work most of the day, his mother {{took care of the}} boy as a child. He had a close {{relationship}} with her. From her, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> tradition and puranas. He learned to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits – all of which are part of Brahmin culture. At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue's eight {{valuable}} Torah scrolls {{were saved}} {{due to an}} intervention by Leonardo Grivičić, an entrepreneur and industrialist who lived next door from Mile Budak, a minister in the Ustaša government. He was also close to Poglavnik Ante Pavelić and the Third Reich's ambassador to Croatia, Edmund Glaise-Horstenau. Although Grivičić {{did not have a}} significant political role in the Independent State of Croatia, he was considered trustworthy. On October 9, 1941, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the regime's plan to start the demolition of the synagogue on the following morning. By that evening, Grivičić secretly relayed the information to the synagogue's chief cantor, Grüner, and during the night, the Torah scrolls were moved to safety.|$|E
5|$|When Nobin {{returned}} to the village, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the affair from village gossip. Nobin was publicly humiliated following {{the discovery of the}} affair. He confronted Elokeshi, who confessed and begged him for forgiveness. Not only did Nobin forgive her but he decided to run away with her from Tarakeswar. However, the mahant did not allow the couple to escape; his goons blocked their way. Overcome with anger and jealousy, Nobin slit his wife's throat with a fish knife, decapitating her, on 27 May 1873. Full of remorse, Nobin surrendered to the local police station and confessed his crime.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, {{while the}} Confederates {{attempted}} to raid New Creek, Averell's force crossed the Potomac at Hancock, Maryland, {{and headed for}} Springfield, West Virginia. He was losing horses due to exhaustion, but at Springfield he received food for his men and horses sent by General Kelley. Around this time <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> McCausland's unsuccessful raid at New Creek, and that McCausland was moving toward Moorefield. He arrived in Romney around 11:00am on August 6. At that time he sent a battalion of men from the 22nd Pennsylvania Cavalry away from the main road to the Wardensville Road. This battalion, led by Major George T. Work, was instructed to block McCausland's route back to the Shenandoah Valley at Lost River Gap while Averell approached from behind, or approach McCausland from the east if fighting had begun. During the afternoon, Averell gathered more information and devised his plan for a surprise attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} {{parts of the}} game's development, the largest {{challenge}} was to coordinate Guasti's and his collaborators' work; when Guasti started working as a programmer, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> project management, and applied it to AM2R, but still found it challenging to have deadlines and keep people motivated, as everyone {{was working on the}} game for free in their spare time. In late 2014, the project was ported to the newer version GameMaker: Studio, which enabled improved loading times and performance, but required the complete rewriting of some features and changes to the designs of some levels. This move also made bugs faster to fix and new builds easier to make, leaving the development progress in a more expedient and productive state. Later in the same year, the developers worked on improving the visuals, giving the fourth area a new graphics tile set intended to give it more personality.|$|E
5|$|Seizing opportunity, the Eight Banners {{crossed the}} Great Wall after the Ming border general Wu Sangui (1612–1678) opened the gates at Shanhai Pass. This {{occurred}} shortly after <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> {{the fate of}} the capital and an army of Li Zicheng marching towards him; weighing his options of alliance, he decided to side with the Manchus. The Eight Banners under the Manchu Prince Dorgon (1612–50) and Wu Sangui approached Beijing after the army sent by Li was destroyed at Shanhaiguan; the Prince of Shun's army fled the capital on the fourth of June. On 6 June, the Manchus and Wu entered the capital and proclaimed the young Shunzhi Emperor ruler of China. After being forced out of Xi'an by the Qing, chased along the Han River to Wuchang, and finally along the northern border of Jiangxi province, Li Zicheng died there in the summer of 1645, thus ending the Shun dynasty. One report says his death was a suicide; another states that he was beaten to death by peasants after he was caught stealing their food.|$|E

5|$|While at college, Reed interned for Congressman Joseph Patrick KennedyII. During his {{internship}} <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> {{a federal}} dollar-for-dollar matching grant program. In {{his senior year}} and as the undergraduate trustee on the University's Board of Trustees, he instituted a $15-per-semester student fee increase to be matched by the federal grant, with monies to be earmarked for the university's endowment. The fees were expected to total nearly $300,000 per semester. The estimate was conservative {{in the sense that}} it only assumes the fees from slightly more than 75% of the 12,000 students. The four-year totals would approach a $2.4million addition to the endowment. Reed earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1991. He earned his juris doctorate from Howard University School of Law in 1995. In 2002 Reed was appointed as the youngest General Trustee to serve on Howard's Board of Trustees and continues to serve on that board.|$|E
5|$|Balaji Sadasivan {{was born}} on 11 July 1955 in Singapore, the son of Indian immigrants. A student at Raffles Institution, Siglap Secondary School (1969–1971) and National Junior College (1972–1973), he {{subsequently}} studied medicine at the University of Singapore. In his second year, he won an essay competition organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and received the opportunity to attend a healthcare workshop in Minamata, Japan, where <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the devastating effects of Minamata disease, a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. This led him to specialise in neurosurgery later on, which was not a popular discipline at the time. In 1979, Sadasivan graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), {{and two years later}} embarked on further studies at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S.) in 1984. He trained at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between 1985 and 1990, obtaining a diploma from the American Board of Neurology Surgery and becoming a fellow at Harvard University in 1990. He also worked at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard, and at the Children's Hospital Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1997, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. (Hons.)) from the University of London.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Shackleton {{returned}} to New Zealand from the Ross Sea, having {{picked up the}} survivors of the winter party, Worsley travelled to England aboard the RMS Makura. As an RNR officer, he wanted to join in the fight against Imperial Germany. After arriving in Liverpool, {{he made his way to}} London and was quickly assigned to HMS Pembroke, the shore station at Chatham. Here, for three months, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> fighting U-boats, which were causing considerable damage to supply convoys crossing the Atlantic. Several tactics were deployed against the U-boats. One of these involved the use of Q-ships, small merchant vessels fitted out with hidden armament that could be deployed against any U-boats which surfaced and approached the seemingly unarmed ship. Another tactic was the use of P-boats, which were patrol boats that carried out convoy escort duties and anti-submarine work. The P-boats had a distinctive profile, and their effectiveness wore off as U-boat commanders began to recognise and avoid them. The later built P-boats were designed with a more conventional profile approximating that of a merchant ship, and thus were similar to Q-ships.|$|E
