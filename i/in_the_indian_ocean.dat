5|$|Authorities {{classify}} {{the species}} into {{three or four}} subspecies: B. m. musculus, the northern blue whale consisting of the North Atlantic and North Pacific populations, B. m. intermedia, the southern blue whale of the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda, the pygmy blue whale found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and South Pacific, and the more problematic B. m. indica, the great Indian rorqual, which is also found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and, although described earlier, may be the same subspecies as B. m. brevicauda.|$|E

5|$|Long and slender, {{the blue}} whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and {{somewhat}} lighter underneath. There {{are at least}} three distinct subspecies: B. m. musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia of the Southern Ocean and B. m. brevicauda (also known as the pygmy blue whale) found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and South Pacific Ocean. B. m. indica, found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the world}} wars, Royal Navy ships were painted dark gray in the Home Fleet, light gray in the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas, and white <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and western Pacific.

5|$|Culturally, the {{campaign}} captured the public imagination in Britain and France: the Battle of Grand Port {{is the only}} naval battle that appears on the Arc de Triomphe, while in Britain Rowley and Bertie were both made baronets for their services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that {{followed}} them, British dominance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> was repeatedly {{challenged by the}} depredations of French vessels sailing from the isolated and well protected French colonies of Réunion (later Île Bonaparte) and Île de France. Although French Navy cruisers were periodically stationed on the islands, the majority of ships that preyed on British commerce from the islands were privateers, independently funded armed ships issued with letters of marque giving them permission to attack military and civilian ships belonging to the enemies of France. French naval strategy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> was so reliant on privateers that entire squadrons developed, including a powerful force under the wealthy privateer captain Robert Surcouf. Although most privateers were small, carrying only a few cannon, some could be very large, rivalling professional warships in size. One such ship was the Bellone, which carried 34 guns, a crew of nearly 200 men and was commanded by Captain Jacques François Perroud, a notorious privateer who had caused significant damage to British trade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> In 1803, Perroud had gained significant notoriety with the capture of the valuable East Indiaman Lord Nelson on 14 August 1803.|$|E

5|$|In 1514, Sultan Selim I (1512–1520) {{successfully}} {{expanded the}} empire's {{southern and eastern}} borders by defeating Shah Ismail I of the Safavid dynasty in the Battle of Chaldiran. In 1517, Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into Algeria and Egypt, and created a naval presence in the Red Sea. Subsequently, a contest started between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires to become the dominant sea power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> {{with a number of}} naval battles in the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. The Portuguese presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> was perceived {{as a threat to the}} Ottoman monopoly over the ancient trade routes between East Asia and Western Europe. Despite the increasingly prominent European presence, the Ottoman Empire's trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, the Japanese Combined Fleet {{withdrew from}} its base at Truk and was divided between Palau and Singapore. The {{appearance}} of a powerful Japanese squadron at Singapore concerned the Allies, as it was feared that this force could potentially conduct raids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and against Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Robert Surcouf (12 December 1773– 8 July 1827) was a French {{privateer}} who operated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> between 1789 and 1801, {{and again}} from 1807 to 1808, capturing over 40 prizes, while amassing a large fortune as a ship-owner, from both privateering and commerce.|$|E

5|$|The Invasion of Isle de France was a {{complicated}} but successful amphibious operation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> launched in November 1810 during the Napoleonic Wars. During the operation, a substantial British military force was landed by the Royal Navy at Grand Baie on Isle de France (now Mauritius). Marching inland against weak French opposition, the British force {{was able to}} overwhelm the defenders {{in a series of}} minor engagements, culminating in the capture of the island's capital Port Napoleon and the surrender of Charles Decaen, the French governor. The surrender eliminated the last French territory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and among the military equipment captured were five French Navy frigates and 209 heavy cannon. Isle de France was retained by Britain {{at the end of the}} war under the name of Mauritius and remained part of the British Empire until 1968.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Pułaski was initially used as a French and, after the Fall of France, a British troopship. Pułaski sailed variously in the North Atlantic, between African ports, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> In 1946, the ship's name was changed to Empire Penryn and continued trooping duties under the management of Lamport & Holt. She was scrapped in 1949 at Blyth.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sakonju's fears, the Allies {{were not}} {{immediately}} {{aware of the}} attack on Behar. Her distress signal had been picked up by only a single Allied merchant ship, which did not report it until she arrived at Fremantle on 17March. In the meantime, Somerville had decided on 16March that surface raiders no longer posed a threat to shipping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and allowed Allied vessels to resume their normal routing.|$|E

5|$|Direct trade {{links between}} the Mediterranean lands and India had been {{established}} in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Greek navigators learned to use the regular pattern of the monsoon winds for their trade voyages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The lively sea trade in Roman times is confirmed by the excavation of large deposits of Roman coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to Roman communities {{have been identified in}} India and Sri Lanka along the route used by the Roman mission. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports of Roman Egypt to India suggests that Roman commercial activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and Southeast Asia declined heavily with the Antonine Plague of 166 AD, the same year as the first Roman embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.|$|E
5|$|Following a short refit, Sydney sailed for Fremantle on 27 February, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to escort and patrol tasks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> This primarily involved meeting convoys off the southern Australian coast and escorting them on the next leg of their journey, either westbound to the Middle East and Europe, or northwards to the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5|$|Hume has {{suggested}} that the Mascarene parrots have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E
