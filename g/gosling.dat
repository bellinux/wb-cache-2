40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine the riboflavin, pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, and choline requirements of young Embden geese fed purified diets. <b>Goslings</b> fed diets deficient in either riboflavin, pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, or choline grew poorly. Feeding a panthothenic acid-deficient diet resulted in 100 % mortality. <b>Goslings</b> fed diets containing 530 mg/kg of choline or less developed perosis. Under the conditions of these experiments it was found that: 1) <b>goslings</b> require no more than 3. 84 mg/kg of riboflavin and 31. 2 mg/kg of nicotinic acid in the diet for rapid growth and normal development, 2) the pantothenic acid requirement of <b>goslings</b> {{is no more than}} 12. 6 mg/kg of diet, and 3) a dietary choline level of 1530 mg/kg is adequate for both the prevention of perosis and rapid growth of <b>goslings.</b> The levels of vitamins found to support normal growth and development of <b>goslings</b> appear to be similar to requirements of other species that have been examined...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} of four-week duration {{were conducted}} to investigate the effect of caecectomy on the intestinal characteristics, body weight gain and gas production in the caeca of White Roman <b>goslings.</b> In experiment I, forty eight 2 -wk-old female <b>goslings</b> with similar body weight were randomly divided into four treatments: sham (SHAM), left side caecum removed (LSCR), right side caecum removed (RSCR) and both caeca removed (CAECECTOMY). Smimilarly, experiment II was conducted with twelve 5 -wk-old male <b>goslings</b> in two treatments: SHAM and CAECECTOMY. Free choice water with ad libitum feed was provided during experiment. At the end of experiment I, <b>goslings</b> were sacrificed and gut length and weight were determined. At 7 and 9 wks of age, birds in experiment II were subjected to respiration calorimetry studies. In both experiments, final body weights were not affected by caecectomy. Results of experiment I indicated that caecectomy did not significantly affect the relative weight (g/ 100 g BW) of gizzard, small intestine, rectum and colon (p> 0. 05); however, the relative length of colon and rectum did increase (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{susceptibility}} of 4 bird species (ducklings, <b>goslings,</b> turkeys and chickens) to a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H 6 N 2 subtype) and to evaluate the corresponding virus shedding periods. For that purpose, 9 turkey poults, 9 chickens, 7 ducklings and 6 <b>goslings,</b> were experimentally infected by the H 6 N 2 virus (105 ELD 50) by intravenous route whereas another 16 birds (2 ducklings, 2 <b>goslings,</b> 6 turkey poults and 6 chickens) were not infected and served as negative controls. The virus re-isolation method was performed on cloacal and oropharyngeal samples collected before inoculation and 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days after inoculation. The virus was re-isolated from all ducklings (100 %), 67 % of <b>goslings,</b> 56 % of turkey poults and from 33 % of chickens essentially during the first 10 days after virus inoculation. The proportion of positive cloacal samples was higher compared to that of oropharyngeal samples (positive cloacal samples were 72 %, 83 %, 80 % and 87 % from all positive samples in ducklings, turkey poults, chickens and <b>goslings</b> respectively). The mean virus shedding periods determined from cloacal samples were 10. 6, 6. 6, 5. 4 and 4. 3 days in ducklings, turkeys, <b>goslings</b> and chickens respectively. The longest periods observed in this study were 21 (ducklings), 10 (turkeys and <b>goslings)</b> and 5 days (chickens). The oropharyngeal virus shedding periods were shorter in the 4 species. Consequently, cloacal samples may be more relevant to exploring spontaneous avian influenza cases...|$|R
40|$|In many birds, {{body size}} at {{fledging}} {{is assumed to}} predict accurately the probability of subsequent survival, and size at fledging is often used as a proxy variable in analyses attempting to assess the pattern of natural selection on body size. However, in some species, size at fledging can vary significantly {{as a function of}} variation in the environmental component of growth. Such developmental plasticity has been demonstrated in several species of Arctic-breeding geese. In many cases, slower growth and reduced size at fledging has been suggested as the most parsimonious explanation for reduced post-fledging survival in <b>goslings</b> reared under poor environmental conditions. However, simply quantifying a relationship between mean size at fledging and mean survival rate (Francis et al., 1992) may obscure the pattern of selection on the interaction of the genetic and environmental components of growth. The hypothesis that selection operates on the environmental component of body size at fledging, rather than the genetic component of size per se, was tested using data from the long-term study of Lesser Snow Geese (Anser c. caerulescens) breeding at La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba, Canada. Using data from female <b>goslings</b> measured at fledging, post-fledging survival rates were estimated using combined live encounter and dead recovery data (Burnham, 1993). To control for the covariation between growth and environmental factors, survival rates were constrained to be functions of individual covariation of size at fledging, and various measures of the timing of hatch; in all Arctic-breeding geese studied to date, late hatching <b>goslings</b> grow significantly more slowly than do early hatching <b>goslings.</b> The slower growth of late-hatching <b>goslings</b> has been demonstrated to reflect systematic changes in the environmental component of growth, and thus controlling for hatch date controls for a significant proportion of variation in the environmental component of growth. The relationship between size at fledging, hatch date and survival was found to be significantly non-linear; among early hatching <b>goslings,</b> there was little indication of significant differences in survival rate among large and small <b>goslings.</b> However, with increasingly later hatch dates, there was progressively greater mortality selection against smaller, slower growing <b>goslings</b> in most years. This would appear to suggest that body size matters, but not absolutely; small size leads to reduced survival for late-hatching <b>goslings</b> only at La Pe´rouse Bay. Since {{at least some of the}} variation in size among <b>goslings</b> for a given hatch date reflects genetic differences, this suggests selection may favour larger size at fledging, albeit only among late-hatching <b>goslings.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} parental behavior and brood size, {{and the consequences of}} this relationship in terms of parental fitness (timing of molt and body mass at onset of molt in same year as breeding, and probability of return, timing of breeding, and clutch size in following year) in the precocial Lesser Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) at La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba. The percentage of time parent birds spent feeding decreased with increasing brood size, from greater than 90 % for pairs without offspring to less than 80 % for broods of seven and eight. The number of vigilant (head-up) postures per minute by parental birds increased up to brood size five and then decreased. Parental females also spent significantly less total time feeding and more time in alert behavior as brood size increased from one to five <b>goslings.</b> The relationship between parental behavior and brood size remained significant for small brood sizes even if pairs without <b>goslings</b> were excluded (range one to five <b>goslings),</b> and this relationship was independent of female age. Males (but not females) rearing larger broods molted later than those with smaller broods, although only by one to two days. This was directly related to rearing of offspring; in both sexes, birds that hatched four or more <b>goslings</b> and subsequently lost one or more <b>goslings</b> during brood-rearing molted significantly earlier than birds rearing all of their hatched <b>goslings.</b> There was no relationship, in either sex, between number of <b>goslings</b> reared and the adult mass five to six weeks posthatch (molt) in the same year, or probability of return or timing of breeding (laying date or hatch date) in the following year. Partners of males that reared the largest number of <b>goslings</b> laid significantly larger clutch sizes the following year, suggesting that these were "better-quality" pairs.
