Synthesizers and [...] "stuttering" [...] drums are {{featured}} at the pre-chorus, [...] "Don't even tell me your name/ All I {{need to know is}} whose place/ And let's get walking". Chris Martins of Spin commented that the lyrics actually means, [...] "The <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the tank, congress can't agree on anything, war and natural disasters consume us ... so, what else can we do but make love?" [...] At the second verse, she tells her lover, [...] "I am a freak, I'm disturbed/ So come on and give me your worst/ We're moving faster than slow/ If you don't know where to go/ I'll finish off on my own". The four-on-the-floor refrain has Aguilera [...] "flaunting her famous pipes" [...] on the chorus, [...] "All I wanna do is love your body/ Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it". In a track-by-track review for Lotus, Billboard critic Andrew Hampp thought that the song [...] "doesn't peak" [...] until Aguilera [...] "growls", [...] "I think you already know my name" [...] at the bridge. According to Jason Lipshutz from Billboard and Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the lyrics of [...] "Your Body" [...] are similar to Aguilera's previous single [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002).|$|E
