We propose an agent-based solution that allows the caller to present both identity and intentions. The scheme uses a metaphor of business cards to make the calling and screening procedures easy to understand. 1 Introduction The problem of screening and forwarding incoming calls is mainly a problem of lack of knowledge. In an ordinary signaling system (e. g., SS 7), next to nothing is known about the callers identity and intentions. A call center system today would have to rely on the caller's telephone number for the identity, and would have to ask questions ("if you want to speak to an operator please press 0 ") for figuring out the intentions of the caller. All computer support is on the called party's side and very little suppo [...] ...|$|E
40|$|To assess Soxhlet {{extraction}} as {{a method}} for quantifying fatty acids (FA) of microalgae, crude lipid, FA content from Soxhlet extracts and FA content from in situ transesterification (ISTE) were compared. In most cases, gravimetric lipid content was considerably greater (up to sevenfold) than the FA content of the crude lipid extract. FA content from Soxhlet lipid extraction and ISTE were similar in 12 / 18 samples, whereas in 6 / 18 samples, total FA content from Soxhlet extraction was less than the ISTE procedure. Re-extraction of residual biomass from Soxhlet extraction with ISTE liberated a quantity of FA equivalent to this discrepancy. Employing acid hydrolysis before Soxhlet extraction yielded FA content roughly equivalent to ISTE, indicating that acidic conditions of ISTE are responsible for this observed greater recovery of FA. While crude lipid derived from Soxhlet extraction was not a useful proxy for FA content for the species tested, it is effective in most strains at extracting total saponifiable lipid. Lipid class analysis showed the source of FA was primarily polar lipids in most samples (12 / 18 lipid extracts contained 15 %). This investigation confirms the usefulness of ISTE, reveals limitations of gravimetric methods for projecting biodiesel potential of microalgae, and reinforces the need for <b>intelligent</b> <b>screening</b> using both FA and lipid class analysis.

40|$|The <b>intelligent</b> <b>screen</b> reader system observes a user¡¯s keystrokes {{when he or}} she is {{performing}} tasks, and infers an underlying plan structure. The system then generates an optimized script that allows the user to perform the same task more efficiently in the future. The <b>intelligent</b> <b>screen</b> reader system is particularly beneficial for visually impaired computer users. The JAWS for Windows screen reader was chosen for this prototype, since the JAWS scripting language provides flexibility to users for customizing their tasks within a specific application. The JAWS macro recorder, developed by Freedom Scientific Inc., records all the user¡¯s actions. Automated Synthesis of Plan Recognition Networks (ASPRN), developed by Intelligent Reasoning Systems Inc., takes a plan or a script representation as input and outputs a specially-constructed belief network that supports plan recognition. The Script Generation Interface, developed by the University of Pittsburgh, allows users to modify the actions recorded by the JAWS macro recorder and generate an optimized script. Development of the SGI involved integrating the SGI with the JAWS macro recorder, integrating the SGI with ASPRN, and implementing the SGI user interface. Preliminary usability testing involving the <b>intelligent</b> <b>screen</b> reader system was conducted with visually impaired users. Within limited actions and tasks, the results are satisfactory. Users felt the SGI was easy to learn and operate, and that it was efficient to create useful scripts with the <b>intelligent</b> <b>screen</b> reader system.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the complex {{metabolic}} {{effects of a}} rag 8 genetic mutation performed on Kluyveromyces lactis yeast cells is investigated with a specific, ‘information-rich’ analytical approach: differential NMR metabolomics. The use of such NMR-based metabolite proﬁling techniques {{form the basis for}} <b>intelligent</b> <b>screening</b> strategies to exploit the biotechnological potentials of yeasts because the rational improvement of K. lactis strains for the production of primary and secondary metabolites requires, first of all, a quantitative understanding of their metabolism, allowing the development of more efficient cell factories through metabolic engineering. Wild-type and mutant cell lines metabolomes are compared each other: through the application of multivariate statistical models a metabolic network is built on statistical basis, describing the metabolite phenotype of the rag 8 mutant K. lactis strain. However, the measurement and interpretation of such in vivo metabolite dynamics at a systems level is inherently difficult. Indeed, decipher the intricate web of metabolic networks of a complex system and, particularly, infer something about gene functions only based on metabolite proﬁling, {{is one of the greatest}} challenges in molecular biology which cannot be resolved fully by any metabolomic tool. To resolve and improve the metabolic network description, an extension of the 13 C labeling protocol for investigating eukaryotic cellular systems is applied in this work. The resulting labeling pattern of each metabolite reﬂects the relative importance of the alternative pathways within the metabolic network. This observation underscores the need for acquiring 13 C-isotopomer data, instead of just steady-state concentrations, to deduce meaningful relationships between metabolites in related pathways. It was displayed that differential 13 C-labeled isotopomer proﬁles and abundance can serve as a ﬁngerprint of the metabolic networks activity and could reﬂects both qualitative and quantitative differences in the metabolic pathways that lead to the synthesis of each metabolite. In this way, the role of several metabolic processes could be defined, allowing the exploration of metabolic pathways, leading to qualitative information on the links between labeled precursors and their products and quantitative information on metabolic ﬂuxes. It was demonstrated that in yeasts it has been possible to make signiﬁcant progress in the analysis of carbon metabolism by using 13 C NMR to measure metabolic ﬂuxes in genetically modiﬁed cells. This approach, so, can be used for functional genomic analysis of yeast mutants providing detailed quantitative information for the understanding of a biological network useful to identify the key genes for strain improvement. Moreover, an <b>intelligent</b> <b>screening</b> of the large unexploited fungal biodiversity opens the possibility to the development and use of directed genetic modiﬁcations of cell factories for the production of novel compounds, that are otherwise difficult to produce by chemical synthesis, and also of new, efficient and environmentally friendly bioprocesses. These possibilities open the way to many comparative functional studies and will certainly change the respective importance of the different yeasts, building up new model yeasts for specific studies...|$|E
40|$|Megafauna play an {{important}} role in benthic ecosystem function and are sensitive indicators of environmental change. Non-invasive monitoring of benthic communities can be accomplished by seafloor imaging. However, manual quantification of megafauna in images is labor-intensive and therefore, this organism size class is often neglected in ecosystem studies. Automated image analysis has been proposed as a possible approach to such analysis, but the heterogeneity of megafaunal communities poses a non-trivial challenge for such automated techniques. Here, the potential of a generalized object detection architecture, referred to as iSIS (<b>intelligent</b> <b>Screening</b> of underwater Image Sequences), for the quantification of a heterogenous group of megafauna taxa is investigated. The iSIS system is tuned for a particular image sequence (i. e. a transect) using a small subset of the images, in which megafauna taxa positions were previously marked by an expert. To investigate the potential of iSIS and compare its results with those obtained from human experts, a group of eight different taxa from one camera transect of seafloor images taken at the Arctic deep-sea observatory HAUSGARTEN is used. The results show that inter- and intra-observer agreements of human experts exhibit considerable variation between the species, with a similar degree of variation apparent in the automatically derived results obtained by iSIS. Whilst some taxa (e. g. Bathycrinus stalks, Kolga hyalina, small white sea anemone) were well detected by iSIS (i. e. overall Sensitivity: 87 %, overall Positive Predictive Value: 67 %), some taxa such as the small sea cucumber Elpidia hecker...|$|E

40|$|A {{state-based}} reasoning {{approach to}} trend recognition and failure prediction for the Altitude Determination, and Control System (ADCS) of the Space Station Freedom (SSF) is described. The problem domain {{is characterized by}} features (e. g., trends and impending failures) that develop over a variety of time spans, anywhere from several minutes to several years. Our state-based reasoning approach, coupled with <b>intelligent</b> data <b>screening,</b> allows features to be tracked as they develop in a time-dependent manner. That is, each state machine {{has the ability to}} encode a time frame for the feature it detects. As features are detected, they are recorded and can be used as input to other state machines, creating a hierarchical feature recognition scheme. Furthermore, each machine can operate independently of the others, allowing simultaneous tracking of features. State-based reasoning was implemented in the trend recognition and the prognostic modules of a prototype Space Station Freedom Maintenance and Diagnostic System (SSFMDS) developed at Honeywell's Systems and Research Center...|$|R

However, traditional stores generally cannot fully satisfy customer needs because of difficulties in locating target products, out-of-stocks, a lack of professional assistance for product selection, and long waiting for payments. Therefore, this paper proposes an item-level RFID-enabled retail store management system for relatively high-end apparel products to provide customers with more leisure, interaction for product information, and automatic apparel collocation to promote sales during shopping.

40|$|Use of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) {{for design}} {{validation}} in a product development cycle has been pursued as a state-of-the-art strategy {{to compete in}} the global competition. However, the combined use of CAD and CAE is still impractical to solve non-linear design problems that are multi-disciplinary in nature, even allowing for the speed offered by the advancement of computer computation.

The optimization of the ratio between opaque and transparent closure of the south facade, which acts as the collector of the contributions of solar radiation, combined {{with the use of}} automated solar shading helps to reduce energy consumption for heating in winter and greatly improve the thermal and lighting comfort indoor. The integrated dynamic simulation was conducted with the aid of tools for physical-technical modeling as Design Builder and it has allowed to quantify the important contribution to the total annual energy saving of the building through the use of <b>intelligent</b> solar <b>screens.</b> The objective is the design of a component with innovative technical features that has the ability to be integrated in an automated control system used at the larger building scale.

40|$|The Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) {{technology}} is {{core of the}} Internet of Things (IOT), essential for development of intelligence-rich businesses. Item-level RFID facilitates real-time track-and-trace, and thus complete visibility, of individual product items that greatly improves source-to-store supply chain management. A number of pilot projects conducted in recent years, including production tracking, pack and ship verification for logistics services, warehouse management, product anti-counterfeiting, and retail business enhancement, have demonstrated huge potential of RFID in elevating the overall efficiency of supply chains to levels not previously practicable. This research addresses some main issues of item-level RFID for retail store management of relatively high-end apparel products. An approach for integrating RFID with major in-store systems, such as inventory, on-shelf replenishment and POS, is studied. Recently, customers’ purchase decisions for high-end products {{have been found to}} shift from a conventionally rational view to an emotional and experiential one. Retailers are now expected to foster personalized customer shopping experience that warrants provision of relevant product information to empower such new pattern of customers’ purchase decisions.

40|$|Aim of study: Knowledge Management (KM) tools {{facilitate}} {{the implementation of}} knowledge processes by identifying, creating, structuring, and sharing knowledge through use of information technology {{in order to improve}} decision-making. In this contribution, we review the way in which KM tools and techniques are used in forest management, and categorize a selected set of them according to their contribution to support decision makers in the phases of problem identification, problem modelling, and problem solving. Material and Methods : Existing examples of cognitive mapping tools, web portals, workflow systems, best practices, and expert systems as well as <b>intelligent</b> agents are <b>screened</b> for their applicability and use in the context of decision support for sustainable forest management. Evidence from scientific literature and case studies is utilized to evaluate the contribution of the different KM tools to support problem identification, problem modelling, and problem solving. Main results : Intelligent agents, expert systems and cognitive maps support all phases of the forest planning process strongly. Web based tools have good potential to support participatory forest planning. Based on the needs of forest management decision support and the thus-far underutilized capabilities of KM tools it becomes evident that future decision analysis will have to consider the use of KM more intensively.   Research highlights : As the problem-solving process is the vehicle for connecting both knowledge and decision making performance, the next generation of DSS will need to better encapsulate practices that enhance and promote knowledge management. Web based tools will substitute desktop applications by utilizing various model libraries on the internet.
