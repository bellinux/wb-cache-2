In the year 1937–38 Moyle was Chairman of the National Joint Council for Local Authorities Non-Trading Services.

25|$|The LB greatly {{encouraged}} commuters into London {{by reducing}} the prices of season tickets and introducing special workmen's trains <b>for</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> in 1870. This ultimately changed {{the character of the}} railway and had a profound influence upon its motive power policy and passenger train services. In the 1870s and 1880s it led to the building of new standard tank engine classes such as the Terrier and D1 classes under William Stroudley. R. J. Billinton replaced these with the D3, E3, E4, and E5 classes designed for London suburban services, during the 1890s. When steam locomotives became unable to cope with the increased suburban traffic and competition from electric trams in the early twentieth century, it resulted in the electrification of the London suburban network.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} never on a firm {{financial}} footing {{and the situation}} worsened with {{the rising cost of}} coal and the effects of the First World War; additionally competition from Dymond's Horse Drawn Coach and later Motor Buses took much of the traffic off the line even in summer. Few passengers from Bideford Station at East-The-Water would trouble to change again for the B,WH,R at the Quay when alternative transport would take them straight to their destination for less money. Trains did not run at times suitable <b>for</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> and freight, apart from Westward Ho! Gasworks, had always been a minor consideration. The line could not even manage the ½% dividend of the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway and eventual closure was inevitable. In 1917, the Minister of Munitions requisitioned the line by Government Order for War Service and it duly closed on 28 March of that year. Grenville and Torridge were loaded onto the captured German freighter Gotterdammerung for duty in France, but the ship was torpedoed off the north Cornwall Coast and sank. The wreck was discovered in 2001 and the locomotives may be recovered for restoration as static displays. Kingsley was scrapped in 1937 after having been sold by the Ministry of Munitions to the National Smelting Company.|$|E

In 1990 almost 3. 4 percent of the U. K. adult population suffered from a LTI caused solely by their working conditions. This paper provides the first estimates of compensating differentials for a broad measure of work-related LTI.

Reports of cannibalism began to appear in the winter of 1941-1942, after all birds, rats and pets were eaten by survivors and meat patties, made from minced human flesh went on sale in the 'Haymarket' in November 1941. Many bodies brought to cemeteries in the city were missing parts. Starvation-level food rationing was eased by new vegetable gardens that covered most open ground in the city by 1942.|$|E

5000|$|By the mid-1980s, {{agriculture}}'s {{share of}} GNP in Jordan {{was only about}} 6 percent. In contrast, in Syria and Egypt agriculture constituted more than 20 percent of GNP in the 1980s. [...] Several factors contributed to this downward trend. With the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Jordan lost prime farmland that Jordan had been occupying since 1949. Starting in the mid-1970s, Jordanian labor emigration also hastened the decline of agriculture. Many Jordanian peasants abandoned farming to take more lucrative jobs abroad, sometimes as soldiers in the armies of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states or in service industries in those countries. Others migrated to cities where labor shortages had led to higher wages <b>for</b> <b>manual</b> <b>workers.</b> Deserted farms were built over as urban areas expanded. As the Jordanian government drove up interest rates to attract remittance income, farm credit tightened, which {{made it difficult for}} farmers to buy seed and fertilizer.|$|E
