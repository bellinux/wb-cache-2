5|$|Property {{losses from}} the fire can be {{accounted}} for with relative certainty as detailed surveys were made immediately afterwards. City surveyor Søren Balle submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen <b>finished</b> <b>a</b> second, made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728. The {{differences between the two}} surveys are limited to the extent of the damages on 43lots, so it is fairly certain that 1,227lots containing about 1,600buildings were lost in flames. All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4,500lots (per the cadastre of 1699), so about 28% of the lots were lost. For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47%.|$|E
