25|$|In King Henry III's long reign (1216–1272) the short-cross penny {{continued}} in use until 1247. By then, however, {{through no fault}} of the moneyers' there was a problem in that many of the coins in circulation were underweight. This was caused by the illegal practice of clipping silver {{off the edge of the}} coin, which was made easier by the cross on the reverse not extending to the rim thus giving people no clear indication of exactly how big the coin was supposed to be. In 1247 therefore, a new long-cross penny replaced the short-cross coin, which made it more obvious when the coin had been clipped. Apart from the change in the size of the cross, the rest of the design did not substantially change, and the long cross made it easy to cut the coin into <b>halves</b> <b>or</b> <b>quarters</b> for change. Because of the introduction of the new coinage it was necessary to reopen many of the old mints to supply sufficient coins. Short-cross Henry III pennies were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, London, Winchester and York.

40|$|The current paper {{presents}} a preliminary {{study on the}} production and perception of syllabic tones of Vietnamese. A speech corpus consisting of fifty-two six-syllable sequences with various combinations of tones was uttered by two speakers of Standard Vietnamese, one male and one female. The corpus was labeled on the syllabic level and analyzed using the Fujisaki model. Results show that the six tone types basically fall into two categories: Level, rising, curve and falling tone can be accurately modeled by using tone commands of positive or negative polarity. The so-called drop and broken tones, however, obviously require a special control causing creaky voice and in cases a very fast drop in F 0 leading to temporary F 0 <b>halving</b> <b>or</b> even <b>quartering.</b> In contrast to the drop tone, the broken tone exhibits an F 0 rise and hence a positive tone command right after the creak occurs. Further observations suggest that drop and broken tone do not only differ from the other four tones {{with respect to their}} F 0 characteristics, but also as to their much tenser articulation. A perception experiment performed with natural and resynthesized stimuli shows, inter alia, that tone 4 is most prone to confusion and that tone 6 obviously requires tense articulation as well as vocal fry to be identified reliably. 1...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Ness has {{developed}} a continuously transposing bi- or poly-tonal harmonic system in which all notes of a chord act as the dominant to the successive chord - a system that through its inherent well-arranged structure lends itself to improvisation. Gradually, Ness has also combined this system with micro tonality - a technique that dictates that intervals consisting of uneven numbers of semitones are either <b>halved</b> <b>or</b> saturated with <b>quarter</b> tones. A highly characteristic interval employed by Ness, is one that is also found in Arab as well as Norwegian folk music; the quarter tone {{in the middle of a}} minor third. Ness has also used a similar approach with other “uneven numbered” intervals; fourths, fifths, major sixths, major sevenths, minor ninths and the minor eleventh. This could lead to each chord having two or more spectral centres of gravity, but the micro-tonal techniques are also frequently employed to symmetrical chords as tonal colorization or as sonorous grit (these chords are commonly designated “pickled cucumber” by the composer).|$|R

6000|$|III. After our {{previous}} experience, {{the impossibility of}} retaining [...] both metals in the coinage together, on equal terms, now came to [...] be generally recognized, and was accepted by Congress in the [...] legislation of 1853. This act made no further changes intended to [...] adapt the mint to the market ratios, but remained satisfied with [...] the gold circulation. But hitherto no regard had {{been paid to the}} [...] principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based, as explained by [...] Mr. Mill in the last section (§ 2). The act of 1853, while [...] acquiescing in the single gold standard, had for its purpose the [...] readjustment of the subsidiary coins, which, together with silver [...] dollar-pieces, had all gone out of circulation. Before this, two [...] <b>halves,</b> four <b>quarters,</b> <b>or</b> ten dimes contained the same quantity of [...] pure silver as the dollar-piece (371-¼ grains); therefore, when it [...] became profitable to withdraw the dollar-pieces and substitute [...] gold, it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two <b>halves</b> <b>or</b> [...] four <b>quarters</b> in silver. For this reason all the subsidiary silver [...] had gone out of circulation, and there was no “small change” in [...] the country. The legislation of 1853 rectified this error: (1) by [...] reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollar’s worth of [...] subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains. By making so much less an amount [...] of silver equal to a dollar of small coins, it was more valuable [...] in that shape than as bullion, and {{there was no reason for}} melting [...] it, or withdrawing it (since even if gold and silver changed [...] considerably in their relative values, 345.6 grains of silver [...] could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a [...] gold dollar, when 371-¼ grains were worth only 104 cents of the [...] gold dollar); (2) this over-valuation of silver in subsidiary coin [...] would cause a great flow of silver to the mint, since silver would [...] be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion; but this was [...] prevented by the provision (section 4 of the act of 1853) that the [...] amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the [...] discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury; and, (3) in order [...] that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes [...] other than for effecting change, its legal-tender power was [...] restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars. This system, a [...] single gold standard for large, and silver for small, payments, [...] continued without question, and with great convenience, until the [...] days of the war, when paper money (1862-1879) drove out (by its [...] cheapness, again) both gold and silver. Paper was far cheaper than [...] the cheapest of the two metals.|$|R

It was long considered that the first silver farthings were produced in the reign of King Edward I (1272-1307).

The production of farthings was authorised by the Patent Rolls of 1222, but actual examples have only recently been discovered.

Chemical pretreatment consisted of dipping cranberries into solution of ethyl oleate and sodium hydroxide at different temperatures, and process times. Mechanical pretreatment was cutting of berries into <b>halves</b> <b>or</b> <b>quarters.</b> Tested parameters for osmotic dehydration were the duration of process, osmotic agent type and its concentration. Once the appropriate pretreatment was selected, cranberries were subjected to hybrid drying under subatmospheric pressure and using microwaves as an energy source. Evaluated process parameters were microwave power level, microwave power mode, and the operating pressure of process. This drying method showed good potential, but in order to verify the results obtained, it was compared to microwave/convective drying. Slight advantages of the microwave/vacuum process over the microwave/convective process were apparent in almost all product quality parameters, as well as in process efficiency...|$|E
