5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} cerebellum plays {{an essential role in}} some types of motor learning. The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an <b>error</b> <b>signal,</b> and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.|$|E
25|$|A phase {{detector}} compares two input signals and produces an <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> which {{is proportional to}} their phase difference. The <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> is then low-pass filtered and used to drive a VCO which creates an output phase. The output is fed through an optional divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output phase drifts, the <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> will increase, driving the VCO phase {{in the opposite direction}} so as to reduce the error.Thus the output phase is locked to the phase at the other input. This input is called the reference.|$|E
25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{active noise control}} {{strategies}} for noise barriers are presented {{which are based on}} the use of sensors near the noise barrier. Virtual <b>error</b> <b>signals</b> are derived from these near-field sensor signals such that reductions of the far-field sound pressure are obtained with the active system. The performance of the control algorithm is compared for far-field <b>error</b> <b>signals,</b> near-field <b>error</b> <b>signals,</b> and virtual far-field <b>error</b> <b>signals,</b> with and without additional reference sensors. The virtual <b>error</b> <b>signals</b> are obtained by using separate transfer functions for the primary sources and secondary sources. These separate transfer functions are determined {{in such a way that}} the necessity of the separation of the virtual sensors for the primary field and for the secondary field can be judged by direct comparison. The systems are evaluated for independent broadband and randomly positioned primary sources, changing source spectra, moving sources, and configurations involving a nonvanishing wind speed...|$|R

25|$|ROs {{produced}} by the General Electric are used in AC voltage stabilizers. These stabilizers are based on an autotransformer that is controlled by two sets of thyristor stacks. The incandescent lamp of RO is protected by a ballast resistor and {{is connected to the}} AC output. The lamp averages the output voltage, suppressing spikes and sine distortions originating from the main. The photoresistor of the RO is included in one arm of the measuring bridge, generating the <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> for the feedback loop.|$|E
25|$|Suppose the {{reference}} signal is 100kHz, and the divider can be preset to any value between 1 and 100. The <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> {{produced by the}} comparator will only be zero when {{the output of the}} divider is also 100kHz. For this to be the case, the VCO must run at a frequency which is 100kHz x the divider count value. Thus it will produce an output of 100kHz for a count of 1, 200kHz for a count of 2, 1MHz for a count of 10 and so on. Note that only whole multiples of {{the reference}} frequency can be obtained with the simplest integer N dividers. Fractional N dividers are readily available.|$|E
25|$|Brainard & Doupe (2000) posit a {{model in}} which LMAN (of the {{anterior}} forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an instructive <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to correct or modify the motor program for song production. In their study, Brainard & Doupe (2000) showed that while deafening adult birds led {{to the loss of}} song stereotypy due to altered auditory feedback and non-adaptive modification of the motor program, lesioning LMAN in the anterior forebrain pathway of adult birds that had been deafened led to the stabilization of song (LMAN lesions in deafened birds prevented any further deterioration in syllable production and song structure).|$|E

40|$|Arbitrary {{admixtures}} of amplitude and phase modulated {{light can}} be used to generate linear, null-crossing <b>error</b> <b>signals</b> for locking Fabry-Perot cavities that are detuned from resonance by arbitrary amounts. Unfortunately, no commercially available device is capable of producing the desired arbitrary combinations of amplitude and phase modulation. This work pertains to construction and characterization of a Universally Tunable Modulator (UTM), capable of producing just such combinations. The UTM was prototyped by modifying a New Focus 4104 amplitude modulator. With the application of feedback control of fabry-perot cavities in mind, the UTM was characterized using a test cavity to measure <b>error</b> <b>signals.</b> The resulting <b>error</b> <b>signals</b> were then fit to the calculated <b>error</b> <b>signals</b> to give the fractions of amplitude and phase modulation. It was shown {{that it is possible to}} produce nearly pure amplitude and phase modulation, as well as intermediate modulation states, using the UTM. The resulting <b>error</b> <b>signals</b> also indicate the UTM's suitability for both on- and off-resonance locking of Fabry-Perot cavities. by Sarah Ackley. Thesis (S. B.)

500|$|The {{idea that}} {{climbing}} fiber activity functions as an <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> has been examined in many experimental studies, with some supporting it but others casting doubt. In a pioneering study by Gilbert and Thach from 1977, Purkinje cells from monkeys learning a reaching task showed increased complex spike activity—which {{is known to}} reliably indicate activity of the cell's climbing fiber input—during periods when performance was poor. Several studies of motor learning in cats observed complex spike activity {{when there was a}} mismatch between an intended movement and the movement that was actually executed. Studies of the vestibulo–ocular reflex (which stabilizes the visual image on the retina when the head turns) found that climbing fiber activity indicated [...] "retinal slip", although not in a very straightforward way.|$|E
500|$|For any animal, {{survival}} requires {{maintaining a}} variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation: these include temperature, water content, salt concentration in the bloodstream, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen level, and others. The ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body—the milieu intérieur, as pioneering physiologist Claude Bernard called it—is known as homeostasis (Greek for [...] "standing still"). Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain. The basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback: any time a parameter diverges from its set-point, sensors generate an <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value. (This principle is widely used in engineering, for example in the control of temperature using a thermostat.) ...|$|E
500|$|Within the brain, {{dopamine}} functions {{partly as}} a [...] "global reward signal", where an initial phasic dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. In the context of reward-related learning, dopamine also functions as a reward prediction <b>error</b> <b>signal,</b> that is, {{the degree to which}} the value of a reward is unexpected. According to this hypothesis of Wolfram Schultz, rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells, but rewards that are unexpected, or greater than expected, produce a short-lasting increase in synaptic dopamine, whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level. The [...] "prediction error" [...] hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists, because an influential computational-learning method known as temporal difference learning makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error. This confluence of theory and data has led to a fertile interaction between neuroscientists and computer scientists interested in machine learning.|$|E

2500|$|In this example, {{an array}} tracksig {{is assumed to}} contain a {{reference}} signal to be tracked. [...] The oscillator is implemented by a counter, with the most significant bit of the counter indicating the on/off status of the oscillator. [...] This code simulates the two D-type flip-flops that comprise a phase-frequency comparator. [...] When either the reference or signal has a positive edge, the corresponding flip-flop switches high. [...] Once both reference and signal is high, both flip-flops are reset. [...] Which flip-flop is high determines at that instant whether the reference or signal leads the other. [...] The <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> {{is the difference between}} these two flip-flop values.

40|$|Proportionate-type {{normalized}} suband {{adaptive filter}} (PNSAF-type) algorithms are very attractive choices for echo cancellation. To further obtain both fast convergence rate and low steady-state error, in this paper, a variable step size (VSS) {{version of the}} presented improved PNSAF (IPNSAF) algorithm is proposed by minimizing {{the square of the}} noise-free a posterior subband <b>error</b> <b>signals.</b> A noniterative shrinkage method is used to recover the noise-free a priori subband <b>error</b> <b>signals</b> from the noisy subband <b>error</b> <b>signals.</b> Significantly, the proposed VSS strategy can be applied to any other PNSAF-type algorithm, since it is independent of the proportionate principles.

2500|$|Leonardo [...] tested {{these models}} {{directly}} by recording spike rates in single LMAN neurons of adult zebra finches during singing in conditions with normal and perturbed auditory feedback. His results {{did not support}} the BOS-tuned error correction model, as the firing rates of LMAN neurons were unaffected by changes in auditory feedback and therefore, the <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> generated by LMAN appeared unrelated to auditory feedback. Moreover, the results from this study supported the predictions of the efference copy model, in which LMAN neurons are activated during singing by the efference copy of the motor signal (and its predictions of expected auditory feedback), allowing the neurons to be more precisely time-locked to changes in auditory feedback.|$|E
2500|$|As {{an example}} of {{negative}} feedback, the diagram might represent a cruise control system in a car, for example, that matches a target speed such as the speed limit. The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a speedometer. [...] The <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> is {{the departure of the}} speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimizing the road disturbance.|$|E
2500|$|To do this, a {{controller}} {{with the}} requisite corrective behaviour is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares {{it with the}} reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the <b>error</b> <b>signal,</b> or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are [...] controllability and observability. On this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is feedback control, which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range {{by means of a}} [...] "final control element", such as a control valve.|$|E

2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. There is now {{significant}} {{evidence that}} prediction <b>error</b> <b>signalling</b> is mediated by dopamine in the midbrain, and that dopamine dysfunction is implicated in people experiencing psychotic symptoms, including delusions. There {{has also been}} significant theorizing and experimentation concerning the remaining link in this triad, namely that deviant prediction <b>error</b> <b>signalling</b> produces or maintains psychotic symptoms. Methods. The research supporting the link between prediction <b>error</b> <b>signalling</b> and delusional symptoms was reviewed. Numerous studies indirectly support this link, but only one set of studies claim to directly test this hypothesis by combining three crucial elements: a patient sample, a manipulation of prediction error and neuroimaging. This particular set of studies were examined in detail. Results. Important methodological limitations in these studies were observed, and a reinterpretation of their data was offered. Conclusions. Methodological inconsistencies significantly weaken the claims made by these studies, but their data are consistent with current theorizing and they are instructive for future lines of inquiry in this field. © 2014 Taylor and Francis...|$|R
