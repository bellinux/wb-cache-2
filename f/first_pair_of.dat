5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between proteins whereby the proteins have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. The result is a protein structure with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> circularly permuted proteins – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.|$|E
5|$|Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders {{are known}} to exhibit {{elaborate}} courtship displays. As a male approaches a female, it will typically raise and spread its <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> legs and vibrate its abdomen. If the female is receptive, it will often vibrate its abdomen as well. The specific patterns of courtship behavior, however, vary between individuals.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December in Engelberg, Peter and {{his younger}} brother Domen Prevc both {{finished}} on the podium as the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> brothers in World Cup history. With three wins and one third place, Prevc won the 2016 Four Hills Tournament, thus becoming the second Slovenian ski jumper to win the Tournament after Primož Peterka in the 1996/97 season.|$|E

5|$|Trent Richardson ran for {{a career-high}} 167 {{yards and three touchdowns}} and Eddie Lacy ran for 161 yards and two touchdowns and became the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> running backs to each run for 150 yards in a game. The shutout was the Crimson Tide's first since they {{defeated}} Chattanooga 45–0 in 2009 and improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mean Green to 4–0.|$|E
5|$|Z.sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized agonistic {{behavior}} when encountering other {{males of}} the same species. This behavior may include many {{of the same}} elements as courtship, such as raising and spreading the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> legs and vibrating the abdomen. During agonistic display, males will also extend their pedipalps and fangs. Lethal attacks between males appear to be rare, however.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
50|$|It {{marked the}} <b>first</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> Harvey and Fritsch {{who went on}} to become the leading screen couple in Weimar and early Nazi cinema. The film premiered at the UFA-Palast am Zoo and was a smash hit on its release.|$|R
50|$|Jimmy the Gent is a 1934 American Pre-Code comedy-crime film {{directed}} by Michael Curtiz and starring James Cagney and Bette Davis. It was the <b>first</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> Cagney and Davis, who would reunite for The Bride Came C.O.D. seven years later.|$|R
50|$|Playing doubles with Marray in June, their <b>first</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> the year, {{they reached}} the Nottingham Challenger finals, losing out to Treat Huey and Dominic Inglot in three tight sets 4-6, 7-6(9), 8-10. They {{compiled}} a 10-6 match record in 6 tournaments.|$|R
5|$|Endeavour docked {{with the}} ISS on 2 December 2000, on mission STS-97, {{bringing}} four more Americans and a Canadian temporarily to the station. The shuttle also brought the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> U.S. provided photovoltaic arrays, which would provide crucial electricity for {{further development of}} the station. In total, STS-97 brought 17tons of equipment to the ISS, which also included expandable metal girders, batteries, electronics and cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Jones and Norwood {{became the}} <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Alabama {{receivers}} to each score {{a pair of}} touchdowns in the same game since three were caught by Al Lary and two by Ed Lary in the 1950 season. Late in the game, backup running back Jalston Fowler suffered a knee injury that sidelined him {{for the remainder of}} the season. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Hilltoppers to 2–0.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{entered the}} 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as the {{youngest}} team in the field. The team made its first Sweet Sixteen appearance since the 1993–94 team did so. The Wolverines appeared in the national championship game {{for the first time}} since 1989 – appearances in 1992 and 1993 were vacated due to a scandal. Following the season, at the 2013 NBA Draft, Burke and Hardaway were selected ninth and twenty-fourth, respectively, becoming the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> first-round NBA draft choices from Michigan since the 1994 NBA Draft.|$|E

5|$|Only {{four days}} before Galarraga's near-perfect outing, Roy Halladay pitched a perfect game for the Philadelphia Phillies, and just twenty days prior to that, Dallas Braden threw a perfect game for the Oakland Athletics. Halladay's and Braden's perfect games had been the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> such games {{to occur in the}} same season during the modern era, let alone the same month. Joyce served as the second base umpire for Braden's perfect game.|$|E
5|$|The addax has 29 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}}. All chromosomes are acrocentric {{except for the}} <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> autosomes, which are submetacentric. The X chromosome is {{the largest of the}} acrocentric chromosomes, and the Y chromosome is medium-sized. The short and long arms of the pair of submetacentric autosomes correspond respectively to the 27th and 1st chromosomes in cattle and goats. In a study, the banding patterns of chromosomes in addax were found to be similar to those in four other species of the subfamily Hippotraginae.|$|E
5|$|The body {{is divided}} into a thorax of three {{segments}} and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings {{are attached to the}} second and third thoracic segments. The tegmina, or <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> wings, are tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins.|$|E

5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve {{is derived from}} the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> occipital somites, collections of mesoderm that form next to the main axis of an embryo during development. The musculature it supplies develop as the hypoglossal cord from the myotomes of the first four pairs of occipital somites. The nerve is first visible as a series of roots in the fourth week of development, which have formed a single nerve and link to the tongue by the fifth week.|$|E
5|$|The {{legs are}} {{composed}} of seven segments, and attach {{on the underside of}} the body. The legs of an individual are generally rather similar to each other, although often longer in males than females, and males of some species may have a reduced or enlarged <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> legs. The most conspicuous leg modifications are involved in reproduction, discussed below. Despite the common name, no millipede has been discovered with 1,000 legs: common species have between 34 and 400 legs, and the record is held by Illacme plenipes, with individuals possessing up to 750 legs – more than any other creature on Earth.|$|E
50|$|The {{movie was}} the <b>first</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> Mabel Normand and Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, {{who went on}} to become a sensationally popular romantic screen team and made {{seventeen}} films together; writer/director/actress Normand, the most prominent silent movie comedienne, was an almost equally frequent partner and mentor of Charles Chaplin during the same period.|$|R
50|$|My Favorite Duck is a 1942 color Looney Tunes cartoon {{featuring}} Porky Pig and Daffy Duck (both {{voiced by}} Mel Blanc). It {{was the second}} color entry in the Looney Tunes series, and the <b>first</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> Porky and Daffy produced in Technicolor. It was directed by Chuck Jones, in his first collaboration with writer Michael Maltese.|$|R
5000|$|Valenta {{played a}} {{significant}} role in preparations for The Great Escape because he was the Head of Contacts (i.e. Scrounging) for the [...] "X" [...] Organization in North Compound at Stalag Luft III near Sagan (now Żagań) in Poland. He was among the <b>first</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> POWs to escape from the camp using a tunnel on 24 March 1944.|$|R
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its <b>first</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{made his}} Test debut in 1971 against England at Edgbaston Cricket Ground.
