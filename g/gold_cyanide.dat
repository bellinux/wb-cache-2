This paper describes the effect of organic fouling on activated carbon, {{as well as the}} influence of pH and dissolved oxygen on the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the carbon. <b>Gold</b> and silver <b>cyanide</b> were used as adsorbates in order to quantify the inhibition of mass transfer to activated carbon caused by these effects. Adsorption tests were carried out when prior contact between the carbon and the foulant was followed by gold or silver adsorption, as well as the simultaneous adsorption of gold or silver and the foulant species. These tests were performed in a batch stirred tank reactor and a packed column. UV-spectrophotometry showed that the organics were all adsorbed fairly irreversibly. The Freundlich-type multicomponent isotherm was applied successfully to describe the equilibrium adsorption capacity of gold or silver {{in the presence of a}} single organic foulant. At low organic loadings on the carbon, the reduction in the rate of adsorption of metal cyanides appeared to be a kinetic influence, and could be caused by pore blocking. By fitting a dual resistance model to the profiles for the adsorption of <b>gold</b> or silver <b>cyanide</b> in the presence of low organic concentrations, the decrease in the intraparticle diffusivity was quantified.

30|$|Cyanide {{is used in}} many {{industrial}} applications such as electroplating, precious metal refining, gold mining, metal ore processing, and smelting, chemical and petrochemical applications. Cyanide compounds used in industry include hydrogen cyanide, cyanogen chloride, cyanide salts containing potassium or sodium, <b>gold</b> and silver <b>cyanide.</b> The mining of gold depends on cyanidation (MacArthur et al. 1988). Cyanide leaching, {{which is one of}} the gold extraction technologies, has replaced the mercury amalgamation.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 100 Years, the cyanidation {{process has been}} the most popular method for {{recovering}} gold from its ores. Despite this, there are still efforts to improve the efficiency of the process, particularly as ores become more difficult to treat. Many investigators have studied the cyanidation process, although a large proportion of these studies have obtained contradictory results. This thesis presents a kinetic and electrochemical study of the leaching of <b>gold</b> in <b>cyanide</b> solutions, and emphasis is placed on rationalising the conflicting results which have been published in the past. The leaching rate of gold was measured using a rotating electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, an instrument which allows the simultaneous measurement of electrochemical data and mass changes at the solid-solution interface in real time. A proportion of this project was devoted to the on-going design of this instrument, and a number of modifications are discussed in detail. Initially, the leaching of <b>gold</b> in <b>cyanide</b> solutions was investigated under conditions of high purity. Under these conditions, {{it was found that the}} gold surface is blocked by a passive film, presumably AuCN. The presence of such a film results in the reaction being chemically controlled, and under typical cyanidation conditions (4 mM cyanide, pH 10. 0), the rate of dissolution is very low. These kinetic results were supported by complimentary electrochemical studies, which showed that gold is passive in the potential region where cyanidation occurs. The second part of this thesis presents a study of the effect of system purity on the leaching of <b>gold</b> in <b>cyanide</b> solutions. Solution phase purity was investigated by adding controlled amounts of lead or silver to the leach solutions. It was found that in the presence of low concentrations of lead, the dissolution of gold in 20 mM cyanide solutions was oxygen ++diffusion controlled (as compared to chemical control for gold in the absence of lead). However, high concentrations of lead were found to be detrimental to the leaching process. It is believed that the role of lead is to modify the surface by cementation, hence reducing the effect of the passive film. Silver was also found to be effective at reducing passivation, and the role of silver believed to be similar to that of lead. It was found that unlike lead, high concentrations of silver are not detrimental to the dissolution of <b>gold</b> in <b>cyanide</b> solutions. Solid phase purity was also found to be important in the leaching of gold, and it was found that the leaching of a gold sample which contains 1 % silver is diffusion controlled. This finding is important from an industrial viewpoint, as most native gold contains some silver. Consequently, attempts were made to rationalise the leaching of gold/silver with current plant practice. Discussion on the effect of cyanide and oxygen concentrations, temperature and lead addition is presented...|$|R
