40|$|Major {{changes are}} {{unfolding}} {{in the conduct}} of public communication in political campaigns in modern democratic societies, yet we know little about how they flow through to the grassroots level of local government. The 2007 Australian federal election {{was one of the first}} in the world where candidates and voters used new media applications. This study adds to our understanding of the complex relationship between regional news media and democracy by presenting an analysis of candidates’ communication strategies during the 2008 local council elections. It shows candidates in 2008 were conservative in their adoption of a variety of e-electioneering tools, with just two-thirds using email to try to reach voters directly. Personal contact with voters rated as the candidates’ most valuable communication strategy. As candidates consider effective strategies for 2012, this paper suggests that the <b>fourth</b> <b>estate’s</b> centrality in local election campaigns may be under threat. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of information from online news organizations and new media outlets, newspapers remain the primary contributor of new content to the marketplace of information and ideas-integral in setting the agenda for public discourse, connecting readers with their communities, reducing the costs of citizen oversight on elected officials, and producing investigative and local news reports. But newspaper economics have sparked massive reductions in editorial operations and threaten the press's role in American democratic society. The strong public interest in preserving the newspaper industry should compel Congress to stabilize the press.   Journalists, politicians, and legal scholars have discussed many possible solutions. This Comment evaluates the practical and constitutional questions raised by two potential public subsidy programsdirect government funding and indirect support by facilitating newspaper conversion to nonprofit status-and whether such programs could be administered without jeopardizing the <b>Fourth</b> <b>Estate's</b> independence. This Comment argues that direct subsidies, though they could be tailored to survive constitutional challenge and to protect editorial independence, cannot deliver a feasible long-term solution. Indirect subsidies likely would only be available to newspapers following {{an amendment to the}} U. S. tax code and even then would provide limited benefit to qualiying newspapers until they have developed a fundraising base. Yet, this Comment concludes that subsidies could stabilize the press practically if Congress combined direct funding and tax-based incentives into a hybrid similar to that utilized by public radio. ...|$|R
