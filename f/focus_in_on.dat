5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E

Raytheon's X-band, active-array SPY-3 Multi-Function Radar (MFR) offers superior medium to high altitude performance over other radar bands, and its pencil beams give it an excellent ability to <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> targets. SPY-3 will be the primary radar used for missile engagements. A 2005 report by Congress' investigative arm, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), questioned that the technology leap for the Dual Band Radar would be too much.|$|E

2500|$|This {{is one of}} the academies {{that was}} instituted during the 2011-2012 school year. The FOCUS academy {{attempted}} to <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the 13% of students in the entire high school. [...] Speaking earlier about the plans, district superintendent Dr. Richard N. Johns said there are four types of students that would be targeted for the FOCUS academy — students who are at risk of dropping out, not graduating on time, not graduating and receiving a General Education Diploma, and students who are graduating with a 75 percent average or below. This program will be flexible with time and will allow students to come for their core classes and graduation requirements and leave {{for the remainder of the}} day, should they have to work or other extenuating circumstances. This academy was scheduled to be the first one implemented and was set to be used in the 2011–2012 school year. This academy was housed in the Wetzel Road Elementary building, which was closed last spring because of declining enrollment and an $11 million budget shortfall. It will first need a few renovations including new gang bathrooms and science laboratories. The FOCUS academy was ultimately shut down after in session for one year as it was deemed a major waste as a part of the school budget without any significant improvements by students.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Stone {{thought that}} [...] "with its swiftly moving {{narrative}} and realistic clash of character" [...] {{it is more}} like an extended tragic ballad than a romance. [...] He preferred its ending {{to that of the}} Morte Darthur, and considered the poem to be [...] "of prime importance in our culture". [...] Dieter Mehl referred to [...] "The by no means simple, but skilfully handled metrical form"; to [...] "a rare balance {{in the structure of the}} plot, a strict subordination of details to the theme of the poem, and a notable lack of digressions which could slow down the tempo of the narration"; and to a [...] "conscious simplicity and detachment that distinguish Le Morte Arthur from most other romances and make it so particularly attractive and appealing to modern taste." [...] Rosemary Woolf called the Stanzaic Morte [...] "the finest example of the English treatment of central Arthurian subject-matter before Malory's Morte Darthur". [...] Praise from some other scholars has been more measured. [...] Jennifer Goodman wrote that [...] "The verse is workmanlike: an acute sense of character and action allow the poet to <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the essential elements of fate and personality that combine to create Arthur's tragedy." [...] Lucy Allen Paton complained of the Mortes poet that [...] "his supply of rhyme-words is extraordinarily limited", and that [...] "he lacks the vigour of imagination, the intensity of feeling and the originality in description that the poet of the [...] Morte Arthure possessed", but went on [...] "he manifests real power as an easy and agreeable story-teller…Perhaps his most noticeable characteristic is his facility in bringing before us by a few direct dramatic words the human interest of the scenes that he is describing." [...] Robert W. Ackerman judged that [...] "Though marred by faults typical of the minstrel style, it tells a moving story vividly and swiftly." [...] George Kane's opinion was that [...] "Never once in its four thousand lines does it attain to brilliance, yet its effect is so unmistakably one of fulfilment and of harmony between intention and result that it must be regarded as a success." ...|$|E
