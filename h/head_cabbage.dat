30|$|All {{analyses}} were done using unbalanced ANOVA in R unless indicated otherwise (R-Core Team 2012). To examine the thrips population around the study site over time, thrips captured on sticky traps were pooled across location and compared across capture dates. The effect of trap location was evaluated by pooling traps within each location (i.e. north, east, south-edge and south-outer) and comparing across capture dates. Thrips entering the field site {{were compared with}} thrips within the field site by correlating <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> thrips counts with trap catches throughout the season by date. The influence of variety and planting date on total thrips observed on <b>cabbage</b> <b>heads</b> over the growing season was analysed. Location of thrips within the <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> at harvest, <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> weight and <b>cabbage</b> size was analysed for the two main varieties, Bronco and Lennox, and planting date. Percentage of <b>cabbage</b> <b>heads</b> showing thrips damage were analysed by location with the <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> and correlated with number of thrips present at harvest and the total thrips present on the heads over the season. And finally, correlation between trap catches and <b>head</b> weight and <b>cabbage</b> size was examined using linear models. <b>Cabbage</b> <b>head</b> weight and size (circumference along polar and equator dimensions) were compared for variety, planting date and harvest date. Thrips counts were transformed by sin− 1 (sqrt(x +  0.5)) where necessary prior to ANOVA where homogeneity of variance was violated.|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the large}} numbers of thrips {{captured}} on the traps, thrips observed on the <b>cabbage</b> <b>heads</b> over the season were very low. This suggests that either the thrips were not able to effectively colonize the heads in the field or that visual surveys were unable to adequately detect a representative portion of the population present on the head. Correlation between thrips observed during the last <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> survey did not correlate well with thrips found during <b>cabbage</b> <b>head</b> damage evaluation for cabbages harvested later in the season. The correlation was higher for <b>cabbage</b> <b>heads</b> harvested earlier. This suggests that head surveys are not indicative of the population contained within the head once the bulk of the population has moved into the field. Alternative means to quantify the thrips present in the plot itself will need to be evaluated. Damage from thrips was negligible at harvest and none of the observed damage was significant enough to render the <b>cabbage</b> <b>heads</b> unmarketable.|$|R

ABSTRACT: The food value and the socio-economic importance of vegetables explain their increasing importance in urban agriculture at Lubumbashi. This research is preliminary study on the consumption of vegetables. Its objective is to compare the consumption of two types of cabbage, namely Chinese cabbage and <b>head</b> <b>cabbage.</b> To attain that goal, a survey was conducted between June and July 2014 among households of Congo district in the Rwashi commune (municipality), and in Kabecha district and Bel-air II in the Kampemba commune. The results reveal that for the majority (50 %) of households surveyed, household size varies between 5 and 7 persons. For 60 % of households, their monthly income varies between 100 and 200 US$. As for consumption, 73. 5 % of households consumed vegetables frequently (2 to 5 times per week). 73 % of households had chosen Chinese cabbage because is cheaper than <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> and always available on market, whereas 27 % affirmed that <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> is the best for their consumption because is good for their health and smells good. However, 80 % of households affirmed to prefer <b>head</b> <b>cabbage</b> to Chinese cabbage for its taste. These results constitute an incentive message to local farmers to orientate their production according to the preferences, needs and the appreciation of consumers.
