This Charizard can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X and has shown to be powerful by defeating 10 Mega <b>Evolutions</b> {{in a row and}} defeating Ash's Greninja, who had a type advantage. It also defeated Trevor's Charizard, who can easily Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard Y.|$|E

Sucker Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.|$|E

5|$|Aliens do not {{feature in}} the series, as Grant and Naylor decided {{very early in the}} process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually {{addressed}} with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as <b>evolutions</b> of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' (GELF), an artificially-created creature. Simulants and GELFs frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show.|$|E
5|$|From its {{beginnings}} in the 1930s, ski flying has developed its own distinct history and {{given rise to}} all of the sport's world records. The first hill designed specifically for ski flying was built in Slovenia in 1934, after which both Germany and Austria built their own hills in 1950. This was followed by Norway in 1966, the United States in 1970, and the Czech Republic in 1980. From the 1960s to 1980s, a friendly rivalry between the European venues saw world records being set regularly, together with hill upgrades and <b>evolutions</b> in technique to fly longer distances.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} use {{his or her}} Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player {{encounters}} a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a maneuver {{for his or her}} Pokémon to fight using one of four moves, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon will level up. A Pokémon's level controls its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves it has learned. At certain levels, the Pokémon may also evolve. These <b>evolutions</b> affect the statistics and the levels at which new moves are learned (higher levels of evolution gain more statistics per level, although they may not learn new moves as early, if at all, compared with the lower levels of evolution).|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{biological}} <b>evolution</b> {{is essential to}} a deep understanding of biology. Biological <b>evolution</b> is a well-established scientific theory that explains how the diversity of life on this planet arose from a single or several original life forms. Nevertheless, public controversy has often clouded {{the extent to which}} biological <b>evolution</b> is addressed by science teachers in K- 12 public education classes. This study investigated the <b>evolution</b> education teaching practices of Iowa State University (ISU) students who completed the <b>evolution</b> education component of the Biology Education Teaching and Learning (BETAL) community, and the <b>evolution</b> education teaching practices of ISU students who did not take part in the <b>evolution</b> education component of BETAL. These two groups were compared to the <b>evolution</b> education teaching practices of teachers across the United States reported in prior studies. Although the sample was small, that all BETAL <b>evolution</b> education participants taught biological <b>evolution</b> is encouraging. While BETAL <b>evolution</b> education participants faced opposition to teaching biological <b>evolution,</b> the BETAL <b>evolution</b> education participants continue to teach biological <b>evolution</b> despite the opposition. BETAL <b>evolution</b> education participants also reportedly spent overall more time teaching biological <b>evolution</b> and included ties to important nature of science topics while doing so...|$|R

40|$|The {{major problem}} {{addressed}} by {{this research is}} how to automate parts of software <b>evolution</b> using dependency rules, especially for large and complex real time embedded systems. The main topics {{of this study are}} the development of a Relational Hypergraph model (RH model) and the design of a Computer Aided Software <b>Evolution</b> System (CASES). The goals of this dissertation are to explore the existing issues, to formalize software <b>evolution,</b> to reuse software <b>evolution</b> components, and to build a dependency computing model. We have resolved parts of essential software <b>evolution</b> issues in the following categories: software <b>evolution</b> process, software <b>evolution</b> traceability, software <b>evolution</b> description, software <b>evolution</b> management, and software <b>evolution</b> control. The RH model can realize automated software <b>evolution</b> in multi-dimensional phases, such as software prototype or product demo, issue analysis, requirement analysis, specification design, module implementation, program integration, and software product implementation. Many types of software <b>evolution</b> objects in each phase, and dependencies among these objects have been defined to describe software <b>evolution</b> processes. Taiwan Army autho...|$|R
