5|$|A two-part, feature-length {{version of}} Hogfather {{starring}} David Jason {{and the voice}} of Ian Richardson was first aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom in December 2006, and on ION Television in the US in 2007. Pratchett was opposed to live action films about Discworld before because of his negative experience with Hollywood film makers. He changed his opinion when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> director Vadim Jean and producer Rod Brown were very enthusiastic and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 2010, a {{military}} court convicted {{air traffic controller}} Sgt. Jomarcelo Fernandes dos Santos, sentencing him to 14 months in jail for failing to take action when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Embraer's anti-collision system had been turned off. Santos will remain free pending {{the outcome of the}} appeal process. Four other controllers were acquitted for lack of proof. On 17 May 2011, Judge Mendes sentenced air traffic controller Lucivando Tiburcio de Alencar to a term of up to three years and four months but ruled he is eligible to do community service in Brazil instead and acquitted Santos on charges of harming Brazil's air transport safety.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after dawn, Reshef {{conducted}} a reconnaissance {{of the battlefield}} from a hilltop. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians {{had set up a}} strong blocking position defending the junction, composed of Egyptian tanks situated in hull-down positions and infantrymen in foxholes and the now-dry irrigation ditches of the Chinese Farm. The infantry were from the 16th Brigade's right-flank battalion and had the support of recoilless rifles, RPG-7s, and some manually guided AT-3 Sagger missiles. Reshef discovered that the Egyptians had mined both sides of Lexicon Road, to which he had lost several of his tanks.|$|E
60|$|Desmond looked back. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> only <b>the</b> four dragoons were following.|$|R
60|$|He had {{got them}} puzzled, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> by <b>the</b> {{look on his}} captor's face.|$|R
60|$|As it was, 'e ran for pretty near a mile, {{and they}} could 'ear 'im {{breathing}} like a pair o' bellows; but at last <b>'e</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was up. He just man-aged to struggle as far as Farmer Pinnock's pond, and then, waving the sack round his 'ead, 'e flung it {{into the middle of}} it, and fell down gasping for breath.|$|R
5|$|When Bahá'u'lláh {{returned}} to Baghdad <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bábí community had become disheartened and divided. During Bahá'u'lláh's absence, {{it had become}} alienated from the religion because Mirza Yahya had continued his policy of militancy and {{had been unable to}} provide effective leadership. Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the Báb against the Báb's clear instructions; dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the Shah; and instigated violence against prominent Bábís who had challenged his leadership.|$|E
5|$|It rained. The {{procession}} of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{world was a}} world for him, though many discovered it {{to be made of}} oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

60|$|She {{looked at}} him fixedly, and Macheson, {{momentarily}} interested, returned her gaze. Then <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> underneath <b>the</b> false smile, for a moment laid aside, there was something human in her face.|$|R
60|$|Will did not answer. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> what <b>the</b> {{men said}} was correct. Presently, however, his eye fell upon an empty rum puncheon, {{and at once}} his {{thoughts}} flashed back to the West Indies.|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of January 29, Mậu and Khiêm alerted the rebel troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon. These included many of those used in the first coup: armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions, two airborne battalions and one Marine battalion {{and an assortment of}} Special Forces, Ranger and Civil Guard units. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 02:00. Lodge was kept fully informed throughout the night. As the time approached, Khánh donned his paratrooper uniform and headed to the military headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, where <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over the government without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Umayyads' {{left wing}} was holding steady, Ibn al-Ashtar changed tack and ordered his troops {{to attack the}} Umayyads' center, believing if he could {{disperse}} {{the core of the}} Umayyad army, the latter's right and left wings would likewise disperse. Ibn al-Ashtar himself took part in this assault and is said to have slew several Umayyad soldiers with his coterie of close companions. Amid the heavy clashes, numerous men on both sides were killed and the Umayyads were routed, Upon witnessing this, Umayr ibn al-Hubab communicated to Ibn al-Ashtar if he should defect to his camp; Ibn al-Ashtar told him to hold off because he feared his men would harm Umayr amid their anger.|$|E
5|$|Li Shimin's {{plan was}} successful: apart from skirmishes {{between the two}} armies' cavalry, the two armies {{maintained}} their standoff from about 08:00 until noon, when the Xia troops began {{to show signs of}} thirst and weariness. Li Shimin, from a high vantage point, saw this and sent 300 cavalry in a probing attack. When <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demoralized Xia recoiled from this assault, he sent more of his cavalry to turn Dou's left flank from the south. Dou reacted by ordering the withdrawal of his entire army from the river to the better defensive position offered by the eastern escarpment of the Sishui valley, but this manoeuvre created confusion in the Xia lines, breaking their battle order. Awaiting this opportunity, Li Shimin ordered his army to launch a general attack against the withdrawing Xia, himself spearheading the attack at the head of his remaining cavalry. Li Shimin always led from the front—accompanied by an elite force of 1000 black-clad, black-armoured horsemen—as indeed did most of the contemporary Chinese military leaders, who were expected to prove their personal bravery on the battlefield and motivate their men by their example, rather than stay in the rear and co-ordinate their army.|$|E
60|$|Again Joe looked, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> what <b>the</b> soldier {{said was}} true. The under {{branches}} of the drifting tree had hit some sharp rocks below the river's surface, and one branch had wedged itself fast.|$|R
60|$|She obeyed {{him with}} fingers which trembled a little. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> then <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tears {{had indeed been}} in her eyes. Her lips quivered. She looked at him sadly, but very wistfully.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a great}} {{shout and}} clash of arms when this was said, and the King's face became crimson with rage, for <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> clearly <b>that</b> <b>the</b> feeling of the {{majority}} was against him.|$|R
5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E
25|$|In 1850, the Venezuelan General Narciso López, {{along with}} some Americans and Cuban exiles, landed here on a {{filibustering}} expedition, and held the town for a few hours, abandoning it when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people would not rise to support him {{in his efforts to}} secure Cuban independence. López did, however, raised for first time the modern Flag of Cuba designed by him along with a local Cuban Miguel Teurbe Tolon.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Newsam {{also looked}} into the whole {{policing}} service from 1944, and became personally committed {{to the idea of}} establishing a national staff college for the police. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> project found the land needed for its buildings (at Bramshill, near Hartley Wintney in Hampshire), and became the founder chairman of the Board of Governors of the Police Staff College in 1947. He retained this role {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E
60|$|But the statesman became {{only the}} more bitter when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> I had <b>the</b> support of my Colonel.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>saw</b> then <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{house was}} crowded with pale shadowy hands, and that every hand was holding what was {{sometimes}} like a wisp lighted for a marriage, and sometimes like a tall white candle for the dead.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Lin was {{selected}} for the annual All-Star Futures Game. Lin hit a two-run home run on <b>the</b> first pitch <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> helped <b>the</b> World team beat the US Team, 3-0. He finished 2-for-2 and was named the game's Most Valuable Player.|$|R
25|$|When her {{mother-in-law}} died, Frances became {{mistress of the}} household. During a time of flood and famine, she turned part of the family's country estate into a hospital and distributed food and clothing to the poor. According to one account, her father-in-law was so angry that he took away from her {{the keys to the}} supply rooms; but gave them back when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> corn bin and wine barrel were replenished after Frances finished praying.|$|E
25|$|The {{defect in}} the Prussian {{position}} this respect was subsequently made strikingly manifest {{by the fact that}} the gradual weakening of the Prussian centre for the purpose of reinforcing the right, was closely observed by Napoleon, who took advantage of the insight thus obtained into his opponent's designs, by collecting in rear of the heights of Ligny that force with which, when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Prussians had no reserve remaining, he so suddenly assailed and broke the centre of their line.|$|E
25|$|John Dickson became {{in effect}} {{the driving force}} of the Dulas Valley Mineral Railway, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> line would only reach its {{potential}} if it extended at each end. In the1863 session of Parliament, therefore, the company promoted a Swansea and Neath and Brecon Railway. Swansea docks were as yet undeveloped but clearly had much greater potential than Neath. Extension north-eastward to Brecon would connect there with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway, itself connecting with a chain of other lines reaching to Hereford and beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Injin {{love to hear}} trut'--hate to hear lie. Can tell 'em all {{you want}} to say. He go too, eh?" [...] {{pointing}} to the corporal, who rather hung back, as if <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> invitation which was not agreeable to him.|$|R
60|$|To {{his great}} joy <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> one of <b>the</b> dwarfs had fallen behind the rest, {{and at once}} began to {{question}} him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> Lady Maud {{accompanied}} him, {{they were}} wont to repair to the farthermost extremities {{of the palace}} grounds where, by a little postern gate, she admitted a certain officer of the Guards to whom the Queen had forbidden the privilege of the court.|$|R
25|$|Ström {{headed off}} towards Åby to inform {{them of the}} {{accident}} and met Mr. Andersson, a track walker. From a nearby house, Andersson called Åby and notified them of the accident. Track walker Eriksson arrived from his house east of the accident site. His wife had lowered the boom barrier at the railway crossing and was standing {{and waiting for the}} train when she thought it sounded as if the train had stopped, so Eriksson quickly went {{to the site of the}} derailment. Once <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> telegraph poles were aslant, he knew that something serious had occurred. Upon seeing that the train had derailed, he hurried to Getå Halt to notify Krokek Station what had occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{news of this}} {{operation}} was not brought to Henry's attention until after it had been accomplished. When the king reached {{the shore of the}} Seine <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rearguard of the army including the garrison of the fort on the right bank were just ferrying themselves across under command of Banuccio. Shocked by this Henry quickly ordered artillery to bear upon the withdrawing soldiers but the bombardment was largely ineffective and the Catholic Spanish force took up their line of march to the south. Henry then constructed a bridge over the Pont de 1'Arche and his first objective was to pursue with his cavalry but it was too late; the infantry {{would not have been able}} to support them in time.|$|E
25|$|However, on 12 December, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet {{ratified}} the Belevezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. It was now {{apparent that the}} momentum towards dissolution could not be stopped. Shortly after the RSFSR {{ratified the}} Accords, Gorbachev hinted that he was considering stepping aside. On 17 December, he accepted the fait accompli and reluctantly agreed with Yeltsin to dissolve the Soviet Union. Four days later, the leaders of 11 of the 12 remaining republics—all except Georgia (the Baltic states had already seceded in August)—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol which formally established the CIS. They also preemptively accepted Gorbachev's resignation. When Gorbachev learned what had transpired, he told CBS that he would resign as soon as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CIS was indeed a reality.|$|E
60|$|He {{was still}} {{thinking}} about this when he started for home. Half way there, <b>he</b> paused, <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way to the Smiling Pool was clear, and suddenly {{made up his mind}} to ask Grandfather Frog about Buster Bear's tail. Off he started, lipperty-lipperty-lip.|$|R
6000|$|He put such {{emphasis}} on the [...] "man" [...] that his comrade glanced sharply at him, but the genuine innocence of our hero's face was too obvious to suggest irony. <b>He</b> simply <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{use of the word}} man pleased his friend, therefore he used it.|$|R
60|$|Lomaque {{looked over}} his {{shoulder}} as <b>he</b> spoke, and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> letter was directed to the President of the Academy of Sciences, Paris.|$|R
