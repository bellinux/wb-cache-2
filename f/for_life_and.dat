5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> defend territories. They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that {{is either}} {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|Armatus, as magister militum, {{was sent}} with all {{available}} forces in Asia Minor, {{to oppose the}} advancing army of the Isaurians, but secret messages from Zeno, who promised {{to give him the}} title of magister militum <b>for</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> to confer the rank of Caesar on his son, induced him to betray his master. Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by another way. This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.|$|E

5|$|The {{music on}} Kaleidoscope Dream draws on R, pop, funk, rock and soul styles, {{as well as}} {{elements}} from electronic and psychedelic music. The album's producers incorporated dense bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds in the songs, which deal mostly with sex, romance, and existential ideas.

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is sexually mature at {{one to three}} years of age, but in healthy populations they breed after {{two to three years}} of age. A pair mates <b>for</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives. The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons.|$|E

5|$|This bird has glossy black plumage, a long curved red bill, red legs, and a loud, ringing call. It has a buoyant {{acrobatic flight}} with widely spread primaries. The red-billed chough pairs <b>for</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> {{displays}} fidelity to its breeding site, {{which is usually}} a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a wool-lined stick nest and lays three eggs. It feeds, often in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey.|$|E
5|$|Following a coup by disgruntled {{military}} officers, Constantine I abdicated for {{a second}} time on 27 September 1922. With several other members of his family, including Queen Olga, he went into exile in Italy and his eldest son succeeded him for a few months on the throne as George II. Within months, Constantine died in Italy. One of Olga's sons, Prince Andrew, was among those arrested by the new regime. Many defendants in the treason trials that followed the coup were shot, including senior politicians and generals. Foreign diplomats assumed that Andrew was also in mortal danger, and George V of the United Kingdom, Alfonso XIII of Spain, the French president Raymond Poincaré and Pope Pius XI sent representatives to Athens to intercede on his behalf. Andrew, though spared, was banished <b>for</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> his family (including the infant Prince Philip, later Duke of Edinburgh and consort of Queen Elizabeth II) fled into exile in December 1922 aboard a British cruiser, HMS Calypso.|$|E

(1964), was reached later that summer. To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews <b>for</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Cosmopolitan and her first photo shoot for Vogue. For Vogue, she and photographer Bert Stern collaborated for two series of photographs, one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude, which were both later published posthumously with the title The Last Sitting. In the last weeks of her life, she was also planning on starring in a biopic of Jean Harlow.|$|E

5|$|Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are {{generally}} seen in flocks of varying sizes, though {{males and females}} pair-bond <b>for</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> pairs stay together within flocks. Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting, with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. At Uppsala, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night. Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks, the latter particularly when migrating or roosting. They have been recorded foraging with the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), and common gull (Larus canus) in northwestern England. Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus), although larger groups are more able to elude the predators. Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group. Occasionally, a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.|$|E
5|$|In late 1961, {{there were}} violent {{confrontations}} between NOI members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested. They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised. Just after midnight on April27, 1962, two LAPD officers shoved and beat several Muslims outside Temple Number 27 without provocation. A large crowd of angry Muslims came outside from the mosque. The officers attempted to intimidate the crowd. One officer was disarmed by the crowd; his partner {{was shot in}} the elbow by a third officer. More than 70 backup officers arrived. They raided the mosque and randomly beat NOI members. Police officers shot seven Muslims, including William X Rogers, who was hit in the back and paralyzed <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> Ronald Stokes, a Korean War veteran, who was shot from behind while raising his hands over his head to surrender, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} element <b>for</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> is the heaviest element commonly needed by living organisms. (Lanthanum and the other lanthanides, as well as tungsten, are used by a few microorganisms.) It {{is required for the}} synthesis of the growth-regulating thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T4 and T3 respectively, named after their number of iodine atoms). A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 and a concomitant enlargement of the thyroid tissue in an attempt to obtain more iodine, causing the disease known as simple goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a'). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes; thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.|$|E

5|$|Nigel's date {{of birth}} is uncertain, but {{it is likely to}} have been some time around 1100. Historians {{occasionally}} refer to him as Nigel Poor or Nigel of Ely, but before his elevation to the episcopate he was commonly known as Nigel, the bishop's nephew, or Nigel, the treasurer. He was probably a Norman by ancestry although he was brought up in England, which in 1066 had been conquered by the Duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror. Following William's death in 1087 his realm was divided between two of his sons. His middle son, William Rufus, inherited the Kingdom of England, and the Duchy of Normandy passed to his eldest son, Robert Curthose. The youngest son, Henry, received a grant of money, which he used to purchase a lordship in Normandy. The brothers fought amongst themselves for the next twenty years; the initial conflict was between Rufus and Robert, but after Rufus' death in 1100 Henry, who succeeded Rufus as King of England, also became involved. Eventually, in 1106, Henry captured Robert, imprisoned him <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> took control of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are {{perfectly}} monogamous, {{meaning that they}} mate <b>for</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> take no other partners (even after the original mate’s death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers, and otters. There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights (polygyny), multiple males that females mate with (polyandry), or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females (polygynandry). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks, are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals. Lek mating occurs in harems, wherein {{one or a few}} males protect their harem of females from other males who would otherwise mate with the females, as in elephant seals; or males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalizations, as in harbor seals.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} rocks, or burrow in the soil. When {{they make their}} own tunnels, they loosen the earth with their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate <b>for</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> use the same hole every year.|$|E
