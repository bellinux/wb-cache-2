Abstract: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) renew {{themselves}} throughout {{the life of}} an organism and also differentiate into sperm in the adult.

SSCs from pigs, considered an ideal animal model, are used in studies of male infertility, regenerative medicine, and preparation of transgenic animals. Here, we report on a culture system for porcine SSCs and the differentiation of these cells into neuron-like cells and adipocytes. SSCs and Sertoli cells were isolated from neonatal piglet testis by differential adhesion and SSCs were cultured on a feeder layer of Sertoli cells. Third-generation SSCs were induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells by addition of retinoic acid, β-mercaptoethanol, and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX) to the <b>induction</b> <b>media</b> and into adipocytes by the addition of hexadecadrol, insulin, and IBMX to the <b>induction</b> <b>media.</b> The differentiated cells were characterized by biochemical staining, qRT-PCR, and immunocytochemistry.

Moreover, the cells were sensitive to insulin as observed from increased glucose uptake and inhibition of lipolysis. This differentiation protocol provides a promising approach for the induction of hASC adipogenesis to obtain functional and mature human adipocytes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} use of self {{assembled}} peptide (F 2 S) hydrogels and cellular metabolomics to identify a number of innate molecules that are integral to the metabolic processes which drive cellular differentiation. Current methods for achieving this wholly depend on {{the use of}} chemical <b>induction</b> <b>media</b> which generally comprise synthetic molecules or attempting to match the physical environment to that of targeted tissue types. By culturing pericytes on F 2 S hydrogels with varied mechanical qualities, these cells were induced to undergo neuronal (2 kPa), chondrogenic (15 kPa) and osteogenic (40 kPa) differentiation. Because the system relies solely on mechanical tuning of a uniform substrate, alterations in cell behaviour by way of total metabolism could be used to mine for selective compounds of interest by way of patterned depletion. When the selected metabolites (ceramide, lysophosphatidic acid and cholesterol sulphate respectively) were reintroduced into stem cells cultures, they were observed as having the ability to direct differentiation in their own right and with similar efficacy to routinely used <b>induction</b> <b>media.</b> Interestingly, it was also observed that these metabolites, when introduced in vitro, have distinct effects on stem cell behaviour dependent on whether the cells are amenable to them. That is, metabolic functions are innately coupled to the pericytes physical and morphological states. This approach shows that simple metabolites provide an alternative means to direct stem cell differentiation and that materials can be used to identify them simply and quickly which has clear implications for stem cell drug discovery...|$|E
40|$|Spermatogonial {{stem cells}} (SSCs) renew {{themselves}} throughout {{the life of}} an organism and also differentiate into sperm in the adult. They are multipopent and therefore, can be induced to differentiate into many cells types in vitro. SSCs from pigs, considered an ideal animal model, are used in studies of male infertility, regenerative medicine, and preparation of transgenic animals. Here, we report on a culture system for porcine SSCs and the differentiation of these cells into neuron-like cells and adipocytes. SSCs and Sertoli cells were isolated from neonatal piglet testis by differential adhesion and SSCs were cultured on a feeder layer of Sertoli cells. Third-generation SSCs were induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells by addition of retinoic acid, β-mercaptoethanol, and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX) to the <b>induction</b> <b>media</b> and into adipocytes by the addition of hexadecadrol, insulin, and IBMX to the <b>induction</b> <b>media.</b> The differentiated cells were characterized by biochemical staining, qRT-PCR, and immunocytochemistry. The cells were positive for SSC markers, including alkaline phosphatase and SSC-specific genes, consistent with the cells being undifferentiated. The isolated SSCs survived on the Sertoli cells for 15 generations. Karyotyping confirmed that the chromosomal number of the SSCs were normal for pig (2 n = 38, n = 19). Pig SSCs were successfully induced into neuron-like cells eight days after induction and into adipocytes 22 days after induction as determined by biochemical and immunocytochemical staining. qPCR results also support this conclusion. The nervous tissue markers genes, Nestin and β-tubulin, were expressed in the neuron-like cells and the adipocyte marker genes, PPARγ and C/EBPα, were expressed in the adipocytes...|$|E
40|$|Interactive {{effects of}} genotypes with callus <b>induction</b> and {{regeneration}} <b>media</b> combinations on green plantlet regeneration response were studied for three indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars, IR- 72, IR- 54 and Karnal Local. Isolated mature-embryoswere used to derive scutellar callus and fifteen media combinations involvingMS, N 6, R 2, SK 1 and some modifications were tested. Regeneration percentage {{as well as}} the shoot-bud induction frequency were influenced by genotype, callus induction medium, regeneration medium, interaction between genotype and the two <b>media</b> (callus <b>induction</b> and regeneration) as well the interaction between the callus induction medium and regeneration medium. Basal media combination of SK 1 m (callusing) and MS (regeneration) was found to be the best for cv. Karnal Local in which regeneration frequency of 88...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{propagation}} through {{tissue culture}} technique {{is required to}} produce plant secondary metabolite. The objective of this experiment was to obtain the optimum media composition for in vitro shoot and root formation of Stemona sp. It was shown that Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplement with 3 mg L - 1 benzyladenine and half-MS medium supplemented with 2 mg L - 1 indolebutyric acid were the appropriate media for shoot and root <b>induction,</b> respectively. The <b>media</b> could produce 100 % of shoot induction and 80 % of root induction. The increase or decrease in 1, 2 -didehydrostemofoline {{was related to the}} root growth. The highest 1, 2 -didehydrostemofoline production of 31. 04 mg g - 1 root dry weight was observed in 16 week old root...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis is {{the first}} report on the {{beneficial}} effect of microalgal and cyanobacterial biomass on anther cultures of maize (Zea mays L.). Investigations were made on the cytokinin- and auxin-like activity and content of terrestrial and fresh-water living microalgal and cyanobacterial strains. The influence of media supplemented with biomass from four selected strains on the anther induction, the frequency of microspore-derived embryo-like structures, and regeneration capacity in anther cultures of maize was also studied. The addition of cyanobacterial and microalgal biomass to the <b>induction</b> and regeneration <b>media</b> in concentrations of 1 or 2 g/L improved the androgenic response, {{and was able to}} reduce the quantity of the synthetic auxin 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid (2, 4 -D) required, or replace it completely...|$|R
