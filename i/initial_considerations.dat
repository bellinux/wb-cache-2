50|$|<b>Initial</b> <b>considerations</b> of a {{rail line}} from Ulm along the Danube can be dated {{back to the}} 1850s. As {{was the case in}} other areas, cities and towns along the Danube started railway committees, which worked on finding support for the {{construction}} of a railway. In 1861, 17 of these committees published a memorandum, which argued {{for the construction of a}} line from Ulm via Ehingen, Mengen, Messkirch, and Singen to Schaffhausen in Switzerland, with a connection to Tuttlingen as well as to the Schwarzwaldbahn (Baden), which was still in its planning phase at the time. In addition, the construction of a railway along the Danube as part of a trans-European line between Vienna and Paris was under discussion. A connection between Ulm and Vienna already existed in the 1860s, and since Paris was already connected to Chaumont, Haute-Marne, closing the gap via construction of a railway from Ulm along the Danube to Donaueschingen, then further through the Schwarzwald to Freiburg, and across the Rhine river and the Vosges mountain range to Chaumont, found proponents amongst the committees along the Danube, and other parties, as the shortest route between Paris and Vienna. However, not only were there major topographical issues, which were difficult to solve given the knowledge of the day, but the many border crossings necessary to build this railway also added to the list of problems with the concept.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{planning}} of a railway {{line in the}} north-south direction within the Palatinate, which had belonged to Bavaria since 1816, was set aside for an east-west line, which was mainly promoted by Palatine entrepreneurs as facilitating the transport of Saar coal to the Rhine. The planners revised their <b>initial</b> <b>considerations</b> of St. Ingbert as the western terminus, under pressure from Prussia, which wanted to have the long-term connection to Saarbrücken passing {{as far as possible}} over its own territory. That is why the planners considered Bexbach, with an extension via Neunkirchen and the Sulzbach valley. A suggestion that the railway line run via Zweibrücken and from there along the Schwarzbach via Rodalben, Annweiler and Langenkandel on the Rhine, did not proceed. The eastern terminus was disputed between Speyer, the capital of the Palatinate and the emerging port and trading centre of Rheinschanze. A memorandum supporting the interests of Speyer argued that it was an old trading town, whereas Rheinschanze was just a military base that would merely serve the transfer of goods. These endeavours were unsuccessful, as the part of the up-and-coming Rhine-Neckar Region to the east of the Rhine, especially Mannheim, was the focus of attention and the export of coal to the area beyond the Rhine was considered more important. Proposals for a line along the Dürkheim Valley also failed, since its side valleys were too low and, above all, the Frankensteiner Steige (Frankenstein climb) would have had too steep. This route would have required stationary steam engines and rope haulage to overcome the differences in altitude. For this reason it was decided to proceed with a route along the valley through Neustadt.|$|E
