We implement DAuth {{as a proxy for}} a Twitter social networking application within our distributed Elastic Application framework and find it introduces negligible overhead and requires only minor modification of existing applications.

The objective for each player is to select locations {{so as to}} maximize their market share—the mass of consumers {{in the vicinity of}} their chosen locations.

We first show that (i) if the feasible locations form a finite set in R d, Leader (the first mover) must obtain at least a 1 d+ 1 fraction of the market share in equilibrium in the single-stage game, and there exist games in which Leader obtains no more than 1 d+ 1; (ii) in the original Hotelling game (uniformly <b>distributed</b> <b>consumers</b> on the unit interval), Leader obtains 1 2 even in the multiple stage game, using a strategy which is oblivious of Follower’s locations.

40|$|Glacier retreat is {{occurring}} across the world, and associated river ecosystems {{are expected to}} respond more rapidly than those in flowing waters in other regions. The river environment directly downstream of a glacier snout is characterised by extreme low water temperature and unstable channel sediments but these habitats may become rarer with widespread glacier retreat. In these extreme environments food web dynamics have been little studied, yet they could offer opportunities to test food web theories using highly resolved food webs owing to their low taxonomic richness. This study examined the interactions of macroinvertebrate and diatom taxa in the Ödenwinkelkees river, Austrian central Alps between 2006 and 2011. The webs were characterised by low taxon richness (13 – 22), highly connected individuals (directed connectance up to 0. 19) and short mean food chain length (2. 00 – 2. 36). The dominant macroinvertebrates {{were members of the}} Chironomidae genus Diamesa and had an omnivorous diet rich in detritus and diatoms as well as other Chironomidae. Simuliidae (typically detritivorous filterers) had a diet rich in diatoms but also showed evidence of predation on Chironomidae larvae. Food webs showed strong species-averaged and individual size structuring but mass-abundance scaling coefficients were larger than those predicted by metabolic theory, perhaps due to a combination of spatial averaging effects of patchily <b>distributed</b> <b>consumers</b> and resources, and/or consumers deriving unquantified resources from microorganisms attached to the large amounts of ingested rock fragments.

40|$|Abstract — Meter {{reading is}} an {{important}} part of billing system for residential and commercial buildings. The importance of an effective and efficient billing system cannot be over emphasized. This is very critical as small errors can lead to substantial loss of revenue. This often does not reflect the exact or true electricity consumption of such buildings, resulting in an inefficient bill mainly due to human errors. Thus, it is essential to have an efficient and effective system for this measurement purposes. This paper is about the design and construction of a personal computer (PC) based power monitoring system. It is made up of integrated circuits, active and passive hardware devices and a Visual Basic software program which is used for programming the PC serial port. This design monitors the amount of electrical power used, up to 600 watt, transmitting data through a central receiving unit connected to a PC via USB serial (COM) port. The PC displays and stores the data for future recall and simple cost analysis. The device is used to measure accurately the electric power consumed by a residential or commercial buildings which is more economical compared to the electromechanical devices. Utility companies can directly monitor and control electrical power supply billing of its <b>distributed</b> <b>consumers</b> without engaging the services of human oriented meter readers. The meter displays the consumed power per minute. The potential of the developed system are mainly the advantages of virtual instrumentation, flexibility, lower built cost and high performance, high accuracy in power monitoring and power management...|$|E

We consider a two-player, sequential location game, with n stages. At each stage, players 1 and 2 choose locations from a feasible set in sequence. After all moves are made, consumers each purchase one unit of the good from the closest location, breaking ties uniformly at random. Since player 1 has a natural first-mover disadvantage here (player 2 can obtain a payoff of half the total market just by replicating player 1 ’s moves), we examine her worst-case payoff. When the number of stages is known to both players we show that (i) if the feasible locations form a finite set in R d 1, player 1 must obtain at least d+ 1 in the single-move game, and there exist games in which player 1 obtains no more than 1 d+ 1; (ii) in the original Hotelling game (uniformly <b>distributed</b> <b>consumers</b> on the unit interval), player 1 obtains 1 2 even in the multiple stage game, using a strategy which is oblivious of player 2 ’s locations.

40|$|The {{electrical}} power system provides vital support for the functioning of modern so- cieties. Driven by the growing interest in clean, reliable and affordable energy, the {{electrical power}} system is facing transitions. The share of renewable energy sources in electricity supply is growing. In addition, the end customers of electricity, such as households, are transforming into “prosumers” that can generate, store, and export elec- tricity. Moreover, the demand for active participation of the end customers in electricity market is rising. Furthermore, the increasing electrification of the transportation sector is foreseen to bring about large wave of electric vehicles into neighborhoods. The future electricity grid, {{referred to as the}} smart grid, is expected to conveniently accommodate all the transitions to deliver clean, reliable and affordable energy. Unfortunately, at the moment there is no clear recipe for constructing the smart grid. The objective of this thesis is to find solutions for some of the challenges to be addressed to construct the smart grid. As more and more end customers become prosumers, the {{electrical power system}} will shift from the old paradigm in which electricity is centrally generated at few large scale power plants and supplied to <b>distributed</b> <b>consumers,</b> to a new decentralized paradigm where different kinds of prosumers exchange power on the grid. Thus, the rather old power system that was designed for centralized power supply needs to be restructured since it is not convenient to accommodate the new paradigm. To this end, this thesis proposes a new architecture of the smart grid based on the concept of holons. In the proposed holonic architecture of the smart grid, prosumers are recursively organized as systems of systems to eventually constitute the overall smart grid holarchy. The attrac- tive attributes of the holonic architecture include its provision of sufficient autonomy to the prosumers to manage their energy resources, its recursive structure that orga- nizes prosumers as systems of systems at various aggregation layers, and the dynamic reconfiguration capability of the prosumers to adapt to the changes in the environment. The benefits of the holonic control architecture are providing convenience for active participation of prosumers in the energy market, enabling scalable distributed control of myriad of energy resources, and increasing the reliability, efficiency, self-healing, and dynamic recovery of the smart grid. In the new paradigm, managing the load profile of the prosumers becomes a major challenge due to various factors. The energy production of the renewable sources, such as solar panels, are highly intermittent depending on the weather conditions. Besides, the large amount of energy consumed in charging the electric vehicles could introduce peak loads. Moreover, the autonomous prosumers might exploit the flexibility of their energy resources to achieve load profiles that maximize their individual benefits, which could add up to volatile aggregate load profile of the energy community. The volatility may result in undesirable peak loads, hence it needs to be minimized. In this thesis, a suitable load management strategy is developed to cope with this challenge. Our load management strategy employs a pricing incentive to coordinate the prosumers in the energy community so that a desirable aggregate load shape is achieved while the autonomous prosumers selfishly strive to minimize their individual costs. The pric- ing incentive adjusts to the intermittence of the renewable energy sources and the price-responsiveness of the prosumers, thereby effectively persuading the autonomous prosumers to a desirable aggregate load shape. In the classical electrical power system, the low voltage (LV) grid delivers energy in one direction, top-down, from controlled supply side to passive end consumers with moderate loads. Thus, the voltage and current dynamics can easily be maintained within the required operational boundaries. But this is changing. As more distributed energy sources and electric vehicles become widely available at the end customers, the energy produced from the distributed energy sources and the large energy consumption of electric vehicles could lead to undesirable voltage and current dynamics that could violate the operational boundaries of the LV grid. In this thesis, we assess how the physical structure of the LV grid influences its ability to maintain safe operational condition in the new paradigm. Using this assessment, we identified the key structural features of the LV grid that influence its operational performance, based on which we propose an algorithm to design the LV grid structure that can cope with the new paradigm. Clearly, improving the structure of the LV grid is not enough by itself. It is commonly understood that intelligence of the future smart grid is provided by the support of ICT networks. Yet, the interdependence between the power grid and the ICT network might affect the reliability of the power grid. After assessing the impact of the interdependence between the LV grid and its supporting ICT network on the reliability of the LV grid, this thesis provides valuable insights for optimal design of the interdependence between the two. As prosumers increasingly dominate the power system, the performance of the sys- tem can be significantly influenced by the performance of the individual prosumers. Whereas, the performances of the individual prosumers depend on the composition of their energy resources, since different energy resources make different contributions to a prosumer. Hence, understanding the value added by an energy resource to the perfor- mance of a prosumer is crucial. In this thesis, a model that assesses the value an energy resource adds to a prosumer is presented. The developed valuation model assesses how addition of an energy resource affects a comprehensive set of performance indicators of a prosumer that incorporate economic, environmental and social dimensions. Using the valuation model, certain energy resources can be added to or removed from a prosumer to improve the desirable performance indicators of the prosumer. The solutions developed in this thesis play important roles in overcoming different challenges facing the smart grid, thereby facilitating the transition to clean, reliable and affordable energy.
