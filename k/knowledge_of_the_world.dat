5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent.

25|$|Interpretations where quantum {{mechanics}} is said to describe an observer's <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> rather than the world itself.

25|$|Kant {{deemed it}} obvious {{that we have}} some {{objective}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> such as, say, Newtonian physics. But this knowledge relies on synthetic, a priori laws of nature, like causality and substance. The problem, then, is how this is possible. Kant's solution was to reason that the subject must supply laws that make experience of objects possible, and that these laws are the synthetic, a priori laws of nature that we know apply to all objects before we experience them. So, to deduce all these laws, Kant examined experience in general, dissecting in it what is supplied by the mind from what is supplied by the given intuitions. What has just been explicated is commonly called a transcendental deduction.|$|E
25|$|Science {{acknowledges}} reason, empiricism, and evidence, while religions include revelation, {{faith and}} sacredness whilst also acknowledging philosophical and metaphysical explanations {{with regard to}} the study of the universe. Both science and religion are complex social and cultural endeavors that vary across cultures and have changed over time. Most scientific and technical innovations prior to the scientific revolution were achieved by societies organized by religious traditions. Elements of the scientific method were pioneered by ancient pagan, Islamic, and Christian scholars. During the Islamic Golden Age foundations for the scientific method were laid by Ibn al-Haytham. Roger Bacon, who is often credited with formalizing the scientific method, was a Franciscan friar. Hinduism has historically embraced reason and empiricism, holding that science brings legitimate, but incomplete <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Confucian thought has held different views of science over time. Most Buddhists today view science as complementary to their beliefs. While the classification of the material world by the ancient Indians and Greeks into air, earth, fire and water was more philosophical, medieval Middle Easterns used practical and experimental observation to classify materials.|$|E
25|$|Engaging this dialogical {{process of}} {{communicating}} is how human beings {{come to be}} composed of multiple voices (which constitute their horizons) that are in constant flux and always incomplete. This implies that Dasein's self-interpretations are never complete; ergo, the establishing of Dasein's identity is never finished and his <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and others is never complete. If Dasein's identity and knowledge is never complete, then human beings are never complete. Bakhtin referred to this as human beings always being unfinalized. In other words, Dasein is never complete because his understanding of himself (i.e. his self-interpretations) remains open to future re-interpretation as his knowledge increases via ongoing dialogue with others and the world. Furthermore, the number of possibilities of who Dasein may become is infinite so long as Dasein remains unfinalized. And, who Dasein is {{at any given moment}} may be just one voice, or may be one temporarily aligned hierarchy of voices (dialogical positions) that will realign the next moment. More to the point, Dasein’s identity never exists as an immaterial entity in his mind, rather it emerges through his embodied acts while relating to others. Philosophers and hermeneutic psychotherapists who reject the mind-body dualism state that is another significant contrast between ontological hermeneutics and mainstream counseling.|$|E

500|$|Another {{point of}} {{conflict}} concerning Nulls is that they violate the closed world assumption model of relational databases by introducing an open world assumption into it. [...] The closed world assumption, {{as it pertains to}} databases, states that [...] "Everything stated by the database, either explicitly or implicitly, is true; everything else is false." [...] This view assumes that the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> stored within a database is complete. [...] Nulls, however, operate under the open world assumption, in which some items stored in the database are considered unknown, making the database's stored <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> incomplete.|$|E

He also considered the ways a player explores the world and discovers new areas as an exploration narrative. As each player had different experience, they hoped that those players would collaborate to expand upon their <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> To that effect, the team built a community site as an online social environment for players to communicate.

These poems present the poet as solitary figure who was faced some unnamed transforming childhood event. Poe adopted some of the common themes of the day, including imagery of heavenly bliss and angelic beauty. He steps away from the typical use of didacticism of the time and instead focuses on psychological reverie and symbolist aesthetics, beginning his lifelong poetic refusal to write for the masses. Poe would continue to revisit themes of death, beauty, love, and pride in his later works. He would later rewrite one poem, [...] "Imitation", as [...] "A Dream Within a Dream" [...] and use images from [...] "Evening Star" [...] in [...] "Ulalume".|$|E

Duncan's mother left San Francisco and settled her four children in Oakland, little knowing that Coolbrith would soon meet one of her children, and help the young dancer develop a wider <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through reading.

500|$|Xenogears nine playable {{characters}} {{hail from}} {{different areas of}} the game's world. The game begins on Ignas, a continent with two countries, Aveh and Kislev. Fei and Citan at first appear to be from this land, although it is later learned that they originate from the capital cities Aphel Aura and Etrenank of the floating countries of Shevat and Solaris, respectively. Fei is the story's protagonist, and has initially lost his memories of his past. Citan is a man whose <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and technology often aids in the party's quest. Bart, a desert pirate, is also from Ignas and is the rightful heir to the throne of Aveh. Rico, a demi-human with incredible strength, lives in a Kislev prison, spending his days as a gear-battling champion. Solaris, a hidden city of advanced technology, is home to several characters in the game. Billy, a pious worker for the Ethos religious group, was originally from Solaris. Elly, a beautiful Gebler officer of Solaris, is destined to be near Fei and falls in love with him {{by the end of the}} game. Maria and Chu-Chu are both from Shevat, the floating city and the only place resisting Solaris' domination. Emeralda is a humanoid being constructed by an ancient civilization from a colony of nanomachines, and was retrieved from the ruins of the ancient civilization Zeboim. Significant non-playable characters include Krelian and Miang, both leaders of Solaris who seek to revive Deus, a mechanical weapon that fell to earth thousands of years ago. They serve as the game's main antagonists. Grahf, a mysterious man with immense power, serves as a major antagonist he follows Fei and his group and often fights them, though his goals remain a mystery until very late in the game. As being the Contact, the Anti-type and the Complement, Fei, Elly, and Miang have been reincarnated several times throughout the game's history.|$|E
