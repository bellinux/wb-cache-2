40|$|In theory, {{workplace}} wellness programs {{offer an}} important {{public health and}} policy opportunity to improve {{the health of the}} working population, encourage prevention, and lower the cost of healthcare. However, the success of these programs is highly dependent on the level of participation, the effect on health claims costs, on medical utilization, and the resulting decrease in health risk behaviors as a result of participation in the program. This three-paper dissertation evaluates a workplace wellness program in California that uses a financial incentive to recruit people to participate. The study is a two-year observational cohort study utilizing data provided by Blue Shield of California Health Insurance Plan from their Healthy Lifestyle Rewards (HLR) program. Demographic, claims, and medical utilization data from a subset of 8, 003 participants in 2006 and 2007 are compared with a control group of non-participants. Program exposure and Wellness Assessment survey data is available for a subset of the participating population. Paper 1 evaluates the determinants of employee participation and retention in the program from 2006 to 2007. The analysis finds that lower-income and high-risk employees have greater odds of participating <b>in</b> <b>HLR</b> as compared to high-income employees. Participation <b>in</b> <b>HLR</b> is significantly related to medication usage for two chronic conditions: high cholesterol, and depression. Paper 2 evaluates the effect of participating <b>in</b> <b>HLR</b> on health care utilization and medical claims. The results find that participation <b>in</b> <b>HLR</b> <b>in</b> 2006 was associated with significant declines in all measures of outpatient utilization (including non-institutional physician and non-physician claims, and physician visits) in the following year. There were no significant effects on claims spending for cholesterol and depression medications, or in utilization in the categories of emergency department visits, and inpatient admissions. HLR may serve as a substitute for some forms of outpatient physician and non-physician care, most likely acting as an informational resource. Paper 3 evaluates the impact of participating <b>in</b> <b>HLR</b> on modifiable health risks. The results find that the use of specific HLR help modules is associated with a significant improvement in many biometric and health risk factors. Participants <b>in</b> <b>HLR</b> exercised more frequently, consistently ate more fruits and vegetables, and reported lower stress levels. Overall, it is found that HLR reduces health care expenditures and decreases medical utilization without a detectable effect of negative health behaviors or increased health risks. These findings suggest that promoting workplace wellness programs may be a promising component of comprehensive health care reform...|$|R

At larger currents the time and current dependent huge longitudinal resistance (HLR) is always initiated at the transition. Transport <b>in</b> the <b>HLR</b> regime is linear and the amount of current-induced nuclear polarization <b>in</b> the <b>HLR</b> is comparable to the thermal nuclear polarization at approximate to 20 mK and 10 T.

40|$|Personal Communication Service (PCS) {{network is}} the {{integration}} of cellular Network and conventional wired network. To support user mobility, {{the locations of the}} mobile stations (MSs) should be constantly tracked using a database. The widespread deployment of PCS will lead to a tremendous {{increase in the number of}} updates and queries to the location database. The centralized, stand-alone Home Location Register (<b>HLR)</b> <b>in</b> GSM can be a potential bottleneck. In case of the location database failure, incoming calls may be lost. According to the analysis of the load <b>in</b> <b>HLR,</b> we suggest replicating the <b>HLR</b> <b>in</b> order to increase its capacity and reliability. In this paper we evaluate the effects of the number of replicas in terms of query response time, misrouting probability of incoming calls and average cost per query. Another issue incurred in the replicated databases is data consistency. A concurrency control protocol called preemptive Read-One-Write-All (PROWA) protocol is also proposed...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical and manual leaf {{removal of}} Nero d Avola vines {{were carried out}} in a {{commercial}} vineyard in Sclafani Bagni area, Sicily (South Italy), in the 2007 growing season. Rows were North East-South West oriented and vines were spur pruned and non-irrigated. The aim {{was to investigate the}} effects of two different ways of defoliation on plant physiology, vegetative parameters, yield and grape quality in a warm temperature area. Fruit zone defoliation consisted of mechanical (MLR) and hand leaf removal (HLR), applied either to both sides of the canopy (Northweast and Southeast). These treatments were applied when the berries had reached pea size and compared to a non-defoliated treatment (control). Hand and mechanical leaf removal caused different and significant reduction in leaf area per shoot modifying leaf-to-fruit ratio. Different vegetative activity was showed among the treatments during the vegetative season (from pea size to harvest). Consequently, differences in canopy architecture were measured at pea size and harvest. Photosynthetic activity of primary leaves was higher in leaf removal treatments than <b>in</b> non-defoliated. <b>In</b> <b>HLR</b> must sugar (°Brix) tended to increase during ripeness process, but at harvest no significant differences among treatments were found. Skin total anthocyanins was lower <b>in</b> <b>HLR</b> and the control vines showed the highest values. Leaf removal had effect on variability between the two canopy sides (Northeast/Southwest) for total anthocyanins and flavonoids. In this study leaf removal at pea size did not modify significantly grape quality of Nero d Avola...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} peculiarities of acute {{respiratory}} disease in children, depending {{on the presence of}} hyperplasia of lymphopharyngeal ring (HLR). Materials and methods. A total of 100 children 3 – 6 years old (the average age of 4 years and 10 months) with clinical manifestations of acute respiratory infections. Formed two groups of observations: Group 1 — the children who suffering acute respiratory infections <b>in</b> the background <b>HLR</b> (n= 50); Group 2 — the children who suffering acute respiratory infections without HLR (n= 50). Results. Have HLR is accompanied by an increase in the duration and severity of acute respiratory infections in children of preschool age. <b>In</b> children <b>HLR</b> doubles the risk of complications from acute respiratory infections, and the possibility of various degrees of conductive hearing loss is three times higher than their peers without <b>HLR.</b> <b>In</b> nasal mucous <b>in</b> children with <b>HLR</b> show a more pronounced inflammatory process in the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract with the direct participation of bacteria in the pathological process. Conclusions. For children of preschool age the presence of HLR is accompanied by an increase in the duration and severity of acute respiratory disease with the development of bacterial complications. ...|$|R

40|$|Three lab-scale vertical-flow {{constructed}} wetlands (VFCWs), {{including the}} non-aerated (NA), intermittently aerated (IA) and continuously aerated (CA) ones, were operated at different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) {{to evaluate the}} effect of artificial aeration on the treatment efficiency of heavily polluted river water. Results indicated that artificial aeration increased the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in IA and CA, which significantly favored the removal of organic matter and NH 4 +-N. The DO grads caused by intermittent aeration formed aerobic and anoxic regions in IA and thus promoted the removal of total nitrogen (TN). Although the removal efficiencies of CODCr, NH 4 +-N and TN in the three VFCWs all decreased with an increase <b>in</b> <b>HLR,</b> artificial aeration enhanced the reactor resistance to the fluctuation of pollutant loadings. The maximal removal efficiencies of CODCr, NH 4 +-N and total phosphorus (TP) (i. e., 81 %, 87 % and 37 %, respectively) were observed in CA at 19 cm/day HLR, while the maximal TN removal (i. e., 57 %) was achieved in 1 A. Although the improvement of artificial aeration on TP removal was limited, {{this study has demonstrated}} the feasibility of applying artificial aeration to VFCWs treating polluted river water, particularly at a high HLR...|$|R
