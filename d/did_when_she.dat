5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was younger as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They {{get married and have}} two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E
25|$|Kngwarreye {{went through}} many {{different}} individual styles in her short {{career as a}} professional painter. In 1992, she began to join the dots into lines with parallel horizontal and vertical stripes, representing rivers and terrain, in many different colours. She began using larger brushes than previously. Her later paintings were based on much larger dots than the finer, more intricate work which she <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> started.|$|E
25|$|King {{notes that}} the {{eighteenth-century}} definition for “publisher” could also mean “bookseller.” King is uncertain whether Haywood produced the books and pamphlets that she sold (as Spedding indicates) or {{if she was a}} bookseller, especially for Haywood’s early productions. Haywood sometimes collaborated on publishing matters in order to share the costs, as she <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> collaborated with Cogan on the publication of The Virtuous Villager. In any case, Haywood was most certainly a bookseller {{due to the fact that}} there were a great number and variety of works “to be had” at the Sign of Fame that did not bare her imprint.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] was filmed in October 1994 at the San Antonio Amtrak station. Produced by Summit Productions, the video {{was directed by}} Sean Roberts. Shooting took four days to complete. Jack Morgan was the on-set photographer, and Diego Aguilar produced the video. Selena wore the same dress that she <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> won a Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Album in 1994. Veronica Flores, {{a reporter for the}} San Antonio Express-News, was asked to make a cameo appearance as a wedding guest. American model Freddie Martinez portrayed Selena's love interest after auditioning for the role in San Antonio.|$|E
500|$|As part of Why Not? with Shania Twain, she {{arranged}} a session with music producer David Foster, hoping to collaborate on [...] "Today Is Your Day". Although she felt skeptical, Twain visited vocal coach Eric Vetro {{to prepare for}} her session with Foster. Twain and Vetro executed vocal exercises to loosen up the tension and tightness in her vocal chords. [...] "The goal is to free up, to let go. She has {{to take all of}} that tension and tightness that she's been feeling for so long, and transform it to free herself from it. And to start singing from her heart again, the way she <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was a little girl, when she started," [...] Vetro stated. He also opined that Twain was ready to return to her music career. Twain learned beneficial vocal techniques and appreciated Vetro's understanding of her psyche.|$|E
500|$|Danielle {{was killed}} off minutes after {{revealing}} her true identity to Ronnie, dying in her mother's arms. Although different outcomes to the storyline were considered, Santer explained that Danielle dying best preserved Ronnie's status as EastEnders [...] "tragic heroine character". Treadwell-Collins felt that to allow Ronnie {{to have her}} daughter, the [...] "one thing that is key to her character" [...] would serve to progressively weaken her character, and Santer agreed that while it may initially be touching, ultimately the relationship would become boring. The scene in which Danielle dies was filmed during winter, but as it was set in early April, snow had to be cleared away from the set before filming could commence. A body double {{was used for the}} moment Danielle was run over. Although sad to leave, Crace felt that the story's conclusion was the right one, and was glad that Ronnie and Danielle finally shared a brief moment in the end, explaining: [...] "It was so important that that tender moment was finally found, because that's all people wanted. It's all Danielle wanted, and it's all Ronnie wants." [...] Crace concluded: [...] "I think Danielle will leave quite a big mark on the Square and on the people in the Square – probably a bigger mark than she <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was alive.|$|E

500|$|Kelly and Darryl’s {{continuing}} relationship {{proves to}} be dysfunctional, as she cannot comprehend his candor, and he finds her to be attractive yet [...] "crazy." [...] Creed Bratton (played by the real-life Creed Bratton) advises Michael to declare bankruptcy, which Michael does literally by walking {{into the office and}} shouting [...] "I declare bankruptcy!", thinking this was all he needed to do. Upon reviewing Michael's financial situation, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) finds that Michael spends a large amount on useless items like magic kits and bass fishing equipment. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam feel sorry for Dwight and attempt to cheer him up by posting a positive review of his bed & breakfast on TripAdvisor.com, which pleases him. [...] However, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) gains Angela's approval to ask her out on a date by giving her the cat (named Garbage) that Dwight had tried to give Angela earlier, sending Dwight spiraling into crushing depression. Dwight retreats to the stairwell to moan. Jim joins him and recounts his days pining for Pam and how miserable it made him feel, saying he would not wish it on his worst enemy, Dwight included, to experience it, and Dwight realizes that he is not without friends. Having re-opened his old memories, Jim re-enters the office, goes right to Pam and kisses her passionately, and indirectly confesses {{in an interview that he}} loves her. Jim is quietly pleased when Dwight returns to his desk along with his annoying and overbearing personality. Jan learns of Michael's dismal finances by phone, and immediately harangues Michael about being irresponsible. [...] He panics and attempts to hop a nearby train. [...] However, the train is slowing down and comes to a complete halt, upon which he is seen sitting on the train singing to himself. Jan speeds to the office and Oscar tells her in which direction Michael ran. She then runs to the train yard. She tells him that she will stand by him as he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was fired. Eventually, they leave the train yard hand in hand.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{before saying}} their [...] "I do's" [...] Erica finds out {{she has a}} {{daughter}} she conceived from rape {{at the age of}} fourteen, Kendall Hart. Erica tells Dimitri what happened all those years ago. This is the first time she told anyone besides Eric Kane and she is grateful he does not say she deserved it like her father <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> told him. They bring Kendall into their home as a part of their family. Despite this, Kendall hates her mother for putting her up for adoption and also becomes infatuated with Dimitri. She attempts to sabotage their wedding by burning Dimitri and Angelique's divorce papers. Dimitri's divorce still goes through and his wedding to Erica goes off without a hitch. The young woman wants to find her biological father which Erica is dead set against. Dimitri tries to help Kendall in her search, putting a strain on his marriage.

Suffering from hallucinations of her own rape, Erica stabs her husband with a letter opener. Dimitri divorces Erica and wants her in prison for what she did but also admits he still loves her.|$|E

[...] Conan O'Brien discussed Rivers' legacy with fellow comedian and lifelong friend Chris Hardwick on Conan, while Seth Meyers recalled Rivers' appearance on his talk show, saying, [...] "I have not sat next to anyone who told more jokes faster than Joan Rivers <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was here." [...] And on The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart noted her contributions: [...] "There are very few people in my business that you can say are, or were, actually groundbreaking talents. Joan Rivers was one of them." [...] Radio host Howard Stern, who delivered her funeral eulogy, devoted an entire one-hour show to Rivers.
