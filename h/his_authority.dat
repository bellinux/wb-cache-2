5|$|According to Diodorus, some 7,000 Illyrians {{died in the}} battle. The Illyrians {{withdrew from}} Macedon and sued for peace.

50|$|Therefore, {{the author}} {{must have been}} active before 1750CE. Since he cites amongst <b>his</b> <b>authorities</b> Ibn Shahin, who {{composed}} his major work in 1453CE, we know that Naysaburi must have been active after the mid-15th century.|$|R

50|$|The inquisitor {{saw to it}} {{that his}} {{convictions}} became known to <b>his</b> <b>authorities</b> in Rome and to the Grand Master. He was not of course prepared to sit pretty while such an affront was levelled against the authority of the Church.|$|R

5|$|He {{supported}} {{the claims of}} Rod Marsh to the Australian captaincy over the incumbent, Kim Hughes, in the early 1980s.

60|$|It by {{no means}} follows, however, that it is {{therefore}} apocryphal; indeed, Mr. Fynney assured {{me that it was}} quite true, although, if he gave me <b>his</b> <b>authorities,</b> I cannot remember them after a lapse of more than thirty years.|$|R
50|$|Also in 635, Emperor Gaozu died, and Emperor Taizong, {{observing a}} {{mourning}} period, briefly had Li Chengqian serve as regent, {{and after he}} resumed <b>his</b> <b>authorities</b> {{less than two months}} later, he still authorized Li Chengqian to thereafter rule on minor matters.|$|R

5|$|Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson (retrospectively) {{delegated}} <b>his</b> <b>authority</b> {{from the}} President under the War Powers Act of 1941 in a memorandum to Groves dated April 17, 1944. Groves delegated {{the authority to}} Nichols, except that contracts of $5 million or more required <b>his</b> <b>authority.</b> The written authority was only given in 1944 when Nichols was about to sign a contract with Du Pont, and {{it was found that}} Nichols original authority to sign project contracts from Colonel Marshall was based on a verbal authority from Styer, and Nichols only had the low delegated authority of a divisional engineer.|$|E
60|$|What a {{loss that}} Fuller {{has not made}} a {{reference}} to <b>his</b> <b>authorities</b> for this assertion! I am sure he could have found none in the New Testament, but facts that imply, and, {{in the absence of}} all such proof, prove the contrary.|$|R
50|$|Galen, {{also in the}} 2nd century, {{likewise}} {{endorsed the}} extramission theory. Due to <b>his</b> medical <b>authority,</b> <b>his</b> view held considerable influence in Europe {{for much of the}} following thousand years.|$|R

5|$|A large temple also owned sizable {{tracts of}} land and {{employed}} thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic as well as religious centers. The priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence, and despite their ostensible subordination to the king they may have posed significant challenges to <b>his</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} John V. A. Fine, Shishman {{may have}} established <b>his</b> <b>authority</b> over the Vidin region {{as early as}} the 1270s, after the death of the previous lord of that area, Jacob Svetoslav. He was perhaps elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was likely a close relative, perhaps even a brother, of George Terter I.|$|E
5|$|Although the pharaoh {{delegated}} <b>his</b> <b>authority,</b> {{the performance}} of temple rituals was still an official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests.

5|$|Andrew II {{decided to}} return home, leaving the crusaders' camp with Hugh I and Bohemond IV in early 1218. Although {{military}} action was suspended after their departure, the crusaders restored fortifications at Caesarea and Atlit. After new troops arrived from the Holy Roman Empire in April, they decided to invade Egypt. They elected John supreme commander, giving him the right to rule the land they would conquer. His leadership was primarily nominal, since he could rarely impose <b>his</b> <b>authority</b> on an army of troops from many countries.|$|E
5|$|Before he died, López Salcedo {{appointed}} contador Andrés de Cerezeda as his successor. Cerezada {{was unable}} to impose <b>his</b> <b>authority</b> over the residents of Trujillo, with two rival claimants struggling for power.

In reality, it was Vasco de Herrera who wielded true authority over the province.|$|E

During the {{following}} years, Ivan and Stephen coordinated their diplomacy, which enabled Ivan to persuade Alexander {{to acknowledge the}} loss of significant territories to Moscow in February 1494.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{part of the}} {{corridor}} is protected from oil and gas activities. On January 27, 2015, President Obama, using <b>his</b> <b>authorities</b> under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, permanently withdrew the waters 3 to 25 miles offshore from future oil and gas leasing activities. This action leaves the valuable waters 25 to 50 miles offshore unprotected.|$|R
50|$|In 339, Zhang Jun {{transferred}} some of <b>his</b> <b>authorities</b> to <b>his</b> heir apparent, Zhang Chonghua.
