25|$|Kriyamana is <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{produce in}} the current life. All kriyamana karmas flow in to sanchita karma and {{consequently}} shape our future. Only in human life we can change our future destiny. After death we lose Kriya Shakti (ability to act) and do (kriyamana) karma until we are born again in another human body.|$|E
25|$|Theology in the Flesh {{shows that}} biblical writers used {{a wide array}} of metaphors to {{understand}} topics such as sin, salvation, and God. Salvation, for example, is thought of in terms of release from slavery, as friendship with God, as healing, as returning from the dead, and as finding your way home to list but a few. No single metaphor says <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can say about salvation and so multiple metaphors are needed. There are often several legitimate ways, within constraints, for Christians to understand a topic. The book provides lots of examples of how different Christian communities, over time and across cultures, use different metaphors for salvation and so arrive at conflicting theological positions.|$|E
25|$|Richard Dawkins {{outlines}} in The Selfish Gene (1976) {{that humans}} are machines made of genes and genes are the grounding for everything we do. The gene-centric view outlines that natural selection, evolution and all behaviour must {{be traced back to}} the survival of competing genes as an extension of Darwin’s theory being the survival of competing individuals. The main goal of individuals, coming from the instinct of our genes, is to reproduce and thrive, where thriving involves protection, conquering competition and future growth. Therefore, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do relates to thriving in our environment above competition, including the way we consume as a form of survival in our environment when simply purchasing the basic physiological needs of food, water and warmth. We also consume to thrive above others, for example in conspicuous consumption where a luxury car represents money and high social status and the application of makeup makes the person and their genes seem more attractive and worthy of passing to offspring.|$|E

Adapting the vertical transmitting [...] "arrowhead", folded twin-dipole antenna design on {{the nose of the}} aircraft, from Hanbury Brown's work with the Mk. III eliminated any remaining problems. In its first operational tests in July 1940, the new AI Mk. IV demonstrated the ability to detect another Blenheim at a range of [...] and continued to track it down to a minimum of 500. Hanbury Brown stated that [...] "it did <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had originally hoped that airborne radar would do for night-fighting". He went on to note that even though Mk.

500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV, Beyoncé stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, [...] " [...] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wanted it to be." [...] For {{the music of the}} album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Destiny Fulfilled is predominantly an R concept album tracing a woman's relationship journey. Critics further found elements of soul music, dance and hip-hop. The album is mostly composed of mid and slowtempo balladry following the opening two songs; Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that the ballads showcased [...] "the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.|$|E
500|$|In the 2012 presidential campaign, {{during which}} he {{acknowledged}} {{it was unlikely that}} he would win the Republican Party nomination, Paul again asserted that he was participating in the Republican Party on his own terms, trying to persuade the rest of the party to move toward his positions rather than joining in with theirs. He expressed doubt that he would support any of his rivals should they win the nomination, warning that, “If the policies of the Republican Party are the same as the Democrat Party and they don't want to change anything on foreign policy, they don't want to cut anything, they don't want to audit the Fed and find out about monetary policy, they don't want to have actual change in government, that is a problem for me." [...] On that same theme he said in another interview, [...] "I would be reluctant to jump on board and tell all of the supporters that have given me trust and money that all of a sudden, I'd say, [...] we've done is for naught. So, let's support anybody at all … even if they disagree with <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do." ...|$|E

500|$|Director Jennifer Lee {{strongly}} {{believed that}} there couldn't be any other Anna but Kristen Bell, saying, [...] "It was definitely a wonderful surprise hearing her voice , not knowing {{that she had been}} classically trained. Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She was <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could've hoped for Anna." [...] Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, [...] "Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person that we saw. We did a lot of casting to find Anna, but she just hit it out of the park. From the beginning we loved her, and she just kind of became Anna and Anna became her. I don't know which one is which." [...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could. Anna's animator Becky Bresee commented that Bell's voice [...] "lends itself well, so you are taking bits and pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{difference}} between The Oracle and other albums Godsmack has released in the past ten years, Sully Erna stated that, [...] "Our previous records always had various influences that we tried to have surface in the music. But this record is much more true to the heart. It is filled with <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have built our success on. Raw, tough, powerful grooves and big vocal melodies." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the bonus}} {{content for the}} November 2011 issue of Guitar World, Matt Heafy talked about why the band decided to record this album in Drop D♭ as opposed to Drop D. [...] "For the whole record of 'In Waves' we're in Drop D♭, so it's kind of like (Ascendency), just a half step lower, and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do {{from all of the}} albums is half a step flat. It's mainly for the vocals. (It's) not that I can't sing higher, it's just easier with the amount of shows we do." ...|$|E

However, he spent the whole race towards the back of the grid, and finished 14th after qualifying in 16th. After the race, he paid tribute to Renault, saying that he wanted [...] "to thank the entire team for <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have achieved together", and wanted to concentrate on the positives during his time with Renault, which had included winning the [...] and [...] world championship titles. He finished ninth in the drivers standings overall, scoring all of Renault's 26 points during the season. As a result, Renault only finished eighth in the constructors ahead of two other teams, Force India and Toro Rosso.|$|E
2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP's cover read [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese!" [...] According to Durango, [...] "We didn't want to sit there and screw people. If we felt it wasn't as good, then we should just be honest about it." [...] Indeed, Headache recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on Atomizer, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively.

[...] We were playing hardball back and forth with the label and that's why that record ... it was a difficult period for us. We were all pretty pissed off and angry and that shows in the music. Our budget got slashed for that record just because of the fact that we had not re-signed. I think it came down to [...] "Well, re-sign now or this is your budget because that's what is says in your contract." [...] You can't argue with that. We didn't re-sign.
