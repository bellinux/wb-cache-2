Scorpio intends to have Bont killed with a laser, but Bont uses a coin to free himself from his {{restraints}} before attempting to flee. However, Homer, who is unaware of events, easily knocks him down, allowing Scorpio's soldiers to shoot the agent. A proud Scorpio happily thanks Homer for a job well done. At dinner, Homer proudly tells of his successes at work, but discovers that his family hates Cypress Creek and {{want to go back}} to Springfield. At first, Homer is opposed to this, saying that he has been doing a <b>great</b> <b>job</b> for the first time in his life, but nobody else is happy. Dejected, Homer decides to visit Scorpio back at Globex Headquarters. His visit coincides with an assault by the U.S. military, but Homer still remains oblivious to what is taking place. He finds Scorpio, explains the situation, and asks what to do. Scorpio advises Homer that he should do what is best for his family.|$|E

25|$|In June 2009, G4 Canada Canada {{launched}} Adult Digital Distraction, a programing block featuring many Adult Swim shows. In late 2011, {{the block}} was discontinued due {{to pressure from}} the CRTC {{on account of the}} channel deviating from its original format (which was to air technology-related programming). The block had briefly been relaunched featuring Tim and Eric Awesome Show, <b>Great</b> <b>Job!,</b> Eagleheart, , Delocated, Metalocalypse, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Superjail!, and The Venture Bros. but was once again discontinued in 2012.|$|E
25|$|To date, the Adult Swim lineup on The Comedy Channel {{has grown}} {{considerably}} with the block now airing every Saturday from 12 to 2 am AEST and 6:30 to 7:30pm AEST to keep {{with the late}} night tradition of the former block. The new incarnation also premiered {{a lot of other}} Adult Swim shows including Moral Orel, Titan Maximum, , Frisky Dingo, Tim and Eric Awesome Show <b>Great</b> <b>Job</b> and Childrens Hospital (airing uncensored with profanity intact), along with the latest additions but aired at a different time, Metalocalypse and The Venture Bros, the latter making it the third show with Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Harvey Birdman to have been aired on both {{the old and the new}} block.|$|E
25|$|The Comedy Central {{television}} show Strangers with Candy (1999–2000), starring comedian Amy Sedaris, was a camp spoof of the ABC Afterschool Special genre. The ESPN Classic show Cheap Seats without Ron Parker (2004–2006) featured two Generation-X, real-life brothers making humorous observations while watching televised camp sporting events, which had often been featured on ABC's Wide World of Sports during the 1970s. Examples include a 1970s sport that attempted to combine ballet with skiing (ski ballet), the Harlem Globetrotters holding a televised exhibition {{game at the}} notorious Attica State Prison in upstate New York, small-time regional professional wrestling and roller derby. The television series Tim & Eric Awesome Show, <b>Great</b> <b>Job!</b> (2007–2010) is a current example of camp, using inspiration from Public-access television productions, early morning infomercials, {{and the use of}} celebrity status in telethons and other televised charity appeals.|$|E

25|$|The British Rallycross Grand Prix {{has come}} and gone in recent years, but none of the modern incarnations have come close to the 'real' Grand Prix, the {{versions}} of the event run at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994. The Rallycross Grand Prix was, in essence, an open-house, end of season, free for all. If you had a Rallycross car and fancied racing in the Grand Prix, you could make your entry and have a go. This led to some wonderful events and the chance to see unusual cars and star drivers; Denis Marcel's beautiful Matra Murena, unlikely and surprisingly fast NSUs from Norway, Stig Blomqvist wheeling out his privately owned Audi Quattro, sportscar ace Cor Euser doing a <b>great</b> <b>job</b> in a MG Metro 6R4, etc. The Grand Prix was different; it stood out from the crowd and appealed to competitors because it wasn’t just another event. Being Brands Hatch helped, geographically it was good and the circuit put all of its marketing and PR effort into making something of the event.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{allegedly}} {{killed his}} first {{man in a}} duel— a second lieutenant in the Mexican Army, whom he killed {{as a result of}} a dispute with a prostitute. At sixteen, Horn headed to the American Southwest, where he was hired by the U.S. Cavalry as a civilian scout, packer and interpreter under Al Sieber during the Apache Wars. Horn did a <b>great</b> <b>job</b> in his work for the army, and soon he rose through the ranks. In one instance, as Sieber, Horn, and the army were crossing the Cibicue Creek, they were ambushed by Apaches warriors positioned on high ground. The officer in charge of their squad, Captain Edmund Hentig, was instantly killed, and the men became pinned down under overwhelming fire. Desperate, Sieber ordered Horn and another scout, Mickey Free, to break away and return fire from a hill. Together with the soldiers, the men managed to repel the attack. Tom Horn and Al Sieber participated during the Battle of Big Dry Wash, and gained recognition when he and Lt. George H. Morgan slipped through the banks opposite of the Apache line, and provided covering fire for the cavalry as well as killing a number of Apaches warriors.|$|E

40|$|There is {{some debate}} whether job strain or working hours is more {{prominent}} in explaining work–family conflict. We tested a multi-group {{structural equation model}} and the results suggested the model was equally applicable to academic and administrative staff employed at an Australian regional university. After controlling for demographic and work-related factors the main predictors of work–family conflict were: job strain, total work hours, job satisfaction, employment as an academic and having dependent children. Social support was negatively related with work–family conflict but the association was not significant. Despite <b>greater</b> <b>job</b> control, academics reported <b>greater</b> <b>job</b> strain and work hours.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of mentor matching on job attitudes {{and the extent to}} which this relationship was mediated by the amount of gay-specific mentor functions gay and lesbian workers receive and further influenced by the centrality of a gay or lesbian individual's sexual identity.

Having a mentor, regardless of whether the mentor was gay or heterosexual, however, did not appear related to gay and lesbian workers' organizational commitment. No support was found for the proposed mediator and moderator variables. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} examines {{relationships between}} working conditions, family relationships, {{job satisfaction and}} work motivation of Myanmar seafarers. Seafaring is a hazardous occupation and has to conduct with uncertain conditions and bad weather. Moreover, seafarers faced isolation, far from family and society. Nevertheless, the seafarer occupation is still in demand in Myanmar. Thus, an online self-completion questionnaire is distributed through social media to describe lives of Myanmar seafarers which focus on their working conditions, family relationships, job satisfaction and work motivation. From this study, there are some conclusions after data analysis. First, better working conditions generates <b>greater</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction of Myanmar seafarers. Second, the better family relationships not generate <b>greater</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction of Myanmar seafarers. Thereafter, work motivation generates stronger relationship between working conditions and job satisfaction...|$|R
