The system also reduces reliance on satellite technology because a <b>guiding</b> <b>wheel</b> track for the next pass is automatically laid down. With implements mostly contained within its wheel track, part width operations, for example ploughing or root crop harvesting, are perfectly feasible, whereas with existing tractor systems they are not.|$|E

Each electroactive bending actuator is operatively connected to the membrane for controlling membrane position.

40|$|A {{reconfigurable}} modular planetary {{robot system}} (RMPRS) {{consists of a}} parent body and multiple asymmetric wheel-manipulator child-robots. As an agent, the child-robot independently performs locomotion and manipulation. The child-robots have reconfigurable capability so {{that a group of}} child-robots are combined to a variety of conflgurations. Moreover, the child-robot gives output in different forms under various constraint conditions from one driving force. Utilizing this characteristic, it can cross an obstacle automatically. But the <b>guiding</b> <b>wheel</b> and the arm have fatal influence on the height of the obstacle that the child-robot can cross. A motion planning method for highly improving the capability of crossing an obstacle for the child-robot is proposed, which makes use of the environment and the posture of arm.

40|$|An {{ever-increasing}} {{number of}} cables and pipelines are being {{laid on the}} bottom of lakes, channels, rivers, seas, and oceans. Various hazards threaten these pipelines and cables, which in case of occurrence can cause (severe) environmental and/or economic damage. Pipelines and cables can be protected against these attacks by dumping protective rock layers over the pipelines or cables. The main hazard concerning this research is the attack of a dragging anchor preceded by the cutting process of the anchor chain while dragged over / through the rock cover. For dragging anchors the effect of any lifting force is detrimental to its holding capacity. A good design of the rock cover can reduce the cutting of an anchor chain in the rock cover, resulting in an earlier lifting of the anchor. No generally applicable design tool exists for dimensioning these rock covers and especially in relation to anchor chains. Therefore the objective is set to find and test a theoretically based relation for the interaction between an anchor chain and a protective rock layer. The simplified solutions for describing the interaction between an anchor chain and clay are used as a basis for the interaction between the chain and rocks. The interaction forces are described as uniformly distributed forces in parallel and lateral directions of the anchor chain. There are several types of rock covers feasible but the loosely dumped rock cover on top of the existing seabed is chosen for this research. The bearing capacity of the rock berm is modelled as the bearing capacity of a strip footing on a shallow foundation. Since the bearing capacity equations do not provide information of loads in the lateral direction to the strip footing the formulas are adjusted to the research situation. A theoretical model with dimensionless normalized axis is used. The model describes a failure curve with all possible combinations of parallel and lateral forces applied to the rock berm by the anchor chain and normalised by the bearing capacity of the rock berm. A physical model has been designed to validate the theoretical model. In the physical model five different anchor chains have been dragged through three different sizes of rock covers with a few different constant anchor holding capacities. The forces {{on both sides of the}} rock cover are indirectly measured by the load cells on both sides of the model. The guiding wheels in the model cause significant friction in the model during dragging. In experiments without the presence of a rock cover a friction factor is determined to quantify the force loss over a <b>guiding</b> <b>wheel.</b> This friction factor lies within a range of 0. 10 <friction factor< 0. 16. It turned out that this friction factor has a major influence on every single data point when plotted in the theoretical model plot. However correlation is found between the data sets acquired by the experiments and the normalized failure curve presented above with the use of a semi-arbitrarily determined friction factor for each experiment. The semi-arbitrarily friction factor lies within the range specified above and is only changed when structural modifications to the model are made. The bearing capacity of the rock berm, which is mainly influenced by the effective width of the anchor chain and the internal friction angle of the rocks, only determines the location of the acquired data in the theoretical model plot. Different bearing capacities scale the dataset into the origin. Because of the uncertainty of the exact bearing capacity of the rock cover research on this subject is recommended. With the bearing capacity known the location of the acquired dataset on the theoretical normal plot can be determined. It is also recommended to do new physical model tests in which the forces on both sides of the rock berm can be directly measured eliminating the effect of friction in guiding wheels.
