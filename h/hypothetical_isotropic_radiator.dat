As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we show the first isotropic source with omnidirectional radiation from a dipole source (applicable to all distributed sources), which can open up several possibilities in axion electrodynamics, optical illusion, novel transformation-optic devices, wireless communication, and antenna engineering. Owing to the electric-field-driven LC resonator realization scheme, this principle can be readily applied to higher frequency regimes where magnetism is usually not present...|$|R

2500|$|Antenna gain is {{sometimes}} measured as decibels {{relative to a}} half-wave dipole, {{which means that the}} antenna in question is being compared to a dipole, and has a certain amount of gain relative to a dipole antenna tuned to the same operating frequency. In this case, one says the antenna has a gain of [...] "x dBd" [...] (see decibel). More often, gains are expressed relative to an <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator,</b> which is an imaginary antenna that radiates equally in all directions. In this case one uses dBi instead of dBd (see decibel). As it is impossible to build an <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator,</b> gain measurements expressed relative to a dipole are more practical when a reference dipole aerial is used for experimental measurements. 0 dBd is often considered equal to 2.15 dBi.|$|R
5000|$|However a true <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator</b> {{cannot be}} built, so in {{practice}} a different antenna is used. This will often be a half-wave dipole, a very well understood and repeatable antenna {{that can be}} easily built for any frequency. The directive gain of a half-wave dipole is known to be 1.64 and it can be made nearly 100% efficient. Since the gain has been measured with respect to this reference antenna, the difference in the gain of the test antenna is often compared to that of the dipole. The [...] "gain relative to a dipole" [...] is thus often quoted and is denoted using [...] "dBd" [...] instead of [...] "dBi" [...] to avoid confusion. Therefore, in terms of the true gain (relative to an <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator)</b> G, this figure for the gain is given by: ...|$|R
2500|$|... dBi: dB(isotropic) – {{the forward}} gain of an antenna {{compared}} with the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>isotropic</b> antenna, which uniformly distributes energy in all directions. Linear polarization of the EM field is assumed unless noted otherwise.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore, {{an antenna}} with a peak power gain of 5 would {{be said to}} have a gain of 7 dBi. [...] "dBi" [...] is used rather than just [...] "dB" [...] to {{emphasize}} that this is the gain according to the basic definition, in which the antenna is compared to an <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{electromagnetic}} radiation is dipole radiation, {{it is not}} possible to build an antenna that radiates coherently equally in all directions, although such a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>isotropic</b> antenna is used as a reference to calculate antenna gain.|$|R
50|$|Isotropic {{radiation}} has {{the same}} intensity regardless of the direction of measurement, and an isotropic field exerts the same action regardless of how the test particle is oriented. It radiates uniformly in all directions from a point source sometimes called an <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator.</b> The radiation may be electromagnetic, audio or composed of other elementary particles.|$|R
25|$|In reality, a {{coherent}} <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator</b> of linear polarization {{can be shown}} to be impossible. Its radiation field could not be consistent with the Helmholtz wave equation (derived from Maxwell's equations) in all directions simultaneously. Consider a large sphere surrounding the hypothetical point source, so that at that radius the wave over a reasonable area is essentially planar. The electric (and magnetic) field of a plane wave in free space is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. So the electric field would have to be tangent {{to the surface of the}} sphere everywhere, and continuous along that surface. However the hairy ball theorem shows that a continuous vector field tangent to the surface of a sphere must fall to zero at one or more points on the sphere, which is inconsistent with the assumption of an <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator</b> with linear polarization.|$|R
50|$|Isotropic: An <b>isotropic</b> antenna (<b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator)</b> is a <b>hypothetical</b> antenna that radiates equal signal {{power in}} all directions.

50|$|In electromagnetics, {{directivity}} is a parameter of {{an antenna}} or optical system which measures {{the degree to}} which the radiation emitted is concentrated in a single direction.

40|$|In the past, {{mathematics}} and experimentation {{were the only}} tools engineers had to understand test site and antenna design. Today we have the Method of Moments. Antennas commonly used in EMC work include dipole, conical, log periodic and horn types. These are used on calibrated test sites for precision measurements. In the past, engineers {{had to rely on}} electromagnetic theory along with good deal of trial and error to design antennas and test sites. Today, we have computational tools that engineers of 30 years ago could only have dreamed of. In this article, we will apply the elegant and powerful Method of Moments to the design of a half wave dipole and a biconical antenna. We will also use it to derive a site attenuation model. But first we need to review the physics of an antenna that does not, and cannot, exist, yet is the antenna against which all others are measured. It is called the “isotropic radiator. ” Figure 1 : Energy from an <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator</b> propagates outward evenly in all directions, falling off according to the inverse square law. An <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator</b> is an antenna that radiates equally in all directions. An impulse of energy supplied to the antenna’s terminals results in a spherical shell of energy propagating outward at the speed of light. Since energy must be conserved, the shell’s energy per unit area must fall as it expands. In free space, the rate of fall is proportional to 1 / 4 πr 2. The purpose of a receiving antenna is to intercept some of this outward radiating energy. For example, consider the case of a theoretical receiving antenna consisting of a one-meter square, perfectly absorbing sheet placed at a distance r from the <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator.</b> The amount of energy per unit time (power) absorbed by the sheet will be:...|$|R
50|$|The {{directivity}} of an antenna, {{its ability}} to direct radio waves in one direction or receive from a single direction, is measured by a parameter called its gain, which is {{the ratio of the}} power received by the antenna to the power that would be received by a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>isotropic</b> antenna, which receives power equally well from all directions.|$|R
50|$|When actual {{measurements}} of an antenna's gain {{are made by}} a laboratory, the field strength of the test antenna is measured when supplied with, say, 1 watt of transmitter power, at a certain distance. That field strength is compared to the field strength found using a so-called reference antenna at the same distance receiving the same power {{in order to determine}} the gain of the antenna under test. That ratio would be equal to G if the reference antenna were an <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|R
