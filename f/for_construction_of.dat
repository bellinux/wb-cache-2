5|$|Between 1946 and 1952, uranium {{compounds}} were {{extracted from}} locally mined graptolitic argillite at the Sillamäe Processing Plant (now: Silmet). More than 60tonnes of uranium compounds (corresponding to 22.5tonnes of elemental uranium) were produced. Some sources note that uranium produced in Sillamäe was used <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the first Soviet atomic bomb; however, {{this information is}} not confirmed by the archive materials.|$|E
5|$|Excavations <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the building's {{foundations}} {{started in}} October 1961 {{and the first}} concrete pour occurred in November 1961. The building was not completely finished by the time Perth hosted the Commonwealth Games in November 1962, however the builders rushed to finish the ground, eighth, and 10th floors in time so that foreign dignitaries could be entertained in the reception areas.|$|E

The dam was built during the summer, between 25 June and 3 September 1907.

40|$|We generalize the grid-projection method <b>for</b> the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> quasiperiodic tilings. A rather general {{fundamental}} {{domain of}} the associated higher-dimensional lattice is used <b>for</b> the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the acceptance region.

5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod. Construction of the Alaska Railroad caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s {{as the price of}} gold rose during the Great Depression. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> military depots during World War II and {{the first decade of the}} Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the time}} {{required}} to electrify the network the MTT continued to run horse trams until 1914. The cost of purchasing the tramways was funded by treasury bills and the act capped total construction costs at £12,000 per mile of track. £457,000 was let in contracts to March 1908 <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the tramways, trams, strengthening the Adelaide bridge over the River Torrens and associated works. The official ceremony starting track construction was in May 1908, with tracks originally laid on Jarrah sleepers.|$|E
5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with awareness of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the parkway.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the 1782 Edict of Tolerance of Emperor Joseph II, Jews first {{permanently}} {{settled in}} Zagreb {{in the late}} eighteenth century, and founded the Jewish community in 1806. In 1809 the Jewish community had a rabbi, and by 1811 it had its own cemetery.

5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished. The Toronto–Barrie Highway was {{the primary focus of}} the Department of Highways at the time, and the onset of the Korean War in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving {{as a model for the}} design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, but it would not open with that name.|$|E
5|$|In 1667 Mylne was {{in discussions}} with the town of Perth <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a new market cross. However, he died at Edinburgh in December. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, where a monument, erected by his nephew and {{apprentice}} Robert Mylne, still stands. Another memorial was erected by the Freemasons at their meeting place, St. Mary's Chapel, although this former church was demolished in the 18th century. His portrait hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Robert Mylne succeeded him as master mason to the crown.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, John Barbour built a sawmill on Loyalsock Creek {{near the}} mouth of Plunketts Creek. This {{developed}} into the village of Barbours Mills, today known as Barbours. In the 19th century, Barbours had several blacksmiths, a temperance hotel, post office, many sawmills, a school, store and wagon maker. In 1840, a road was built north from Barbours along Plunketts Creek, crossing it several times. This is the earliest possible date <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the bridge, but the surviving county road docket on the construction mentions neither bridges nor fords for crossing the creek.|$|E

5|$|In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed, {{providing}} <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a reticulated water scheme using {{water from}} the Meander River and other streams. Hagley was connected to mains water via the Westbury-Hagley water scheme in 1902. By 1923 residents of Hagley were asking for an upgrade of the system, as it was seen as inadequate by then. The Westbury Council took out loans in 1952 to extend the system, and work on this extension continued into 1954, still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MTO {{began an}} {{environmental}} assessment {{into a new}} alignment for the northern connection with the Queensway. It was approved in mid-1987, with Cedarview Drive chosen as the ideal alignment for the new freeway. The MTO set out to design a four-lane route to connect the Queensway with Highway16 New, including a three-level free-flow interchange. A contract <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> this interchange was awarded in late 1989 and construction began in 1990.

5|$|In 2007, {{construction}} {{began on}} MD 200, {{which was to}} head east from I-370. At this time, the ramp from Shady Grove Road to westbound I-370 was shifted to a new alignment.

Construction on this segment of MD 200 was completed in February 2011, with the road opening to traffic on February 23.
