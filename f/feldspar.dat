40|$|Framework {{grains and}} matrix in {{sandstones}} from ODP Sites 796, 797, and 799 have been altered to various degrees owing to chemical diagenetic processes. Petrographic and geochemical {{data show that}} albitization of Plagioclase <b>feldspars</b> and replacement of matrix, glass shards, volcanic rock fragments, and <b>feldspars</b> by zeolites, carbonates, clay minerals, sulfates, and sulfides were the dominant diagenetic processes. <b>Feldspars</b> in the volcanic lithic sandstones at Site 796, which were buried to shallow depths and subjected to relatively low diagenetic temperatures (40 °- 65 °C), have not been albitized. On the other hand, zeolites have replaced many of the glass shards, and calcite has extensively replaced mud matrix and framework grains in many sandstones at this site. Most Plagioclase <b>feldspars</b> in the volcanic lithic sandstones at Site 797, where diagenetic temperatures may have exceeded 100 °C, have been altered to albite. In addition, zeolites, mixed-layer clay minerals, anhydrite, barite, and calcite commonly replace glass shards, volcanic rock fragments, and <b>feldspars.</b> Many Plagioclase <b>feldspars</b> in the feldspathic sandstones (arkoses) at Site 799, which were subjected to diagenetic temperatures of approximately 100 °C, have also been albitized. Zeolites are absent in Site 799 sandstones, but kaolinite occurs as a cement and as a replacement mineral for matrix and <b>feldspars.</b> Carbonate minerals, particularly calcite, are common replacement minerals for matrix, Plagioclase, orthoclase, and volcanic rock fragments at Site 799. Because albitization has altered the original compositions of Site 797 and 799 Plagioclase <b>feldspars,</b> these <b>feldspars</b> are not reliable indicators of the compositions of the parent source rocks. Total replacement of some framework grains in Site 796, 797, and 799 sandstones by zeolites or carbonates has also reduced the provenance information available from the framework grains...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - To {{study the}} effect of <b>feldspars</b> as {{inorganic}} filler on the mechanical and dielectric properties of epoxy coatings. Design/methodology/approach - Coating systems used were of either filler-free epoxy resin (as reference), or epoxy resin filled with <b>feldspars</b> powder at four different levels by weight. Mechanical properties of the coatings were evaluated via damping hardness and abrasion and impact resistance measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements {{were used for the}} evaluation of the dielectric properties while visual observations of the test panels after salt-spray test were also made. Findings - The addition of 15 per cent w/w <b>feldspars</b> resulted in a formulation giving the most positive results, e. g. improvement of the coating's mechanical characteristics and dielectric behaviour similar to that of filler-free epoxy coatings. Practically comparable to this behaviour was that possessed by coatings with 30 per cent w/w <b>feldspars,</b> while further increase of the <b>feldspars</b> content resulted either in a reduction in the extent of the enhancement of the mechanical behaviour or even in a worsening of both mechanical and dielectric characteristics. Originality/value - <b>Feldspars</b> are the most abundant group of minerals in the earth's crust; it is an inorganic, environmentally friendly material, which exhibits high Mohs hardness. The effects of <b>feldspars</b> in improving the mechanical characteristics of organic coatings, while not causing any reduction in the anticorrosive performance of the polymeric matrix was found through the study. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism; the rock has been pressure-cooked. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally sedimentary and igneous rocks with large quantities of quartz and <b>feldspar</b> mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted schist and gneiss, making their original parentage almost unrecognizable. Radiometric dating gives an age of 1700 million years for the metamorphism, placing it in the early part of the Proterozoic eon.|$|E
5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if {{they are likely to be}} much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali <b>feldspar,</b> and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E

The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase <b>feldspar,</b> with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found.

Analyzing petrographic textures, crystal morphologies, zoning, and phenocryst compositions, Suswa magma dynamics that occurred within the magma chamber can be determined. Trachyte and phonolite <b>feldspars</b> and other phenocrysts were analyzed with an electron microprobe. The trachytic <b>feldspars</b> are not zoned and have a K-rich composition (An 1 - 3 Ab 50 - 60 Or 35 - 45). The phonolitic <b>feldspars</b> fall into three groups defined by composition and texture.

5|$|Hallival and Askival {{are formed}} from an {{extraordinary}} series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and <b>feldspar</b> crystals accumulated {{at the base}} of a magma chamber. The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt on the northwest coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of periglacial landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and patterned ground. On Orval and Ard Nev the weathered basalt and granophyre has been sorted by frost heaving into circles 50centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3metres across on the flat summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in the southeast corner of the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain basalt and {{andesite}} flows {{were presented}} in the 1926 Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. The andesites were described as porphyritic rocks with phenocrysts of <b>feldspar</b> of various size in a greyish or greenish matrix. Both hornblende and augite andesites were noted to have been represented under a microscope. The basalts were described as black rocks with basic plagioclase with or without olivine and were noted in many cases to contain a considerable percentage of brownish glass. Although there was not sufficient time available to study these flows in detail it was revealed at several points that the andesites formed the older and the basalts the younger flows. G. M. Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) was able to demonstrate that on the Stikine River {{there were at least}} four flows of basalt. The basalts and andesites were considered to be younger than all the rocks they were observed in contact with, namely granitic intrusives, porphyries and greenstones. More definite evidence as to their age was obtained by W. A. Johnston and F. A. Kerr of the GSC who placed them in the Tertiary {{with some of the most}} recent flows of the Stikine valley probably belonging to the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the <b>feldspar.</b> Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E

5|$|The rocks {{collected}} from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques.

As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of the}} Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich <b>feldspar</b> mineral anorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart.
