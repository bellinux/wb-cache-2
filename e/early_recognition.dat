25|$|Painless {{passage of}} blood or protein {{in the urine}} may often be the only {{presenting}} sign of kidney involvement. Acute or chronic renal impairment may develop with lupus nephritis, leading to acute or end-stage kidney failure.

He also made his first class debut for Kent on 8 June 1876, taking two catches and performing three stumpings, and scoring 12 and 13 with the bat. He would play nine matches for Kent in total, scoring 72 runs at 5.14 but taking 12 catches and performing six stumpings. Outside of cricket, he worked at an engineering firm in Greenwich.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} rare, but dramatic, {{side effect}} associated with trazodone is priapism, {{likely due to}} its antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors. More than 200 cases have been reported, and the manufacturer estimated {{that the incidence of}} any abnormal erectile function is about one in 6,000 male patients treated with trazodone. The risk for this side effect appears to be greatest during the first month of treatment at low dosages (i.e. <150mg/day). <b>Early</b> <b>recognition</b> of any abnormal erectile function is important, including prolonged or inappropriate erections, and should prompt discontinuation of trazodone treatment. Clinical reports have also described trazodone-associated psychosexual side effects in women, including increased libido, priapism of the clitoris, and spontaneous orgasms.|$|E

25|$|The {{progression}} of SPS {{depends on whether}} it is a typical or abnormal form of the condition and the presence of comorbidities. <b>Early</b> <b>recognition</b> and neurological treatment can limit its progression. SPS is generally responsive to treatment, but the condition usually progresses and stabilizes periodically. Even with treatment, quality of life generally declines as stiffness precludes many activities. Some patients require mobility aids due to the risk of falls. About 65 percent of SPS patients are unable to function independently. About ten percent of SPS patients require intensive care at some point; sudden death occurs in about the same number of patients. These deaths are usually caused by metabolic acidosis or an autonomic crisis.|$|E

In 1885, McAleer joined another minor league organization in Charleston, South Carolina; and in 1887, he played for a team based in Memphis, Tennessee.

Both I Capuleti ed i Montecchi at La Fenice in 1830 and La sonnambula in Milan in 1831 reached new triumphal heights, although initially Norma, given at La Scala in 1831 did not fare as well until later performances elsewhere.

2500|$|A {{central concern}} of Levantine {{archaeology}} since its genesis {{has been the}} study of ceramics.

The ubiquity of pottery sherds and their long history of use in the region makes ceramics analysis a particularly useful sub-discipline of Levantine archaeology, used to address issues of terminology and periodization. Awareness {{of the value of}} pottery gained <b>early</b> <b>recognition</b> in a landmark survey conducted by Edward Robinson and Eli Smith, whose findings were published in first two works on the subject: Biblical Researches in Palestine (1841) and Later Biblical Researches (1851).|$|E
