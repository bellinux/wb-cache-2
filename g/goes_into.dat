25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error <b>went</b> <b>into</b> {{banishment}}. One would <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person <b>went</b> <b>into</b> banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the person did not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment, but the sages said that the person did <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person <b>went</b> <b>into</b> banishment, but the sages said that the person did not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment.|$|R
