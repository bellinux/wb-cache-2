60|$|But {{the obvious}} reply to this {{hypothesis}} is, that Letter IV, {{by the evidence}} of modern experts (evidence unanimous and irresistible), is just as much forged as all the rest, is just as certainly in Sprot’s imitation <b>of</b> Logan’s <b>handwriting.</b> This being so, why did Sprot keep it back so long, and why, having kept it back, did he, almost in his last hour, produce it, and say (if he did) that it was genuine, and his model, as it certainly was? This is the last enigma of Sprot. His motives defy my poor efforts to decipher them. Even if the substance of IV is genuine, what were Sprot’s motives? I do not feel assured that Sprot really maintained the <b>genuineness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>handwriting</b> <b>of</b> Letter IV. His remark that he kept Logan’s letter only till he forged others on it, as a model, certainly implies {{that he did not}} keep it after he had done his forgeries, and therefore that our Letter IV is, confessedly, not Logan’s original. Certainly it is not.|$|R
