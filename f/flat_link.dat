Link seemed oblivious {{to the fact that}} the outside wheels were perilously close to the edge. Madeline heard the rattle of loosened gravel and earth sliding into the gully. The wash widened and opened out into a sandy <b>flat.</b> <b>Link</b> crossed this and turned up on the opposite side. Rocks impeded the progress of the car, and these had to be rolled out of the way. The shelves of silt, apparently ready to slide with the slightest weight, the little tributary washes, the boulder-strewn stretches of slope, the narrow spaces allowing no more than a foot for the outside wheels, the spear-pointed cactus that had to be avoided--all these obstacles were as nothing to the cowboy driver. He kept on, and when he came to the road again he made up for the lost time by speed.|$|E

40|$|The {{method of}} {{intersection}} spaces associates cell-complexes depending on a perversity to {{certain types of}} stratified pseudomanifolds {{in such a way}} that Poincaré duality holds between the ordinary rational cohomology groups of the cell-complexes associated to complementary perversities. The cohomology of these intersection spaces defines a cohomology theory HI for singular spaces, which is not isomorphic to intersection cohomology IH. Mirror symmetry tends to interchange IH and HI. The theory IH can be tied to type IIA string theory, while HI can be tied to IIB theory. For pseudomanifolds with stratification depth 1 and <b>flat</b> <b>link</b> bundles, the present paper provides a de Rham-theoretic description of the theory HI by a complex of global smooth differential forms on the top stratum. We prove that the wedge product of forms introduces a perversity-internal cup product on HI, for every perversity. <b>Flat</b> <b>link</b> bundles arise for example in foliated stratified spaces and in reductive Borel-Serre compactifications of locally symmetric spaces.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{intersection}} spaces assigns cell complexes to certain topological pseudomanifolds depending on a perversity {{function in the}} sense of intersection homology.

Using differential forms, the resulting generalized cohomology theory for pseudomanifolds was extended to 2 -strata pseudomanifolds with a geometrically <b>flat</b> <b>link</b> bundle in a paper of M. Banagl. In this thesis we use differential forms to generalize the intersection space cohomology theory to a class of 3 -strata spaces with flatness assumptions for the links.

40|$|Link {{analysis}} algorithms {{have been}} extensively used in Web information retrieval. However, current link analysis algorithms generally {{work on a}} <b>flat</b> <b>link</b> graph, ignoring the hierarchal structure of the Web graph. They often suffer from two problems: the sparsity of link graph and biased ranking of newly-emerging pages. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking algorithm called Hierarchical Rank {{as a solution to}} these two problems, which considers both the hierarchical structure and the link structure of the Web. In this algorithm, Web pages are first aggregated based on their hierarchical structure at directory, host or domain level and link analysis is performed on the aggregated graph. Then, the importance of each node on the aggregated graph is distributed to individual pages belong to the node based on the hierarchical structure. This algorithm allows the importance of linked Web pages to be distributed in the Web page space even when the space is sparse and contains new pages. Experimental results on the. GOV collection of TREC 2003 and 2004 show that hierarchical ranking algorithm consistently outperforms other well-known ranking algorithms, including the PageRank, BlockRank and LayerRank. In addition, experimental results show that link aggregation at the host level is much better than link aggregation at either the domain or directory levels...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope for}} {{compensating}} for environmental loss or degradation with {{some form of}} balancing environmental gain (such as habitat creation) has attracted critical attention from conservationists and policy makers. However, it is increasingly apparent that concentrating on technical skills, and adopting a linear analytical framework, disguise the range of social processes at work. Engaging in environmental compensation is, almost inevitably, a process of considerable ecological, evaluative and institutional transformation. Moreover, taking increasing control of this process through detailed management may accelerate the transformation of nature into 'capital'.

While the conditions associated with flat subduction {{would be expected to}} produce increases in rock uplift and exhumation, where thrusting and dynamic forces work together, a prevalence of pre-Cenozoic apatite fission track (AFT) cooling ages suggests {{that there is no such}} link. The lack of Cenozoic cooling ages is at odds with structural reconstructions and basin studies along the foreland that show several kilometers of exhumation. This paradox can be reconciled by taking into account the thermal effects of flat subduction that removed the mantle wedge, and a significant source of heat flow into the crust. Reinterpretation of published AFT exhumation data (> 320 ages) using more realistic lower geothermal gradient values allows for substantial exhumation and explains the lack of Cenozoic exhumation ages across the foreland region...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis new methods are presented to achieve performance enhancement in wireless cooperative networks. In particular, techniques to improve transmission rate, mitigate asynchronous transmission and maximise end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio are described. An offset transmission scheme with full interference cancellation for a two-hop synchronous network with frequency <b>flat</b> <b>links</b> and four relays is introduced. This approach can asymptotically, as the symbol block size increases, achieve maximum transmission rate together with full cooperative diversity provided the destination node has multiple antennas. A novel full inter-relay interference cancellation method that also achieves asymptotically maximum rate and full cooperative diversity is then designed which only requires a single antenna at the destination node. Extension to asynchronous networks is then considered {{through the use of}} orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) type transmission with a cyclic prefix, and interference cancellation techniques are designed for situations when synchronization errors are present in only the second hop or both the first and second hop. End-to-end bit error rate evaluations, with and without outer coding, are used to assess the performance of the various offset transmission schemes. Multi-relay selection methods for cooperative amplify and forward type networks are then studied in order to overcome the degradation of end-to-end bit error rate performance in single-relay selection networks when there are feedback errors in the destination to relay node links. Outage probability analysis for two and four relay selection is performed to show the advantage of multi-relay selection when no interference occurs and when adjacent cell interference is present both at the relay nodes and the destination node. Simulation studies are included which support the theoretical expressions. Finally, outage probability analysis of a cognitive amplify and forward type relay network with cooperation between certain secondary users, chosen by single and multi-relay (two and four) selection is presented. The cognitive relays are assumed to exploit an underlay approach, which requires adherence to an interference constraint on the primary user. The relay selection is performed either with a max-min strategy or one based on maximising exact end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio. The analyses are again confirmed by numerical evaluations...|$|R
