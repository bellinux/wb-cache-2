40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are related to the determination of the optimal use of water for a run-of-the-river irrigation system for rice production. A simulation model was developed based on the concept of rotation irrigation and was used in the irrigation water management study to estimate the optimal irrigation time interval that will maximize the yield of rice, determine the effects of subdividing the <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> into rotation areas on the yield of rice and water supply, and estimate the maximum area that would give the highest yield and the optimal area that could be put under rice production for a river water source;The input data were rainfall, pan evaporation and stream flow. The depth of water applied and the potential evapotranspiration were computed. Water depletion was calculated by adding the potential evapotranspiration and soil percolation. The number of moisture-stress days was determined, based on the depth of water in the field; the yield of rice was calculated by use of a yield function {{based on the number of}} moisture-stress days developed from the data obtained in the Philippines;The combination of the number of rotation areas and the rotation interval that produced the highest yield was selected as the optimal water management for a given area. Since the simulation was done for several <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas,</b> the largest area that gave the potential yield of 2. 43 tons/acre was selected as the <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> that can be supplied with irrigation water without moisture stress, and the area that obtained the highest profit was selected as the optimal irrigable area;It was not necessary to subdivide the <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> into rotation areas when the water supply was adequate. The rotation interval varied from 1 to 8 days and did not affect significantly the yield of rice. However, an interval of more than 8 days considerably decreased the yield. For the <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> of highest profit, it was necessary to divide the area into 4 rotation areas which were irrigated at 4 -day intervals;There was no significant difference between the rotation irrigation scheme and continuous irrigation for small <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> when the water supply was adequate. However, rotation irrigation provided for a significantly greater optimal <b>irrigable</b> <b>area.</b> It also gave significantly higher production for large <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> when the water supply became inadequate;Since the results {{of this study are}} realistic and comparable with all research findings and field observations that are available in the literature, it can be concluded that the model is acceptable, rice production can be optimized by rotation irrigation, and selection of the area and interval is required for a given quantity of diverted water...|$|R

Thus, irrigated agriculture has a paramount role in lifesaving and insuring food security. Mismanagement of irrigation water influences agricultural productivity {{and efficiency of}} water uses. This study aimed to assess performance and potential of traditional surface irrigation schemes and to survey conflicts resulting from irrigation water use and management. Three major rivers in Cheleleka watershed (Wesha, Worka and Wodesa) where traditional irrigation has been widely practiced were selected purposively. The <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> of each river were identified and categorized into upper, middle and lower parts based on its related location in the watershed. The soil samples, infiltration rate, long time meteorology, conveyance efficiency, <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> and discharge at diversion points were analyzed. In addition, 49 households in <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> of the three rivers were interviewed and three focus group discussions were held. About 0.16 and 0.14  m 3 /s of discharge were recorded in irrigation areas of the middle Wodesa and upper Worka rivers, respectively. The conveyance efficiency of the traditional surface irrigation canals at middle Wodesa and upper Wesha and Worka was less than 50 %. The general potentials of surface irrigation water across the three perennial rivers were greater than 23 million cubic meters per year. The moisture stored in root zone or readily available water in existing farmers’ practices was found far beyond the carrying capacity of the soils, especially in middle Wodesa and upper Wesha and Worka areas. Performances of the traditional surface irrigation schemes are very low and had aggravated irrigation water losses and contributed to crop water scarcity and conflicts. The results also showed that farmers in the upper parts of the area {{and close to the}} diversion points excessively irrigate the cropland, whereas those far away and in lower watersheds of each river receive irrigation water insufficiently and irregularly.

In an attempt to sustain the long-term productivity {{of natural resources and}} to meet the food and non-food demands of growing population in the semi-arid tropics, the Indian government invests and promotes integrated watershed development programs. A comprehensive tool to assess the impacts of watershed development programs on both social well-being and sustainability of natural resource is currently lacking. In this study, we develop a watershed level bioeconomic model to assess the ex-ante impacts of key technological and policy interventions on the socioeconomic well-being of rural households and the natural resource base. These interventions are simulated using data from a watershed community in the semi-arid tropics of India. The model captures the interaction between economic decisions and biophysical processes and using a constrained optimization of household decision model. The interventions assessed are productivity-enhancing technologies of dryland crops and increased in <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> through water conservation technologies. The results show that productivity-enhancing technologies of dryland crops increase household incomes and also provided incentives for conserving soil moisture and fertility.

Fortunately, there are renewable ones, such as wind, which has experienced recent developments {{in the area of}} power generation. Wind pumps can {{play a vital role in}} irrigation projects in remote farms. A methodology based on daily estimation balance between water needs and water availability was used to evaluate the feasibility of the most economic windmill irrigation system. For this purpose, several factors were included: three-hourly wind velocity (W 3 h, m/s), flow supplied by the wind pump as a function of the elevation height (H, m) and daily greenhouse evapotranspiration as a function of crop planting date. Monthly volumes of water required for irrigation (Dr, m 3 /ha) and in the water tank (Vd, m 3), as well as the monthly <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> (Ar, ha), were estimated by cumulative deficit water budgeting taking in account these factors. An example is given illustrating the use of this methodology on tomato crop (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) under greenhouse at Ciego de Ávila, Cuba. In this case two different W 3 h series (average and low wind year), three different H values and five tomato crop planting dates were considered. The results show that the optimum period of wind-pump driven irrigation is with crop plating in November, recommending a 5 m 3 volume tank for cultivated areas around 0. 2 ha when using wind pumps operating at 15 m of height elevation...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{man made}} blast, entire water stored in Kalmadu {{irrigation}} tank passed through the 125 m length and about 15 m depth breach. This led the 1397 ha of total <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> under gravity irrigation system was abundant for eight seasons. Species recorded of project area identified native, endemic plants 86 % and 8 % respectively. Fauna and flora found are common and the habitats are secondary in origin. Similar habitats were identified in surrounding, hence no possible threats to any important ecosystems. With the improvements in the dam and its operational efficiency, the overall impact is positive because it {{would result in a}} more favourable condition for the aquatic life in the reservoir and the river downstream and this scheme was functional until the year before the blast. EMP was monitored by the Environmental monitoring team at the field and mitigation measures were addressed by the contractor. More than 100, 000 m 3 of earth (SC/GC material) collected from the tank bed was used for the construction for the closure of this breach. Resettled 4641 families with 18335 individuals were used for manual labour which was about 50 - 75 % of total labours used, to facilitate immediate employment for the IDPs from Kalmadu area with the purpose of uplifting livelihood and mental stability. After the completion of the work the paddy production is 8382 ton/year. Average per capita consumption of 108 kg/individual results, 23. 6 % of the production is self sustain the Kalmadu area and the rest 76. 4 % is mixed with the national supply...|$|R
40|$|University of Zaragoza, Spain The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyze aspects {{relating}} to saving water and energy consumption of the modernization of irrigation in Spain. In relation to water saving, it studies the most important irrigation modernization processes and their water saving goals. Next, it presents water accounting as a tool for water resource assessment of <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas.</b> Based on this, it concludes that, in general, modernized irrigation in Spain consumes more water than before, mainly due to changes in crop patterns, the increase in irrigated areas, and the greater satisfaction of the water requirements of crops. Different case studies are analyzed, all revealing higher water consumption after modernization. Regarding energy consumption, it studies the greater electricity consumption arising from irrigation modernization when surface irrigation is replaced by pressurized irrigation using pumping systems. It analyses the high economic cost of this pressurization since the liberalization of the electricity market in 2008, and how this high operating cost constitutes a serious threat to the economic viability of some modernized areas. As a general conclusion, it observes that irrigation modernization policy in Spain, mainly financed with billions of euros from Europe, Spanish state and Spanish regions, and justified socially by hypothetical water savings, has not in practice led to any water savings, but rather the reverse. Productivity in modernized farms has increased, but their general costs and the costs of amortizing the investments made have also increased. Thus, despite substantial public funding, in certain cases modernization can be a threat to the economic viability of the same farm which is modernized, which may find it needs new public funding...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation {{scheduling}} services (ISS) provide {{farmers with}} recommendations on timing {{and amount of}} irrigation, thus contributing to improving on-farm water management. There are wide variations {{in the level of}} services, from providing regional water use guidelines to local, on-farm advisory services. An ISS (ISS-ITAP) was created in 1988 in Albacete, Central Spain, a province encompassing 100, 000 ha which are irrigated mostly with groundwater. The ISS-ITAP first offered general information on crop water requirements (ET), and after 1994 field-specific scheduling services were provided to growers. By 2005 the ISS-ITAP had expanded its services to over 33, 500 ha, corresponding to about 30 % of the <b>irrigable</b> <b>area.</b> The evolution of irrigation performance in a number of individual farms was followed over 10 years, and {{it was found that the}} proportion of fields which were adequately irrigated increased from 50 to over 70 % in that period. Meanwhile, the proportion of deficit-irrigated fields declined from 20 to 10 %, while the proportion of over-irrigated fields which also had initially decreased from 20 to 10 %, went back to 20 % at the end of the study period. To assess the benefits and costs of the ISS-ITAP, a comparison of the yields achieved in the scheduled farms against those obtained in the rest of the province was carried out. When the Service was evaluated in economic terms, using information from 2003, the pay-back was 2 years and the internal rate of return was 59. 1 %, highlighting the high returns on the public funds invested by ISS-ITAP to provide irrigation advisory service to growers in the Albacete province. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.
