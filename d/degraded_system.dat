50|$|In {{circumstances}} where {{the amount of}} free physical memory is low and paging is fairly prevalent, any performance gains provided by the compression system (compared to paging directly to and from auxiliary storage) may be offset by an increased page fault rate that leads to thrashing and <b>degraded</b> <b>system</b> performance. In an opposite state, where enough physical memory is available and paging activity is low, compression may not impact performance enough to be noticeable. The middle ground between these two circumstanceslow RAM with high paging activity, and plenty of RAM with low paging activityis where virtual memory compression may be most useful. However, the more compressible the program data is, the more pronounced are the performance improvements as less physical memory is needed to hold the compressed data.|$|E

The assessment result of system reliability by universal generating function was low accurate {{when compared with}} the Monte Carlo simulation. And the probability density function of the system output performance cannot be got. So the reliability assessment method based on the probability density evolution with multi-parameter was presented for complexly <b>degraded</b> <b>system.</b> Firstly, the system output function was founded according to the transitive relation between component parameters and the system output performance. Then, the probability density evolution equation based on the probability conservation principle and the system output function was established. Furthermore, probability distribution characteristics of the system output performance was obtained by solving differential equation. Finally, the reliability of the <b>degraded</b> <b>system</b> was estimated. This method did not need to discrete the performance parameters and can establish continuous probability density function of the system output performance with high calculation efficiency and low cost. Numerical example shows that this method is applicable to evaluate the reliability of multi-parameter <b>degraded</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the controllability analysis and fault tolerant control {{problem for a}} class of hexacopters. It is shown that the considered hexacopter is uncontrollable when one rotor fails, even though the hexacopter is over-actuated and its controllability matrix is row full rank. According to this, a fault tolerant control strategy is proposed to control a <b>degraded</b> <b>system,</b> where the yaw states of the considered hexacopter are ignored. Theoretical analysis indicates that the <b>degraded</b> <b>system</b> is controllable {{if and only if}} the maximum lift of each rotor is greater than a certain value.

40|$|Design of {{gracefully}} <b>degrading</b> <b>systems,</b> where functionality {{is gradually}} reduced {{in the face}} of faults, has traditionally been a very difficult and error-prone task. General approaches to graceful degradation are typically limited to re-implementation of the system for a number of pre-designated fallback configurations. We describe an architecture-based approach to gracefully <b>degrading</b> <b>systems</b> based upon Product Family Architectures (PFAs) combined with automatic reconfiguration. A PFA is a region of a system design space populated by different, but related, products sharing similar architectures and components. Each system instance within a PFA yields a distinct price/performance point, and represents a different model in the product family. The unifying mechanism that joins PFAs and gracefully <b>degrading</b> <b>systems</b> is automatic reconfiguration – {{in the face of}} a fault, the system reconfigures to a different PFA configuration point that optimizes the functionality available with the remaining resources. In this process, the system sheds some of the non-critical functions that make up such a large percentage of modern embedded systems. System designers can also exploit a reconfiguration mechanism to provide graceful upgrade and unique logistical benefits. The RoSES (Robust Self-configuring Embedded Systems) project employs such a reconfiguration approach, seeking to create a revolutionary means to build self-customizing, distributed, embedded control systems...|$|R
