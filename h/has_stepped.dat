5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

25|$|Although it had {{traditionally}} supported Burma's pro-democracy {{movement for}} many years, India's policy changed in 1993, making friendly overtures {{to the military}} junta. India signed trade agreements and increased its investments in Burma; although private sector activity remains low, India's state corporations have landed lucrative contracts for industrial projects {{and the construction of}} major roads and highways, pipelines and upgrading of ports. India has also increased its competition with China over the harnessing of Burma's significant oil and natural gas reserves, seeking to establish a major and stable source of energy for its growing domestic needs, countering Chinese monopoly over Burmese resources and reducing dependence on oil-rich Middle Eastern nations. Although China remains Burma's largest military supplier, India has offered to train Burma's military personnel and has sought their cooperation in curbing separatist militants and the heavy drug trafficking affecting much of Northeast India. China's winning of contracts harnessing more than 2.88–3.56 trillion cubits of natural gas in the A-1 Shwe field in the Rakhine State and development of naval and surveillance installations along Burma's coast and the Coco Islands has provoked great concern and anxiety in India, which <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> up its investment in port development, energy, transport and military sectors.|$|E

[...] GameTrailers stated that [...] "another viable challenger <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> onto the stage." [...] IGN's review was lukewarm, noting that [...] "A number of things it tries to accomplish were already done better in Rock Band", but stated that the game would be a good [...] "stepping point" [...] for the next iteration of the series.|$|E

The biting {{of the tongue}} conveys the emotion of lajja or modesty, an expression that is widely accepted as the emotion being expressed by Kaali. In Bengal also, [...] Kaali's protruding tongue is [...] "widely accepted... {{as a sign of}} speechless embarrassment: a gesture very common among Bengalis."Yet another view of Kaali's extended tongue is that the red tongue represents the Rajas (passion) which is controlled by Satva (goodness or knowledge).

500|$|The {{polygonal}} eastern tower <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> buttresses at its {{corners and}} louvred belfry windows {{just below the}} parapet. Its origins are not entirely clear, but it was possibly originally a turret for stairs leading to a room over the chancel, later extended upwards as an aesthetic enhancement and {{to act as a}} beacon for mariners. Its date is uncertain, but it is much later than the chancel. Although its lack of height compared to the west tower has led to some questioning of its suitability as a beacon, {{it has been suggested that}} lining up the two towers guided ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; this is the [...] "leading light" [...] practice later achieved using pairs of lighthouses at different levels.|$|E
500|$|Although earlier {{metrical}} homilies, such {{as those}} of Ælfric and Wulfstan, were based on the rules of Old English poetry, they took sufficient liberties with meter to be readable as prose. Orm does not follow their example. Rather, he adopts a [...] "jog-trot fifteener" [...] for his rhythm, based on the Latin iambic septenarius, and writes continuously, neither dividing his work into stanzas nor rhyming his lines, again following Latin poetry (Bennett 1986, p.31). The work is unusual in that no critic ever <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> forward to defend it on literary grounds. Indeed, Orm was humble about his oeuvre: he admits in the preface that he frequently has padded the lines to fill out the meter, [...] "to help those who read it", and urges his brother Walter to edit the poetry to make it more meet (Treharne 2000, pp.274–75).|$|E
500|$|... "Presbyterians {{should take}} prompt action because the Popish party, seeing the want that was felt {{throughout}} the colony {{in regard to}} higher education, <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> in to supply that want, and if Protestants did not look to the matter, the Roman Catholics would take advantage of them." [...] The General Assembly was also inspired to establish a school, particularly a Ladies' College, by less worthy motives. Other Protestant denominations in NSW had recently established their own Ladies' Colleges, and the neighbouring colony of Victoria had maintained a Presbyterian Ladies' College since 1875, {{and so it was}} felt that NSW Presbyterians should also have one. At the 1884 Assembly the Committee announced that while a boys' school was not needed, the secondary education options available to girls were not satisfactory, and they recommended that a Ladies' College, similar to the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne, be established as soon as possible.|$|E

500|$|The Goodison Road Stand was {{partially}} demolished and rebuilt during the 1969–70 season with striking images of both {{old and new}} stands side by side. The new stand opened 1971, {{at a cost of}} £1 million. The new stand housed the 500 and 300 members clubs and an escalator to the tallest stand in the ground—the Top Balcony. However, not everyone thought that the upgrade was necessary at the time. Journalist Geoffrey Green of The Times wrote [...] "Goodison Park has always been a handsome fashionable stage for football, a living thing full of atmospherics-like a theatre. And now it <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> into the demanding seventies with a facelift it scarcely seemed to need compared with some of us I know.

500|$|After {{losing the}} World Series {{in six games}} to the Boston Red Sox, Matheny and general manager John Mozeliak {{explained}} that Miller's role was as [...] "insurance." [...] In just one game until Michael Wacha's final start– which was {{the final game of}} the year– did a starter go less than five innings. [...] Miller also became less effective as the season progressed late, with his strikeout rate decreasing and walk rate increasing. [...] Said Matheny, [...] "It {{would have to be a}} situation where we were pushing into a tight spot, and that's just not fair to him without having much action to this point. [...] He's been exactly what we’ve needed up to this point. [...] Fortunately we haven’t needed that long outing." [...] Mozeliak added that [...] "second-guessing the roster doesn’t have traction. [...] His role was always that insurance. [...] There were a lot of question marks as we were going into this on exactly how our rotation was going to unfold. [...] The fact that everybody <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> up changed the dynamic." ...|$|E

That's a fear that I think any adopted mother would have. I think that's going to really help the audience relate to Regina in some level." [...] The role of Rumpelstiltskin was given to Robert Carlyle; it was written with Carlyle in mind, though the writers initially thought he would never accept the part. Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as [...] "mind-blowing... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!" [...] The writers offered the part of the Blue Fairy to recording artist Lady Gaga, but never heard back from her management staff.|$|E
