40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gas <b>identification</b> <b>circuit</b> for tin oxide (SnO 2) gas sensors. The proposed circuit uses 2 gas sensors with different characteristics to achieve gas identification. A spike train is generated during operation, with {{the frequency of}} spike occurrence being gas dependent but concentration invariant.

The calibration of this readout technique requires only a single exposure to the target gases to extract the sensor resistances. The low complexity processing is suitable for on-chip implementation.

40|$|The {{problem of}} source {{identification}} involves correctly classifying an incoming signal into a category that identifies the signal's source. The problem {{is difficult because}} information is not provided concerning each source's distinguishing characteristics and because successive signals from the same source differ. The source identification problem can be made more difficult by dynamically changing the repertoire of sources while the problem is being solved. We used genetic programming to evolve both the topology and the sizing (numerical values) for each component of an analog electrical circuit that can correctly classify an incoming analog electrical signal into three categories. Then, the repertoire of sources was dynamically changed by adding a new source during the run. The paper describes how the architecture-altering operations enabled genetic programming to adapt, during the run, to the changed environment. Specifically, a three-way source <b>identification</b> <b>circuit</b> was evolved and then adapted into a four-way classifier...|$|E
