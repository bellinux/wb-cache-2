40|$|Production of {{electricity}} from heat requires a heat engine working between two heat reservoirs, a <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> and a <b>heat</b> sink. The Carnot efficiency is defined for the reversible heat engine working between two reservoirs of infinite heat capacity and constant temperature. Geothermal <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> is a <b>stream</b> of water, {{either in the}} liquid phase or as liquid-steam mixture of any quality. The heat capacity of the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> is thus finite, and the source temperature is not constant in the heat addition process of the heat engine. Same applies for the heat rejection of the heat engine, usually the cooling fluid available has some strict limitation on the possible temperatures, and rejection to a sink at a constant temperature is practically almost impossible. This paper analyzes electricity production when the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> and the <b>heat</b> sink {{do not have a}} constant temperature. The maximum production efficiency is defined and calculated, both for pure electricity production (E) and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation. The maximum obtainable efficiencies are calculated for typical values for geothermal application.

Historical land uses including logging, flow diversions, and hydraulic gold mining, have resulted in altered sediment transport regimes, diminished riparian cover and reduced large woody debris. These in turn have altered the thermal regime of the river. Summer stream temperatures commonly exceed salmonid (specifically Oncorhynchus spp.) temperature thresholds. Study focusThermal dynamics of a one-kilometer reach of the Salmon River was quantified using distributed temperature sensing fiber-optics (DTS) and <b>Heat</b> <b>Source</b> modeling. <b>Stream</b> thermal responses to scenarios of air temperature increase and flow reduction were compared with riparian reforestation simulations to estimate benefits of reforestation. New hydrological insightsElevated air temperatures (2 °C, 4 °C, 6 °C) increased mean stream temperature by 0. 23 °C/km, 0. 45 ºC/km and. 68 °C/km respectively. Reforestation lowered temperatures 0. 11 – 0. 12 °C/km for partial and 0. 26 – 0. 27 °C/km for full reforestation. Reduced streamflow raised peak stream temperatures in all simulations. Warming could be mitigated by reforestation, however under severe flow reduction and warming (71. 0 % reduction, 6 °C air temperature), only half of predicted warming would be reduced by the full reforestation scenario.

We simulated the influence of expected changes in heat wave intensity during the 21 st century on water temperatures of a heavily impacted pre-alpine Austrian river and analysed future mitigating effects of riparian vegetation shade on radiant and turbulent energy fluxes using the deterministic <b>Heat</b> <b>Source</b> model. Modelled <b>stream</b> water temperature increased less than 1. 5  °C within {{the first half of}} the century. Until 2100, a more significant increase of around 3  °C in minimum, maximum and mean stream temperatures was predicted for a 20 -year return period heat event. The result showed clearly that in a highly altered river system riparian vegetation was not able to fully mitigate the predicted temperature rise caused by climate change but would be able to reduce water temperature by 1 to 2  °C. The removal of riparian vegetation amplified stream temperature increases. Maximum stream temperatures could increase by more than 4  °C even in annual heat events. Such a dramatic water temperature shift of some degrees, especially in summer, would indicate a total shift of aquatic biodiversity.

40|$|The LHP {{operating}} temperature {{is governed by}} the saturation temperature of its reservoir. Controlling the reservoir saturation temperature is commonly accomplished by cold biasing the reservoir and using electrical heaters to provide the required control power. Using this method, the loop {{operating temperature}} can be controlled within +/- 0. 5 K. However, because of the thermal resistance that exists between the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> and the LHP evaporator, the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> temperature will vary with its heat output even if LHP operating temperature is kept constant. Since maintaining a constant <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> temperature is of most interest, a question often raised is whether the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> temperature {{can be used for}} LHP set point temperature control. A test program with a miniature LHP has been carried out to investigate the effects on the LHP operation when the control temperature sensor is placed on the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> instead of the reservoir. In these tests, the LHP reservoir is cold-biased and is heated by a control heater.

Using this method, the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> temperature can be maintained within a tight range for moderate and high powers. At low powers, however, temperature oscillations may occur due to interactions among the reservoir control heater power, the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> mass, and the heat output from the <b>heat</b> <b>source.</b> In addition, the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> temperature could temporarily deviate from its set point during fast thermal transients.
