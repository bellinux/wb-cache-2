5|$|DDT was {{a widely}} used {{pesticide}} in agriculture {{that was found}} to have significant adverse effects on wildlife, particularly egg thinning and subsequent breakage in birds of prey. A review of DDT's impact on Australian raptors between 1947 and 1993 found that the average <b>egg-shell</b> thickness had decreased by 6%. This average level of thinning was not thought likely to result in significantly more breakage overall, however individual clutches that had been even thinner might have broken. The white-bellied sea eagle was one of the more affected species, probably due to its feeding in areas heavily treated with pesticide such as swamps. DDT use peaked in 1973, but was no longer approved after 1987 and its use had effectively ceased by 1989.|$|E
500|$|... "The Open Boat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} discussed works in Crane's canon, and is regularly anthologized. Wilson Follett included the story in the twelfth volume of his 1927 collection of Crane's work, and it also appeared in Robert Stallman's 1952 volume Stephen Crane: An Omnibus. The story and its subsequent eponymous collections received high acclaim from contemporary critics and authors. Praising the merit of the story and his friend's literary importance, journalist Harold Frederic wrote in his review for The New York Times that [...] "even if he had written nothing else, [...] have placed [...] where he now undoubtedly stands." [...] English poet Robert Bridges likewise praised the story in his review for Life, stating that Crane [...] "has indelibly fixed the experience on your mind, and that is the test of a literary artisan". American Newspaperman and author Harry Esty Dounce praised the story as chief among Crane's work, despite its seemingly simple plot, writing for the New York Evening Sun that [...] "those who have read 'The Open Boat' will forget every technical feat of construction before they forget the long, heartbreaking mockery of the day, with land so near, the bailing, the <b>egg-shell</b> changes of seats, the terrible, steady cheerfulness and brotherhood of the queer little human group".|$|E

Pausanias traveled to Sparta to visit the sanctuary, dedicated to Hilaeira and Phoebe, in order to see the relic for himself.* Hughes, Helen of Troy, 26–27 ...|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{egg laying}} breeds often suffer from {{osteoporosis}} {{which results in}} the chicken's skeletal system being weakened. During egg production, large amounts of calcium are transferred from bones to create <b>egg-shell.</b> Although dietary calcium levels are adequate, absorption of dietary calcium is not always sufficient, given the intensity of production, to fully replenish bone calcium. [...] This can lead to increases in bone breakages, particularly when the hens are being removed from cages {{at the end of}} laying.|$|E

Henry Blake {{was injured}} four times: once by a disgruntled chopper pilot ("Cowboy"), once by {{friendly}} fire ("The Army-Navy Game"), and in season 3, episode 15 ("Bombed"), Henry is injured {{when he is}} blown up while in the latrine. (The gag of Blake being caught in an exploding latrine {{is also in the}} episode [...] "Cowboy".) Henry is also injured when the latrine catches fire. Father Mulcahy is given a concussion on two separate occasions - first in the episode [...] "Bombed", where he is in the latrine stall next to Blake when it is blown up; and again in [...] "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen" [...] when he is knocked out by mortar fire which strikes close by him; he also suffers severe hearing loss {{as a result of this}} incident. Frank Burns is twice awarded Purple Hearts for spurious injuries: throwing his back out after he gave Margaret a dip and could not move - which was later covered up with a story that he slipped on the way to the showers ("Sometimes You Hear the Bullet", 1.17), and getting an <b>egg-shell</b> fragment in the eye ("The Kids", 4.8). Burns' Purple Heart medals were then given to more deserving people: a GI who was admitted with appendicitis and a Korean newborn infant who was hit by a bullet in utero.|$|E
