50|$|A <b>fish</b> <b>factory,</b> {{also called}} a fish plant, fish {{processing}} facility, is a facility where fish processing is performed. <b>Fish</b> <b>factories</b> {{range in the}} size and range of species of fish they process. Some species of fish, such as mackerel and herring, and can be caught at sea by large pelagic trawlers and offloaded to the factory {{within a few days}} of being caught. Or the fish can be caught by freezer trawlers that freeze the fish before providing it to factories, or by factory ships which can do the processing themselves on board. Some <b>fish</b> <b>factories</b> have <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> catching fish for them at a given times of the year. This is to do with quotas and seasons conflicting how much and when the fish can be landed.|$|R

40|$|Acoustic or noise {{pollution}} in marine habitats {{has become an}} increasing concern for conservationists and policymakers. In 1972 the U. S. federal government enacted the Marine Mammal Protection Act, a law guaranteeing that marine mammals would not be detrimentally harassed by human activities. However acoustic pollution under the marine mammal protection act is unclearly defined and nearly impossible to enforce, yet, {{noise pollution}} in our oceans is a real threat {{to the survival of}} many marine mammals. “The MMPA cannot deal broadly with the source levels that polluters generate or with the total amount of noise produced in a given area. ” 1 Acoustic pollution is problematic, because unlike land mammals, marine mammals greatly depend on their hearing to survive. Acoustic pollution becomes an especially difficult issue when marine mammals and human economic interests collide. The Puget Sound Region, for example, is not only the home of various forms of marine life and habitats but it is also the home to major economic shipping routes. The vessel entries and transits for 2002 in the Haro Strait, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Georgia basin totaled over 5221 cargo and passenger vessels including oil tankers. 2 These figures do not include the 336 -entering <b>factory</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> 3 or the numerous recreational vessels in the waters.
