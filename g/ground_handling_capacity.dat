40|$|To improve airport <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> <b>capacity</b> {{and safety}} in all weather conditions, the {{introduction}} of moving map taxi displays in glass cockpit airliners is being considered. A digital data link to replace the current voice communication System {{can be used in}} combination with a taxi display to present dynamic information such as taxi clearances and moving obstacle locations. This paper describes a study in which the data link interface was graphically integrated with the taxi display itself to minimize the likelihood of communication errors and to maximize the crew situation awareness of the implications of new clearances. An experiment was conducted to compare the possible impact of the new graphical system with currently used procedure based opérations and with an intermédiare solution where Radio Télécommunications (RT) was not completely replaced by data link...|$|E

40|$|Airports {{will face}} {{congestion}} problems due to increasing air traffic. Since airport expansion {{is not always}} possible, other solutions must be found. One solution could be to make better use of the parties at an airport. <b>Ground</b> <b>handling</b> parties are an example of parties at an airport. Aircraft fueling, passenger boarding and cleaning of an aircraft are examples of <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> processes, which are performed by <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> parties. This thesis focuses on replanning of <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> processes. The original <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> process plan is modeled as a Simple Temporal Problem. By solving the Temporal Decoupling Problem for a given plan, the plan is split into several independent subplans, each subplan represents {{a plan for a}} service provider. Whenever an aircraft is delayed or one of the <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> processes is disturbed, the current plan may become infeasible. Subsequently, repair algorithms have to be applied to repair the broken plan. The main contribution of this thesis is to propose repair algorithms for a <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> process plan, modeled as a decoupled Simple Temporal Problem.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. <b>Ground</b> <b>handling</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} of the air transport logistics supply chain as it facilitates the mobility of cargo and people from one destination to another. <b>Ground</b> <b>handling</b> facilitates international trade hence its existence is critical to the competitiveness of a nation. Airline businesses usually overshadow <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> due to the historical dominance of airlines in the aviation industry. The importance and effectiveness of the <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> function as part of the air transport business is fast becoming a global issue as the industry is slowly emerging. The following tenets of <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> are fast becoming key issues in the air transport business: passenger handling, cargo handling, handling ramp handling, baggage handling, equipment, safety, security, and human resources. <b>Ground</b> <b>handling</b> players are mainly concerned with productivity, profitability and maximising returns on investment. Dwindling revenue, unsustainable profit margins, low productivity and low customer satisfaction and loyalty are terms no shareholder or business leader wants to hear. This research will give insight into <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> best practices that are a panacea for the industry. The <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> business is time sensitive and requires massive investment. Therefore, sustainable best practices are the right ingredient for customer loyalty and business success. The focus on <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> in South Africa and Zimbabwe will help in assessing the level of development in each country. This will aid in recommending best practices for the industry taking into account different country-specific risks and operational conditions. There are few studies in the field of <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> and it is an industry not many individuals know about. Many ground-handling executives admit that the industry absorbed them by accident and not by design. They only realise the importance of the industry when they are in it. This research is a practical study meant to bring out solutions to the industry...|$|R

50|$|Many {{airlines}} subcontract <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> to airports, handling agents or even {{to another}} airline. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), conservative estimates indicate airlines outsource more than 50 per cent of the <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> that {{takes place at the}} world's airports. <b>Ground</b> <b>handling</b> addresses the many service requirements of an airliner between the time it arrives at a terminal gate and the time it departs on its next flight. Speed, efficiency, and accuracy are important in <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> services in order to minimize the turnaround time (the time during which the aircraft must remain parked at the gate). Faster turnarounds for lower ground times are correlated to better profits.|$|R

40|$|On 16 April 2013, the European Parliament {{adopted a}} new, amended airport <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> Regulation, which {{will replace the}} old Directive 96 / 67 EC on <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> services. The new Regulation will further open up European {{airports}} for competition on the <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> market. Even long before the introduction of Directive 96 / 67 /EC, Amsterdam Airport has had a liberalised handling regime. Against {{the background of the}} further liberalisation of the European <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> market, this paper investigates the characteristics of the open <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> market for air cargo at Amsterdam Airport and the lessons that can be learnt from the Amsterdam experience. We find that an open handling market brings greater freedom of choice for airlines and lower handling fees. However, we do not see any (serious) market failure for the airport that would justify intervention by the market regulator, by limiting the number of handlers for example...|$|R

Using the IATA IGHC database as of spring 2015, our analysis revealed that out of Europe double digit numbers of providers are rare what contrasts with situation in Europe where <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> markets were deregulated by the Council Directive 96 / 67 /EC. The analysis also brought that the monopolistic structures of <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> markets were more specific for the regions of Asia and the Middle East.
