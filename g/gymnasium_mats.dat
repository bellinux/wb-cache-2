40|$|Hip {{fracture}} is rare {{in young}} adults, despite evidence that the energy available in a fall is sufficient to fracture the young proximal femur. This might be explained by protective responses that allow young individuals to avoid hip impact during sideways falls. To test this hypothesis, we conducted experiments with 44 individuals (31 women and 13 men) aged 19 – 26 years, who were instructed to try to maintain balance after a sudden unpredictable sideways translation {{was applied to the}} platform they stood upon. While the surface adjacent to the platform was formed of <b>gymnasium</b> <b>mats,</b> we provided no information on surface compliance, or the direction and speed of the perturbation. Ninety percent of participants fell and impacted the pelvis, and 98 % of those cases involved direct impact to the hip region. Impact occurred to the hand in 98 % of falls, and preceded impact to the pelvis by 50 ms on average (SD 40, range " 12 – 175 ms). The impact velocity of the pelvis decreased 3. 6 % for every 10 ms increase in the interval between hand and pelvis impact, and was reduced by 22 % on average by stepping prior to impact. Our results suggest that the lack of hip fractures in young adults cannot be explained by avoidance of hip impact during sideways falls. Rather, it probably relates to use of the hands and stepping, and by simply possessing sufficient bone strength to withstand the direct blow to the greater trochanter that tends to accompany sideways falls. r 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
50|$|Ranging from 4 feet x 8 feet to 6 feet x 12 feet, sizes {{usually only}} matter when limited by space or {{personal}} preference. In most cases - like in gymnastics - multiple mats are purchased to be strung together via Velcro {{to create the}} ultimate sure-footed tumbling experience. Generally <b>mats</b> used for <b>gymnasiums</b> and gymnastics <b>mats</b> come in 2-foot-wide panels and is why many in the industry call them folding panel mats or folding mats. The 2-foot-wide panels allow for ease in both set up and clean up when using the mats to becoming the perfect compact size for storage.|$|R
40|$|Falls and hip {{fractures}} are a {{major public}} health problem among the elderly. In addition to bone strength, sideways falls and direct hip impact are important determinants for hip fracture. However, few falls actually cause serious injury in both young and older adults. Therefore, understanding how individuals facilitate a safe landing during a fall will help guide appropriate exercise-based training programs. The primary purpose of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} effects of secondary tasks on movement strategies during a sideways fall. 	 To address this aim, I used a tether and electromagnet to suddenly release subjects from a sideways leaning position, causing them to fall onto a <b>gymnasium</b> <b>mat.</b> I instructed subjects to "fall and protect yourself, as if you were landing on a hard surface". I acquired trials in four conditions, presented in a pseudo-random order: falling while holding a box, falling while holding an empty mug, falling while reciting spoken text, and falling with no secondary task. In most trials, regardless of condition, impact occurred to the lateral aspect of the pelvis (no secondary task = 87 %, box = 82 %, cognitive = 90 %, mug = 79 %). While the frequency of impact to both hands decreased when carrying an object (box= 67 %, mug= 50 % compared to cognitive= 90 % and no secondary task= 85 %), 40 % of trials in the mug condition involved one hand contacting the ground, indicating hand impact was still common. It appears when protective movements such as impact to the knees and hands did occur, they were not used to avoid direct hip impact. Instead, they were used to help break the fall, and to avoid head impact, which was not seen in this experiment. The results from this study indicate that secondary tasks have minimal effects on fall responses and that the rare occurrence of hip fractures in the young is due to some combination of bone strength and effective use of body segments to break the fall. 	 	In a second study, I examined how a cognitive task affected the ability of young women to rotate forward (FR) or backward (BR) during a sideways fall. Subjects were released from a sideways leaning position and were provided with a visual cue upon tether release instructing them on the desired direction of rotation. The site of impact on the pelvis (as reflected by the hip proximity angle) was closer to the lateral aspect of the hip in cognitive trials than in control trials (43 ± 18 º versus 51 ± 19 º in FR and 59 ± 18 º versus 68 ± 18 º in BR) (p= 0. 0006). This was due to a longer delay in the initiation of rotation in cognitive trials (293 ± 60 ms versus 232 ± 71 ms in FR and 278 ± 87 ms versus 239 ± 60 ms), as opposed to a change in mean angular velocity. Pelvis impact velocity was similar in the two conditions (2. 6 ± 0. 3 m/s compared to 2. 7 ± 0. 3 m/s in FR trials and 2. 8 ± 0. 2 m/s compared to 2. 9 ± 0. 2 m/s in BR trials) (p= 0. 0514). The results from this study indicate that involvement in a secondary task can impair safe landing responses. Secondary attentional tasks cause a delay in the initiation of fall protective responses, which alters landing configuration. However, the motor programme that governs falling, remaining consistent across condition is robust to changes in task execution {{at the onset of the}} fall...|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, Hutton volunteered for the army and was recruited to the Army Physical Training Corps as a sergeant-instructor. Although no first-class cricket was played during the war, league and charity cricket matches continued and Hutton played several high-profile matches in 1940. But in March 1941, his future in cricket was threatened by a serious injury. On the last day of a commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the <b>gymnasium</b> when a <b>mat</b> slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated his ulna at the wrist. By the summer, surgery and rest initially looked to have repaired the injury; Hutton returned to his unit and resumed cricket, scoring a century in one game. However, he began to suffer increasing pain and underwent more surgery to graft bone from his legs onto the injured arm. A first operation failed, but the second attempt at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful. The surgery left him with a left arm almost two inches shorter than the right. He was discharged from the army in the summer of 1942 and, after a period of recovery, began work as a civilian for the Royal Engineers, inspecting the condition of government-owned properties. Hutton's recovery and return to cricket was closely followed by the wartime press, which kept track of many pre-war cricketers.|$|R
