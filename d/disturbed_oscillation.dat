A term newborn male weighing 3380 g at birth suffered myoclonic seizures within 24 hours of birth by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Apgar scores were 3 and 4 at 1 and 5 minutes. Myoclonus persisted for 9 days, responding poorly to step-up anticonvulsant treatment including lidocaine, midazolam, and clonazepam. Imaging documented arterial ischaemic stroke within the left posterior cerebral and both superior cerebellar arteries, compatible with top of the basilar artery stroke. There was no electrographic correlate for the seizures. <b>Disturbed</b> <b>oscillation</b> within the dentato-rubro-olivary circuitry was the likely mechanism. The probable cause was embolism from an in-utero-onset inferior caval vein thrombosis. At 22 months the child was sitting unsupported.

The presence of shocks in the flow leads to non-uniform convergence of the obtained series, manifesting itself in strong oscillations of the truncated infinite series solutions (also known as the Gibbs phenomenon), which makes the theoretical solution unsuitable for proper numerical computation. This severe difficulty is overcome by an analytical method based on Kummer's series transformation, which completely eliminated the <b>disturbing</b> <b>oscillations.</b> The resulting free jet solutions is discussed, and it is shown that the cylindrical jet exhibits a rather complicated cellular structure. The comparison with experiment shows excellent agreement, thus proving that linear theory can indeed adequately describe the flow field of supersonic jets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- During {{continuous}} casting, {{especially of}} modern steel grades or at higher casting velocities, undesired oscillating disturbances may occur, which strongly impair {{the quality of}} the final product, or even lead to costly plant downtime. In this paper, both a novel model based explanation of these level oscillations in terms of unstable internal feedback and delay time, as well as a corresponding control to reject the oscillations are presented. The first part of the paper shows how these oscillations arise from couplings inside the strand and how they can be explained in terms of approximated periodic oscillations. To this end, both a new approach to model this oscillatory behavior as well as a frequency analysis is shown. This plant structure poses difficulties for control, as there is a substantial delay time in the plant and the <b>disturbing</b> <b>oscillations</b> depend on the quantitatively unknown internal feedback. To cope with these problems, a new control structure is proposed. Further a prediction based approach is presented, which allows to eliminate the periodic patterns in the oscillations and thus to lead those to rest.

40|$|According to the Dual Process Model {{of coping}} with {{bereavement}} (DPM; Stroebe & Schut, 1999), adjustment to bereavement involves a flexible oscillation between two types of coping strategies: loss-oriented (LO) and restoration-oriented (RO). This model postulates that extremely anxious or avoidant attachment <b>disturbs</b> the <b>oscillation</b> process by focusing more on one type of strategy, either LO or RO. The present study examined this assumption. We recruited 321 bereaved individuals who had lost a romantic partner. Our results showed that less negative appraisal of bereavement-related stressors, as well as higher use of RO strategies, mediated the link between attachment avoidance and low severity of grief reactions. However, the DPM variables were not found to mediate the link between attachment anxiety and elevated grief reactions. We discuss how these results provide an empirical basis of the DP...|$|R
40|$|Typical {{consequences}} in schizophrenia are work absence and early retirement. Such poor every day activities {{are associated with}} executive dysfunctioning. Under healthy conditions, successful executive functioning is associated to increased frontal-midline theta oscillations. Such event-related modulations are related to enhanced coupling between neuronal spikes and the phase of the population theta cycle. Crucially, fm-theta {{has been shown to}} be reduced in schizophrenic patients compared to healthy subjects and seems to underlie impaired executive functioning. From a rehabilitation perspective, the question arises if <b>disturbed</b> <b>oscillations</b> can be directly targeted with neuroscientific approaches in order to influence associated disturbed cognition in schizophrenia. In this regard EEG-neurofeedback represents a putative intervention to self-regulate oscillations. However, it is debated if this patient group can self-regulate their own oscillations at all. The current study aims first at exploring the specific fm-theta disturbances of schizophrenic patients in memory updating using a two-back experimental paradigm and comparing the results with healthy, matched subjects. Ultimately, the study tests a personalized five training session fm-theta neurofeedback with schizophrenic patients including an active control group. The study included 29 patients diagnosed as schizophrenic (F 20, ICD- 10) and 16 healthy control subjects. 16 patients were pseudo-randomized to either the experimental or active control group (the so-called pseudo group) for neurofeedback. With regard to the two-back task, reduced performance of schizophrenic patients was accompanied by a total loss of fm theta modulability. This was reflected by two deficits with respect to task-relevant stimuli and working memory load in the two-back task. With respect to the theta neurofeedback training, two main results were observed. First, patients in the experimental group showed indeed increased theta amplitudes over the course of the training compared to the pseudo group. And second, this increase transferred to one of the fm-theta modulation deficits in the n-back task, but (yet) did not lead to increased performance. Nevertheless, our data suggest that a non-invasive, low-cost EEG-neurofeedback training may represent a therapeutic tool also in psychiatric patients...|$|R

Their attractive performances both in the linear and non-linear regime along with their reduced cost and small size compared to Erbium-doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) render them extremely appealing for metro and area optical networks, where cost and size are of utmost importance. We have carried out a comprehensive study of several amplifiers (from standard and gain clamped to new amplifiers with distributed electrodes for non-uniform current injection) with novel configurations by means of two independent experimental setups providing complementary information on both the static carrier distribution along the active laver of the devices (spatially resolved spontaneous emission collection and analysis) and their transient response (cross gain modulation with 150 fs of temporal resolution). One of these new configurations, called Optical Speed-up at Transparency (OSAT), was proposed by our group in 2000 and consists of a high power assist MN' beam injected near the amplifier transparency. As we shall demonstrate, this scheme copiously enhances the performances of SOAs on all critical issues: acceleration of {{the response of the}} amplifier reducing its gain recovery time, larger saturation output power allowing for an extended operation in a linear regime and reduced noise figure. One striking outcome of the OSAT principle further revealing its full potential emerges when applied to a gain clamped amplifier. These devices exhibit improved amplification stability through the presence of an internal lasing mode offset with respect to gain maximum but suffer from relaxation oscillations arising from the coupling between the internal lasing mode and carrier density just like semiconductor lasers do.

40|$|The European {{power market}} has changed {{substantially}} {{over the past}} twenty years. Increased competition, increasing use of renewables and environmental regulations contributed to a power market in which the power supply and demand fluctuates more frequently than ever. By nature, most power plants are sensitive to these fluctuations. The main reason for this is coupling between throughput (i. e. power output) and quality (e. g. pressure, temperature) and coupling amongst the quality parameters itself. As a consequence, when throughput fluctuates the quality is <b>disturbed</b> and <b>oscillations</b> occur in many of the process loops. Since these oscillations reduce power plant efficiency, increase wear and reduce plant lifetime it is desired to investigate solutions. In this study the effect of multivariable advanced process control (MIMO APC) on internal process loop oscillation and performance is investigated. Furthermore, the effect of improved process loop control on overall power plant performance is studied. To this end, a conventional drum-boiler power plant simulator (PID-controlled) is equipped with an Hinf-controller. A safe shutdown master-slave control structure is proposed to enable practical implementation. To accentuate the influence of improved internal process loop control on overall performance, the Hinf-controller will be responsible for four boiler process loops (the boiler has a central role in determining the overall behavior of power plants). This study shows that MIMO APC is a viable method for reducing oscillations and improving performance of internal process loops. It has become clear that better internal control also improves overall power plant performance. As a result, the effective maximum power production rate can be increased, which was found to have a surprisingly small effect on the achieved performance increase. These results indicate {{that it is possible to}} increase the economic potential of power plants using MIMO APC.

40|$|Abstract: Progress in {{unravelling}} {{the cellular}} and molecular basis of mammalian circadian regulation {{over the past}} decade has provided us with new avenues through which we can explore central nervous system disease. Deteriorations in measurable circadian output parameters, such as sleep/wake deficits and dysregulation of circulating hormone levels, are common features of most central nervous system disorders. At the core of the mammalian circadian system is a complex of molecular oscillations within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus. These oscillations are modifiable by afferent signals from the environment, and integrated signals are subsequently conveyed to remote central neural circuits where specific output rhythms are regulated. Mutations in circadian genes in mice can <b>disturb</b> both molecular <b>oscillations</b> and measurable output rhythms. Moreover, systematic analysis of these mutants indicates that they can express an array of abnormal behavioural phenotypes that are intermediate signatures of central nervous system disorders. Furthermore, the response of these mutants to psychoactive drugs suggests that clock genes can modify a number of the brain’s critical neurotransmitter systems. This evidence has led to promising investigations into clock gene polymorphisms in psychiatric disease. Preliminary indications favour the systematic investigation of the contribution of circadian genes to central nervous system disease...|$|R

There {{remains a}} class of laws which it is {{impracticable}} to ascertain {{by any of the}} three methods which I have attempted to characterize: namely, the laws of those Permanent Causes, or indestructible natural agents, which it is impossible either to exclude or to isolate; which we can neither hinder from being present, nor contrive that they shall be present alone. It would appear at first sight that we could by no means separate the effects of these agents from the effects of those other phenomena with which they can not be prevented from co-existing. In respect, indeed, to most of the permanent causes, no such difficulty exists; since, though we can not eliminate them as co-existing facts, we can eliminate them as influencing agents, by simply trying our experiment in a local situation beyond the limits of their influence. The pendulum, for example, has its <b>oscillations</b> <b>disturbed</b> by the vicinity of a mountain: we remove the pendulum to a sufficient distance from the mountain, and the disturbance ceases: from these data we can determine by the Method of Difference, the amount of effect due to the mountain; and beyond a certain distance every thing goes on precisely as it would do if the mountain exercised no influence whatever, which, accordingly, we, with sufficient reason, conclude to be the fact.|$|R
40|$|Classical schemes of {{basal ganglia}} {{organization}} posit that Parkinsonian movement difficulties presenting after striatal dopamine depletion {{stem from the}} disproportionate firing rates of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) therein. There remains, however, a pressing need to elucidate striatal SPN firing {{in the context of}} the synchronized network oscillations that are abnormally exaggerated in cortical-basal ganglia circuits in Parkinsonism. To address this, we recorded unit activities in the dorsal striatum of dopamine-intact and dopamine-depleted rats during two brain states, respectively defined by cortical slow-wave activity (SWA) and activation. Dopamine depletion escalated striatal net output, but had contrasting effects on ‘direct pathway’ SPNs (dSPNs) and ‘indirect pathway’ SPNs (iSPNs); their firing rates became imbalanced and they disparately engaged in network <b>oscillations.</b> <b>Disturbed</b> striatal activity dynamics relating to the slow (~ 1 Hz) oscillations prevalent during SWA partly generalized to the exaggerated betafrequency (15 – 30 Hz) oscillations arising during cortical activation. In both cases, SPNs exhibited higher incidences of phase-locked firing to ongoing cortical oscillations, and SPN ensembles showed higher levels of rhythmic correlated firing, after dopamine depletion. Importantly, in dopamine-depleted striatum, a widespread population of iSPNs, which often displayed excessive firing rates and aberrant phase-locked firing to cortical beta oscillations, preferentially and excessively synchronized their firing at beta frequencies. Conversely, dSPNs were neither hyperactive nor synchronized to large extents during cortical activation. These data collectivity demonstrate a cell-type-selective entrainment of SPN firing to Parkinsonian beta oscillations. We conclude that a population of overactive, excessively-synchronized iSPNs could orchestrate these pathological rhythms in basal ganglia circuits...|$|R

This state is excited and sustained by energy supply. Mitochondria producing small packets of energy in the form of adenosine and guanosine triphosphate and strong static electric field around them form boundary elements between biochemical-genetic and physical processes. The transformation mechanism of chemical energy into useful work for biological needs and the excitation of the coherent state far from thermodynamic equilibrium are fundamental problems. The exceptional electrical polarity of biological objects and long-range interactions suggest a basic role of the endogenous electromagnetic field generated by living cells. The formulated postulates encompass generation, properties and function of the electromagnetic field connected with biological activity and its pathological deviations. Excited longitudinal polar oscillations in microtubules in eukaryotic cells generate the endogenous electromagnetic field.

The demand for large spans in combination with slender slabs, is today a reason to investigate the floor-system constructions, in order to prevent <b>disturbing</b> vibrations and <b>oscillations.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to create a guide for how a comfort analysis, considering vibrations, should be implemented. Göran Svedenbjörk who is an expert in structural dynamics has been interviewed where he presents his latest project Värtaterminalen and answers some questions about vibrations due to human activities. Floor-systems, consisting of concrete slabs supported by steel or concrete beams, have been investigated with simulations in the finite element program Abaqus. In the simulations, the influence of various factors on the natural frequency of floor-systems and the acceleration level caused by dynamic loads, is studied. Properties like elastic modulus, span width, boundary conditions, density, slab thickness and placement the load have been investigated. The influence of reinforcement on the natural frequency and acceleration level has also investigated through numerical simulations. The results showed that the additional stiffness from the reinforcement had little effect on the natural frequency of floor-system. It should, however, be noted that the concrete slab was assumed to be uncracked in the numerical models. This means that the reinforcement may have a higher influence on a cracked concrete slab, due to its reduced stiffness. Reinforcement has a larger effect on the acceleration level and in some of the studied cases, the maximum acceleration is reduced with 25 %. The stiffness and the mass of the reinforcement result in lower acceleration values. Even prestressed reinforcement effect has been studied in the numerical models. It was found that the effect of prestressed reinforcement is not significantly different compared to regular reinforcement in this context. ...|$|R

An off-grid system to cheaply convert this solar energy into electricity could improve the lives of millions of families. Waste heat from high-concentration photovoltaic arrays and solar energy from evacuated tubecollectors are potential sources of abundant low-grade thermal energy. An Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is able to convert low-grade thermal energy into electricity at a relative low cost. While traditional ORCs rely on stable thermal energy inputs (i. e. geothermal energy), solar energy is not able to provide a constant supply of thermal energy. Understanding how transient solar fluctuations affect ORC performance is crucial to the development of high-performance, stable and stand-alone solar-driven ORC systems and further integration with heat storage units. In this work, an experimental ORC testbed was designed and fabricated for small-scale low-grade thermal energy utilization for transient characterization. Of particular interest in this work is the behavior of the ORC system as it approaches the operational limits. When the mass flow rate in the cycle is too high or the thermal energy input too low, the balance of the system is <b>disturbed</b> and strange <b>oscillations</b> are encountered. This work focuses on gaining a deep understanding of this abnormal behavior and itsinfluence on ORC performance. The physical phenomena that bring about these changes in an evaporator and their effect on ORC's moving components (i. e., diaphragm pump and scroll expander) are studied and characterized. A qualitative description of the phenomena is proposed and used to describe the changes within the cycle {{as a result of the}} imbalance. Once the individual processes in the oscillations are identified, quantitative analysis is carried out to better characterize the entire cycle. This characterization may be used to predict when the heat source conditions would lead to oscillations in ORCs and the magnitude of the reactions. These oscillations hinder the ORC performance and may even cause damage to the moving components under certain circumstances. Revealing the physical mechanismof oscillations helps attain advanceddesign and energy-efficient operation of ORCsunder transient thermal energy supplies, particularly solar. Cycle modifications such as heat storage units are also discussed to coping with transient solar energy inputs and night-time operation...|$|R
40|$|Structure-caused {{parasitic}} electromagnetic {{effects have}} a great importance in power electronic modules and systems, since they affect both their function mode and {{the security of the}} system. This work deals with the extraction of parasitic elements from the circuit layout based on field theory, clarifies its different influences on the switching process of power semiconductors and points constructional proposals for solution out for the avoidance or reduction of parasitic effects. Using a PEEC (2 ̆ 2 Partial element Equivalent Circuit 2 ̆ 2) approach it is shown, how partial elements with consideration of skin- and proximity-effect can be determined by suitable computer simulations from the power electronic circuit layout. For typical module dimensions partial self and mutual inductances of the conductors, bond wires and busbars are indicated, whereby also the influence of the substrate thickness and the dependence on the frequency are examined. It is shown by simulations that layout-dependent inductive positive and negative feedbacks between power and control circuit can affect the switching behaviour of power transistors considerably. It is illustrated, as this inductive coupling can be used consciously, in order to adjust switching speeds and to realize a symmetrical switching behaviour in the parallel connection of power devices. On the basis of a half bridge module on DCB substrate it is shown by simulation and measurement that eddy currents in the backside metallization of the substrate {{have a great}} influence on the symmetrical load of IGBTs in a parallel connection. During the turn-off phase of bipolar power devices paralleled in power modules very <b>disturbing</b> high frequency <b>oscillations</b> in the range between 70 MHz and 700 MHz have sometimes been observed. The excitation mechanism of these spontaneously appearing oscillations in the tail current phase can be explained by a transit-time diode effect which works in analogy to a BARITT-type diode. The new PETT-effect (2 ̆ 2 Plasma Extraction Transit Time 2 ̆ 2) is based on a periodic extraction of holes from the electron-hole plasma in combination with a suitable transit-time of the charge carriers passing the space-charge region. The LC resonant circuit is formed by the junction capacitances of the power devices itself and the parasitic inductances between the chips arranged in parallel. The experiences from measurements are confirmed by suitable device simulations. The observed oscillations react very sensitively to changes in the operating parameters (temperature, DC link voltage and tail current level) and the natural frequency of the resonant circuit. In order to absorb PETT oscillations in the power module considerably or prevent their emergence, three new constructional measures based on the integration of resistive elements are presented. The effectiveness of these measures is confirmed by electromagnetic field simulations. During dynamic current measurements with magneto-resistive sensors in power modules measuring errors were observed because of parasitic proximity effects. It is shown by electromagnetic field simulation that the measuring errors can be substantially suppressed by adding a ferrite core or an eddy current plate brought in the position suitably...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{accelerations}} {{encountered in}} daily life in causing postural instability or falls is not well understood, especially when walking. Lateral <b>oscillations</b> <b>disturb</b> walking stability during train journeys but it is desirable that passengers feel comfortable {{and they do not}} fall due to loss of balance. This research was designed to improve understanding of the mechanisms of walking stability and to construct a model for predicting the probability of losing balance in walking railway passengers. Postural stability was assessed using both a subjective measure (the reported probability of losing balance) and objective measures of centre of pressure (COP). The first of four experiments investigated how postural stability when walking depends on the frequency (0. 5 to 2. 0 Hz) and the magnitude (0. 1 to 2. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.) of transient lateral oscillation. The probability of losing balance reported by 20 subjects was used to obtain stability thresholds for the lateral accelerations experienced in trains. It was shown that postural stability cannot be predicted solely from either the peak or the r. m. s. value of lateral acceleration but can be predicted from the peak or the r. m. s. velocity of sinusoidal lateral oscillation. The second experiment with 20 subjects investigated {{the extent to which a}} hand support (rigid vertical bar) modifies postural stability when walking during lateral oscillation. The hand support improved postural stability at all frequencies (0. 5 to 2 Hz) and at all velocities (0. 05 to 0. 16 ms- 1 r. m. s.). The improvement in postural stability from holding the support and the forces applied to the hand support were independent of support height and were greater during perturbed walking (30 - 50 % when the support was held throughout the oscillation, 20 - 30 % when the support was held if required) than during normal walking (15 %). When it was required, subjects preferred to hold the hand support at a height of 126 cm above the surface supporting the feet. The third experiment investigated how the postural stability of walking people is influenced by the waveform of lateral oscillations. Twenty subjects were exposed to a range of 1 Hz and 2 Hz lateral oscillations having the same r. m. s. magnitude but different waveforms. The reported probability of losing balance and the lateral COP velocity was found to be sensitive to the peak magnitude of the oscillations especially at 1 Hz. It was concluded that the r. m. s. value is not an optimum method for predicting the postural stability of walking subjects exposed to low frequency lateral oscillations and that peaks in the motion should also be considered. The influence of subject characteristics (age, gender, weight, stature, shoe width, fitness) on postural stability was investigated in a fourth experiment with 100 subjects. Age had the greatest influence on postural stability, with an increase in COP measures with increasing age. There was no significant effect of any subject characteristic on self-reported probability of losing balance. The stability thresholds of young males (determined in the first experiment) can therefore be applied to a wider age range (18 to 70 years) of fit and healthy people, including females. The subjective experimental findings have been used to develop an empirical model for predicting the probability of losing balance in walking people exposed to lateral oscillation. Analysis of the objective measure of COP revealed that the ‘stepping strategy’ is the principal means of maintaining postural stability when walking is perturbed by lateral oscillation. The developed model can be used to predict the perceived risk of fall when walking and exposed to lateral oscillations from the peak and r. m. s. velocity of oscillations. The model predicts the perceived probability of losing balance during exposure to various waveforms of oscillations and is applicable to males and females with variety of ages (18 to 70 years) ...|$|R
