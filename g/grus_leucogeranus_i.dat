The birds from north spend winters in {{different}} wetlands and deserts of Pakistan, which are distributed almost throughout the country, from the high Himalayas to coastal mangroves and mud flats in the Indus delta. After winter they go back to their native habitats. Because of the different lakes that emerged due to waterlogging of Jhelum link canal, the Rangpur Baghoor area is a haven for these birds. Many people locals and other hunters come for hunting. Main birds include heron (Urdu), koot, The Siberian crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus),</b> <b>Grus</b> antigone.|$|R
40|$|Three Siberian crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus)</b> chicks hatched in {{the summer}} of 1987 at the International Crane Foundation (lCF); Baraboo, Wisconsin, were raised in near-complete {{isolation}} from humans. The chicks were exposed to species-specific models, vocalizations, a costumed 2 ̆ 2 parent 2 ̆ 2 and a role-model adult Siberian crane housed in an adjacent pen. Attachment to costumed 2 ̆ 2 parent, 2 ̆ 2 interchick interaction, and reactions to humans were measured and compared with those aspects of sandhill crane behavior under similar rearing conditions...|$|R
50|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the unfavorable conservation status of the Siberian crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus)</b> {{and the fact that}} the species has the longest migration route of all crane species ranging from breeding areas in the Arctic regions of Asia to wintering grounds in southern Asia, the range states acknowledged that the species would benefit from international cooperation between the countries. Therefore, as the first one to be conducted under the CMS, an Article IV agreement was concluded and entered into effect on 1 July 1993 and was later revised in January 1999.|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of water birds (Non-Passeriformes) inhabiting the lakes of Uvs- Nuur Depression. The article includeds material obtained during field work in the Uvs-Nuur Depression during 1999 - 2006, unpublished observations of rare vagrant species of birds, and data from the literature. Altogether we and others recorded 81 bird species from ten families on the lakes within the basin. The list we provide does not include sparrows or birds from habitats closely associated with the basin. The following non-Passeriformes bird families were noted (with the number of species in parentheses) : Gaviidae (1), Podicipedidae (2), Phalacrocoracidae (1), Ardeidae (5), Anatidae (27), Gruidae (6), Charadriidae (5), Recurvirostridae (2), Scolopacidae (21), and Laridae (11).

40|$|Habitat loss {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} {{underlying}} the decline of many waterbird species, including Siberian Crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus),</b> a threatened species worldwide. Wetlands are the primary stopover for many waterbirds and restoration of these wetlands involves both hydrological restoration and water resource management. To protect the stopover sites of Siberian Cranes, we collected Siberian Crane stopover numbers, meteorological and hydrological data, and remote sensing data from 2008 to 2011 in Momoge National Nature Reserve, one of the largest wetlands in northeastern China. A model was developed to estimate the suitability of Siberian Crane stopover sites. According to our results, the most suitable daily water level for Siberian Cranes between 2008 and 2012 occurred in the spring of 2008 and in the Scirpus planiculmis growing season and autumn of 2010. We suggest a season-dependent water management strategy in order to provide suitable conditions at Siberian Crane stopover sites...|$|R
5000|$|The Siberian crane was {{formally}} described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1773 {{and given the}} binomial name <b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus.</b> The specific epithet {{is derived from the}} classical Greek words leukos for [...] "white" [...] and geranos [...] for a [...] "crane". Ustad Mansur, a 17th-century court artist and singer of Jahangir, had illustrated a Siberian crane about 100 years earlier. The genus Megalornis was used for the cranes by George Robert Gray and this species was included in it, while Richard Bowdler Sharpe suggested a separation from Grus and used the genus Sarcogeranus. The Siberian crane lacks the complex tracheal coils found in most other cranes but shares this feature with the wattled crane. The unison call differed from that of most cranes and some authors suggested that the Siberian crane belonged in the genus Bugeranus along with the wattled crane. Comparisons of the DNA sequences of cytochrome-b however suggest that the Siberian crane is basal among the Gruinae and the wattled crane is retained as the sole species in the genus Bugeranus and placed as a sister to the Anthropoides cranes.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} fertility {{patterns of}} 339 eggs laid 1985 - 93 at the International Crane Foundation by cranes whose sole means of fertility was artificial insemination (AI). Ten of 15 crane species were studied. Fertility rates increased significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with (I) higher sperm density, (2) greater sperm motility, and (3) 2 vs. 1 vs. 0 inseminations 4 - 7 days before oviposition. Semen {{sample size was}} inversely related to sperm density and had no strong relationship with egg fertility. Inseminations less than 2. 5 - 3. 0 days before an egg is laid are probably too late to contribute to fertilizing the egg but {{may contribute substantially to}} fertilizing the next egg. We also describe practical knowledge gained during the past 10 years that apply to certain species or situations. Wattled cranes (Bugeranus carunculatus) have a long fertile period post-AI (up to 16 days), but may require more careful methods and special AI scheduling strategies. We also describe techniques for AI just after oviposition that are especially beneficial for Siberian cranes (<b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus),</b> and methods for maximizing sample delivery to the female...|$|R
40|$|As {{a common}} plant in Momoge Wetland, Scirpus planiculmis {{is the major}} food source for Siberian Crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus),</b> {{which is one of}} the most {{valuable}} waterfowl in Momoge Wetland. Through a simulation experiment, this study investigated the effects of different water table depths (- 5, 5, 10, 20, and 30 cm) and salinities (300, 1, 000, 3, 000, 4, 000, and 5, 000 mg/L) on the eco-physiological characteristics (height, leaf area per plant, chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll fluorescence) of Scirpus planiculmis. The results indicate that for the seedlings of Scirpus planiculmis, the effects of water depth on plant height, leaf area per plant, and chlorophyll content were significant, while salinity affected height increment, chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. For the plants of Scirpus planiculmis, the water depth had a significant effect on height increment and chlorophyll content, while salinity had a significant effect on height increment, chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. These results indicate a suitable ecological response thresholds of water table and salinity on the growth of Scirpus planiculmis seedlings and plants, which were 5 - 10 cm and less than 3, 000 mg/L for seedlings, 30 cm and 300 - 4, 000 mg/L for plants...|$|R
40|$|Almost 95 % of {{the entire}} {{population}} of the Siberian crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus)</b> winter in Poyang Lake, China, where they forage on the tubers of the submerged aquatic macrophyte Vallisneria spiralis. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River may possibly affect this food source of the Siberian crane by affecting the light intensity reaching the top of the V. spiralis canopy. In this study, the photosynthetically active radiation {{at the top of the}} V. spiralis canopy (PARtc) in Lake Dahuchi was modeled from 1998 to 2006, and the potential impacts of changes in water level and turbidity on the underwater light climate of V. spiralis were analyzed. PARtc was calculated from incident irradiance while the losses due to reflection at the water surface, absorption, and scattering within the water column were taken into consideration. The results indicated significant differences in PARtc between years. Six years of water level and Secchi disk depth records revealed a seasonal switching of the lake from a turbid state at low water levels in autumn, winter, and spring to a clear state at high water levels during the monsoon in summer. The highest PARtc occurred at intermediate water levels, which were reached when the Yangtze River forces Lake Dahuchi out of its turbid state in early summer and the water becomes clear. The intended operation of the Three Gorges Dam, which will increase water levels in May and June, may advance the moment when Lake Dahuchi switches from turbid to clear. We suggest that this might increase production of V. spiralis and possibly improve the food habitat conditions for wintering Siberian crane in Poyang Lake...|$|R
30|$|The Protected Area {{network in}} India is {{spread over the}} country {{covering}} 4.9 % of its geographical area (102 national parks, 515 wildlife sanctuaries, 47 conservation reserves and four community reserves, Ministry of Environment & Forests, 2013). Protected areas, especially national parks and sanctuaries, have been the model for conservation of biodiversity in India, adopting an administrative and management strategy that largely excludes the local or indigenous communities, even at locations where their traditional resources are well within the area possibly conflicting with the equity criteria {{in the context of}} biodiversity conservation. India has been remarked as ardently holding on to the philosophy of protection rather than conservation bridging the gap between people and managers (Jung, 2015). As this model accrues little direct and tangible benefits to the local communities, probably depriving them of the direct benefits, it fails in drawing their participation in conservation activities. Lately, the policy makers in India, in rhyme with the international trend, are increasingly recognizing this limitation and the need to involve locals through participatory conservation. That would help to an extent in reconciling the conservation conflicts, the conflict of passionate conservationists’ demand for total protection and the demands from human livelihood and well-being (Redpath et al. 2015). The conflict in the case of Keoladeo National Park (KNP) was of seemingly incompatible goals, the goal of its management and that of the local inhabitants. The explicit conflicts concerning the local inhabitants are related to non-recognition of the traditional resource-use practices, and local aspirations for social welfare and better livelihood options. Therefore this PA, formerly a royal hunting ground, declared wildlife sanctuary in 1971, Ramsar site in 1981 (one of the two initial sites in India), National Park in 1982, and UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 (first natural site in India) was selected as a model. Until the late 1990 s, KNP was the only wintering ground for the central population of Siberian cranes (<b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus)</b> in South Asia; unfortunately, since 2002, these birds stopped coming there. KNP, a mosaic of wetland, woodland, and grassland, is known to have 404 species of plants, 380 species of birds, 65 species of fish, 49 species of butterflies and 29 species of amphibians and reptiles (Prusty et al. 2013). The development of KNP to its present state has been eventful, reconciling several conflicts of interests (Azeez, 1992), of which the most striking were the conflicts relating to access to its resources mainly for grazing and that relating to water release. The KNP is critically dependent on the water flow from its catchment, which in recent years have grown into a matter of serious contention with the public. The demand in the upstream areas results in diversion of more water for agriculture and domestic uses. Consequently, during the past couple of decades, KNP has been facing serious shortage of water (Prusty et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Almost 95 % of {{the world}} {{population}} of Siberian crane (<b>Grus</b> <b>leucogeranus)</b> winter in Poyang Lake, China. Here they forage on the tubers of the submerged aquatic macrophyte Vallisneria spiralis L. The growth and production of V. spiralis are regulated by the local hydrology, which might also {{be influenced by the}} changed hydrology of the Yangtze River induced by engineering projects. This thesis investigated the impact of dredging activities in the northern Poyang Lake and the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River on the water turbidity and water level of Poyang Lake, analyzed how these hydrological changes influenced the underwater light climate of V. spiralis, and discussed their potential impacts on the growth and productivity of V. spiralis and further on the food habitat of Siberian crane in Poyang Lake. The principal results obtained can be summarized as follows: (1) Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat thematic mapper (TM) images were compared for mapping the tempo-spatial dynamics of water clarity. Two multiple regression models including the blue and red bands of Landsat TM and MODIS respectively explained 83 % and 88 % of the variation of the natural logarithm of Secchi disk depth. On the basis of the comparison of water clarity predicted from Landsat TM and MODIS data as well as the advantages and contras of both sensors, it is concluded that MODIS offers the possibility to monitor the dynamics of water clarity more regularly and cheaply in relatively big and frequently cloud covered lakes like Poyang Lake. (2) The performance of the various Landsat TM bands for detecting dredging ships was explored in the turbid water of the northern Poyang Lake. The result revealed that the TM bands 1 to 4 had limitation especially in turbid water, while bands 5 and 7 better discriminated vessels from surrounding waters. Therefore, it is recommended using the mid-infrared bands of Landsat TM for operational ship monitoring in turbid water. (3) The possibility to strengthen inference of dredging impact while simultaneously monitoring vessels and water turbidity with remote sensing techniques was investigated in the northern Poyang Lake. Time-series MODIS images revealed a significant increase in water turbidity from 2001 onwards, while Landsat TM image analysis indicated a simultaneous {{increase in the number of}} vessels. Regression analysis further showed a highly significant positive relation (R 2 = 0. 92) between water turbidity and vessel number. On the basis of discussion of ship-related resuspension, final destinations of vessels and coincidence of vessel clusters with irregular dented patterns and turbid plume development, it is confirmed that dredging caused the increase in water turbidity. Therefore, it is concluded that simultaneously monitoring water turbidity and vessels enhanced the strength of evidence in remotely sensed dredging impact assessments. (4) Three extrapolation and interpolation methods were compared for predicting daily photosynthetically active radiation reaching the earth surface over the Poyang Lake national nature reserve. The result revealed that the triangulated irregular network (TIN) and inverse distance weighted (IDW) -based interpolation method produced more reliable result than the extrapolation methods. (5) The photosynthetically active radiation reaching the top of V. spiralis (PARlc) in Lake Dahuchi from 1998 to 2006 was modelled. The results revealed significant between year differences in PARtc, which were determined primarily by fluctuation in water level. Six years of Secchi disk depth records revealed seasonal switching of the lake from turbid at low water level in autumn, winter and spring to clear at high water level in summer. The highest PARtc occurred at intermediate water levels, which were reached when the Yangtze River forces Lake Dahuchi out of its turbid state in spring. The operation of the Three Gorges Dam, which will increase water level of Yangtze River from May to June may force Lake Dahuchi out of its turbid state earlier and increase the light intensity reaching the canopy and the production of V spiralis. It is concluded that the operation of the Three Gorges Dam might at the short term increase the light regime and productivity of V. spiralis and possibly affect the food habitat of Siberian crane in Poyang Lake. (6) A conceptual framework to integrate a simulation model of plant biomass for V. spiralis with remote sensing and a geographical information system was introduced. It is expected that the system, once implemented, could contribute to evaluate the impact of possible hydrological changes on the growth and productivity of V. spiralis, and assess whether tuber feeding bird populations are constrained by the regional availability of food resources in Lake Poyang. It is anticipated that these results provide a basis for the future research and necessary information for decision-making that need to be made by the responsible authorities to decide how to rationally manage this unique lake ecosystem...|$|R
