40|$|In recent years, {{the control}} or <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> {{and any other}} {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) possibly circulating in the sheep population has become a priority in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. A {{better understanding of the}} epidemiology of scrapie would greatly aid the development and evaluation of control and eradication strategies. Here we bound the range of key epidemiological parameters using a combination of relatively detailed pathogenesis and demography data, more limited data on susceptibility and incubation times, and recent survey data on scrapie incidence in Great Britain. These data are simultaneously analysed using mathematical models describing scrapie transmission between sheep and between flocks. Our analysis suggests that occurrence of scrapie in a flock typically provokes changes in flock management that promote termination of the outbreak, such as the adoption of selective breeding, and that a large fraction of cases (possibly over 80 %) goes undetected. We show that the data analysed are consistent with the within-flock reproduction number of scrapie lying in the range 1 · 5 – 6, consistent with previous epidemiological studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Following EU {{decision}} 2003 / 100 /EC Member States {{have recently}} implemented sheep breeding programmes {{to reduce the}} prevalence of sheep with TSE susceptible prion genotypes. The present paper investigates {{the progress of the}} breeding programme in the Netherlands. The PrP genotype frequencies were monitored through time using two sets of random samples: one set covers the years 2005 to 2008 and is taken from national surveillance programme; the other is taken from 168 random sheep farms in 2007. The data reveal that although the level of compliance to the breeding programme has been high, the frequency of susceptible genotypes varies substantially between farms. The 168 sheep farms are a subset of 689 farms participating in a postal survey inquiring about management and breeding strategies. This survey aimed to identify how much these strategies varied between farms, in order to inform assessment of the expected future progress towards <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> classical <b>scrapie.</b> Results On the one hand, we found that compliance to the national breeding program has been high, and the frequency of resistant genotypes is expected to increase further in the next few years. On the other hand, we observed a large variation in prevalence <b>of</b> the <b>scrapie</b> resistant PrP genotype ARR between farms, implicating a large variation of genetic resistance between farms. Substantial between-flock differences in management and breeding strategies were found in the postal survey, suggesting considerable variation in risk <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> transmission between farms. Conclusions Our results show that although there has been a good progress in the breeding for scrapie resistance and the average farm-level scrapie susceptibility in the Netherlands has been significantly reduced, still a considerable proportion of farms contain high frequencies of susceptible genotypes in their sheep population. Since 2007 the breeding for genetic resistance is voluntarily again, and participation to selective breeding can decrease as a result of this. This, together with the patterns of direct and indirect contact between sheep farms, might present a challenge of the aim <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> <b>eradication.</b> Communication to sheep owners of the effect of the breeding programme thus far, and of the prospects for classical scrapie eradication in The Netherlands might be essential for obtaining useful levels of participation to the voluntary continuation of the breeding programme. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genetic {{predisposition}} to scrapie in sheep {{is associated with}} several variations in the peptide sequence of the prion protein gene (PRNP). DNA-based tests for scoring PRNP codons are essential tools for eradicating scrapie and for evaluating rare alleles for increased resistance to disease. In addition to those associated with scrapie, there are dozens more PRNP polymorphisms that may occur in various flocks. If not accounted for, these sites may cause base-pair mismatching with oligonucleotides used in DNA testing. Thus, the fidelity <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> genetic testing is enhanced by knowing the position and frequency of PRNP polymorphisms in targeted flocks. Results An adaptive DNA sequencing strategy was developed to determine the 771 bp PRNP coding sequence for any sheep and thereby produce a consensus sequence for targeted flocks. The strategy initially accounted for 43 known polymorphisms and facilitates the detection of unknown polymorphisms through an overlapping amplicon design. The strategy was applied to 953 sheep DNAs from multiple breeds in U. S. populations. The samples included two sets of reference sheep: one set for standardizing PRNP genetic testing and another set for discovering polymorphisms, estimating allele frequencies, and determining haplotype phase. DNA sequencing revealed 16 previously unreported polymorphisms, including a L 237 P variant on the F 141 haplotype. Two mass spectrometry multiplex assays were developed to score five codons of interest in U. S. sheep: 112, 136, 141, 154, and 171. Reference tissues, DNA, trace files, and genotypes from this project are publicly available for use without restriction. Conclusion Identifying ovine PRNP polymorphisms in targeted flocks is critical for designing efficient scrapie genetic testing systems. Together with reference DNA panels, this information facilitates training, certification, and development of new tests and knowledge that may expedite the <b>eradication</b> <b>of</b> sheep <b>scrapie.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|During {{experiments}} on the purification <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> infectivity, changes {{were found in}} the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> titration. After exposure to detergent, infectivity estimates by both endpoint titration and incubation period were altered. The addition of detergent to the diluent used in titration resulted in at least a 100 -fold increase in the infectivity estimate. This suggests that the amount <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> in a sample, as measured by serial dilution and titration, may be underestimated to different extents, depending on the biochemical milieu of the inoculum. Membrane fractions treated with detergents before dilution exhibited longer incubation periods than untreated fractions for the same number of infectious units <b>of</b> <b>scrapie.</b> This demonstrates that detergent treatments and possibly other biochemical manipulations can cause changes in the response of the host to the inoculum that are not detectable if incubation periods alone are used to estimate scrapie 'titre'.

Detailed simulations <b>of</b> the <b>scrapie</b> outbreak reveal that the observed patterns of seasonality in incidence can not {{be accounted for by}} seasonality in demography alone and provide strong support for the hypothesis of increased transmission during lambing.

40|$|Following {{diagnosis}} <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> in a clinically suspect Suffolk sheep, 7 clinically normal flockmates {{were purchased}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture to determine their scrapie status using an immunohistochemical procedure. Two of the 7 euthanized healthy sheep had positive immunohistochemical staining of the prion protein <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> (PrP-Sc) in their brains, nictitating membranes, and tonsils. The PrP-Sc was localized {{in the areas of}} the brain where, histopathologically, there was neurodegeneration and astrocytosis. The PrP-Sc occurred within germinal centers of the affected nictitating membranes and tonsils and was located in the cytoplasm of the dendrite-like cells, lymphoid cells, and macrophages. These results confirm that immunohistochemical examination of the nictitating membrane {{can be used as a}} screen for the presence <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> infection in clinically normal sheep at a capable veterinary diagnostic laboratory. In sheep with a PrP-Sc–positive nictitating membrane, the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> should be confirmed by histopathology and immunohistochemical examination of the brain following necropsy. Following full validation, immunohistochemistry assays for detection of PrP-Sc in nictitating membrane lymphoid tissues can improve the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>scrapie</b> control and eradication program by allowing diagnosis of the disease in sheep before the appearance of clinical signs...|$|R

The sheep were killed at sequential time points during a scrapie infection covering both the early and late stages <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> pathogenesis. Various lymphoid and neural tissues were collected and immunohistochemically examined for the presence of the scrapie-associated prion protein PrPSc, a marker for scrapie infectivity.

40|$|Scrapie is endemic in {{the sheep}} flocks of many countries, but good {{epidemiological}} {{information on this}} disease is scarce. Data on {{the initial stages of}} an epidemic are even more rare. We describe the ongoing epidemic <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> in Cyprus that has been tracked since it began in the mid- 1980 s.

The impact of interventions on the control of the epidemic are discussed from an epidemiological and economic point of view.

40|$|Abstract Background Scrapie is {{a chronic}} {{neurodegenerative}} disease affecting small ruminants and {{belongs to the}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Scrapie is considered a serious animal disease {{and it has been}} notifiable in Norway since 1965. The clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> might be vague and the farmers, if familiar with the signs <b>of</b> <b>scrapie,</b> are often in the best position for detecting scrapie suspects. In 2002, an anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted in order to assess Norwegian sheep farmers' vigilance <b>of</b> <b>scrapie.</b> Results Although the potential detection of a scrapie-positive animal would lead to the destruction of the sheep flock concerned, almost all the farmers (97 %) expressed their willingness to report scrapie suspects. This was most certainly dependent on the Government taking the economic responsibility for the control programme as nearly all the farmers responded that this was an important condition. Listeriosis is relatively common disease in Norwegian sheep and a differential diagnosis for scrapie. In a multinomial logistic regression the reporting behaviour for non-recovering listeriosis cases, used as a measurement of willingness to report scrapie, was examined. The reporting of non-recovering listeriosis cases increased as the knowledge of scrapie-associated signs increased, and the reporting behaviour was dependent on both economic and non-economic values. Conclusion The results indicate that in 2002 almost all sheep farmers showed willingness to report any scrapie suspects. Nevertheless there is an underreporting <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> suspects and the farmers' awareness and hence their vigilance <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> could be improved. Furthermore, the results suggest that to ensure the farmers' compliance to control programmes for serious infectious diseases, the farmers' concerns of non-economic as well as economic values should be considered. </p...|$|R
40|$|Scrapie is a fatal, {{neurological}} disease of {{sheep and goats}} and belongs to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In 1998, a new type <b>of</b> <b>scrapie,</b> designated scrapie Nor 98, was detected in Norway. Scrapie Nor 98 differs from classical scrapie {{in the distribution of}} pathological changes and <b>of</b> the <b>scrapie</b> prion protein, the Western blot profile of the prion protein, and with isolated cases usually being observed in the case flocks. In 2004, a case–control study was conducted on scrapie Nor 98 with 28 cases and 102 randomly selected controls. The questionnaire included questions on demographic data, animal contact between sheep flocks, indirect contact with equipment, use of concentrate feed and supplemental feeds, and use of medicines and vaccines. The data were analysed by using logistic regression with the sheep flock as the statistical unit. In the final model, the detection <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> Nor 98 was related to the practice of not removing all afterbirths, the use of vitamin and mineral feed supplements, the absence of concentrate feed of swine or poultry on the farm and the presence of dogs on the farm. The results show that the epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> Nor 98 differs from that <b>of</b> classical <b>scrapie</b> in that no risk factors that indicate transmission <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> Nor 98 between flocks by movement or direct contact between animals were found. Furthermore, the association between scrapie Nor 98 and mineral intake shown herein should be explored further. Although the possibility that scrapie Nor 98 has a low transmissibility between animals under natural conditions cannot be ruled out, the results would also be in accordance with a spontaneous aetiology...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the causative agent <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> represents a class of infectious particle that is devoid of nucleic acid and that an altered form of the endogenous prion protein (PrP) is the agent.

To obtain PrP uncontaminated by scrapie-infected tissues, PrP cDNA cloned from a scrapie-infected mouse brain was expressed in mouse C 127 cells in vitro. mRNA and protein encoded by the cloned PrP gene were identified. The expressed PrP polypeptides appeared to be glycosylated and were released from the cell surface into the medium. Homogenates of the cells expressing the cloned PrP gene were inoculated into susceptible mice but failed to induce clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>scrapie.</b> Thus, either PrP is not the transmissible agent <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> or the expressed PrP requires additional modification to be infectious...|$|R
40|$|The {{mode and}} the site of action of the major antiscrapie drugs have been studied by {{investigating}} their effects on the abnormal protease-resistant isoform of PrP (PrPres) and on its accumulation in mouse spleen.

Three phases were identified: the detection <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> inoculum on the day <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> infection, a clearance phase, and then the peripheral accumulation of PrPres. In a second step, {{the effects of the}} polyene antibiotic MS- 8209, the polyanion dextran sulfate 500 (DS 500), and Congo red were assessed on these phases, after the drugs were coincubated with scrapie inoculum. Highly different mechanisms and sites of action were apparent. MS- 8209 had a weak effect on the accumulation of PrPres in spleen, sug-gesting another site of intervention for this drug. DS 500 delayed the beginning of the clearance phase but then blocked PrPres synthesis {{for a long period of}} time, probably because of its immunological effects on the spleen. Surprisingly, Congo red suppressed the clearance phase <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> inoculum and then increased transiently accumulation of PrPres in spleen.

Passaging studies demonstrated that the host species, and not the source <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> prions, determined the incubation time for each species, and histochemical studies of hamsters with clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> revealed characteristic patterns of neuropathology. Northern (RNA) analysis showed the size of PrP mRNA from CHa, AHa, and SHa hamsters to be 2. 5, 2. 4, and 2. 1 kilobases, respectively. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the PrP isoforms were of similar size (33 to 35 kilodaltons); however, the monoclonal antibody 13 A 5 raised against SHa PrP did not react with the CHa or AHa PrP molecules. Comparison of the three predicted amino acid sequences revealed that each is distinct.

They have been exploited successfully as model pathogens for the development of novel disinfectants with simultaneous activity also against bacteria, viruses and fungi. In order to further facilitate the use of prions as model agents in the search for novel broad-range disinfectants without the use of animal experiments we established and validated an experimental platform for the sensitive quantitative measurement and biological detection <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> seeding activity in vitro.

Steel wires contaminated with 263 K scrapie prions were subjected to different decontamination procedures and subsequently analysed by quantitative PMCA. The results of the PMCA assay were validated by comparison to bioassay data previously established for similar treatments of steel wires. Furthermore a novel cell culture assay of cerebral glial cell cultures from hamsters was established for the biological detection <b>of</b> 263 K <b>scrapie</b> seeding activity. The detection limit for scrapie seeding activity on steel wires in the PMCA assay exceeded that for prion infectivity detected by bioassay at least tenfold.

40|$|A {{postal survey}} of British sheep farmers {{provided}} {{information on the}} proportion of farms that experienced their first case <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> in each year between 1962 and 1998. We {{found no evidence of}} a large increase in the proportion of scrapie-affected farms prior to, during or following the epidemic of BSE in British cattle. After correcting for between-farm heterogeneity in the probability <b>of</b> acquiring <b>scrapie,</b> we estimated the yearly between-flock force of infection since 1962. The current force of infection is estimated at approximately 0. 0045 per farm per year and combined with a simple model <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> spread provides an estimate of the average duration <b>of</b> a <b>scrapie</b> outbreak on an individual farm. Considering all farms, the average outbreak lasts for five years, but if only those farms that have cases in animals born on the farm are considered, it lasts 15 years. We use these parameter estimates to compare the proportion <b>of</b> farms with <b>scrapie</b> in time periods of different lengths. In the survey, 2. 7 % of farms had a case in 1998. The 5. 3 % of farms reporting having a case between 1993 and 1997 is consistent with the hypothesis that the <b>scrapie</b> force <b>of</b> infection remained constant over this period...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Total {{number and}} genotypes {{of animals in}} {{holdings}} selected for the genotype & cull option in the Compulsory Scrapie Flock Scheme (CSFS) in Great Britain were extracted from the National Scrapie Plan data warehouse. The association between various genotype-related measures and scrapie prevalence infection was tested using zero-inflated negative binomial models with the counts of positive cases as dependent variable, and country, number of flocks in the scheme, flock size, surveillance source and the following genotype-related measurements: the centered-log ratios (clr) oof the 15 genotypes, of the proportions of the 5 alleles at codons 136, 154 and 171, of the proportions of the 5 NSP types, and two flock-susceptibility risk indicators, as explanatory variables. A total of 319341 genotyped animals from 168 holdings {{were included in the}} analysis. An increased proportion of the ARR/ARR genotype corresponded to a decrease in the number <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> cases. ARR/AHQ, AHQ/VRQ, ARH/VRQ and ARQ/VRQ genotypes, NSP type V, ARH, ARQ, AHQ and VRQ alleles and the low and high-susceptibility risk indicators are all associated with an increase risk in the number <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> cases. Regardless the management practices; the increased susceptibility that the non-ARR alleles confer on an individual could be extrapolated at the population level. Increasing prevalence of ARR allele reduces the overall risk <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> at population level. At genotype level, the VRQ/VRQ genotype, present a very low frequency in the study population, seems to play a residual effect in the overall risk <b>of</b> <b>scrapie</b> in a flock. </p...|$|R
