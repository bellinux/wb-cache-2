5|$|As the Doctor investigates, {{he realizes}} that alien energy lifeforms were beamed onto the ship within the {{containment}} field into which the protostar samples were transported. The missing crew members have been converted to <b>energy</b> <b>by</b> the lifeforms from the protostar, presumably as hostages in retaliation for Voyagers actions. The Doctor releases the energy lifeforms on the holodeck; in kind, the missing crew are returned to their original forms.

5|$|HD 28185 {{is similar}} to our Sun in terms of mass, radius, and luminosity. The star is on the main {{sequence}} and is generating <b>energy</b> <b>by</b> fusing hydrogen in its core. The spectral type of G5V implies HD 28185 is cooler than the Sun. Like the majority of extrasolar planet host stars, HD 28185 is metal-rich relative to the Sun, containing around 173% of the solar abundance of iron. The star rotates slower than the Sun, with a period of around 30 days, compared to 25.4 days for the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{structures}} that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (often called fats). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them {{as a source of}} <b>energy,</b> <b>by</b> their digestion.

5|$|Terrestrial weather occurs almost {{exclusively}} in {{the lower part of}} the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat. Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat <b>energy</b> <b>by</b> the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.|$|E
