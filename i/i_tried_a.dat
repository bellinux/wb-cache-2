According to an interview with Booker, Coyle had worked on song ideas using GarageBand which she then presented to Booker in England to work on together further. The producer said, [...] "She was singing her songs to loops, and then I took the loops out and rewrote the music from scratch to her ideas." [...] He described her songs as [...] "very pop". Booker also worked on songs to show off Coyle's vocals: [...] "Because she’s got such a belting voice, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>a</b> couple of things where she could really belt," [...] he said.|$|E

Plant's UK-based manager told E! News later that the rocker was apparently being cheeky when {{he used the word}} [...] "eloped" [...] to describe his home life, for [...] "Robert has not married Patty Griffin," [...] instead [...] "He was just referring to the fact that he's been residing in Texas" [...] with her. Actually, according to a July 2012 Ultimate Classic Rock article, Plant and Griffin had been dating for over a year, spending half of their time together in Austin, Texas. On 23 August 2014, The Independent, a UK publication, indicated Plant had broken up with Patty Griffin: [...] "“Patty and <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>a</b> sort of zig-zag across the Atlantic,” Plant told the publication, “but she didn’t share my penchant for cider and she used to marvel at the Black Country character I became after four pints of Thatchers. My feelings are very much ones of sadness and regret." ...|$|E

She {{worked with a}} number of famous songwriters and producers during recording sessions, such as Desmond Child, Guy Chambers, Mike Elizondo, Steve Booker, Toby Gad, Tony Kanal, and newcomer Ricci Riccardi. Nadine also worked with Lucie Silvas, Matchbox Twenty's Kyle Cook, William Orbit, and Tiesto. Nadine said she had sketched out most of the tracks in her London flat, before taking them to producers. Some of the original vocals, recorded in her front room, remain on the finished record. Some songs were even recorded in Nadine's en suite bathroom. According to an interview with Booker, Coyle had worked on song ideas using GarageBand which she then presented to Booker in England to work on together further. The producer said, [...] "She was singing her songs to loops, and then I took the loops out and rewrote the music from scratch to her ideas." [...] He described her songs as [...] "very pop". Booker also worked on songs to show off Nadine's vocals: [...] "Because she’s got such a belting voice, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>a</b> couple of things where she could really belt," [...] he said. Nadine herself said, [...] "We never did big, massive notes, so it was difficult to fit my style of writing on a Girls Aloud album." [...] In February 2010, Nadine revealed that she was recording extra tracks to help perfect her solo album, in order to have [...] "a lot of choices." ...|$|E

I made her promise to write to me the moment she had any news to send. And I went back to my business in London, with a mind exceedingly ill at ease.|$|E
