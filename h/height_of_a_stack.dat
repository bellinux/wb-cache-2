Sequence logos show each {{column in the}} alignment as stacks of symbol(s) where the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> is proportional to its informational content, whereas the height of each symbol within the stack is proportional to its frequency in the column. Sequence logos use symbols of either nucleotide or amino acid alphabets. However, certain regulatory signals in messenger RNA (mRNA) act as combinations of codons.

Results: We present the first application which allows visualization of conserved regions in a multiple sequence alignment {{in the context of}} codons. CodonLogo is based on WebLogo 3 and uses the same heuristics but treats codons as inseparable units of a 64 -letter alphabet. CodonLogo can discriminate patterns of codon conservation from patterns of nucleotide conservation that appear indistinguishable in standard sequence logos.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Tall smokestacks [...] stacks of 500 feet or higher, which are primarily used at coal power plants [...] release air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) high into the atmosphere to help limit {{the impact of these}} emissions on local air quality. Tall stacks can also increase the distance these pollutants travel in the atmosphere and harm air quality and the environment in downwind communities. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act encourage the use of pollution control equipment over dispersion techniques, such as tall stacks, to meet national air standards. Section 123 of the Act does not limit stack height, but prohibits sources of emissions from using the dispersion effects <b>of</b> <b>stack</b> <b>heights</b> in excess <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack's</b> good engineering practice (GEP) height to meet emissions limitations. GAO was asked to report on (1) the number and location of tall stacks of 500 feet or higher at coal power plants and when they began operating; (2) what is known about such stacks' contribution to the interstate transport of air pollution and the pollution controls installed at plants with these stacks; and (3) the number of stacks that were built above GEP height since 1988 and the reasons for this. GAO analyzed Energy Information Administration (EIA) data on power plants, surveyed states with tall stacks, and interviewed experts on the transport of air pollution. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy stated they had no comments on this report...|$|R
40|$|The synthesis, morphology, and {{properties}} of segmented poly(ether amide) s based on flexible PTHF segments (Mn = 1. 1 × 103 g mol– 1) and uniform rigid oxalamide segments were investigated. The amount of oxalamide {{groups in the}} hard segment and the spacer length of bisoxalamide-based hydrogen bonded arrays were varied systematically. The segmented poly(ether amide) with single oxalamide groups connecting the polyether blocks was a sticky solid with a melting temperature of 25 °C. Incorporation of uniform hard segments consisting of two interconnected oxalamide units provided highly phase-separated thermoplastic elastomers with a broad temperature-independent rubber plateau. By decreasing the aliphatic spacer length separating two oxalamide units from 10 to 2 methylene groups, the melting transitions increased from 140 to 200 °C. FT-IR evidenced strongly hydrogen bonded and highly ordered bisoxalamide hard segments with degrees of ordering between 66 and 90 %. AFM revealed the presence of fiber-like nanocrystals with lengths up to several hundreds of nanometers randomly dispersed in the soft PTHF matrix. The long dimension of the crystals was found parallel to {{the direction of the}} hydrogen bonds. One of the other small dimensions of the crystal approximately equals the length of the oxalamide segment, whereas the other one may correspond to the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> containing ca. 10 – 20 hydrogen-bonded sheets. Upon heating, the crystalline phase melts over a broad temperature range to give a homogeneous melt according to temperature-dependent FT-IR, SAXS, and rheology data. Increasing the number of oxalamide groups in the hard segment to three afforded a highly phase-separated material with a melting transition above 200 °C. The segmented copolymers with two or three oxalamide groups in the hard segment show a distinct yield point and have an elastic modulus between 121 and 210 MPa, a stress at break ranging from 15 to 27 MPa, and strain at break of 150 up to 900 %. The results demonstrate that alternating block copolymers with soft PTHF segments and uniform hard segments containing two or three oxalamide groups are TPEs with good thermal and mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Every {{five years}} Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) generates an updated {{meteorological}} database to facilitate dosimetric calculations of accident and routine release scenarios for onsite and offsite populations. This information becomes {{the input of}} various environmental dosimetry codes run by the Environmental Dosimetry Group (EDG) at SRNL. The three most recent databases prior to the current one were completed for the time periods 1987 - 1991, 1992 - 1996, and 1997 - 2001. The current database covers the period 2002 - 2006. This study represents {{a portion of a}} larger study to compare the meteorological data among these four five-year periods and focuses on updating VENTSAR XL{copyright} for the current meteorological database. The updated meteorological data are also applied in other dosimetry models approved for risk and dose assessment at Savannah River Site (SRS). VENTSAR XL{copyright} is a Gaussian Plume model that includes building effects and plume rise. The typical input involves the location of the release, building dimensions, distance to the building, release height, vent diameter, vent gas temperature, gas molecular weight, ambient air temperature, breathing rate, meteorological conditions, radionuclides and their amount released. The output is easily converted into tables and graphs for further analysis and shows the concentrations and pathway doses for each of the incremental downwind distances. VENTSAR XL{copyright} has been used at SRS to investigate building effects such as reactor cooling towers in support of safety analyses. VENTSAR XL{copyright} has also been applied to Good Engineering Practice (GEP) stack height evaluations for various projects at SRS. In accordance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, GEP must be used in determining the height of any stack that will be used to disperse routine emissions. With respect to stack heights, the GEP height is 'the height necessary to ensure that emissions from the stack do not result in excessive concentrations of any air pollutant in the immediate vicinity of the source as a result of atmospheric downwash, eddies and wakes which may be created by the source itself, nearby structures or nearby terrain obstacles. ' The EPA has set specific criteria to determine if a stack is of the acceptable height. These criteria have been used to determine a GEP stack height for several emission assessments at SRS. The EPA documents contain detailed information on how the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> is determined. The general rule for stack height determination is to make the stack at least 2 1 / 2 times the height of nearby buildings. This estimated height can be increased or decreased based on other factors such as plume rise, downwash, and building wake effects...|$|E
