25|$|The biggest {{achievement}} of the invention of clepsydrae during this time, however, was by Ctesibius with his incorporation of gears and a <b>dial</b> <b>indicator</b> to automatically show the time as the lengths of the days changed throughout the year, because of the temporal timekeeping used during his day. Also, a Greek astronomer, Andronicus of Cyrrhus, supervised the construction of his Horologion, known today as the Tower of the Winds, in the Athens marketplace (or agora) {{in the first half}} of the 1st century BCE. This octagonal clocktower showed scholars and shoppers both sundials and mechanical hour indicators. It featured a 24-hour mechanized clepsydra and indicators for the eight winds from which the tower got its name, and it displayed the seasons of the year and astrological dates and periods.|$|E
2500|$|Run-out is {{measured}} using a <b>dial</b> <b>indicator</b> {{on a fixed}} rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the brake disc's face. It is typically measured about [...] from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around [...] Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining {{the root cause of}} the indicator displacement (lateral runout) requires disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.|$|E
50|$|Once worked, {{the grease}} {{is placed in}} a {{penetration}} test apparatus.

40|$|Introduction. According to "A Test Plan for Investigating the Structural Integrity of TileCal modules" by Norman Hill {{a series}} of {{mechanical}} tests have been carried out. Stiffnesses and loads which could cause failure of the sub-module were measured. Measurements of displacements were carried out using <b>dial</b> <b>indicators.</b> These data have been compared with results of numerical calculations. 2 Shear failure of the front-plate To simulate front part of three submodules connected with one front-plate, a set-up shown in Fig. 1 a has been realised. The final load equal to 85 tons caused failure of two cross-sections of the front-plate and some parts of welds. The average value of shear stresses in the front-plate are equal to av = 85 tons Δ 9810 N tons =(2 Δ 1240 mm) = 336 MP a: 1 Using the Mises-Hencky theory the equivalent one...|$|R
5000|$|The easiest {{method for}} {{measuring}} flatness {{is with a}} height gauge positioned on a surface plate. Note that you must set up the part on three stands and find the minimum variation while adjusting them, just placing the part on the surface plate and using a <b>dial</b> <b>indicator</b> to find TIR {{on the opposite side}} of the part measures parallelism. Flatness is more easily measured with a co-ordinate measuring machine. But neither of these methods can measure flatness more accurately than about 0.0001" [...] (2.5μm).|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} feature of gauge blocks {{is that they can}} be joined together with very little dimensional uncertainty. The blocks are joined by a sliding process called wringing, which causes their ultra-flat surfaces to cling together. A small number of gauge blocks can be used to create accurate lengths within a wide range. By using 3 blocks from a set of 30 blocks, one may create any of the 1000 lengths from 3.000 to 3.999 mm in 0.001 mm steps (or [...]3000 to [...]3999 inches in 0.0001 inch steps). Gauge blocks were invented in 1896 by Swedish machinist Carl Edvard Johansson. [...] They are used as a reference for the calibration of measuring equipment used in machine shops, such as micrometers, sine bars, calipers, and <b>dial</b> <b>indicators</b> (when used in an inspection role). Gauge blocks are the main means of length standardization used by industry.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a small-scaled {{accelerated}} {{loading test}} based on similarity theory and Accelerated Pavement Analyzer {{was developed to}} evaluate dowel bars with different materials and cross-sections. Jointed concrete specimen consisting of one dowel was designed as scaled model for the test, and each specimen was subjected to 864 thousand loading cycles. Deflections between jointed slabs were measured with <b>dial</b> <b>indicators,</b> and strains of the dowel bars were monitored with strain gauges. The load transfer efficiency, differential deflection, and dowel-concrete bearing stress for each case were calculated from these measurements. The test {{results indicated that the}} effect of the dowel modulus on load transfer efficiency can be characterized based on the similarity model test developed in the study. Moreover, round steel dowel was found to have similar performance to larger FRP dowel, and elliptical dowel can be preferentially considered in practice.
