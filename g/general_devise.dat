40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of Description Logics (DLs) {{concrete}} domains allow to model concepts and facts {{by the use of}} concrete values and pred-icates between them. For reasoning in the DL ALC with general TBoxes concrete domains may cause undecidability. Under certain restrictions of the concrete domains decidability can be regained. Typically, the con-crete domain predicates are crisp, which is a limitation for some applica-tions. In this paper we investigate crisp ALC in combination with fuzzy concrete domains for <b>general</b> TBoxes, <b>devise</b> conditions for decidability, and give a tableau-based reasoning algorithm. ...|$|R

He would have mail flown across the country completely by air, without using the railroad, {{in order to reduce}} transit time, and chose February 22, 1921, for the all-air cross-country test. This flight would not be an easy task for the pilots flying in unprotected cockpits as {{it would be difficult for}} pilots to find visual landmarks at night. On the morning of February 22, 1921, two mail planes left Hazelhurst Field, Long Island, New York, heading west, while two other planes left Marina Field, San Francisco, California flying east.

40|$|Visual {{tracking}} {{is prone}} to distractions, where features similar to the target features guide the tracker away from its intended object. Global shape models and dynamic models are necessary for completely distraction-free contour tracking, {{but there are many}} cases when component feature trackers alone can be expected to avoid distraction. We define the tracking problem in <b>general</b> and <b>devise</b> a method for local, window-based, feature trackers to track accurately in spite of background distractions. The algorithm is applied to a generic line tracker and a snake-like contour tracker which are then experimentally analyzed with respect to previous contour-trackers.
