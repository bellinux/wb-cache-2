40|$|When agonistic {{interventions}} are nepotistic, individuals {{are expected to}} side more often with kin but less often against kin in comparison with non-kin. As yet, however, few mammal studies {{have been in a}} position to test the validity of this assertion with respect to paternal relatedness. We therefore used molecular genetic kinship testing to assess whether adult female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) from the free-ranging colony of Cayo Santiago (Puerto Rico) bias their interventions in ongoing dyadic aggressive interactions towards maternal and paternal <b>half-sisters</b> compared with unrelated females. It turned out that females supported maternal <b>half-sisters</b> significantly more often than paternal <b>half-sisters</b> or non-kin regardless of the costs associated with such interventions. Similarly, females targeted maternal <b>half-sisters</b> significantly less often than non-kin when this was associated with high costs. Unrelated females provided significantly higher mean rates of both high- and low-cost support to each other than did paternal <b>half-sisters.</b> However, females targeted paternal <b>half-sisters</b> significantly less often than non-kin when targeting was at low cost, suggesting that females refrain from intervening against paternal <b>half-sisters.</b> Our data confirm the general view that coalition formation in female mammals is a function of both the level of maternal relatedness and of the costs of intervention. The patterns of coalition formation among paternal kin were found to be more complex, and may also differ across species, but clear evidence for paternal kin discrimination was observed in female rhesus as predicted by kin selection theory...|$|R
40|$|Adult female cercopithecines {{have long}} been known to bias their social {{behaviour}} towards close maternal kin. However, much less is understood about the behaviour of paternal kin, especially in wild populations. Here, we show that wild adult female baboons bias their affiliative behaviour towards their adult paternal <b>half-sisters</b> {{in the same manner}} and to the same extent that they bias their behaviour towards adult maternal <b>half-sisters.</b> Females appear to rely heavily on social familiarity as a means of biasing their behaviour towards paternal <b>half-sisters,</b> but may use phenotype matching as well...|$|R

5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a <b>half-sister</b> was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her <b>half-sister,</b> but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E
