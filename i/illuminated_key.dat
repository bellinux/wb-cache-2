In each experiment, one group of ducklings was raised in monochromatic (589 nanometers) sodium-vapor light and a second group, in white light. In Exp. I, ducklings pecked a key transilluminated by 589 nanometers. In a subsequent test, the group raised in white light produced steeper gradients. However, several monochromatically reared ducklings produced gradients as steep as those for the white-reared ducklings. In Exp. II, ducklings pecked a white line. In a subsequent test, using a fully <b>illuminated</b> <b>key,</b> subjects in both groups responded more often to “green” (510, 530, 550, or 570 nanometers) than to “non-green” wavelengths (490, 589, 610, or 650 nanometers).

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of mechanical systems with dry friction elements, modeled by set-valued force laws, can be de-scribed by differential inclusions. The switching and set-valued {{nature of the}} friction force law is responsi-ble for the hybrid character of such models. An equi-librium set of such a differential inclusion corresponds to a stationary mode for which the friction elements are sticking. The attractivity properties of the equilib-rium set are of major importance for the overall dy-namic behavior {{of this type of}} systems. Conditions for the attractivity of the equilibrium set of linear MDOF mechanical systems with multiple friction elements are presented. These results are obtained by application of a generalization of LaSalle’s principle for differen-tial inclusions of Filippov-type. Besides passive sys-tems, also systems with negative viscous damping are considered. For such systems, only local attractivity of the equilibrium set can be assured under certain condi-tions. Moreover, an estimate for the region of attraction is given for these cases. The results are illustrated by means of a 2 DOF example. Moreover, the value of the attractivity results {{in the context of the}} control of me-chanical systems with friction is <b>illuminated.</b> <b>Key</b> word...|$|E

Components were correlated with different keylights. When the rate of food presentation in the first component exceeded that in the second component, the local rate of key pecking was relatively high at onset of the first component. Overall rate in that component varied inversely with component duration {{and the rate of}} food presentation in the second component. When responding was maintained in the second component, the local rate of key pecking was relatively low at onset of that component.

40|$|This paper {{analysed}} {{the popularity}} of visual caricatures in identifiably modernist periodicals (most notably, The New Age, Rhythm, and Coterie). It is argued that these figures represent a form of modernist ‘novelty’, as recently outlined by Michael North and Aaron Jaffe. However, more attention will {{be paid to the}} ways in which these ‘novel’ images allowed periodical texts to synthesise and to transform various aspects of the encyclopaedic nineteenth-century print culture they had inherited. On one hand, caricature could be associated with British satirical publications (such as Punch), on another, it indicated an equally popular but seemingly less parochial Continental tradition (as in Jugend). Caricatures were a staple of newspapers—featuring in some of the very cheapest—but they had also been adopted and adapted by Beardsley on the pages of The Yellow Book and The Savoy in the mid-late 1890 s. By the end of the nineteenth century, these caricatures had themselves been caricatured, by the likes of Le Petit Journal des Refusées. The ambivalent position of both genres was indicated by Walter Benjamin in ‘Baudelaire in the Second Empire’. Here, Benjamin argued at length for the significance of the ‘feuillton’ and the ‘physiologie’ to the modernity of the period, before going on to dismiss them both as shallow and compromised. This ambivalence might even be said to exist in the ‘caricature’ itself, in which the individual becomes both more generic, and more distinctive, in the same representational gesture. As such, these seemingly ephemeral images momentarily <b>illuminated</b> <b>key</b> issues concerning the negotiation of identity in an emerging modernist field, whether that identity was of an individual publication, the wider movement it represented, or the individual or individuals depicted...|$|E
40|$|Compensatory {{behavior}} such as oculomotor, gaze, and postural {{responses that}} occur during movement largely depend upon a functioning vestibular system. In the present study, the initial loss and subsequent recovery of postural and head stability in pigeons undergoing vestibular regeneration were examined. Adult pigeons {{were trained to}} manipulate a straight run chamber to peck an <b>illuminated</b> <b>key</b> for fluid reward. Six behavioral measures assessing performance, posture, and head stability were quantified. These included run latency, steps (walking), path negotiation (lane changes), gaze saccades, head bobs, and head shakes. Once normative values were obtained for four birds, complete lesion of all receptor cells and denervation of the epithelia in the vestibular endorgans were produced using a single intralabyrinthine application of streptomycin sulfate. Each bird was then tested at specific times during regeneration and the same behavioral measures examined. At 7 days post-streptomycin treatment (PST), all birds exhibited severe postural and head instability, with tremors, head shakes, staggering, and circling predominating. No normal trial runs, walking, gaze saccades, or head bobs were present. Many of these dysfunctions persisted through 3 – 4 weeks PST. Gradually, tremor and head shakes diminished and were replaced with {{an increasing number of}} normal head bobs during steps and gaze saccades. Beginning at 4 weeks PST, but largely inaccurate, was the observed initiation of directed steps, less staggering, and some successful path negotiation. As regeneration progressed, spatial orientation and navigation ability increased and, by 49 days PST, most trials were successful. By 70 days PST, all birds had recovered to pretreatment levels. Thus, it was observed that ataxia must subside, coincident with normalized head and postural stability prior to the recovery of spatial orientation and path navigation recovery. Parallels in recovery were drawn to hair cell regeneration and afferent responsiveness, as inferred from present results and those in other investigations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present {{applications}} of long-term and multi-faceted approaches undertaken for the Division of Water Supply Protection of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) in modeling hydrodynamics and water quality in Wachusett Reservoir. The modeling work is part of a larger effort focused on the two reservoir (Quabbin and Wachusett) source of currently unfiltered drinking water for the Boston metropolitan area, with the long term research goal of providing a rational basis for watershed and reservoir management decisions through measurements of water quality and modeling of significant transport and transformation processes. Modeling of reservoir hydrodynamics and water quality has included extensive use of CEQUAL W 2, a two dimensional (longitudinal segments, depth layers, lateral homogeneity) finite difference model available in the public domain. Assessment and calibration of annual water budgets have highlighted strengths and weaknesses of available data in properly characterizing water quantity. Wachusett, the terminal supply reservoir, can be significantly affected by transfers from the larger, more pristine, Quabbin reservoir; modeling has <b>illuminated</b> <b>key</b> impacts of this transfer. Another aspect of the project has been to assess inputs and transformations of natural organic matter (NOM) due to its influence on subsequent oxidant/disinfectant demands and by-product formation. The current modeling work is directed as assessing potential impacts of contaminant spills (sewage, hydrocarbons) into the reservoir on water quality in the overall reservoir and at the Cosgrove water supply intake. Impacts of spill date (season) and location as well as contaminant type are being investigated through use of both the two dimensional CE QUAL W 2 model and a three dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model developed for the Thomas Basin.
