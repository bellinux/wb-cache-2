The polyaniline(PANI) -poly(vinyl alcoho 1) (PVA) {{composite}} {{films with}} the doping of hydrochloride (HCl), dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) or aminosulfonic acid (NH 2 SO 3 H) were prepared by in-situ polymerization. Effects of PVA content, HC 1 content, oxidant ammonium persulfate(APS) dosage, reaction time and <b>film</b> <b>drying</b> temperature on tensile {{strength of the}} HCl-PANI-PVA composite film were studied. The conductivity of PANI-PVA composite film with the doping of HCl is the highest of 13. 2 S. cm- 1 among them. The tensile strength {{of the film is}} improved greatly due to effective mixture of PANI and PVA. The tensile strength of the composite film substantially depended upon the mass fraction of PVA. The tensile strength of the HC 1 -PANI-PVA composite film reaches the maximum of 60. 8 MPa, in case the PVA content is 40 %, the C(HC 1) = 1. 0 mol/L，reaction time is 4. 0 h, the n(APS/An) = 1. 0, and <b>film</b> <b>drying</b> temperature is 80 ℃...|$|R

We find that <b>films</b> <b>dried</b> by spontaneous water evaporation are more ordered and homogeneous than <b>films</b> <b>dried</b> by nitrogen flow. The latter are quite inhomogeneous and may have regions with highly disordered polymer conformation. We propose that drying by spontaneous water evaporation reduces the effect of drag by the drying front, while during nitrogen-flow drying the fast evaporation of water ""freezes"" the disordered conformation of adsorbed polyelectrolyte molecules. These findings are important for many applications of LbL films, since device performance usually depends on film morphology and its molecular structure.

40|$|Infrared (IR) {{spectroscopy}} {{has previously}} been established {{as a means to}} accurately quantify several serum and urine metabolites, based upon spectroscopy of <b>dry</b> <b>films.</b> The same technique has also provided the basis to develop certain diagnostic tests, developed in the 'metabolomics' spirit. Here, we report on the further development of an integrated microfluidic-IR technology and technique, customized with the aim of dramatically extending the capabilities of IR spectroscopy in both analytical and diagnostic (metabolomic) applications. By exploiting the laminar fluid diffusion interface (LFDI), serum specimens are processed to yield product streams that are better suited for metabolic fingerprinting; metabolites are captured within the aqueous product stream, while proteins (which otherwise dominate the spectra of <b>films</b> <b>dried</b> from serum) are present in much reduced concentration. Spectroscopy of <b>films</b> <b>dried</b> from the aqueous stream then provides enhanced diagnostic and analytical sensitivity. The manuscript introduces an LFDI card design that is customized for integration with IR spectroscopy, and details the development of a quantitative assay for serum creatinine [...] based upon LFDI-processed serum samples [...] that is substantially more accurate (standard error of calibration, SEC = 43 micromol/L) than the corresponding assay based upon unprocessed serum specimens (SEC = 138 micromol/L). Preliminary results of diffusion modeling are reported, and the prospects for further optimization of the technique, guided by accurate modeling, are discussed.

The phase ratio is an important parameter that influences the localization of the HPMC-enriched phase and maltodextrin-enriched phase, i. e., to the particle surface, to the core, or in a more or less bicontinuous pattern. The drying time, affected by the solids content, was found to control the level of advancement of the phase segregation...|$|R

30|$|In {{parallel}} it {{has been}} extensively documented {{that the use of}} biocompatible and biodegradable alginate and chitosan wound dressing films/patches are advantageous in many ways: 1) They kill bacteria and prevent infections caused by systemic invasion (Burkatovskaya et al. 2008); 2) They promote a better healing environment by absorbing the wound exudate (Murakami et al. 2010); 3) They eliminate the need for wiping or washing the wounds in between new dressings (Ayogi et al. 2007); 4) They have good bio-adhesive properties, eliminating the need for surgical adhesives (Khan et al. 2000). The three most common means of <b>film</b> <b>drying</b> mentioned in the above references are air drying, thermostatic, and freeze drying. Meng et al. found that the <b>films</b> <b>dried</b> in open air were drier than expected (Meng et al. 2010).

In a more recent study of cross-linked scaffolds for tissue engineering, for the 4 – 12 % (w/v), no change in pore size range as a function of chitosan concentration was observed; but porosity was found to be inversely proportional to the chitosan content (Jana et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{creation}} of supersaturation transiently after application overcomes {{the issue of}} drug instability. However, if the solvents used to drive supersaturation evaporate too quickly, drug recrystallisation or rapid <b>film</b> <b>drying</b> can occur which will inhibit drug release. As such {{the effects of a}} residual solvent, poly(ethylene glycol) 400 (PEG), on the release, mobility and supersaturation kinetics of a transiently supersaturated formulation were studied. Materials and Methods. Metered dose aerosol (MDA) formulations consisting of hydrofluoroalkane 134 a, ethanol, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) K 90, beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), and 0 %, 5 % or 10 % w/w PEG were prepared in canisters sealed with metered dose valves and tested for release and adhesion over time. Results. The addition of 10 % PEG to the MDA formulation resulted in a significant reduction (p < 0. 05) in steady state drug release rate (230. 4 +/- 17. 3 mu g/cm(2) /h for 0 % PEG MDA, 83. 6 +/- 4. 9 mu g/cm(2) /h for 10 % PEG MDA). The presence of PEG caused a delay in dose depletion (2 h for 0 % PEG MDA versus 4 h for 10 % PEG), retarded supersaturation kinetics and increased <b>film</b> <b>drying</b> time. Conclusion. Whilst equivalent amounts of BDP were released, the residual solvent altered the drug release profile to achieve more constant delivery...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMaterial {{consumption}} and <b>dry</b> <b>film</b> thickness {{are the two}} main indicators for identifying the efficiency of spray coating process. Using a proper spray condition, less material consumption could be obtained as per a given <b>dry</b> <b>film</b> thickness. This paper presents the influences of supplying- air pressure, spray time and nozzle size of spray gun on the weight of material used per shot and the <b>dry</b> <b>film</b> thickness obtained. A high- volume-low-pressure type spray gun was used to atomize and deliver a liquid solution of Teflon depositing on a flat work surface. The experimental results showed that low spray time, large nozzle size and low spray pressure {{were responsible for the}} increased material {{consumption and}} <b>dry</b> <b>film</b> thickness. The optimization was performed, where the material consumption was minimized and the <b>dry</b> <b>film</b> thickness was set within a specified standard. Based on the geometric interaction between the spray gun and work-piece, a spray coating model in this application, which is considered unique was also developed and discussed in this paper. Moreover, this paper demonstrates a determination of the coefficient of spray coating process (k) through a relationship between coating thickness and material consumption using data obtained from the experiment. As a result, a relationship among the <b>dry</b> <b>film</b> thickness and positions of the spray gun was established and {{it can be used to}} predict the coating thickness. In conclusion, the optimal conditions in the spray coating process was determined to minimize material consumption whereas the developed spray coating model predicts the coating thickness related to the position of the spray gun. This model will substantially reduce spray gun setup time during production in order to obtain required <b>dry</b> <b>film</b> thickness...|$|R
