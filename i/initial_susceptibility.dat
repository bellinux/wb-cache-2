40|$|We {{investigate}} the structural chain-to-ring transition at low temperature in a gas of dipolar hard spheres (DRS). Due to {{the weakening of}} entropic contribution, ring formation becomes noticeable when the effective dipole-dipole magnetic interaction increases, It results in the redistribution of particles from usually observed flexible chains into flexible rings. The concentration (rho) of DI-IS plays a crucial part in this transition: at a very low rho only chains and rings are observed, whereas even a slight increase of the volume fraction leads {{to the formation of}} branched or defect structures. As a result, the fraction of DHS aggregated in defect-free rings {{turns out to be a}} non-monotonic function of rho. The average ring size is found to be a slower increasing function of rho when compared Lo that of chains. Both theory and computer simulations confirm the dramatic influence of the ring formation on the rho-dependence of the <b>initial</b> magnetic <b>susceptibility</b> (chi) when the temperature decreases. The rings clue to their zero total dipole moment are irresponsive to a weak magnetic field and drive to the strong decrease of the <b>initial</b> magnetic <b>susceptibility.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Complementary {{nature of}} {{coercivity}} enhancement and exchange bias is generalized from the layered systems to ferro-antiferromagnet (F-AF) exchange coupled systems with arbitrary configurations and is proved {{based on the}} coherent rotation of the F magnetization. In the proof, the effect of F-AF coupling is absorbed into the anisotropy of the F part, resulting in an arbitrary anisotropy for the F part. The proof starts from a general discussion on the <b>initial</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of a single domain particle. Then the fundamental correlation between the maximal <b>initial</b> <b>susceptibility</b> and the critical field along an arbitrary easy direction of a single domain particle, at which the magnetization becomes unstable, is discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{residual}} structure on properties of MR fluids, based on CI par-ticles, was investigated using a magneto-sweep technique and <b>initial</b> magnetic <b>susceptibility</b> measurements. The shear rate, particle size, and the CI surface properties {{were among the}} experimental variables. A mechanical hysteresis, associated with the irreversible residual struc-ture formation, was observed via measurements of both shear stress and first normal stress difference. The hysteresis was most pronounced at the creeping flow as compared to high shear conditions. Regardless of experimental settings, {{the level of the}} hysteresis was the same at high shear rate, while the fluids containing larger particles and higher CI concentrations demonstrated stronger residual effect at slow flow. The hysteresis loop was slightly wider for the silica-treated particles suggesting that chemical (non-magnetic) interaction might contrib-ute to the fluid irreversible behavior. Existence of some residual structure has been also shown in measurements of <b>initial</b> magnetic <b>susceptibility</b> of MR fluids. After exposure to a sequence of DC magnetic fields, fluids exhibited higher susceptibility presumably caused by the forma-tion of residual structures of larger size than those in the initial state.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{discussed}} {{the difference between}} the magnetic reversal mechanisms: i) coherent rotation, ii) nucleation, iii) unpinning of domain walls. The main argument to suggest pinning as the coercivity mechanism of Sm(CoFeCuZr) z magnets is the low <b>initial</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of magnetization curves of thermally demagnetized magnets. However, coherent rotation also implies in low <b>initial</b> <b>susceptibility,</b> since the grain size of the magnets is near the single domain particle size. It is unlikely that pinning could be the coercivity mechanism in this case, since the anisotropy field of Sm 2 Co 17 phase is 65 kOe, whereas the coercivity of magnets can be higher than 40 kOe. Such coercive field of 60 % of the anisotropy field indicates coherent rotation as mechanism. A model for describing the abnormal coercivity behavior in Sm(CoFeCuZr) z magnets is proposed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Initial</b> {{magnetic}} <b>susceptibility</b> in Flandrian sediments from Lough Neagh, N. Ireland, {{is shown}} to be a function of the detrital titanomagnetite of the sediment. Parallel suscepti-bility changes are synchronous from core to core and thus potentially valuable for core correlation especially in view of the rapid nondestructive techniques developed for mea-surement. Changing susceptibility in the lake sediments studied appears to be positively* correlated with variations in the amount of inwashed inorganic allochthonous material pres-ent in the cores. Thompson (1973) has shown that mag-netic susceptibility in lake sediments varies with depth and can be measured rapidly and accurately. We here examine the ori-gin of magnetic susceptibility in sediments from Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland, evaluate susceptibility measurements as a method of core correlation, and explore the relationship between magnetic susceptibil-ity and other chemical and biological char-acteristics of the sediments.

Monotherapy with aztreonam, ceftazidime, and cefepime and combinations of aztreonam with cefepime or ceftazidime were also studied. MICs and MBCs were determined for viable organisms at 24 h to test {{for the development of}} resistance. Once-daily amikacin demonstrated killing activity over the initial 8 h superior to those of all other drugs administered as monotherapy against both strains tested (P < 0. 01). Regrowth by 24 h was greatest for the amikacin regimen (P < 0. 01) but was apparent for all monotherapy regimens against both strains. No changes in susceptibilities were observed. All combination therapies containing once-daily amikacin achieved 99. 9 % reductions in log 10 CFU/ml by 2. 0 h against both strains, with no regrowth of organisms at 24 h. Aztreonam-cefepime and -ceftazidime combinations required approximately 5 to 6 h to achieve a 99. 9 % reduction in log 10 CFU/ml. Although {{there was no difference in}} time to the 99. 9 % kill between the aztreonam-cefepime and -ceftazidime regimens against either strain, the killing activity of these combinations was significantly less than those of regimens containing once-daily amikacin (P < 0. 01).
