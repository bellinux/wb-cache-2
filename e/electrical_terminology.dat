50|$|The {{importance}} to network {{analysis of the}} PR condition lies in the realisability condition. Z(s) is realisable as a one-port rational impedance {{if and only if}} it meets the PR condition. Realisable in this sense means that the impedance can be constructed from a finite (hence rational) number of discrete ideal passive linear elements (resistors, inductors and capacitors in <b>electrical</b> <b>terminology).</b>|$|E
50|$|In <b>electrical</b> <b>terminology,</b> {{the plasma}} {{membrane}} {{functions as a}} combined resistor and capacitor. Resistance arises {{from the fact that}} the membrane impedes the movement of charges across it. Capacitance arises {{from the fact that the}} lipid bilayer is so thin that an accumulation of charged particles on one side gives rise to an electrical force that pulls oppositely charged particles toward the other side. The capacitance of the membrane is relatively unaffected by the molecules that are embedded in it, so it has a more or less invariant value estimated at about 2 µF/cm2 (the total capacitance of a patch of membrane is proportional to its area). The conductance of a pure lipid bilayer is so low, on the other hand, that in biological situations it is always dominated by the conductance of alternative pathways provided by embedded molecules. Thus, the capacitance of the membrane is more or less fixed, but the resistance is highly variable.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} increasing penetration of Anglicisms in <b>electrical</b> engineering <b>terminology,</b> with particular emphasis on computer terminology. This widespread phenomenon {{is part of a}} larger language process influenced by globalization, in which the boundaries between languages have become less rigid. Furthermore, the problem of their integration into the Croatian language system is analyzed. Examples excerpted from Croatian popular magazines and scientific journals in the field of power engineering and computer science are analyzed in accordance with the work of Rudolf Filipović. Consequently, the analysis is carried out on the level of orthography, phonology, morphology, and semantics, but also on the level of word formation. In the end, standardization issues of Anglicisms are tackled...|$|R

40|$|A {{grounding}} {{scheme is}} one of important parts in protection for safety of <b>electrical</b> installations. <b>Terminologies</b> are successively creating and gradually increasing due to diversity and external environments. The declaration and definition of terminologies concerning grounding are in disorder in several KS standards, electrotechnical provisions for electrical installations and electrotechnical guides related to electrical installations. There seem to be serious confusions in use among technicians and experts. In this paper, we proposed a new scheme and system to consistently use the technical terms concerning grounding described in KS standards and technical provisions. Different use examples and {{the present state of}} terminologies on grounding described in Korean documents such as KS IEC standards, technical provisions for electrical installations, consumer's electrical installation guide, and etc are investigated. Although the scope of this work is limited to examine the terminologies on grounding, it is expected that the proposed method could be contributed to the consistent use o...|$|R

40|$|Quantum random walks have {{received}} much attention for their intrinsic interest and many possible uses {{and have been}} experimentally demonstrated. In this work {{we look at the}} possibility of using a biased one-dimensional (1 D) quantum walk as an element within a larger quantum device. We ask whether one can use a quantum walk to act as a router with one bias setting engineering the quantum walk to route probability flow one direction while another bias setting routes flow in the opposite direction. Appealing to <b>electrical</b> circuit <b>terminology,</b> we consider a biased quantum walk over a large spatial lattice to act as a single "lumped element" whose routing action depends on the coin bias. We discover that the lumped-element current, when summed over the quantum walk lattice, reaches a steady state and for specific initial states we derive an analytic form for this steady-state lumped-element current. We show that we can control the magnitude and the direction (routing) of the steady-state current. Curiously the control phase and steady-state total current exhibits a sinusoidal current-phase relationship indicating that the lumped element may be similar to that found in Josephson junctions. Finally we illustrate that conservative 1 D Hamiltonian systems can also exhibit steady-state dynamics similar to the quantum walk. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Suppose {{that each}} edge e {{of a network}} is {{assigned}} a random exponential passage time with mean re. Then the expected first-passage time between two vertices is at least the effective resistance between them for the edge resistances 〈re〉. Similarly, suppose each edge is assigned a random exponential edge capacity with mean ce. Then the expected maximum flow between two vertices is at least the effective conductance between them for the edge conductances 〈ce〉. These inequalities are dual {{to each other for}} planar graphs and the second is tight up to a factor of 2 for trees; this has implications for a herd of gnus crossing a river delta. § 1. Introduction. There are well-known connections between random walks and <b>electrical</b> networks. (For <b>terminology</b> and basic results concerning electrical networks, see Doyle and Snell (1984).) For example, the commute time between two vertices in a finite network is the effective resistance between them, multiplied by twice the sum of the edge conductances (see Chandr...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. At the {{beginnings}} of <b>electrical</b> sciences the <b>terminology</b> used by the scientists was varied and vague. There was no system of units for measuring the various aspects of electricity, described by terms as tension, voltaic excitation, electric virtue, etc. Using an historical approach, this paper concentrates {{on the development of}} the science of electricity and its key applications starting from the Voltaic cell in 1800 up to the beginning of electric power industry in late 1800 s. It discusses the complex interplay between the theoretical and the tangible aspects of electricity, and the role of the practical applications in formulation of the terminology and definition of units for measurements of electricity. In order to explain observable effects of electricity such as the occurrences of heat, light, or motion of objects, theories of electricity use terms such as potential, tension, voltage, electromotive force. Do these terms have a concrete, tangible meaning? What about electric current or a flow of electrons? Do they mean the same thing? Is there something that is going all the way through the circuit from one pole of a battery to the other? When studying mechanics, students can directly see the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of a moving object. They have a workable concept of force from their everyday life. In comparison, the concepts of th...|$|R
