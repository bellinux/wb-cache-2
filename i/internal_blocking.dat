40|$|This report {{documents}} the design procedure of a SerDes Transmitter module for PCI e-gen 1 applications. The Transmitter module has programmable features: impedance, amplitude and pre-emphasis. Design {{was performed in}} 130 nm CMOS technology (process IBM cmrf 8 sf). The design of the Transmitter module is divided in three stages as follow: First, a behavioral model of Transmitter module was created in Verilog-A language. This model has 2 inputs and two complementary outputs. This behavioral model was used to verify the proper system-level response of the Transmitter module alone. Simulations based on behavioral model were performed using Spectre simulator in Virtuoso-Cadence. Simulations {{results show that the}} three features: impedance, amplitude and pre-emphasis could be properly modulated with the developed Verilog-A code. The behavioral model of Transmitter module was also assembled with other modules of SerDes system in order to perform mixed-signal simulations and validate the correct response of the entire SerDes system for PCI-e gen 1 specifications. As second stage, the Transmitter module was designed at transistor level with two complementary outputs. For this, we used pCells (transistors, resistors and capacitors, and vias for interconnecting devices) from CMRF 8 SF technology process. Transmitter module is composed by several blocks such as Mux, Decoders, basic digital cells, buffers, and pseudo-analog cells among others. Transistors of digital cells were sized by applying the basic scaling theory while transistors of pseudo-analog cells were sized by analytic calculations in an iterative way. Mux and Decoders were assembled with digital cells. To validate the correct response of each designed <b>internal</b> <b>block,</b> test-benches were created to test each block. Transient simulations were performed using Spectre in Virtuoso Cadence. After verifying the proper response of <b>internal</b> <b>block</b> alone, they were assembled to form more complex blocks such as Decoders, ZAP UNIT and others and they were also tested. Finally, all <b>internal</b> <b>blocks</b> of Transmitter module were assembled and tested at nominal PVT conditions. Critical PVT corners were evaluated and it was verified that response was under tolerance range. The third stage of design was the layout creation in a custom way. A similar bottom-up methodology followed to design at schematic-level of internal modules was applied to design the layout of each <b>internal</b> <b>block</b> of the Transmitter module. Keeping in mind the integration of <b>internal</b> <b>blocks,</b> the low–level digital cells were designed with the same height. The layout of each <b>internal</b> <b>block</b> was verified for DRC and LVS using Calibre tool and design rules of CMRF 8 SF process. Extraction of parasitics from layout using Calibre-PEX was done for each <b>internal</b> <b>block.</b> Post-layout response was compared to the pre-layout one; for this, Spectre simulation was performed of each <b>internal</b> <b>blocks</b> using simultaneously the extracted Calibre view and schematic view. Once the correct response was verified, the <b>internal</b> <b>blocks</b> were assembled and routed in order to build the entire layout of Transmitter module. Finally, the layout of Transmitter module was folded in order to generate the two complementary outputs. At this top level, the layout of Transmitter module was also checked for DRC and LVS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{heterogeneous}} flex-grid networks, optical connections {{for different}} line rates, spectral widths and modulations can coexist {{in the same}} infrastructure. Optical connections are transparently routed by Reconfigurable Add/Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs). Flex-grid ROADMs are enabled by state-of-the-art evolution from original Wavelength-Selective-Switches (WSS), designed for fixed-grid applications, to WSSs that operate in flexible grids. Broadcast-and-select (B&S) flex-grid ROADMs {{are subject to the}} same <b>internal</b> <b>blocking</b> as their fixed grid counterparts, and this <b>internal</b> <b>blocking</b> can be also reduced by augmenting the number of add/drop transponder banks. In this paper, we dimension the number of transponder banks C required in flex-grid ROADMs, to make the <b>internal</b> <b>blocking</b> negligible. To this end, we present a graph transformation that takes a network topology based on B&S ROADMs and converts it into an equivalent network composed of contentionless ROADMs. Then, any conventional (non-contention-aware) algorithm {{can be applied to the}} transformed topology to make lightpath allocations. Our results show that often C= 2, and in some cases C= 1, transponder banks are enough to eliminate internal contention in practice. Interestingly, these results are similar to the ones obtained in the fixed-grid case. This is not an obvious conclusion, since spectrum fragmentation in flex-grid networks may amplify <b>internal</b> <b>blocking.</b> Results have been obtained using the Net 2 Plan 0. 2. 3 open-source tool.

40|$|Abstract — Multistage {{buffered}} switching fabrics are {{the most}} efficient method for scaling packet switches to very large numbers of ports. The Benes network is the lowestcost switching fabric known to yield operation free of <b>internal</b> <b>blocking.</b> Backpressure inside a switching fabric can limit the use of expensive off-chip buffer memory to just virtual-output queues (VOQ) {{in front of the}} input stage. This paper extends the known backpressure architectures to the Benes network. To achieve this, we had to successfully combine per-flow backpressure, multipath routing (inverse multiplexing), and cell resequencing. We present a flow merging scheme that is needed to bring the cost of backpressure down to O(N) per switching element. We prove freedom from deadlock for a wide class of multipath cell distribution algorithms. Using a cell-time-accurate simulator, we verified operation free of <b>internal</b> <b>blocking,</b> we evaluated various cell distribution and resequencing methods, we found that delay under bursty traffic is only 25 to 50 percent higher than ideal output queueing, and we showed that the delay of well-behaved flows remains unaffected by the presence of congested traffic to oversubscribed output ports...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that transaction-specific {{investments}} (TSIs) made in customers by account managers makes them vulnerable to opportunism by customers (i. e., the targets of the investments). The present research shows that TSIs made in customers by account managers can also lead them to be concerned about internal opportunism by nontargets of the investments (e. g., information technology or finance specialists in their own teams). Furthermore, it shows that concern about internal opportunism leads account managers to engage in <b>internal</b> <b>blocking</b> of their own team members (i. e., restricting their access to customers and to customer information), which results in lower performance with customers. This phenomenon is a conundrum in that account managers interested in stronger performance with customers appear to block the very functional specialists who can help them attain better performance. This research also identifies two types of continuities (account manager-customer continuity and specialist-customer continuity) that moderate the relationship between TSIs and concern about internal opportunism. Building on the literature in economics and organization theory, our research suggests that cross-functional teams that are designed to bring different functional areas together are more complex to manage than previously believed.
