25|$|In December 2005, the WorkChoices {{reforms were}} passed by Federal Parliament. There were many {{elements}} in the reforms, including some which elicited political and social controversy and consternation. In a legal sense, perhaps the two most fundamental changes were (1) the purported elimination of State and Territory workplace relations legislation from the federal industrial landscape and (2) the attempt to rely almost completely on the corporations power directly to prescribe minimum terms and conditions of employment regardless {{of the existence of}} an intrastate industrial dispute. This unprecedented (but not novel) use of the corporations power to enact federal <b>industrial</b> <b>legislation</b> was accompanied by claims that 85% of the Australian workforce would be covered by WorkChoices.|$|E

500|$|Enactment of the National Industrial Recovery Act climaxed {{the first}} 100 days of Roosevelt's presidency. Hugh S. Johnson, Raymond Moley, Donald Richberg, Rexford Tugwell, Jerome Frank, and Bernard Baruch—key Roosevelt advisors—believed that {{unrestrained}} competition had helped cause the Great Depression and that government had {{a critical role}} to play through national planning, limited regulation, the fostering of trade associations, support for [...] "fair" [...] trade practices, and support for [...] "democratization of the workplace" [...] (a standard work week, shorter working hours, and better working conditions). Roosevelt himself, {{the former head of}} a trade association, believed that government promotion of [...] "self-organization" [...] by trade associations was the least-intrusive and yet most effective method for achieving national planning and economic improvement. Some work on an industrial relief bill had been done in the weeks following Roosevelt's election, but much of this was in the nature of talk and the exchange of ideas rather than legislative research and drafting. The administration, preoccupied with banking and agriculture legislation, did not begin working on industrial relief legislation until early April 1933. Congress, however, was moving on its own <b>industrial</b> <b>legislation.</b> In the Senate, Robert F. Wagner, Edward P. Costigan, and Robert M. La Follette, Jr. were promoting public works legislation, and Hugo Black was pushing short-work-week legislation. Motivated to work on his own industrial relief bill by these efforts, Roosevelt ordered Moley to work with these Senators (and anyone else in government who seemed interested) to craft a bill.|$|E

Berrangé resigned from the SACP in 1950 when and because it was dissolved, after the passing of the Suppression of Communism Act 1950. Berrangé later reappraised and radically changed his views, to become critical of the theories and practices of the party. Despite this change of views he remained friends with some former comrades and subsequently defended Bram Fischer in court.|$|E

5000|$|The Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) is a {{completely}} independent and autonomous trade union centre for Scotland. It is not a Scottish regional organisation of the TUC. It was established in 1897 {{largely as a result}} of a political dispute with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) regarding political representation for the Labour movement. [...] A number of meetings were held by the various Scottish trades councils to discuss the situation, resulting in the formation of the STUC in Glasgow, Scotland, in March 1897. From the outset, the STUC was not in competition with the TUC, nor was it a political movement, but sought to ensure that [...] "in any scheme for the government of Scotland provision should be made for the same <b>industrial</b> <b>legislation</b> being applied throughout Great Britain." [...] Close contact was retained with the TUC with reciprocal arrangements existing for mutual assistance and co-operation when the occasion warranted.|$|E
50|$|The {{worldwide}} depression {{after the}} end of the First World War had led to a strike in South Africa, known as the Rand Rebellion, which had been defused through a combination of military force and repression, including the imprisonment of Labour leader Frederic Creswell for a month. The government's heavy handed negotiations with the out-gunned unions earned Jan Smuts the enmity of the labour vote and the Labour Party, whose support was boosted by the growing militancy of workers. This paved the way for an election agreement between the Labour Party and the National Party (NP) for the 1924 general election, in which the two parties would not oppose each other during the election and would support each other's candidates in certain constituencies. The alliance resulted in a coalition government known as the Pact. The Labour Party provided two members of the Pact government, including its leader, Creswell, as Minister of Defence. In the event, Creswell remained in office until 1933, for much of that time doubling as Minister of Labour. While serving in government, the LP initiated important economic and <b>industrial</b> <b>legislation</b> which improved conditions for white workers. In addition, the LP also helped to alleviate unemployment amongst whites, and a year after becoming labour minister, Creswell claimed that he had found employment for 12,000 previously jobless whites. These policies, however, did nothing to enhance conditions for black workers.|$|E

5000|$|The Ryan {{government}} {{was the first}} majority Australian Labor Party government of Queensland {{as a result of}} the 1915 election. Some of the eight members of his Cabinet had connections with the early ALP of the 1880s and the Shearer's Strike. His government would provide the example which would see Labor in power in Queensland almost continuously until 1957. Major reform of Labor laws and agricultural policy were part of the Ryan legacy. At the election in May 1915, Labour came in with a large majority and Ryan became premier, chief secretary, and Attorney-General, and an era of <b>industrial</b> <b>legislation</b> and state enterprise began. Among the measures passed were the industrial arbitration act, labour exchanges act, workers' compensation act, inspection of machinery and scaffolding act, factories and shops amendment act, and workers' compensation amendment act. This was one side of the Ryan government's activities but where it particularly broke fresh ground was the entrance of the state into trading activities. Stations were purchased and run as going concerns, and many retail butchers' shops were opened in Brisbane and other parts of Queensland. Railway refreshment rooms were taken over, state hotels were built and purchased, a produce agency was established, coal mines were acquired, iron and steel works were opened, and a state insurance department was established. In addition, Cane price boards were set up, providing fair returns for growers and fair wages for sugar workers. Women were given the right to stand for parliament, industrial reforms were carried out which gave workers a [...] "new deal," [...] and a chain of butchers' shops was established which sold meat cheaper than elsewhere and proved to be very popular.|$|E

40|$|After {{three years}} of trying, the Coalition Government finally succeeded in obtaining passage of several key {{workplace}} reform statutes in 2016. This followed {{the outcome of the}} federal election held on 2 July, delivering the Government a differently composed Senate and a new opportunity to secure support for its legislative program. This review article explains key aspects of the <b>industrial</b> <b>legislation</b> passed by federal Parliament in 2016, including statutes abolishing the specialist road transport industry tribunal, re-establishing the Howard-era regulator for the construction industry, and setting up a new agency to enforce enhanced governance and accountability standards for registered unions and employer organisations. Legislative amendments aimed at resolving the long-running bargaining dispute in Victoria&# 039;s Country Fire Authority are also considered, along with the Government&# 039;s muted response to the 2015 Productivity Commission review of the workplace relations framework. The article then examines developments at state level, including a major rewrite of Queensland&# 039;s <b>industrial</b> <b>legislation,</b> structural changes in New South Wales, and proposed changes to long service leave and the labour hire sector in Victoria. It concludes by noting the irony that just as the federal Government has tasted some success after a long legislative &# 039;dry spell&# 039;, its labour law reform agenda appears limited and piecemeal...|$|E
