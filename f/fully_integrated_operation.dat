40|$|One of {{the most}} {{accurate}} approaches for calculating lattice thermal conductivity, κ_l, is solving the Boltzmann transport equation starting from third-order anharmonic force constants. In addition to the underlying approximations of ab-initio parameterization, two main challenges are associated with this path. High computational costs and lack of automation in the frameworks using this methodology affect the discovery rate of novel materials with ad-hoc properties. Here, we present the Automatic-Anharmonic-Phonon-Library, AAPL. It efficiently computes interatomic force constants by making effective use of crystal symmetry analysis, it solves the Boltzmann transport equation to obtain κ_l, and allows a <b>fully</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>operation</b> with minimum user intervention, a rational addition to the current high-throughput accelerated materials development framework AFLOW.

40|$|Abstract: The {{capability}} and cost effectiveness that autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) bring to mine countermeasure operations (MCM) {{has been widely}} demonstrated and accepted in recent years. However, these operations still rely mainly on surface vessels, human operators and divers. These current Navy forces are showing their limitations for modern MCM doctrine: they are vulnerable, costly and slow to deploy. In this paper, we analyse the benefits and re-quirements of heterogeneous fleets of AUVs for enabling <b>fully</b> <b>integrated</b> MCM <b>operations.</b> The Ocean Systems Laboratory {{has a record of}} successful concept demonstrations at all the De-tection, Classification, Identification, and Neutralisation (DCIN) stages of the MCM workflow. Nevertheless, a demonstration showing all the multidisciplinary capabilities <b>fully</b> <b>integrated</b> in a truly autonomous distributed sensing-decision-act loop has never been achieved. In this paper, we describe the research and engineering challenges that we are facing. Then, we introduce the existing research contributions in automatic target recognition, knowl-edge distribution and decision making processes. This will allow us to overcome the research challenges and to demonstrate its capability. We also propose a set of combined metrics to eval-uate the performance improvement of the system over state-of-the-art approaches. We identify a possible concept of operation scenario for a demonstration. Finally we present the results of the <b>fully</b> <b>integrated</b> MCM mission conducted {{at the end of last}} year...|$|R

Post-war analysis of interdiction efforts during World War II and the Persian Gulf War could not identify a single instance where either a German V weapon or an Iraqi SCUD missile was destroyed before launch. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the best estimate that the Air Force could provide the National Command Authority was that ninety percent of the Soviet missiles in Cuba would be destroyed by an airstrike.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine whether the U. S. {{military}} is <b>fully</b> <b>integrating</b> information <b>operations</b> in combat operations. Using the organizational theories of Henry Mintzberg {{and the work of}} Richard Daft as one frame of reference, and the information theories of Claude Shannon, John Diebold, and Martin Libicki as the second frame of reference, this thesis produced testable propositions to determine which theory had a greater ability to explain the degree of integration as seen in the four case studies of Operation Joint Guard/Forge (Bosnia), Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan, Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. This study concludes that the both organizational and information theories help explain how and why military commanders integrate IO successfully into combat operations insights drawn from this study include: without the proper command atmosphere, the integration of information operations will simply not occur. Commanders who do not believe in the usefulness of IO will focus on kinetic operations instead of a full spectrum view using all the elements of combat power; and The increased speed and reliability of information that passes from the human network (physical) to the computer network, and from the tactical to the strategic levels, allows commanders and staffs alike to understand and integrate IO into combat operations more effectively.

South African transport policies documents have been focused on providing mobility for all, {{for more than a}} decade now. The White Paper on National Transport Policy (NDOT, 1996) indicates in its vision statement to ‘provide safe, reliable, effective, efficient, and <b>fully</b> <b>integrated</b> transport <b>operations</b> and infrastructure, which will best meet the needs of freight and passenger customers at improved level of service’. Government has also identified that the provision of public transport plays a crucial role in working towards this vision. Independent of the physical infrastructure and vehicle type, the provision of information has been identified as an important element that provides, or improves, customer satisfaction (Mitretek Systems, 2001). Internationally, the trend is to provide real-time information through the implementation of Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS). This paper describes the implementation of an ATIS system for the Jammie Shuttle service at the University of Cape Town (UCT), with the aim to act as a demonstration project for other public transport systems in South Africa and beyond.

40|$|One {{question}} {{that continues to}} occupy the minds of scholars of e-government is whether {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) can transform public administration. General opinion on the subject is sharply divided: some believe that e-government can shape public administration, while others doubt that it can have this effect. At the empirical level, the testing of the influence of e-government on public administration has been largely ignored. Consequently, the fundamental question remains unanswered, as do the further questions of precisely how and with what effects might information and communication technologies be reshaping public administration. These are the questions that motivated the research presented here, which examines and describes the transformative powers of e-government by focusing on the use of information and communication technologies to transform a particular public agency, the Kenya Revenue Authority. The research used two main methods of data collection and construction: interviewing senior management at the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and reviewing documents obtained from the KRA and other public sources. A transformation change analytical framework was used to analyze the KRA before the implementation of ICT-enabled reforms as an organization needing change and after these reforms as a transformed organization. The results of the findings suggest that, although ICT has had some beneficial effects on the KRA, the changes produced to date fall short of being described as transformative.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{viability}} of incorporating optimization within budgeting methodologies is examined. Resource Planning and Management System and optimization are proposed as tools {{to enhance the}} planning and control functions of the budgeting process. Three hypotheses are proposed: (1) Integer Programming, Integer Goal Programming and Dynamic Programming can be substituted in place of traditional ranking techniques utilized in zero-base budgeting; (2) Linear Programming and RPM networks provide more objective and meaningful data to management in flexible budgeting; and (3) Linear Programming and RPM networks serve to integrate zero-base budgeting and flexible budgeting. A simplified example including ten decision packages (23 decision variables) of zero-base budgeting is designed to test the theoretical validity of the first hypothesis. The Cathode Ray Tube production plant in electronic industry is chosen as the prototype upon which to construct mathematical models to test {{the second and third}} hypotheses. Two major RPM network models were constructed. The first model focused upon the manufacturing of components used in the CRT production and detailed the daily operation to provide data for flexible budgeting. This model included 81 activity processes and 93 resource constraints. The second model depicted the management process for the entire plant and was used for flexible budgeting and to validate data for zero-base budgeting. This model included 521 activity processes and 523 resource constraints.
