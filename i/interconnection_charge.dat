40|$|This {{paper is}} to examine the effect of the {{receiver}} pays principle (RPP) on the calling price, social welfare and <b>interconnection</b> <b>charge.</b> A significant trouble with introducing this system in telecommunications pricing is the possibility that the receiving party may refuse to receive a call if the charge he has to bear is very high. We find the condition for no calls to be refused and show that the profit maximizing prices charged to the calling party and the receiving party must satisfy this condition. We demonstrate that the calling price under RPP must be lower than the price under the caller pays principle (CPP), that the profit of a firm will be increased under RPP, but that the consumer surplus will not necessarily be increased under RPP despite the lowered calling price. Also, we show that, if the demand function is linear, the reciprocal <b>interconnection</b> <b>charge</b> under RPP is higher than under CPP. ...|$|E

The introduction of carrier pre-selection and number portability had a negative impact on price levels. The estimation results also suggest that a 1 % decrease in termination charges on the incumbent network led on average to a 0. 17 % decrease in the cost of usage basket for residential consumers. Furthermore, in the pricing regressions for incumbent local and national calls at peak and off-peak times <b>interconnection</b> <b>charges</b> are significant only in the estimation of national peak prices.

In Bolivia and Finland, for example, consumer cooperatives have been for many years the only mechanism to provide local telecommunication services to the whole country. This paper studies the effects of the Bolivian market's structure on the development of competition as well as on universal access and service policies. It argues that some cooperatives after the liberalisation of the market are not helping to develop competition. Cooperatives may have incentives to increase the <b>interconnection</b> <b>charges</b> that they receive from long distance firms to cross-subsidise the prices of local calls. Moreover, as some cooperatives have entered the long distance market, they may try to restrict competition through collusive agreements. Finally, the paper suggests that the excessive price of the cooperatives' shares may have damaged the possibility of reaching a higher penetration level and greater coverage in rural areas.

40|$|We propose {{an access}} price {{determination}} approach, {{where the only}} regulatory instrument is the <b>interconnection</b> <b>charge.</b> Retail prices are set by unconstrained profit maximizing firms. We present a two stage model, solved backwards. In the second stage, the two firms compete freely, taking the access price as given. In the first stage, the regulator uses the information generated in the second stage to set the social welfare maximizing access price. We first assume a certainty model where firms have constant marginal costs. Firms may have different costs at the retail level and may choose either prices or quantities of the retail service. We find that the regulator generally provides the entrant with a subsidy (paid by the incumbent) {{in the form of}} an access price that does not cover marginal costs. A virtual (real) subsidy is provided when the incumbent has lower (higher) retail costs than the entrant. We then assume that the firms may not have constant marginal costs and that the regulated firm holds private information about its type. We determine an access pricing rule in which any excess of the incumbent's price over its marginal costs lowers the optimal access price. Finally, we use simulation models to compare our partially regulated model with a fully regulated model in which the regulator sets the interconnection and the retail prices. We find that when the integrated firm holds all the private information, the partially regulated model achieves a lower expected social welfare. Nevertheless, when the regulator and the regulated firm do not know the entrant's type, the partially regulated model can achieve a higher level of welfare. We also find that under uncertainty, the partially regulated model often results in the offering of one single contract regardless of the announced type of the incumbent...|$|E

40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with research for the analysis and modeling of interconnection costs in telecommunications based on {{a case study of}} Tanzania. The research formed the basis for recommending the review of the current <b>interconnection</b> <b>charges.</b> Chapter 1 of the thesis started to introduce the United States of America's (USA) Reform Act of 1996,which was the first Act in the world that liberalised the telecommunications markets and opened them up to competition in the USA. The competition brought up interconnection of telecommunications networks and associated costs, which is the focus of the research. Chapter 2 provided for the design and architecture of the interconnection of telecommunications networks m the liberalized and competitive telecommunications markets in terms of types of interconnection models, interconnection components, types of services, interconnection costs and call route types and factors. In chapter 3 the thesis presented the telecommunications development in Tanzania from 1888 to date covering the period of the monopoly era where there was no interconnection of the telecommunications networks and the post-monopoly era where there is interconnection of the telecommunications networks. The chapter also presented the growth of the mobile networks over time in terms of number of mobile phones and mobile density. Chapter 4 discussed charging principles, call routing and operations of the international roaming and non-international roaming services referred to as the One Network concept, which was launched simultaneously in East Africa (Tanzania, Kenyaand Uganda) by the Zain GSM mobile network operator {{for the first time in}} the world on 26 th September, 2006. Review of the existing generic interconnection cost models developed by the British Telecommunications Company Limited and Europe Economics' Consulting Firm was presented in Chapter 5. The review formed the basis for collecting data from Tanzania. Chapter 6 presented the analysis of the data collected from Tanzania. The analysis revealed that the interconnection costs per minute for the five competitive telecommunications network operators for 2007 - 2009 were far below the <b>interconnection</b> <b>charges</b> per minute set by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority for the same period. Chapter 7 concluded that the <b>interconnection</b> <b>charges</b> per minute for the telecommunications industry in Tanzania for 2007 - 2009 have been set over and above the interconnection costs per minute obtained from the analysis of the collected data. The research reviewed the existing generic interconnection cost models mentioned above and identified the interconnection cost estimation methods. The research then collected audited operators' accounts and traffic throughput in minutes from the five competitive telecommunications network operators in Tanzania for 2007 - 2009. It analysed the data and gave results, which showed a big percentage difference of an average of at least 300 % between the interconnection costs obtained from the analysis of the collected data and the <b>interconnection</b> <b>charges</b> set by the Regulator. The research results have justified insufficient interconnection regulations currently used by the Regulator in Tanzania. Hence, the need for the objective and accurate interconnection cost estimation methodology for setting up the cost based <b>interconnection</b> <b>charges</b> have been confirmed by this research.

40|$|Interconnection is {{not only}} a major {{competition}} issue per se, it is also a critical element of the basic telecommunications agreement of the WTO. An important issue in interconnection regulation is <b>interconnection</b> <b>charging</b> especially {{in the context of a}} dominant incumbent. Most regulators in developing countries face challenges in setting interconnection prices in the absence of market information on the incumbent's or entrant's costs, competition or demand and models suited for developing countries that also adhere to the WTO guidelines. There are few papers that illustrate the challenges faced by regulators in such a context. This paper attempts to bridge the gap by highlighting the nature of interaction between the regulator, incumbent, judiciary and the political environment, the role of formal models in setting <b>interconnection</b> <b>charges</b> and the implications of rapid technological changes in a developing country context through a case study of India. The case study highlights the point that besides independence, it is important to vest enforcement powers in the regulatory agency for it to be credible. Incorporating the WTO interconnection guidelines within a developing country context has implications for network growth and poses challenges to the regulatory processes. Although Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) started with a distortionary, inefficiently priced network providing low coverage and quality, it has meandered its way to a more reasonable network access pricing regime. The decreasing cost of technology and increasing incomes in India and political interventions in regulation have put pressure on TRAI to provide lower <b>interconnection</b> <b>charges</b> and faster telecom growth. Thus, it is pragmatic for regulators to start with a "quick and dirty" estimate, provided that they can signal the downward trend in interconnection pricing, rather than wait for the "correct" estimates. Adoption of future looking strategies (interconnection exchanges), use of a variety of formal models, and strengthening of regulatory capacity are all necessary steps in fostering a competitive environment. Interconnection regimes set up early in the reform process require a review. For successful competition, effective dispute resolution mechanisms and institutions are also important.
