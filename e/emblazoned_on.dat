5|$|Butterflies have {{appeared}} in art from 3500 years ago in ancient Egypt. In the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and <b>emblazoned</b> <b>on</b> incense burners. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar, and some species {{were considered to be}} the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies with fire and warfare persisted into the Aztec civilisation; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been found among the Zapotec and Maya civilisations.|$|E
5|$|According to Ludvík Mucha, {{author of}} Webster's Concise Encyclopedia of Flags & Coats of Arms, the white disk {{located in the}} center of the flag {{represents}} the sun. The red crescent and the five-pointed star, two ancient symbols of Islam, were most notably used on Ottoman flag and have since appeared on many flags of Islamic countries. The crescent is, from the viewpoint of an Arabic observer, supposed to bring good luck. The color red is a symbol of resistance against Turkish supremacy. Whitney Smith states that the crescent was first <b>emblazoned</b> <b>on</b> standards and buildings in the Punic state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia. Since appearing on the Ottoman flag, they were widely adopted by Muslim countries, and have become known as symbols of Islam, when in fact, they may be cultural symbols. Likewise, the sun is often represented with the crescent on ancient Punic artifacts and is associated with the ancient Punic religion, especially with Tanit symbol.|$|E

6000|$|King Ferdinand was {{so pleased}} with the gallant action of Hernan Perez del Pulgar that he {{immediately}} conferred on him the honor of knighthood, using in the ceremony the sword of Diego de Aguero, {{the captain of the}} royal guards; the duke of Esculona girded one of his own gilt spurs upon his heel, and the grand master of Santiago, the count de Cabra, and Gonsalvo of Cordova officiated as witnesses. Furthermore, to perpetuate in his family the memory of his achievement, the sovereigns authorized him to <b>emblazon</b> <b>on</b> his escutcheon a golden lion in an azure field, bearing a lance with a handkerchief at the end of it. Round the border of the escutcheon were depicted the eleven alcaydes vanquished in the battle.* The foregoing is but one of many hardy and heroic deeds done by this brave cavalier in the wars against the Moors, by which he gained great renown and the distinguished appellation of [...] "El de las hazanas," [...] or [...] "He of the exploits."** ...|$|R

5000|$|When the 23rd New Jersey's first commander, Colonel John S. Cox, {{resigned}} {{to prevent a}} court-martial for drunkenness in November 1862, the new commander, Col. Henry O. Ryerson (the former Lieutenant Colonel of the 2nd New Jersey Volunteer Infantry), reviewed the regiment, and disparagingly called them [...] "Yahoos", due to their less than military demeanor and irreverence. The men of the regiment took to the sobriquet, <b>emblazoning</b> it <b>on</b> their regimental flag, and called themselves Yahoos {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|R

25|$|In modern times, the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe {{are those}} U.S. Army {{soldiers}} from the 100th Regiment recognized by their commanders for exemplary service and leadership, just as Governor Spotswood recognized the men in his 1716 expedition. Today's Knights of the Golden Horseshoe receive a small gold-painted horseshoe. They also are approved to wear a distinctive unit insignia, featuring a golden horseshoe <b>emblazoned</b> <b>on</b> a red shield. Originally approved for the 375th Field Artillery Regiment on April 27, 1933, the insignia was redesignated for the 100th Regiment on July 8, 1960.

6000|$|... "The central inauguration, if I {{may use the}} term," [...] said Mr. Putney Giles, [...] "is {{comparatively}} easy. It is {{an affair}} of expense and of labor--great labor; I may say unremitting labor. But your lordship will observe the other points are not mere points of expense and labor. We have to consult the feelings of several counties where your lordship cannot be present, at least certainly not on this occasion, and yet where an adequate recognition of those sentiments which ought to exist between the proprietor and all classes connected with him ought to be secured. Then Scotland: Scotland {{is a very difficult}} business to manage. It is astonishing how the sentiment lingers in that country connected with its old independence. I really am quite surprised at it. One of your lordship's most important tenants wrote to me only a few days back that great dissatisfaction would prevail among your lordship's friends and tenantry in Scotland, if that country on this occasion were placed on the same level as a mere English county. It must be recognized as a kingdom. I almost think {{it would be better if}} we could persuade Lord Culloden, not to attend the English inauguration, but remain in the kingdom of Scotland, and take the chair and the lead throughout the festal ceremonies. A peer of the realm, and your lordship's guardian, would impart something of national character to the proceedings, and this, with a judicious <b>emblazoning</b> <b>on</b> some of the banners of the royal arms of Scotland, might have a conciliatory effect. One should always conciliate. But your lordship, upon all these points, and especially with reference to Lord Culloden, must be a much better judge than I am." ...|$|R
25|$|The 8th Hussars {{received}} {{a number of}} battle honours throughout its existence. As per tradition only 40 of these honours were <b>emblazoned</b> <b>on</b> the Regimental Guidon.

25|$|Besides, McDuffie {{was a good}} hitter, swift baserunner and {{unrivalled}} self-promoter. But {{he often}} got more attention for his handsome looks, flashy dress, gold jewelries, flamboyant behavior and bevy of girlfriends than for his ball playing.

5000|$|As {{a result}} of its being the {{business}} aircraft of the [...] "Scuderia Ferrari" [...] racing team, the P.180 Avanti II is the only aircraft to display the 'Cavallino Rampante' prancing horse emblem as part of its livery. This marks a return to aviation for the emblem; its origins date back to the First World War, when the Italian fighter pilot Francesco Baracca, who flew over 30 successful missions on behalf of the Allies, adopted a distinctive prancing horse as his personal emblem, and had it <b>emblazoned</b> prominently <b>on</b> his aircraft. In 1923, Enzo Ferrari's victory on the Salvio circuit in Ravenna so impressed Count Baracca's mother, the Countess Paolina, that she donated her son's symbol to him, allowing him permission to use the horse on his cars for good luck.|$|R
50|$|This {{practice}} was inherited by the RAF from its Army and Navy predecessors upon its creation in 1918. Several squadrons therefore carry honours awarded {{when they were}} a part of the Royal Flying Corps or Royal Naval Air Service. Battle honours are not awarded for every operation conducted by British forces and not every squadron taking part in an operation is entitled to <b>emblazon</b> the honour <b>on</b> their standard, only those involved in contact with the enemy.|$|R
50|$|The Emblem {{appears on}} {{government}} documents, diplomatic missions, {{as well as}} several Saudi Arabian flags. It is <b>emblazoned</b> in gold <b>on</b> the flag of the Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia (which is also the Kingdom's war ensign), and on the lower hoist of the Royal Standard. The latter is essentially the national flag with the added Emblem in gold, which is placed in {{the lower part of the}} (left-facing) hoist and not in the canton as with other royal standards. The Emblem's lower position is in deference to the sacred nature of the Shahada, the Islamic creed.|$|R

25|$|Starting June 2009, Gulf Air's Golden Falcon logo {{was seen}} {{on the streets of}} London, <b>emblazoned</b> <b>on</b> the side of the city's taxi cabs, as part a two-year {{marketing}} deal. Fifty Hackney Carriages were to be rolled out in full Gulf Air livery to promote the airline's flights from London Heathrow to Bahrain and beyond.

50|$|The Fokker D.VIIs in use by both Dahlmann and Loerzer during September 1918 bore similar {{striking}} {{white and}} black patterns. In Dahlmann's case, that meant a black cowling leading the way, with wide black and white bands alternating around the fuselage. An abstract diving hawk was <b>emblazoned</b> in black <b>on</b> the white band circling the fuselage just behind the cockpit. The more usual Iron Cross national marking had been stylized into a + sign cross in black on the next white band aft of the hawk, as well as painted black on white on the Fokker's vertical stabilizer.|$|R
50|$|Just as the Eternal Champion can be {{a servant}} of Law, though he is often more the servant of the balance, so Chaos also has its own champions. The most {{formidable}} is Prince Gaynor the Damned, formerly a servant of the Law but condemned by the Balance to aid Chaos after an unspeakable betrayal. He is completely hidden in shining armour that constantly changes hue from gold to silver to blue and so <b>on,</b> <b>emblazoned</b> with the symbol of Chaos - an image of eight arrows, radiating in all directions from a central point, to represent the many possibilities Chaos offers.|$|R
50|$|Edmondson was {{originally}} apprenticed to a barber, but afterwards became a coach-painter, and being much employed in <b>emblazoning</b> arms <b>on</b> carriages {{was led to}} the study of heraldry and genealogy. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and in March 1764 was created Mowbray Herald Extraordinary. This appointment in the College of Arms did not prevent him from continuing the coach-painting business, which he carried on successfully for many years. The appearance of his Baronagium (1764) attracted the attention of the nobility, and brought him much employment in the compilation of pedigrees. Indeed, most of the peers had their genealogies drawn up or rearranged by him. When the baronets made an unsuccessful attempt to obtain some augmentation of their privileges, as appendages to their titles, they chose Edmondson as their secretary. He died at his residence in Warwick Street, Golden Square, on 17 February 1786, and was buried in the cemetery of St James's, Piccadilly. His extravagant manner of living prevented him from leaving any considerable property to his son, who continued the business of coach-painter till his death, which happened soon after that of his father. Edmondson's library was sold by auction in 1788.|$|R
25|$|He {{became an}} ace on 18 June, {{with the first}} of his two June victories. On the 25th, he took his new Fokker D.VII on a test flight, came upon a dogfight between D. VIIs of another Jasta and Sopwith Camels, and shot one of the Camels down. The D.VII {{remained}} his mount {{for the remainder of the}} war. His had the front three-quarters of the fuselage painted black; the rear quarter was white. <b>Emblazoned</b> <b>on</b> the side was a white running stag with gold antlers and hooves, its head pointed toward the propeller.|$|E
25|$|The Union Jack {{dress was}} {{an item of}} {{clothing}} worn by singer Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls at the 1997 BRIT Awards. The mini dress featured a flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack, on the front, and a white peace symbol <b>emblazoned</b> <b>on</b> the black-coloured back of the dress. The next day {{the images of the}} dress made the front page of various newspapers around the world, and is now remembered {{as one of the most}} iconic pop moments of the 1990s and Brit Awards history. The dress has become synonymous with the Spice Girls, Halliwell and the notions of Girl Power and Cool Britannia.|$|E
25|$|A massive {{boost in}} March 2007 was {{the signing of}} a one-year deal with Asian steel {{manufacturer}} Delong Holdings ltd. This deal {{was one of the}} largest in the A-League, worth $750,000 with an option of another two-year contract after season's end worth another $1,000,000. The name and symbol of Delong featured prominently on the back of Glory's shirts during the 2007–08 season, with Western QBE already <b>emblazoned</b> <b>on</b> the front in tandem with Delong as Glory's title sponsor. Delong opted out of the second year and the space on the back of the uniform was instead replaced by Tony Sage's fashion magazine Kurv in 2008.|$|E
50|$|By {{this time}} Mariya was 38 years old. She {{took part in}} a five-month tank {{training}} program immediately after the donation. These five months training were unusual for tank crews at the time: usually tank crews were rushed straight to the front line with minimal training. After she completed her training, she was posted to the 26th Guards Tank Brigade in September 1943 as a driver and mechanic. She named her tank 'Fighting Girlfriend' and <b>emblazoned</b> these words <b>on</b> the turret of the T-34. Many of her fellow tankers saw her as a publicity stunt and a joke, but this attitude changed when Mariya began fighting in her first tank battles in Smolensk. Her first tank battle began on 21 October 1943.|$|R
60|$|The {{alderman}} {{was really}} sorry for her, and felt himself to blame {{so far as}} that he had shifted {{the guidance of the}} expedition to such an insufficient head as poor Smallbones, so he let her rail on as much as she would, till the storm exhausted itself, and she settled into the trust that Giles would soon grow weary and return. The good man felt bound to show her all hospitality, and the civilities to country cousins were in proportion to the rarity of their visits. So Mrs. Headley stayed on after Tiptoff's return to Salisbury, and had the best view feasible of all the pageants and diversions of autumn. She saw some magnificent processions of clergy, she was welcomed at a civic banquet and drank of the loving cup, and she beheld the Lord Mayor's Show in all its picturesque glory of <b>emblazoned</b> barges <b>on</b> the river. In fact, she found the position of denizen of an alderman's household so very agreeable that she did her best to make it a permanency. Nay, Dennet soon found that she considered herself to be waiting there and keeping guard till her son's return should establish her there, and that she viewed the girl already as a daughter--for which Dennet was by no means obliged to her! She lavished counsel on her hostess, found fault with the maidens, criticised the cookery, walked into the kitchen and still- room with assistance and directions, and even made a strong effort to possess herself of the keys.|$|R
25|$|Following {{suit with}} the rest Network Ten, CTC moved Capital Eyewitness News an hour earlier to 5pm in February 1992. The 'First at Five' slogan was <b>emblazoned</b> across Canberra <b>on</b> buses and in {{newspaper}} ads. The move to 5pm gave Network Ten an edge in other cities against its rival news bulletins. In Canberra {{there were no other}} local/national/international bulletins on air, but the half-hour 6pm local news on rival WIN was proving popular. However, in both a testament to the loyalty of its audience and a question mark over the wisdom of management, the 'First at Five' move was met with fierce protest by viewers. Not only had the beloved 'Channel 7 News' as it was colloquially known been moved an hour earlier, but the 6pm-7pm slot had been filled by the tabloid current affairs programme Hinch and the low-budget American dating show Studs. Canberra was having none of it and CTC restored the bulletin to 6pm after just six weeks. Bus ads were hastily amended with stickers covering the timeslot noting the news was 'First at Six'.|$|R
