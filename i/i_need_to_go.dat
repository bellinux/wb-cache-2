2500|$|In July 1954, Perkins and {{his wife}} heard a new release of [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] by Elvis Presley, Scotty Moore and Bill Black on the radio. As the song faded out, Perkins said, [...] "There's a man in Memphis who understands what we're doing. <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> see him." [...] According to another telling of the story, it was Valda who {{told him that he}} should go to Memphis. Later, Presley told Perkins that he had {{traveled}} to Jackson and seen Perkins and his group playing at El Rancho.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 August 2008 he {{was linked}} with {{a move to}} Burnley's Lancashire rivals Blackpool. And on 1 September 2008 he signed for the Seasiders on loan until 1 January 2009, with a set fee already in place to sign him {{permanently}} should he impress. Gow said of the move, [...] "Obviously it hasn't worked out the way I thought it should have at Rangers but <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out, play some games and get my fitness back." [...] He also confirmed that SPL club Hearts had been interested in signing him. He scored his first goal for the Seasiders on 4 October 2008 against Cardiff City. After coming on as a substitute in the 77th minute he scored the equaliser deep into the fifth minute of injury time as the clubs drew 1–1 at Bloomfield Road.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s Bunin, having become {{interested}} in the new Soviet literature, in particular the works of Aleksandr Tvardovsky and Konstantin Paustovsky, entertained plans of returning to the Soviet Union, as Aleksandr Kuprin had done in the 1930s. In 1946, speaking to his Communist counterparts in Paris, Bunin praised the Supreme Soviet's decision to return Soviet citizenship to Russian exiles in France, still stopping short of saying [...] "yes" [...] to the continuous urging from the Soviet side for him to return. [...] "It is hard for an old man {{to go back to}} places where he's pranced goat-like in better times. Friends and relatives are all buried... That for me would be a graveyard trip," [...] he reportedly said to Zhukov, promising though, to [...] "think more of it." [...] Financial difficulties and the French reading public's relative indifference to the publication of Dark Avenues figured high among his motives. [...] "Would you mind asking the Union of Writers to send me {{at least some of the}} money for books that've been published and re-issued in Moscow in the 1920s and 1930s? I am weak, I am short of breath, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the South but am too skinny to even dream of it," [...] Bunin wrote to Nikolay Teleshov in a 19 November 1946, letter.|$|E

5000|$|After being a solo {{artist for}} more than a year, Jung decided to be in a band again, saying: “When I first signed with my company, it was agreed that I would {{eventually}} work with a band.

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

The song addresses Winehouse's refusal to attend an alcohol rehabilitation centre after her management team encouraged her <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> [...] "I asked my dad if he thought <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> He said no, but I should give it a try. So I did, for just 15 minutes. I went in said 'hello' and explained that I drink because I am in love and have screwed up the relationship. Then I walked out."

5000|$|In another {{interview}} with MTV, 50 Cent {{spoke about the}} album. He said: [...] It's like a spinoff — the sequel to Beg for Mercy. It was a statement towards the competition, towards other artists. Terminate on Sight is the version where you get more aggressive. This record embodies that. I kinda know where <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> because I tested the waters with the material I put out. I get to tell with the response to certain records where I need to be and chill out from other stuff.|$|E
