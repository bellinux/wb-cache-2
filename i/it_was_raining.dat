5|$|Her first English {{language}} {{movie was}} <b>It</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Raining</b> That Night, {{a remake of}} the Bengali film Hei Brishtir Raat, scripted by Sudeshna Roy and directed by Mahesh Manjrekar. In the film, she collaborated with mother Moon Moon Sen. Riya was slated to appear in Anjan Dutt's Bengali-English bilingual film The Bong Connection with her sister, but she was eventually dropped from the project and replaced by Peeya Rai Chaudhary. The two sisters were later cast together in director Ajai Sinha's The Bachelor, a Bengali film that, as of 2008, {{is yet to be}} finished.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee is {{a mythical}} sea {{creature}} that {{appears as a}} horse-like demon when it ventures onto land. Writer and folklorist Ernest Marwick considered it {{very similar to the}} Norwegian nøkk, the nuggle of the Shetlands and the kelpie. A unique and solitary creature possessing extensive evil powers, its malevolent behaviour can influence events throughout the islands. Islanders were terrified of the creature and would not speak its name without immediately saying a prayer. It was often found in the vicinity of a beach, but would never come ashore if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Clinton Presidential Center was {{dedicated}} on November 18, 2004. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining,</b> {{the ceremony was}} attended by approximately 30,000 people (including notable figures such as Willie Mays, Robin Williams, and Barbra Streisand) and included a 20-minute speech made by Clinton, who had recently undergone bypass surgery. It also included performances by Bono, the African Drum Ballet and the Philander Smith Collegiate Choir, {{as well as an}} invocation given by Floyd Flake and video tribute from Nelson Mandela. Four U.S. presidents (Clinton, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush were present; former president Gerald R. Ford could not attend due to health concerns) were on the same stage together. All three other presidents spoke at the event as well. Overall, the ceremony lasted two hours and featured six speakers.|$|E
40|$|The paper reviews expressivism {{with respect}} to {{statements}} of the form “I believe that p”. The expressivist holds that the statement “I believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> raining” is an expression and not {{a description of the}} belief that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining.</b> The article proposes a variation of expressivism according to which such a statement expresses the conscious belief that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining,</b> in the sense of Brentano’s theory of consciousness. The content of the conscious belief that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining</b> <b>is</b> that <b>is</b> <b>raining</b> and that the believer believes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining...</b>|$|R
50|$|The logicians Alice and Bob {{are sitting}} in their dark office {{wondering}} whether or not <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining</b> outside. Now, none of them actually knows, but Alice knows something about her friend Carol, namely that Carol wears her red coat only if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining.</b> Bob does not know this, but he just saw Carol, and noticed that she was wearing her red coat. Even though none of them knows whether or not <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> distributed knowledge amongst them that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining.</b> If {{either one of them}} tells the other what they know, <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> clear to the other that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining.</b>|$|R
50|$|Directly translated: Bob {{knows that}} Carol wears a red coat and Alice {{knows that if}} Carol wears a red coat <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining</b> so {{together}} they know that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining.</b>|$|R
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining</b> during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E
5|$|Moondram Pirai {{was shot}} in Ketti, a small town {{situated}} close to Ooty. Shooting also took place in Bangalore. A total of 30 days was taken to complete the filming on 36,000 feet of film negative. Mahendra did not find hiring a train expensive at that time; as a result, he hired a train for the film's scene where Haasan and Sridevi depart for Ketti, and another train for the film's climax which was shot at the Ketti railway station. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining</b> {{on the day the}} climax was shot, Mahendra decided to continue shooting the scene even though the rain {{was not part of the}} film's script. In the post-production phase, Smitha's voice was dubbed by Anuradha. Mahendra supervised Anuradha's dubbing session and taught her the methods to emote the dialogues for Smitha in the film.|$|E

According to the Pierce County Coroner's report, he suffered a heart attack, although bridgemen believed his death {{was the result of}} electrocution.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese soon {{worked on}} various {{techniques}} {{to improve the}} effectiveness of their guns. They developed a serial firing technique to create a continuous rain of bullets on the enemy. They also developed bigger calibers to increase lethal power. Protective boxes in lacquerware were invented to fit over the firing mechanism so it could still fire while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining,</b> as were systems to accurately fire weapons at night by keeping fixed angles thanks to measured strings.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{survivors}} {{were taken}} to the Mary Hitchcock Hospital, at least one in critical condition, and the hospital authorities said that no more injured were expected. The injured were lifted from the crash scene by helicopters and taken to the green {{in the center of the}} Dartmouth College campus, where fire engines and other vehicles lighted the grassy area for an emergency landing pad. The plane carried 39passengers and three crew members, Northeast said. One of the survivors was Frail, 21 years old, of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, and Winthrop, Massachusetts. The military authorities participating in the rescue operation said that bad weather had complicated matters. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining</b> at the crash scene, with snow at higher altitudes, and freezing temperatures were expected.|$|E

40|$|Moore’s {{problem or}} Moore’s ‘paradox’ {{arises from the}} fact that {{consistent}} propositions of the form of (1) and (2) : (1) 	<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining</b> but I believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not <b>raining</b> (2) 	<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining</b> but I don’t believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining</b> strike us as being contradictory. Shoemaker explained this oddity by producing a proof that belief in such sentences is either inconsistent or self-refuting. For Sorensen many propositional attitudes have scopes smaller than the class of consistent propositions. Inaccessible consistent propositions are ‘blindspots’. Moore-propositions are the blindspots of belief. According to either, Moore-propositions are unbelievable. I argue that Moore-propositions are actually believable. ...|$|R
5000|$|A common {{example of}} the {{distinction}} between direct and circumstantial evidence involves a person who comes into a building, when <b>it</b> may <b>be</b> <b>raining.</b> If the person declares, [...] "It's raining outside," [...] that statement is direct evidence that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining.</b> If the person is carrying a wet umbrella, and he's wearing a wet rain coat, those observations are circumstantial evidence that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>raining</b> outside.|$|R
25|$|On 25 January Hussein {{returned}} abruptly to the United States, after experiencing feversa sign {{of recurrent}} lymphoma. On 4February {{it was reported}} that Hussein had suffered internal organ failure, and was in critical condition. The next day, and at his request, he was flown to Jordan where he arrived unconscious after a second bone marrow transplant failed. Fighter jets from several countries flew with his plane as it passed over its territory, including the United States, Britain, and Israel. Hussein arrived at the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining</b> heavily, yet thousands flocked from all over Jordan and gathered at the main entrance. The crowds chanted his name, some weeping, others holding his pictures. On 7February Hussein was pronounced dead.|$|E
25|$|The hustings were erected {{outside the}} Hokitika Magistrate's Court {{building}} for the nomination meeting on 20 June at noon. Marcus Furlong South was the returning officer. Because of heavy rain, the nomination meeting was held inside the court, with the returning officer taking the bench. The merchant James Chesney nominated Thorne George, with the merchant Joseph Churches seconding the nomination. Fitzgerald was nominated by John Bevan and seconded by George Davidson, an engineer, blacksmiths and ironfounder. The third person to be nominated was Croumbie-Brown, but by then, {{the rain had stopped}} and the waiting crowd demanded forcefully for the remaining affairs to be held on the hustings. The returning officer moved the affairs outside and asked for a show of hands, which he declared in favour of Fitzgerald. A formal poll was asked for on behalf of Croumbie-Brown. Fitzgerald then gave an address to the electors, and towards the end, it started raining again. The other two candidates said that they would not keep the electors while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining,</b> and the proceedings were terminated.|$|E

500|$|The {{very first}} scene {{was shot in}} a small tank {{across the street from}} North Shore Studios in Vancouver. Wide-angle lenses were used to film the scene as the actors did not {{actually}} have much room for swimming. This made it look like the actors are actually covering some ground, while in reality they only swam [...] On the set of the following scene in which Fox Mulder reaches the shore, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining</b> and very cold.

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over the course}} of seven days in Baltimore. The scene in which Pembleton and Felton try to find the correct police car in a large garage was filmed in a rundown early 20th-century ballroom. The scene {{features}} dozens of white unmarked Cavaliers. Shortly before [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] was filmed, the Baltimore Police Department stopped using Cavaliers as their regular brand of police car, and agreed to sell their collection of leftover Cavaliers to the Homicide show for $1. Although the cars were used as props in the episode, only two of the cars were actually drivable. The scenes set in the medical examiner's office were filmed in the actual Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. The actors, particularly Jon Polito, hated performing in the morgue because they found the atmosphere unsettling. Ned Beatty said of filming there, [...] "The one thing you can't get on camera is, oh boy, it smells." [...] The identification pictures of suspects that Munch looks through were all pictures of photos of members of the Homicide crew. One of the final scenes in the episode, featuring Polito, Johnson and Belzer speaking in an alley at night, was conceived, written and shot in one night simply because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining</b> outside, and the Homicide crew wanted {{to take advantage of the}} location during a rainy night.|$|E
500|$|The brigade passed Oceana Court House in Wyoming County on July 16. On {{the next}} day, the advance guard (cavalry {{companies}} D, E, and F with Colonel Powell) was sent {{forward to the}} top of Tug Ridge. Tug Ridge is located {{on the north side of}} Abb's Valley, near the Virginia border with West Virginia. During the war, Abb's Valley was an important mountain pass monitored by rebel troops. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>raining</b> as Powell's men advanced, and they encountered a picket of six rebels who were inside a tent. A portion of the three companies led by Lieutenant Jeremiah Davidson surprised the rebels, capturing them without firing a shot. About [...] beyond the ridge, near Abbs Valley, Powell and the three companies [...] "...dashed into Camp Pemberton, at the head of Abb's Valley, and captured 25 prisoners belonging to a home-guard company... and 700 stand of arms, intended for arming a regiment in that vicinity." [...] Food was also captured, and redistributed among the brigade. The weapons were destroyed. Up until this point, the brigade captured all rebels confronted in an effort to keep its location secret. However, one rebel in the Tug Ridge-Abb's Valley region either was not captured or was captured and escaped—and warned his superiors that a large Union force was approaching. A newspaper article about the raid, published a week later in Abingdon, Virginia, described the Union brigade while it was in Abb's Valley as having [...] "a Colonel along acting as a Brigadier, but mainly commanded by a one-eyed Colonel by the name of Powell".|$|E
