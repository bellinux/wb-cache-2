500|$|Kennan had not {{intended}} the [...] "X" [...] article as {{a prescription for}} policy. For {{the rest of his}} life, Kennan continued to reiterate that the article did not imply an automatic commitment to resist Soviet [...] "expansionism" [...] wherever it occurred, with little distinction of primary and secondary interests. The article did not make it obvious that Kennan favored employing political and economic rather than military methods as the chief agent of containment. [...] "My thoughts about containment" [...] said Kennan in a 1996 interview to CNN, [...] "were of course distorted by the people who understood it and pursued it exclusively as a military concept; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that,</b> as much as any other cause, led to [...] 40 years of unnecessary, fearfully expensive and disoriented process of the Cold War".|$|E
500|$|Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{said that}} second season {{was the one}} on which {{the rest of the}} series was based, with {{characters}} taking long-term roles such as Geordi La Forge as Chief Engineer and Worf at the Tactical station. DeCandido said that the addition of Goldberg as Guinan was [...] "delightful", but that Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski [...] "didn't entirely work as a character". In his view, the episodes during season two were varied in quality. He gave [...] "Q Who" [...] ten out of ten, while he gave [...] "Shades of Grey" [...] a zero. It {{was the first time he}} awarded the top score to an episode; none of the first season had qualified. He gave the season an overall mark of seven out of ten and said that [...] "Far too many people say that TNG didn't come into its own until the third season, and frankly, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> estimation comes a year too late." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{topic of}} {{abortion}} is a prominent theme in [...] "Secrets". After discovering {{that she is}} pregnant, Lori asks Glenn to retrieve with emergency contraception pills from the pharmacy. Upon returning, an infuriated Maggie hands Lori her pills. Dale gently confronts her about her pregnancy when he sees that she becomes nauseated at the smell of cooking meat, and Lori explains that Rick is the biological father of the child. Writer Robert Kirkman opined that such assertions were [...] "wishful thinking". [...] "She was with those two men very close to each other. There was not a large span of time between her time with Shane and then Rick's return and her time with Rick. It's definitely {{up in the air}} and it’s not like there's a lot of paternity tests floating around out there." [...] Kirkman felt that he had to responsibly approach controversial issues from a neutral standpoint and insisted that abortion should warrant discussion, considering the circumstances. He stated: [...] "As far as the abortion stuff goes, it’s really just a matter of being realistic. These are the kinds of issues that people deal with in real life and in this situation <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is the kind of thought process that Lori Grimes would be going through." ...|$|E

2500|$|About {{contemporary}} American {{poetry and}} her own risk-taking in her work she said: “Perhaps there's a fear of revealing too much emotion in American poetry, despite the go-ahead of a sort from confessional poetry. At any rate, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is my goal—I mean I never want to say ‘I have plenty of heart,’ but I {{want to be able}} to say whatever I feel without fear or embarrassment.” ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{ought to}} be left up to the states. I {{personally}} {{do not think that}} that is a good idea, but I believe in many of these cases where there's real dispute in the country, these things {{are not going to be}} ever resolved. [...] People are going to have different ideas. That's why we have states. We ought to give great leeway to states and not have the federal government and not have the Supreme Court of the United States making social policy that's contrary to the traditions of this country and changing that overnight. And that's what's happened in a lot of these areas.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a meeting}} with European Commission President José Manuel Barroso in Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel {{condemned}} the action, stating [...] "It is not acceptable {{when there are no}} consultations about such actions". Commenting on the importance of trust in energy security, she said [...] "That always destroys trust and no trusting, undisturbed cooperation can be built on that." [...] Merkel continued by saying [...] "We will certainly say to our Russian partners but also to Belarus that such consultations are the minimum when there are problems, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> must become normality, as it would be within the European Union." [...] Barroso said that [...] "while there is no immediate risk to supplies, it is not acceptable" [...] for such actions to be undertaken without prior consultation.|$|E

[...] "But we've matured as musicians over time, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> been reflected in the music. We've learned <b>that</b> we don't all have to play crazy at all times, and we've learned to pick our moments to shine and deliver the songs in the most clear, concise and passionate way possible." ...|$|R

2500|$|During her June 12, 2010, {{appearance}} on Freedom Watch, Palin elaborated on her stance {{that even though}} marijuana should not be legalized, enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws should be made a lower priority: [...] "Well, if we’re talking about pot, I’m not for the legalization of pot because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> would just encourage, especially, our young people {{to think that it}} was okay to go ahead and use it. And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I {{think that we need to}} prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fight ended {{after the}} fourth round when Penn's cornerman, Jason Parillo, {{requested}} that the referee stop the fight. Penn failed to attend the post-fight press conference due to hospitalization for injuries. Penn later admitted {{that he could not}} recall anything that happened during the 3rd and 4th rounds because [...] "I was probably borderline knocked out or something." [...] During the fight, Penn complained that St-Pierre was too slippery to hold, which led to suspicion about petroleum jelly being illegally applied to St-Pierre's back. The matter was formally investigated by the UFC and Nevada State Athletic Commission upon the request of the Penn camp. Dana White said it was unfortunate GSP's dominant win was overshadowed by the cornerman controversy. [...] "Do I think that he got greased? Yeah, I do," [...] White told The Canadian Press prior to the UFC 95 weigh-in Friday at the Dominion Theatre. [...] "Absolutely, 100 per cent, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> guy was rubbing grease on him. Do I think Georges was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all, but that cornerman was rubbing grease on him; you cannot do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|RTÉ {{journalist}} Philip Boucher-Hayes said {{other media}} sources had misreported his words {{in order to}} erroneously claim that nuns had deliberately starved children to death: [...] "Today on BBC TV I said malnutrition was listed as cause of death at other mother-and-baby homes. Several outlets [...] now quoting me as [...] source for the unsupportable claim that ‘nuns starved 800 babies to death’ before dumping them in a septic tank. So just in case this needs clarification, I said nothing of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk to anybody else and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah sure, those were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is an embarrassment about our past that is probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary that there are very, very large communal graves of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|E

Now, if members of Congress did not know what they were voting on, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> their responsibility a lot more than it is the government's." ...|$|R
