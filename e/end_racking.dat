50|$|Many {{currently}} manufactured automobiles worldwide use MacPherson strut suspension, which utilises one {{ball joint}} per side, between {{the lower end}} of the strut and the control arm, with the necessary small amount of articulation at the top of the strut being usually provided by an elastomeric bearing, within which is a ball bearing to allow free rotation about the steering axis. So, there are commonly only two ball joints in the suspension, however there will be at least four (track rod <b>ends</b> and <b>rack</b> <b>ends)</b> in the steering linkage.|$|R
50|$|The airer {{consists}} of a rack with several horizontal wooden rails, usually 4 to 7, known as laths, with two <b>rack</b> <b>ends,</b> originally cast iron. The <b>rack</b> <b>ends</b> are brackets that separate the laths and also act as points to secure the cords that raise and lower the unit. Cords go from the metal tether points to pulleys mounted on the ceiling, {{and then to a}} cleat mounted on the wall.|$|R

A 2525 mm wheelbase helps endow the i20 with a generous passenger cabin. Suspension follows the supermini norm of MacPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam rear <b>end,</b> with <b>rack</b> and pinion steering.|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} of ATLAS electronic equipments must be insured {{to achieve}} the expected level of performance of the experiment. The ATLAS EMC Policy covers the electrical safety aspects of the front <b>end</b> and <b>racked</b> installations, and aims the proper operation of the experiment in the electromagnetic environment that it creates. For this, the policy defines a set of procedures to document and approve the installations from the safety, compatibility and maintenance points of view...|$|R

5|$|Buffalo {{began the}} final quarter with the ball in a 2nd-and-11 {{situation}} and were unable to convert the first down. UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also unable to move the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls. On their next possession Buffalo {{managed to get a}} first down off of a Drew Willy pass to tight <b>end</b> Jesse <b>Rack,</b> but were unable to move the ball further than UConn's 49-yard line and punted again.|$|R
5000|$|Cotton Owens would retire as a NASCAR {{race car}} owner after this race. David Pearson would be {{prevented}} from tying Richard Petty's record of ten consecutive wins at this race. This would {{eventually lead to}} Pearson's downfall in the NASCAR Cup Series. Pearson would <b>end</b> up <b>racking</b> a [...] "mere" [...] 105 victories compared to Petty's 200 career wins. Bobby Allison skipped this race to do the 1973 Indianapolis 500; which was the most horrific Indianapolis 500 race in its 100+ year history.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 the Lower Saxony Ministry for the Economy and Transport warmed that {{operations}} on the St. Andreasberg rack railway were very unprofitable.

50|$|Main {{intermediate}} {{station on the}} line at site of the locomotive workshops {{as well as the}} top <b>end</b> of the <b>rack</b> rail. Trains must reverse a short distance before continuing their climb to Udhagamandalam. It is normal for the locomotive to be changed here with diesel traction, being normal for all trains to Udhagamandalam.|$|R
50|$|Internal to the {{laboratory}} are racks, rack stand-offs, and vestibule jumpers. The lab racks house the system hardware in removable modular units. The stand-offs provide space for electrical connections, data management systems cabling for computers, air conditioning ducts, thermal control tubes and more, {{all of which}} support the space station's equipment racks. The racks interface to the piping and wiring in the standoff via outlets and ports located in the standoffs at the base <b>end</b> of each <b>rack</b> location.|$|R
50|$|The four rack {{locomotives}} {{were all}} shedded at Waterval Onder. When working a train up to Waterval Boven, a 32 Tonner would be coupled {{to the rear}} end of a train as banking engine. When working a descending train, the order of assembly was reversed, with the train's locomotive at the rear <b>end</b> and the <b>rack</b> locomotive in front to act as brake. Loads of 120 to 140 lt t could be handled in this manner.|$|R
25|$|In late 1962 Alan Turner, AC's chief {{engineer}} completed a major design {{change of the}} car's front <b>end</b> to accommodate <b>rack</b> and pinion steering while still using transverse leaf spring suspension. The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated Mark II. The steering rack was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle. About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced {{in the summer of}} 1965 (the last US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).|$|R

25|$|Bike rack plates: fitted {{onto the}} rear of {{vehicles}} (naturally having bicycles obstructing the registration plate) can have smaller numerical plates (black-on-white design) with Victoria – Bike Rack as the insert, fixed on the <b>end</b> of the <b>rack</b> and clearly visible. The bike rack plates has been updated as of December 2013 with screen printed bottom legend Vic – Stay Alert Stay Alive and Bike Rack legend at top and the ink was changed from black to blue. The slogan was later replaced with the current slogan Victoria – The Education State.|$|R
60|$|Austin, who stooped {{and picked}} up the cigar, settled himself afresh on the settee after {{lighting}} it, and half an hour dragged by. Neither of them felt the least sign of drowsiness yet, and the jingle of the odds and <b>ends</b> in the <b>rack,</b> and tremble of the stout teak house, was, as he had said, vaguely reassuring. The big pump was pounding on in spite of the climate, and neither heat nor fever had any effect on steam. Then he looked up sharply, and Jefferson straightened himself, for a faint sound of footsteps came out of the darkness. They were slow and dragging, as though somebody was groping his way warily towards the light.|$|R
50|$|The Riggenbach {{rack system}} used a ladder rack, formed of steel {{channels}} connected by square rungs at regular intervals, {{to engage the}} pinion wheels of the rack engine. The rungs of the NZASM rack track were spaced 4 in apart. To ensure correct meshing of the gears when entering the rack section, engaging pieces of special section, 6 ft long and fitted with round-bar rungs, were hinged to each <b>end</b> of the <b>rack,</b> supported by a spiral spring underneath. When the rack engine made contact with the hinged section and the gear wheels did not mesh with the rack correctly, the engaging section would be pressed down until correct meshing was accomplished.|$|R
50|$|Pockets, usually rimmed at {{the back}} with leather or plastic, may have leather mesh or cloth bags or plastic cups, or {{elongated}} wire racks, to catch the balls, common in home billiard rooms and pool halls, or in the coin-operated tables found in bars/pubs may instead lead to ball-return troughs inside the table, which channel the balls into a collection chamber {{on one side of}} the table (or, in non-coin-op models, on the <b>racking</b> <b>end</b> of the table). A disadvantage to pockets with bags or cups is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.|$|R
50|$|Similar gaiters {{to those}} {{described}} above find multiple uses on most vehicles. They are used {{at both ends}} of driveshafts, protecting constant-velocity joints from the ingress of dirt, and retaining the grease. They also prevent the ingress of dirt where one component slides within another, for example, on suspension struts or the <b>ends</b> of steering <b>racks.</b> Finally, they are also usually used to perform the same function on ball joints, which appear on suspension wishbones and steering tie rod ends. The gear stick gaiter is to resist dirt entering the ball joint {{at the bottom of the}} stick and to not have oil or grease from the joint exposed to passengers. They are commonly leather, faux leather, rubber or a waterproof cloth.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{begins with}} Naomi Arkoff (Robin Sydney) being taken {{by her father}} Carver Arkoff (Steve Kramer) into the {{basement}} of their castle home in Rome, Italy, where there lies a rack. Carver ties Naomi to both <b>ends</b> of the <b>rack</b> and turns the wheel, hurting her. Carver claims that her punishment this time is for having a cell phone, which was against the father's wishes. After begging her father to let her go, Carver unties her, but warns her {{that the next time}} she has a cellphone in the house, her punishment {{is not going to be}} slow and painful. As she gets released, she runs off upstairs, strangely screaming: [...] "I can run faster than you!" [...] over and over again.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} part of the 17th century Standlake had three or four public houses, {{including}} the Chequers, which traded until at least 1781. By the latter part of the 18th century Standlake had between seven and 11 pubs. The Black Horse is a 16th-century building that was a pub by 1761 and continues to trade today. By 1790 The Bell had opened in <b>Rack</b> <b>End,</b> but by 1804 it had moved to the High Street to a building part of which is timber-framed infilled with brick nogging, and the remainder of which is built of Cotswold stone. The Bell was closed for refurbishment for some time after the sale of the pub by Greene King in 2008, but reopened in August 2010 as a free house run by Few Inns.|$|R
50|$|However, two {{different}} basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds {{corresponding to the}} digit being added or subtracted; a 1 moves the accumulator the slowest, and a 9, the fastest.

Each rack has a drive pin that is moved by the slot. The rack for 1 is closest to the pivot, of course.For each keyboard digit, a sliding selector gear, much {{like that in the}} Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.|$|R
40|$|A {{telescoping}} manipulator arm and pivotable finger assembly are disclosed. The telescoping {{arm assembly}} includes a generally T-shaped arm having three outwardly extending fingers guided on grooved roller guides {{to compensate for}} environmental variations. The pivotable finger assembly includes four pivoting fingers. Arcuate teeth are formed {{on the ends of}} the fingers. A rack having teeth on four sides meshes with each one of the fingers. One surface of the rack includes teeth along its entire surface which mesh with teeth of one of the fingers. The teeth at the remote <b>end</b> of the <b>rack</b> engage teeth of a gear wheel. The wheel includes a worm which meshes with a worn drive shaft of the drive motor providing a ninety degree self-locking drive for locking the fingers in a desired position. A similar drive provides a self-locking drive for positioning the telescoping arm...|$|R
50|$|Testing {{the rack}} {{in its place}} allows it to fall until the tail rests on the lowest step of the snail. The hook of the rack should then hold the rack {{so that there are}} twelve teeth {{gathered}} up. Trying it on the highest step of the snail, should catch the first rack tooth. This leaves only one to be gathered up. If the clock strikes thirteen when on the lowest step and two when on the highest, it shows that the <b>end</b> of the <b>rack</b> tail is a little too far off from the snail and must be set a little closer. If on the other hand the snail strikes the right number when on the lowest step and two when on the highest, then the proportion between the snail and rack is wrong. The rack travel is too great for the rack.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to examine the changes in density of stacked roundwood, chips, and chunks as affected by various compaction treatments. Density of stacked roundwood bolts was tested for the effect of stacking orientation, binding of the stack ends, and species. Stacked bolt wood occupied less than 50 {{percent of the total}} rack space for all species, giving final dry bulk densities, based on total rack volume, of 159 to 293 kg/m 3. Alternating butt <b>ends</b> in the <b>rack</b> increased final bulk densities by an average of approximately 40 percent. The effect was greatest for mixed, small hardwood stems. Vibration and compaction of chipped material (pine, mixed hardwood, and sycamore) resulted in final dry bulk densities of from 170 to 273 kg/m 3. Vibration increased dry bulk density by an average of 20 percent, whereas compaction increased dry bulk density by about 30 percent, vibration of sycamore chunks produced a 17 percent increase...|$|R
5000|$|After {{working for}} about a year, the songs were {{released}} on the Aariana sub-label Aquarius Records (in France) in November 1978. The first single that was released was the disco song [...] "Born to Be Alive". Its success was immediate, and in January 1979, Hernandez received his first gold record from Italy. The song spread throughout Europe, where it hit #1 in France in April and remained there until July. By then, the United States had caught on, and after some remixing, the record was signed to the A-Tom-Mik label and later Columbia Records. The remixed version was released on a commercial 12" [...] single, and it peaked in the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart at #1 and crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #16. It sold over one million copies in the US. The track reached #10 in the UK Singles Chart. By year's <b>end,</b> Hernandez had <b>racked</b> up fifty-two gold and platinum record awards from more than fifty different countries.|$|R
30|$|We ran the {{experiments}} at room temp, and storage after liquid nitrogen storage {{over a period}} of 30 days, and with a sample number of n?=? 30 or 16 for each measured points. By positioning probes in the tubes, the probes were placed in the tube just below the meniscus of the liquid. The probes were inserted from the side to reduce the displacement of sample in the well. The probe wire was routed out of the rack down an adjacent tube. The base and one side of the tube are removed to allow the wire to pass through. The rest of the tube is kept where possible in tact to keep the thermal mass of the test rack as close to a standard unmodified rack as possible. Probe wires must be routed between tubes or around the skirt of the rack to allow the rack to sit on the base of the tubes during the sealing process. Holes in one <b>end</b> of the <b>rack</b> skirt allow the wires to exit the side of the rack without interfering with the sealing process.|$|R
