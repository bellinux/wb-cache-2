When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little {{time to spend with}} them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to spend as much time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.|$|E

5|$|Benedetto Pistrucci {{was born}} in Rome on 24 May 1783, second child and son of Federico Pistrucci, Senior Judge of the High Criminal Court under the papal government, and Antonia (née Greco). His elder brother Filippo {{displayed}} artistic tendencies from a young age, but Benedetto showed mainly a disinclination to study. Federico Pistrucci wanted his sons to follow in his <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> sent them to Latin schools. Benedetto began his education in Bologna, where the family had property, but the Pistrucci family was forced to move to Rome in 1794 when Napoleon invaded Italy, and the boys {{were enrolled in the}} Roman College.|$|E
5|$|By 23BC, {{some of the}} un-Republican {{implications}} {{were becoming}} apparent concerning the settlement of 27BC. Augustus' retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the Roman political system, and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters– Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. Feeling pressure from his core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help.|$|E
5|$|Determined to save Marceline, Finn and Jake {{disguise}} {{themselves as}} demons and sneak {{back into the}} Nightosphere by creating a portal that sends them to the seat of government for Marceline's regime. Marceline, in her evil demon form, listens to the requests of her subjects, often ignoring what they seek and instead punishing them with macabre torture. Finn and Jake are spotted by Marceline, who gives chase. After narrowly avoiding their demonic friend, the duo run into the now-benign Hunson Abadeer, who explains that he only wanted Marceline to follow in his <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> rule the hellish realm.|$|E

5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, <b>footsteps,</b> <b>and</b> occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a new Friday the 13th film which {{restarted}} {{the film}} series continuity was released. In this film, after witnessing his mother being beheaded {{at a young}} age, an adult Jason (Derek Mears) follows in her <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> kills anyone who comes to Crystal Lake. Jason subsequently kidnaps a young woman, Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti), who resembles his mother at a young age. Six weeks after her disappearance, her brother, Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki), comes to look for her. The pair reunite and work together to seemingly kill Jason.|$|E

5|$|The first Hispanic {{to serve}} in the United States Revenue Cutter Service, {{predecessor}} to the Coast Guard, was Juan Andreu who from 1824 to 1845 served as the Keeper of the St. Augustine Lighthouse in Florida, thus making him also the first Hispanic to oversee a U.S. federal installation of any kind. Maria Andreu (a.k.a. Maria Mestre de los Dolores), a family member, followed in his <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> served as Keeper of the same lighthouse from 1859 to 1862, becoming the first Hispanic-American woman {{to serve in}} the Coast Guard (USRCS) and the first Hispanic-American woman to command a U.S. federal shore installation.|$|E
5|$|The game's 15 {{missions}} {{take place}} in large levels that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a blackjack or killed with a bow or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security automatons and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as frameups and blackmail, the player steals valuables {{that may be used}} to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to douse lights, moss arrows to dampen the player character's <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> rope arrows to reach higher ground.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's {{father taught}} her to play the piano, which she {{mastered}} well {{enough for him to}} believe that she might follow in his sister's <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.|$|E

5|$|Emile Durkheim {{was born}} in Épinal in Lorraine, the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim. He came {{from a long line}} of devout French Jews; his father, grandfather, and {{great-grandfather}} had been rabbis. He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, he decided not to follow in his family's <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> switched schools. Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community. Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew. One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist.|$|E
5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> other sounds. When Fiona is in a {{dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E
5|$|Gourcuff {{is the son}} of Christian Gourcuff. In 2001, he {{followed}} in his father's <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> joined Rennes. After progressing through the youth ranks and making the senior team, Gourcuff quickly became a fan favorite among supporters and his individual achievements soon led to interest from clubs abroad, which resulted in a move to Italian club A.C. Milan. Gourcuff achieved many club honours despite not being able to break into the starting eleven, which resulted in the player being sent on loan to Ligue 1 club Bordeaux in his home country of France. Following a successful season, in which Bordeaux captured the league and league cup double and Gourcuff attained several individuals honours, he signed with the club permanently. Gourcuff is a former winner of the UNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Year award and, in December 2009, was named the French Player of the Year for the 2009 calendar year. In August 2010, he joined Olympique Lyonnais on a five-year contract.|$|E
60|$|Mademoiselle Mermillon was of {{the order}} of young person who resents, but this {{afternoon}} she was far too nervous.

When at last he reappeared alone her disappointment was obvious.|$|R
25|$|The arpent (58.464 m), {{the unit}} of {{measurement}} employed {{in the first years}} of colonisation, fell out of use in several decades.

5|$|His grandfather, Sir Henry Power, was {{a captain}} of the Battle-Axe Guards. His father, Captain Lieutenant Bolton Power, served in the 20th Regiment of Foot and fought in several battles of the Seven Years' War, {{and later in the}} American Revolutionary War under Guy Carleton and John Burgoyne. Manley Power {{followed}} in his forefather's <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> was a career soldier, starting as an ensign in his father's old regiment, the 20th Regiment of Foot, on 27 August 1783, when he was either 9 or 10 years old. He served in Halifax, Nova Scotia (1795–97), Holland (1799), and Menorca (1800). He was part of the force under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby at the Battle of Alexandria (1801), and later served with the Royal Horse Guards (1803–05). After rising to Lieutenant Colonel of the 32nd Regiment of Foot, he entered the Peninsular War and was attached to the Portuguese army under the command of Sir William Beresford and was promoted to lieutenant general in 1813.|$|E
5|$|Though {{he would}} later become indelibly {{associated}} with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club's local rivals Port Vale. His father wanted him to follow in his <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> become a boxer, but Stanley decided {{at the age of}} 13 {{that he wanted to be}} a footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had one more year at school, should follow his passion of football. His father conceded that should he be picked for England Schoolboys then he could continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.|$|E
5|$|Yellowfang's Secret was {{released}} on 9 October 2012. It is a Super Edition about the former medicine cat of ThunderClan, Yellowfang and her life in ShadowClan. It follows Yellowfang as she first trains to be a warrior, then a medicine cat, as Sagewhisker tells her that her paws are not meant for shedding blood. She decides to switch {{to the role of}} medicine cat instead because she can feel the injuries of all the other cats in ShadowClan. A few moons later she breaks the code of medicine cats when she gives birth to kits; as a result, she and her whole Clan are punished for her disloyalty to the code, as her only surviving kit, Brokenkit proves to be vicious, bloodthirsty, and driven only by ambition, qualities that his own father, Raggedstar, ignores. In the end, Yellowfang herself is cast out of ShadowClan to live as a rogue by her own kit, now having gone on to follow in his father's <b>footsteps</b> <b>and</b> become Brokenstar for a crime she did not commit.|$|E
