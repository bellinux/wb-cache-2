The main attention was dedicated to the measurement of this pheno-menon. The concept of psychic distance was compared to cultural distance, they are used interchangeably in the article. The objective of the paper was also to discuss the conceptual and methodo-logical properties of psychic (cultural) distance: the illusion of symmetry, stabili-ty, linearity, causality, discordance, as well as the assumption of corporate and spatial homogeneity and the assumption of equivalence. The last part of the article is dedicated to the examples of research exam-ining the role of psychic (cultural) distance in decisions of: choosing market entry mode (export versus foreign direct investment; acquisitions versus <b>green</b> <b>field</b> <b>investment),</b> choosing the level of strategy adaptation to local market con-ditions and decisions concerning other fields of international business...|$|E

40|$|The {{business}} experts could witness {{major changes}} in the targets of international capital flow during the last two decades. The Central-Eastern European economic and social transition that was started in the early 1990 s has created good conditions for the international investments. The new target of foreign direct investments ñ besides the Asian regions ñ depended on the changes of political and economic system going on in the countries concerned. The different pace of changes and the privatization of state properties determined the share of individual countries from the capital import. The early eminent countries were replaced by new eminent ones, and the capital inflow replaced brown <b>field</b> <b>investments</b> ñ that dominated at the beginning ñ with <b>green</b> <b>field</b> <b>investments.</b> The paper examines the worldwide and regional tendencies of foreign direct investments of the 1990 ís and the 2000 ís, the share of individual countries within the region as well as the changes in the sectoral distribution.

40|$|The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms in India {{have been}} liberalized in a phased manner since 1991. Foreign {{investment}} is now {{coming into the}} country {{not only as a}} source of new technology, but also as a source of capital and managerial skills. Accordingly actual inflow of FDI in India has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 36. 3 % between 1991 and 2003. The regional pattern of FDI has been marked by strong variations during this period, with more investment going to states with better infrastructure and more progress in the reform process. The hitherto reserve sectors for public investment like power, oil and telecommunications have attracted considerable FDI after liberalization. In terms of the country-wise approvals of FDI, USA accounts for nearly 20 % of the share followed by Mauritius, UK and Japan.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was on a basis of an analysis of the statistical data about the flows and stocks of the foreign direct investments in the world to detect the trends with respect to their growth, geographic distribution as well as trends with respect to their components and forms. Further, the aim of {{the research}} was to identify how the last economic and financial crises affect the trends of the foreign direct investments. Our expectation was that the last crisis has affected the trends of the foreign direct investments and not only their growth and geographical patterns, but also their components and forms. The analysis {{of the results of the}} statistical data show that the trend of growth of before the crises was present in developed, developing and transition economies, but both the inflows and outflows were concentrated in few countries. Actually, the developed countries have domination in this respect. However, the last crises increased the importance of developing countries both as sources and destinations of the foreign direct investments. After the crises the <b>green</b> <b>field</b> <b>investments</b> increased their importance over the mergers and acquisitions as forms of FDI.

To gain more in-depth knowledge in this area he has taken up a PhD High Rise Ability. A basic hypothesis of this study is the impact of local conditions on feasibility. His research field includes redefining sustainability in building economics and project development. A redefinition of building economics towards sustainability will include the spatial approach of <b>green</b> <b>field</b> <b>investments</b> and most of all necessary intensification of brown field development. For large parts of Western Europe and the US the latter will be, according to economic principles of concentration and revaluation of city life, the main focus in development. Like the rest of the world, the growth of cities seems irreversible and a continuous fight against sprawl. Other studies reveal that sustainable economics require focus and insight on building characteristics. So density is the focal point. Urban quality can be partly quantified in parameters like Floor Space Index (FSI- intensity), Ground Space Index (GSI-compactness), Open Space Ratio (OSR- pressure on open space) and height.

40|$|The Serbian banking sector {{after four}} years of {{transition}} is almost completely different from the situation before. Last year the growth rate of GDP in the sector was among the highest in neighborhood and even among all transition countries. Ten big acquisitions of domestic banks, with majority stake possessed by the state or private persons or legal entities, were realized with results that 2 / 3 of the sector now belong to foreign investors. Necessary prerequisite for transition was really independent role of National bank in definition and realization of monetary policy and supervision of banking sector. Transition of the banking sector was realized step by step threw three lines of activities. Firstly, restructuring and rehabilitation of existed banks. This painful step included closing of 18 banks and merging of small, week banks. National bank introduced tight financial discipline and international banking standard. Secondly, financial market was opened for foreign investors. At the beginning monetary authorities gave several license for <b>green</b> <b>field</b> <b>investments,</b> but later on foreign banks could penetrate the market threw acquisition of domestic banks, only. Thirdly, recently the state started privatization of majority stake in domestic banks owned by the state. This process will be finished by the end of 2006. At the same time domestic private shareholders recognized their interest to sell majority stake in several others banks. Although Serbian banks improved their efficiency and increased total amount of credit lines and assets for several times, there is still room for further transition steps. Among others, the law on banks and other financial institutions has to be amended, especially regarding stronger supervisory role of National bank, higher responsibility for bank management and auditors, as well. Important role for National bank would be also transition of insurance market, which is now at the very beginning phases of overall reform. Serbian banking sector with linkages to banks from EU countries and full introduction of international banking standards can be solid basis for European integration of Serbian economy. ...|$|R

Urban quality can be partly quantified in parameters like Floor Space Index (FSI - intensity), Ground Space Index (GSI - compactness), Open Space Ratio (OSR - pressure on open space) and height. The density and the morphology of the urban fabric can be adequately described by these parameters, using plot charts where the different parameters are placed on the axis and the elements are plotted and analysed. The value of real estate property is determined by the building value and the land value. The building value is related to the location due to rent levels enabling building quality, urban quality and contextual (functional and economical quality). The land value should be almost equivalent to location value and, at least {{at the start of the}} process, is calculated using the looked-for Floor Space Index. It is expected that performance of real estate objects, categorised in different sets, defined by these urban parameters will show similar grouping, by which the density related behaviour can be forecasted. Used as a tool to analyse a portfolio it will give insight in the relation of this stock and density. This tool and gained insight is especially needed for emphasising externalities of density to a project scope. The central question “Why Tall?” can be answered by these regional advantages. At the same time urban planners, at least in Rotterdam, require tall buildings iconic by slenderness, an effect further stressed by regulation. This city is exemplary for a situation in which it is already hard to distinguish a need for going high. All externalities have to be taken into account. Even beyond economic viability, the fineness creates a setback on the performance by density. The original density plot charts are twodimensional. By adding colour the performance is shown and by using marker styles the impact of building volume related to the financial indicators can be clarified. Real Estate and HousingArchitectur...|$|R
