5|$|The {{development}} of the Council has been characterised by the rise in power of the Parliament, with which the Council has <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> its legislative powers. The Parliament has often provided opposition to the Council's wishes. This has in some cases led to clashes between both bodies with the Council's system of intergovernmentalism contradicting the developing parliamentary system and supranational principles.|$|E
5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
5|$|For {{his great}} {{services}} at Hohenfriedberg, Frederick {{gave him the}} captaincy of Tatiau, which carried with it a salary of 500 thalers a year. Later on he became Governor of Kolberg in Pomerania. At Battle of Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the united Austro-Saxon force; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in {{time to take a}} decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the laurels, and Zieten wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt in any way that he thought fit. During the ten years peace that preceded the next great war, Winterfeldt was in constant attendance upon the king, except when employed on confidential missions in the provinces or abroad. For example, he was sent to London for negotiating the Convention of Westminster. In 1756 he was made a lieutenant general and received the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order Pour le Mérite.|$|E

25|$|After {{the general}} {{success of the}} IPSFC’s {{restoration}} efforts, the Canadian government began pushing for a pink salmon treaty.

25|$|During the French Revolution, Mende <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> with Marvejols the {{function}} of department capital of Gévaudan. This was renamed in the Lozère department in 1790, and the guardianship of the church disappeared in 1791, thus {{putting an end to}} the paréage of 1307. Mende was the scene of small counter-revolutionary clashes, but without great effects. It became the sole capital shortly after.|$|E
25|$|The Legislative Assembly {{first met}} on 1 October 1791, elected by those 4 million men – {{out of a}} {{population}} of 25 million – who paid a certain minimum amount of taxes.

The King <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> power with the elected Legislative Assembly, but he retained his royal veto {{and the ability to}} select ministers.|$|E

25|$|Athena {{instructed}} Perseus to {{find the}} Hesperides, who were entrusted with weapons needed to defeat the Gorgon. Following Athena's guidance, Perseus sought the Graeae, sisters of the Gorgons, to demand the whereabouts of the Hesperides, the nymphs tending Hera's orchard. The Graeae were three perpetually old women, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> a single eye. As the women passed the eye from one to another, Perseus snatched it from them, holding it for ransom {{in return for the}} location of the nymphs. When the sisters led him to the Hesperides, he returned what he had taken.|$|E

The German fighters, taking advantage of the illumination from searchlights, target indicator flares and ground fires, claimed 12 aircraft shot down but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> their claims with the anti-aircraft batteries who also claimed the 12 bombers. To avoid losses to friendly fire, anti-aircraft batteries were ordered to restrict the height of their flak barrage and the fighters operated above that ceiling.|$|E

50|$|In ozone (O3) molecules, the two O−O {{bonds are}} nonpolar (there is no {{electronegativity}} difference between atoms {{of the same}} element). However, the distribution of other electrons is unevensince the central atom <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> electrons with two other atoms, but each of the outer atoms <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> electrons with only one other atom, the central atom is more deprived of electrons than the others (the central atom has a formal charge of +1, while the outer atoms each have a formal charge of −). Since the molecule has a bent geometry, {{the result is a}} dipole across the whole ozone molecule.|$|R
25|$|Both groups {{suffered}} the same poor living {{conditions in the}} city, such as {{the lack of a}} clean water supply and of sanitation, leading to outbreaks of cholera and typhus. The barracks were so cramped that often two soldiers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> a bed; the officers, quartered in the houses of the upper classes, did not experience such problems. Among the inhabitants, there was similar stratification: there was a marked difference between the dark, cramped housing of the poor in the lower town and the fine accommodation enjoyed by the rich who lived in housing in the upper town built by the nobility or the clergy.|$|E
25|$|The next tournaments {{were not}} as close, {{although}} Jamaica's win in 1990–91—their fourth in eight seasons, and their last for a further eight—also {{came down to the}} last over, but then with four wickets in hand. Then, in 1992–93 the era of the Leeward Islands began. They won three successive titles—admittedly with the first one rained off, but the next two won outright—before fading back to last place in their three-team group in 1995–96, beaten by the two teams who would later try to contest the final, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the trophy due to rain. The tournament was also renamed in 1994–95, becoming the Shell/Sandals Trophy.|$|E
25|$|In 1926 by the Government {{order the}} Dmitrovsky Theatre {{was turned over}} to two opera studios founded by two pivotal reformers of theatre art, Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko – the Stanislavsky Opera Studio (originally started as the Bolshoi Theatre Studio but soon set to work independently) and the Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Studio (started as the Moscow Art Theatre Music Studio and for several years run at the Theatre’s premises, but severed from its alma mater after a {{successful}} tour in Europe and USA). Both companies acquired the status of theatres this same year. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> one stage, using it by turns, and had the joint business management.|$|E
