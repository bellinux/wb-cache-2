40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether temporal clustering of autobiographical memories (AMs) around periods of self-development ([Rathbone et al., 2008] and [Rathbone et al., 2009]) would also occur when imagining <b>future</b> <b>events</b> {{associated with the}} self. Participants completed an AM task and future thinking task. In both tasks, memories and <b>future</b> <b>events</b> were cued using participant-generated identity statements (e. g., I am a student; I will be a mother). Participants then dated their memories and <b>future</b> <b>events,</b> and finally gave an age at which each identity statement was judged to emerge. Dates of memories and <b>future</b> <b>events</b> were recoded as temporal distance from the identity statement used to cue them.

The Doctor introduces her to the concept of [...] "spoilers", seen originally in the 10th Doctor story [...] "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead", and becoming a virtual catchphrase for River. River's aptitude for flying the TARDIS—having been taught how by the machine itself—is demonstrated in [...] "The Time of Angels"; River explains she [...] "had lessons from the very best" [...] (which the Doctor assumes refers to himself) and that the Doctor was [...] "busy that day". The Teselecta crew consider River a wanted, dangerous criminal; River is shown being in prison in her personal future in [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] for killing [...] "the best man I ever knew". In this episode's epilogue, River joins the Luna University to become an archaeologist, in order to find the Doctor. Her previous appearances (events which take place later in River's personal timeline) show that she will/has acquired her degrees. When River wakes up in hospital, the Doctor says [...] "Rule One: The Doctor lies".

She is only able to [...] "see" [...] a small segment of some <b>future</b> <b>event,</b> and she frequently errs on what it really means, in which case her attempts to change these events only end up making it happen or making it worse. Her main catchphrases are [...] "Oh Fudge!", [...] "Oh snap!", [...] "Ya nasty!", [...] "How y'all doin'?", and [...] "Oh, no he didn't!" [...] She abruptly says, [...] "I'm okay!" [...] if she falls down in one of her disguises. And, if big guys throw her, she tells them to do it [...] "gently!" [...] In addition, when she disapproves of something, she exclaims [...] "Gotta go!" [...] When she makes an appearance on Cory in the House, her father exclaims, [...] "You didn't get kicked out of design school because they don't give out refunds!", which shows she is attending design school. Raven is also a master of disguise, which fits in with her trouble-making antics and passion for becoming a fashion designer, like her idol, Donna Cabonna, whom she worked for as an intern. Raven Baxter is extremely allergic to mushrooms, and her favorite drink is orange juice. According to Chelsea, her favorite gemstone is diamond, her favorite vegetable is corn, and her favorite animal is stuffed. Often referred to as Rae, Raven does not enjoy nature or camping. She has appeared in every episode of the series, along with her younger brother Cory. In the second spin-off, Raven's Home, Raven eventually married her first love Devon but they got divorced. In between that time, they had two children Nia and Booker - latter of whom, shares Raven's ability to see into the future.|$|E

40|$|Imagining one's {{future is}} a {{ubiquitous}} and {{important aspect of}} mental life. In recent years, research into episodic future thinking {{has been one of}} the most rapidly expanding topics in psychology. This thesis took a multimethod approach to explore its cognitive and mnemonic characteristics. In Study 1, an internet-based study was conducted investigating subjective characteristics of autobiographical past and <b>future</b> <b>events.</b> It was found that temporal distance had parallel effects on the emotional intensity and importance of past and <b>future</b> <b>events.</b> In terms of differences, past events had more subjective detail and <b>future</b> <b>events</b> were more emotionally positive. In Study 2, the Internal (episodic) and External (000 - episodic) details of past and <b>future</b> <b>events</b> were objectively measured using the Levine et al (2002) coding technique. To distinguish episodic future thinking from imagination in general, an imagined past event condition was included. Remembering was associated with greater sensory-perceptual detail than imagining (past and <b>future)</b> <b>events.</b> In Study 3, no relation was evident between episodic and non-episodic detail within past and <b>future</b> <b>events</b> and trial duration did not affect event specificity (past and <b>future</b> <b>events).</b> Study 4 explored the memory and future-thinking of an individual with amnesia following vascular dementia. This case study replicated previous studies of amnesics who are unable to imagine the future. Study 5 and 6 explored possible subprocesses underlying episodic future thinking, with some evidence for a role of executive function in the production of episodic <b>future</b> <b>events.</b> Finally, age-related differences in Internal and External detail of future thinking were observed, in addition to differences amongst finer-grained event properties. In sum, the range of approaches and methodologies adopted in these studies allowed exploration of a broad range of empirical and theoretical issues. The results documented here led to novel questions which open new avenues of research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
