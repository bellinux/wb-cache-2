Rushing to the area, Whittle dived into the weed-choked lake and began searching for the boy. Finding him unconscious, Whittle brought the boy to the bank and applied {{artificial}} respiration for approximately half an hour; the child later came around and was taken to hospital. Whittle left the scene and proceeded home in a taxi without leaving his name, but his identity was subsequently discovered and he was presented with a Certificate of Merit by the Royal Life Saving Society. Whittle himself was ill for a fortnight due to swallowing some of the <b>foul</b> <b>water</b> in the ornamental lake.|$|E

Seeing rubbish {{on the streets and}} smelling the <b>foul</b> <b>water</b> of the canals, he feels nauseated and claustrophobic, and decides that he must leave Venice. Back at the hotel, the Manager expresses his regret over Aschenbach's departure. When Tadzio returns Aschenbach's glances, Aschenbach himself also feels regret. On arriving at the station, Aschenbach finds that his luggage has been sent on the wrong train ("I am furious because I am forced to return, but secretly I rejoice. Vacillating, irresolute, absurd"), and he realises upon seeing Tadzio again that the boy was the cause of his regret at leaving.|$|E

Many of these gastropods have also undergone detorsion, such that the mantle cavity and gill have shifted round to the right side of the body.

2500|$|The word 'gowt' [...] {{refers to}} a sluice or outflow, though {{the origin of the}} word is not known with {{complete}} certainty. It appears to be cognate with the French égout, sewer. Though the modern mind associates the word 'sewer' with <b>foul</b> <b>water,</b> it was not always necessarily so. There are several 'gowt' placenames on the fens, including Anton's Gowt. In a reference that predates the pumping works, the nearby turnpike toll gate was known as Guthram Cote. This is indicative, as though the spelling and form of the name vary considerably, {{there appears to be no}} reference to the use of 'gowt' in connection with Guthram's Cote before the steam engine was installed. The earlier name was still in use contemporary with the use of the engine.|$|E
2500|$|For its size, the San Joaquin River {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{polluted}} rivers in the United States, especially in its lower course. Years of pesticides and fertilizers being applied to the surrounding lands as well as municipal runoff have led to elevated levels of selenium, fluoride, nitrates and other substances in the river and its tributaries; pesticide pollution is now considered [...] "ubiquitous" [...] to the San Joaquin River system. The selenium is believed to originate from soils on the west side of the valley and in the Coast Ranges, which are rich with the element. Additionally, the San Joaquin is suffering chronic salinity problems due to high levels of minerals being washed off the land by irrigation practices. Abandoned mines contribute toxic acid mine drainage to some tributaries of the river. One of the worst environmental disasters was at Kesterson Reservoir, a disposal site for agricultural drain water which doubled as a wildlife refuge. Initially, animals and plants thrived in the artificial wetlands that were created here, but in 1983, it was found that birds had suffered severe deformities and deaths due to steadily increasing levels of chemicals and toxins. In the next few years, all the fish species died except for the mosquito fish, and algae blooms proliferated in the <b>foul</b> <b>water.</b> These have had not only an adverse impact on San Joaquin River ecology, but also cause pollution to the sources of most of the large aqueducts in the state – the California and Delta-Mendota Canals, for example.|$|E

These damages, particularly those to the watering holes, have the potential to make native plants and animals locally extinct. The donkeys also affect local agriculture. They sometimes can over eat pasture grasses and destroy fences. They are also known to infect domestic animals with diseases.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{long after}} the end of the Byzantine-Sasanian War of 572-591, a locust plague ravaged the {{countryside}} of the province from 591 to 595, in which locusts are said to have destroyed crops and <b>fouled</b> <b>water</b> supplies. The ensuing food shortages and famine caused many to migrate to neighbouring regions, whilst those less able were forced to resort to begging in nearby cities. This led to the abandonment of many villages and hamlets throughout Arbayistan.

60|$|It is {{remarkable}} how unequally the glands on the bladders {{on the same}} branch, and even the glands {{of the same kind}} on the same bladder, are affected by the <b>foul</b> <b>water</b> in which the plants have grown, and by the solutions which were employed. In the former case I presume that this is due either to little currents bringing matter to some glands and not to others, or to unknown differences in their constitution. When the glands on the same bladder are differently affected by a solution, we may suspect that some of them had previously absorbed a small amount of matter from the water. However this may be, we have seen that the glands on the same leaf of Drosera are sometimes very unequally affected, more especially when exposed to certain vapours.|$|E
60|$|From {{the nature}} of the {{solutions}} which were tried, I presume that nitrogen is absorbed by the glands; but the modified, brownish, more or less shrunk, and aggregated contents of the oblong glands were never seen by me or by my son to undergo those spontaneous changes of form characteristic of protoplasm. On the other hand, the contents of the larger spherical glands often separated into small hyaline globules or irregularly shaped masses, which changed their forms very slowly and ultimately coalesced, forming a central shrunken mass. Whatever may be {{the nature of}} the contents of the several kinds of glands, after they have been acted on by <b>foul</b> <b>water</b> or by one of the nitrogenous solutions, it is probable that the matter thus generated is of service to the plant, and is ultimately transferred to other parts.|$|E
