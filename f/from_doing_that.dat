2500|$|Following {{the release}} of Freak Out!, the debut album of the rock band the Mothers of Invention, Capitol Records A {{representative}} Nick Venet commissioned an album of orchestral music composed by the Mothers of Invention's leader, Frank Zappa, a self-taught composer. Venet spent $40,000 on the album. Because Zappa's contract with Verve and MGM Records did not allow for him to perform on albums recorded for any other label, he could not play any instrument on the proposed album, and instead served as the conductor of an orchestra consisting of session musicians hired for the recording. Zappa states that [...] "my contract [...] did not preclude me <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> I wasn't signed as a conductor." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 28, 2000, Aguilera {{announced}} her first tour, whick kicked off on July 31, 2000 and would hit 37 cities (and {{a total of}} 81 shows). The tour was sponsored by Sears and Levi's. Aguilera released a statement about the tour, saying: [...] "Headlining my own tour means creative control and a high-energy, let-loose show. It's designed with my band and dancers to be a visually exciting mix of my big hits and some special surprises," [...] said Christina. [...] "Plus, my sponsors, Sears and Levi's, are giving fans lots of ways {{to get involved with}} the tour, like exclusive CDs and posters, a chance to win a backstage pass to hang with me and a cause-related program called 'Come On Over and Do Something' that was created specifically for the tour." [...] About the tour's setlist, she claimed, [...] "I'll be doing songs from my debut album. But I've changed so much <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> at 17, so we'll put a whole new twist on things from my album. â€¦ There {{will be a lot of}} blues and soul inflections, which is what I've wanted to do more of for a long time." [...] One feature of the shows she described involved getting the crowd excited with her hit [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] and then switching to a piano-and-vocal-only song by her hero, blues legend Etta James.|$|E

60|$|Returning to the poet's {{conception}} of Agamemnon, {{we find in}} the character of Agamemnon himself the key to the difficulties which critics discover in the Second Book. The difficulty is that when Zeus, won over to the cause of Achilles by Thetis, sends a false Dream to Agamemnon, the Dream tells the prince that he shall at once take Troy, and bids him summon the host to arms. But Agamemnon, far <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> summons the host to a peaceful assembly, with the well-known results of demoralisation.|$|E

"I am afraid," [...] {{said the}} speaker, gazing kindly at him, [...] "that I {{do not always}} express myself plainly to the general comprehension, but what I mean is this: that during the time we stay here, let {{each one of us}} do exactly what he or she wants to do, without {{considering}} other people at all, except, of course, that we must not do anything which would interfere with any of the others doing what they please. For instance--and I assure you I have thought over this matter in all its details--if any of us were inclined to swear or behave disorderly, which I am sure could not be the case, he or she would not do so because he or she would feel that, being responsible to himself or herself, that responsibility would prevent him or her <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> which would interfere with the pleasure or comfort of his or her associates." ...|$|E
60|$|One {{young man}} of my acquaintance, who has {{inherited}} some acres, {{told me that he}} thought he should live as I did, if he had the means. I would not have any one adopt my mode of living on any account; for, beside that before he has fairly learned it I may have found out another for myself, I desire that there may be as many different persons in the world as possible; but I would have each one be very careful to find out and pursue his own way, and not his father's or his mother's or his neighbor's instead. The youth may build or plant or sail, only let him not be hindered <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> which he tells me he would like to do. It is by a mathematical point only that we are wise, as the sailor or the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his eye; but that is sufficient guidance for all our life.

6000|$|And Christian men {{are apt to}} do so also, as well {{as those}} old heathens. They feel that they are very mysterious and {{wonderful}} beings themselves, simply because they are men. They say to themselves: [...] "How strange that I should have a body of flesh and blood, and appetites and passions, like the animals, and yet that I should have an immortal spirit in me. How strange this notion of duty which I have, and which the other animals have not; this notion of its being right to do some things, and wrong to <b>do</b> others! <b>From</b> whence <b>did</b> <b>that</b> notion come? And again, this strange notion which I have, and cannot help having, that I ought to be like God: and yet I do not know what God is like. <b>From</b> whence <b>did</b> <b>that</b> notion come?" ...|$|R
60|$|Do {{you think}} that God gave the woman her hair, that she might deck herself, and set off her fleshly beauty therewith? It was given her to cover her face with, in token of shame and silence, for that by the woman sin {{came into the world}} (1 Tim 2:9). And perhaps the reason why the angels cover their faces when they cry, Holy, Holy, Holy, in heaven, is to shew that they still bear in mind, with a kind of abhorrence, the remembrance of their fellows falling from thence. Modesty, and shame-facedness, becomes women at all times, {{especially}} in times of public worship, and the more of this is mixed with their grace and personage, the more beautiful they are both to God and men. But why must the women have shame-facedness, since they live honestly as the men? I answer, In remembrance of the fall of Eve, and to that the apostle applies it. For a woman, necessity has no law, to shave her head, and to look with open face in worship, as if she could be a leader there, is so far <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> which becomes her, that it declares her to have forgot what God would have her for ever with shame remember.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning he walked into Silverbridge and called at Miss Prettyman's house. As he went along his heart was warmer towards Grace than it had ever been before. He had told himself that he was now bound to abstain, for his father's sake, <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> which he had told his father that he would certainly do. But he knew also, that he had said that which, though it did not bind him to Miss Crawley, gave her {{a right to expect}} that he would so bind himself. And Miss Prettyman could not but be aware of what his intention had been, and could not but expect that he should now be explicit. Had he been a wise man altogether, he would probably have abstained from saying anything at the present moment,--a wise man, that is, in the ways and feelings of the world in such matters. But, as there are men who will allow themselves all imaginable latitude in their treatment of women, believing that the world will condone any amount of fault of that nature, so are there other men, and a class of men which on the whole is the more numerous of the two, who are tremblingly alive to the danger of censure on this head,--and to the danger of censure not only from others, but from themselves also. Major Grantly had done that which made him think it imperative upon him to do something further, and to do that something at once.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are certain}} things follow {{naturally}} from this remote concentration, and we must persistently keep them in mind. These men of exceptional mental quality, if they are really {{to do what they}} are specially fitted to do, with all their power, will be unable to give their personal affairs, their personal advancement, sustained attention. In a democratic community whose principle is [...] "hustle," [...] in a leisurely monarchy where only opulence, a powerful top-note, and conspicuous social gifts succeed, they will have either to neglect or taint their special talent in order to survive. It does not follow that because a man's special qualities and inclinations are towards, let us say, illuminating inquiries into the constitution of matter, or profound and beautiful or simply beautiful renderings of his individual vision of life, that he is indifferent to or independent of honour, of all the freedoms to do and to rest <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> come with wealth, or of the many lures and pleasures of life. Posthumous Fame is losing its attractiveness in an age which has discovered excellent reasons for doubting whether after all Ã¦re perennius was not rather too strong a figure. However powerful the impulse to think, to state and create, there comes a point--often a point a long way from starvation-- at which a genius will stop working. Your man of scientific, literary, or artistic genius will not work below his conception of the endurable minimum, the minimum of hope and honour and attention as well as of material things, any more than a coal-heaver will--and we live in a period when the Standard of Life tends to rise. To secure these things which most men make the entire objective of their lives is, or should be, an irrelevancy to the man of exceptional gifts. This means an enormous handicap for him. Unless, therefore, we endow him and make life easy for him so long as he does his proper work, he will have either to pervert his powers more or less completely to these irrelevant ends, or if his powers do not admit of such perversion, he will have no use for them whatever. He will take some subordinate place in the world as a rather less than average man and, it may be, find the leisure to give just an amateurish ineffectual expression of the thing he might have been.|$|E
