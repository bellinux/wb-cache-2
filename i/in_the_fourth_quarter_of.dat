Denver passed an initiative <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11-member review panel to monitor the city's compliance with the 2005 ordinance.

5|$|In the 1961–62 NBA season, {{the aging}} Cousy {{slowly began to}} fade statistically, {{averaging}} 15.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists, and was voted into the All-NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations. Still, he enjoyed a satisfying postseason, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4–3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title. Finally, in the 1962–63 NBA season, {{the last of his}} career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination. In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4–2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench.
