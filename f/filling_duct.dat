40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the ultrasonographic and mammographic features of intraductal breast masses {{that may be}} associated with malignancy. Patients and methods: We compared US and mammographic findings with the histopathology in 198 patients with 251 intraductal breast masses. The radiologist assessed US features of the mass, its distance from the nipple, the pattern of <b>duct</b> <b>filling</b> by the mass, whether the mass involved the branch ducts and the presence of abnormal axillary lymph nodes. The mammograms were assessed for the presence of a mass, calcifications, a mass with calcifications and asymmetry. Results: Histopathology revealed 46 malignant masses (18. 3 %) and 205 benign masses (81. 7 %). Malignant masses were larger than benign masses, have greater distance from the nipple, commonly <b>filled</b> the <b>duct</b> completely, extended outside the duct, and involved branch duct whereas benign masses commonly <b>filled</b> the <b>duct</b> incompletely and none extended outside the duct or involved branch duct.

40|$|Purpose: Diffusion MRI is {{frequently}} {{used to assess}} prostate cancer. The prostate consists of cellular tissue surrounding fluid <b>filled</b> <b>ducts.</b> Here, the diffusion properties of the ductal fluid alone were studied. Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate ductal residence times to determine whether ducts {{can be regarded as}} forming a separate compartment and whether ductal radius could determine the ADC of the ductal fluid. Methods: Random walks were simulated in cavities. Average residence times were estimated for permeable cavities. Signal reductions resulting from application of a Stejskal-Tanner pulse sequence were calculated in impermeable cavities. Simulations were repeated for cavities of different radii and different diffusion times. Results: Residence times are at least comparable with diffusion times even in relatively high grade tumours. ADCs asymptotically approach theoretical limiting values. At large radii and short diffusion times, ADCs are similar to free diffusion. At small radii and long diffusion times, ADCs are reduced towards zero, and kurtosis approaches a value of - 1. 2. Conclusions: Restricted diffusion in cavities of similar sizes to prostate ducts may reduce ductal ADCs. This may contribute to reductions in total ADC seen in prostate cancer...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 112 - 113) This experimental thesis {{was directed}} towards providing new {{insight into the}} characterization of the fluid and thermal behavior of metal foam. The study focused on the thermal characteristics of aluminum metal foams over a range of pores per inch values at different mass flow rates of air under steady state conditions. After measuring the permeability of the various metal foams based on the modified Darcy equation, the thermal characteristics of the foams were studied {{and the results were}} correlated with the dimensionless Nusselt and Reynolds numbers. The experimental results were then compared with other studies reported in the literature. The Nusselt number-Reynolds number curves from this study compared favorably to those of Boomsma et al???s[15 and Salas et al[16]. However a similar comparison with Tzeng[17 and Calmidi[18] showed rather weak agreement where the data trends were consistent but the values differed by as much as a factor of two. Following the data comparisons, the tradeoff of improved heat transfer in a <b>duct</b> <b>filled</b> with foam as compared to a duct without foam was made based on the data collected. However the Reynolds analogy equation when applied to the foam <b>filled</b> <b>duct,</b> as expected only seems to hold when the pore diameter is used as the characteristic length in the definition of the coefficient of friction. Finally as a corollary to the Reynolds analogy discussion, the increase in the power required creating the flow of air through the foam was compared with the resulting increase in the heat transfer between the duct walls and the air passing through the foam. Results, as expected, show {{a significant increase in the}} required compressor power in order to force the air through the foam heat exchanger. These results compared favorably with those of Boomsma[15]. Suggestions for areas where further work needed were also made...|$|R

Thus although PLCs are used to control and monitor all manner of intricate equipment, simple hardware interlocks and relief devices provide basic protection against component failure, control failure, or inappropriate control operation. Nevertheless, this report includes two observations as follows: (1) It may be prudent to reconfigure the link between the Pyrotronics system and the HVAC system such that the Pyrotronics system provides interlocks to the ventilation fans instead of control inputs to the uncertified HVAC PLCs.

40|$|Highly porous {{sintered}} metal fiber structures {{have been prepared}} from melt extracted aluminum base alloy fibers. To this end, a liquid phase sintering approach was developed. Thermodynamic calculations were used to identify suitable amounts of alloying elements and optimum sintering conditions. In this paper, the manufacturing process is described and heat transfer properties are reported for air-flow through a sintered aluminum fiber core sandwich. S The measurements can {{be compared with the}} well known analytical results for the friction coefficient (X = 64 /Re) and heat transfer (Nu = f(Re,Pr)) for an unfilled duct of equal dimensions. This comparison shows that the pressure drop of the fiber <b>filled</b> <b>duct</b> is approximately 25, 000 times larger than that of the empty duct whereas the heat transfer is increased by a factor of only 7 to 14 as compared to the empty duct. These results have to be interpreted very carefully as in all measurements the outlet temperature was very close to the heated wall temperature, indicating that for the given conditions the system is 'oversized'. This means that heat transfer from the walls to the fluid is better than required and the system could be optimized by a number of different measures such as - lowering the surface density by increasing the porosity and/or increasing the fiber diameter -lowering the absolute internal surface by minimizing the length of the duct. The results presented here are the first of a large measurement campaign intended to characterize the heat transfer behavior of sintered fiber structures made from short melt extracted fibers.

The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate a previously developed classification system and to test the hypothesis that the pancreatic duct can be involved in PSC. METHODS: Two observers scored 132 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) from established PSC patients. From 30 patients, subsequent ERCPs were scored and compared with the initial ERCPs. The pancreatic duct was judged with regard to morphologic abnormalities. RESULTS: The classification system was applicable in 107 patients. In 10 ERCPs (7. 6 %), no clear intrahepatic abnormalities were found; 15 other ERCPs (11. 4 %) did not show extrahepatic abnormalities. In 30 cases, a subsequent ERCP was judged. The difference in scoring between the initial and the subsequent ERCPs was statistically significant, with the subsequent ERCP having higher intrahepatic and extrahepatic scores.

40|$|Pancreatic HCO 3 − {{and fluid}} {{secretion}} were studied by monitoring luminal pH (pHL) and luminal volume simultaneously in interlobular duct segments isolated from guinea-pig pancreas. The secretory rate and HCO 3 − flux were estimated from fluorescence images obtained following microinjection of BCECF-dextran (70 kDa, 20 μM) into the <b>duct</b> lumen. <b>Ducts</b> <b>filled</b> initially with a Cl−-rich solution swelled steadily (2. 0 nl min− 1 mm− 2) when HCO 3 − 2 /CO was introduced, and the luminal pH increased to 8. 08. When Cl− {{was replaced by}} glucuronate, spontaneous fluid secretion was reduced by 75 %, and pHL did not rise above 7. 3. Cl−-dependent spontaneous secretion was largely blocked by luminal H 2 DIDS (500 μM). We conclude that, in unstimulated ducts, HCO 3 − transport across the luminal membrane is probably mediated by Cl−-HCO 3 − exchange. Secretin (10 nM) and forskolin (1 μM) both stimulated HCO 3 − and fluid secretion. The final value of pHL (8. 4) {{and the increase in}} secretory rate (1. 5 nl min− 1 mm− 2) after secretin stimulation were unaffected by substitution of Cl−. The Cl−-independent component of secretin-evoked secretion was not affected by luminal H 2 DIDS. This suggests that a Cl−-independent mechanism provides the main pathway for luminal HCO 3 − transport in secretin-stimulated <b>ducts.</b> <b>Ducts</b> <b>filled</b> initially with a HCO 3 −-rich fluid (125 mM HCO 3 −, 23 mM Cl−) secreted a Cl−-rich fluid while unstimulated.

The analysis considers the distinguished double limit in which the Reynolds number Re/sub a/=Re/sub j/epsiv for the final downstream flow is of order unity, when four different regions can be identified in the flow field. Near the entrance, the outer confinement exerts a negligible influence on the incoming jet, which develops as a slender unconfined jet with constant momentum flux. The jet entrains outer fluid, inducing a slow backflow motion of the surrounding fluid near the backstep. Further downstream, the jet grows to <b>fill</b> the <b>duct,</b> exchanging momentum with the surrounding recirculating flow in a slender region where the Reynolds number is still of the order of Re/sub j/. The streamsurface bounding the toroidal vortex eventually intersects the outer wall, in a non-slender transition zone to the final downstream region of parallel streamlines. In the region of jet development, and also in the main region of recirculating flow, the boundary-layer approximation can be used to describe the flow, while the full Navier-Stokes equations are needed to describe the outer region surrounding the jet and the final transition region, with Re/sub a/=Re/sub j/epsiv entering as the relevant parameter to characterize the resulting non-slender flows...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{approach to}} modeling transient, compressible fluid flow with heat transfer in long, narrow ducts is presented. The primary {{application of the}} model is for analyzing fluid flow and heat transfer in solid propellant rocket motor nozzle joints during motor start-up, but the approach is relevant {{to a wide range}} of analyses involving rapid pressurization and <b>filling</b> of <b>ducts.</b> Fluid flow is modeled through solution of the spatially one-dimensional, transient Euler equations. Source terms are included in the governing equations to account for the effects of wall friction and heat transfer. The equation solver is fully-implicit, thus providing greater flexibility than an explicit solver. This approach allows for resolution of pressure wave effects on the flow as well as for fast calculation of the steady-state solution when a quasi-steady approach is sufficient. Solution of the one-dimensional Euler equations with source terms significantly reduces computational run times compared to general purpose computational fluid dynamics packages solving the Navier-Stokes equations with resolved boundary layers. In addition, conjugate heat transfer is more readily implemented using the approach described in this paper than with most general purpose computational fluid dynamics packages. The compressible flow code has been integrated with a transient heat transfer solver to analyze heat transfer between the fluid and surrounding structure. Conjugate fluid flow and heat transfer solutions are presented. The author is unaware of any previous work available in the open literature which uses the same approach described in this paper...|$|R

Other uncommon presentations have been described, such as uni- or multifocal spindle-shaped dilatations of the intrahepatic bile <b>ducts</b> <b>filled</b> with gallstones, secondary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Conclusion This review focuses on MR features related to ABCB 4 /MDR 3 mutations. Main Messages • LPAC syndrome is characterised by intrahepatic microlithiasis or intrahepatic hyperechogenic foci. • Ultrasound examination is very accurate in detecting intrahepatic stones. • At MR imaging, LPAC syndrome is associated with vari-ous presentations...|$|R
40|$|Concrete is {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} construction material. Apart from the fresh and early age properties of concrete material, its condition during the structure life span affects the overall structural performance. Therefore, development of techniques such as non-destructive testing which enable {{the investigation of the}} material condition, are in great demand. Tomography technique has become an increasingly popular non-destructive evaluation technique for civil engineers to assess the condition of concrete structures. In the present study, this technique is investigated by developing reconstruction procedures utilizing different parameters of elastic waves, namely the travel time, wave amplitude, wave frequency, and Q-value. In the development of algorithms, a ray tracing feature was adopted {{to take into account the}} actual non-linear propagation of elastic waves in concrete containing defects. Numerical simulation accompanied by experimental verifications of wave motion were conducted to obtain wave propagation profiles in concrete containing honeycomb as a defect and in assessing the tendon <b>duct</b> <b>filling</b> of pre-stressed concrete (PC) elements. The detection of defects by the developed tomography reconstruction procedures was evaluated and discussed...|$|R
