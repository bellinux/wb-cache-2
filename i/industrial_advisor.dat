Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling of oxygen injection strategies was performed during the quarter resulting in data that suggest the oxygen injection reduces NOx emissions while reducing LOI. Pilot-scale testing activities concluded at the University of Utah this quarter. Testing demonstrated that some experimental conditions can lead to NOx emissions well below the 0. 15 lb/MMBtu limit. Evaluation of alternative OTM materials with improved mechanical properties continued this quarter. Powder procedure optimization continued and sintering trial began on an element with a new design. Several OTM elements were tested in Praxair's single tube high-pressure test facility under various conditions. A modified PSO 1 d element demonstrated stable oxygen product purity of > 98 % and oxygen flux of 68 % of target. Updated test results and projected economic performance have been reviewed with the Utility <b>Industrial</b> <b>Advisors.</b> The economic comparison remains very favorable for O{sub 2 } enhanced combustion. Discussions regarding possible Beta sites have been held with three other utilities {{in addition to the}} <b>industrial</b> <b>advisors.</b> Proposals will be prepared after the completion of full scale burner testing.

5000|$|Though Chamberlain was {{inclined}} to give the most hopeful impressions on the post Bad Godesberg situation, {{the majority of the}} Cabinet led by the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, who was himself influenced in his Damascene Road conversion by the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, Sir Alexander Cadogan, were for rejecting the Bad Godesberg ultimatum as unacceptable. Germany's increased demands were formally rejected on 25 September 1938. To further underline the point, Sir Horace Wilson, the British government's Chief <b>Industrial</b> <b>Advisor,</b> and a close associate of Chamberlain was dispatched to Berlin to inform Hitler that if the Germans attacked Czechoslovakia, then France would honour her commitments under the Franco-Czechoslovak treaty of 1924 and [...] "then England would feel honour bound, to offer France assistance.". Thus, as Chamberlain himself noted after 25 September 1938 the world was about to be plunged into war over the question of the timing of the change-over of the frontier posts. Hitler insisted in his Bad Godesberg ultimatum that the Sudetenland be ceded to Germany no later then 1 October 1938 whereas the Anglo-French plan Chamberlain had presented, and Hitler had rejected called for the ceding of the Sudetenland within the next six months. In reference to question of the timing of the turnover of the Sudetenland and trenches being dug in a London central park, Chamberlain infamously declared in a radio broadcast on 27 September 1938:"How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing.... I am myself a man of peace to the depths of my soul".|$|E

5000|$|By {{the summer}} of 1939, if Chamberlain did not welcome the {{prospect}} of war, {{there was a feeling}} that it was the best time to force Hitler into a settlement, and if that was impossible then it was the best time to wage war because of the economic problems associated with British rearmament. The Board of Trade's Oliver Stanley advised his Cabinet colleagues in July 1939 that [...] "There would, therefore, come a moment which, on a balance of our financial strength and strength in armaments, was the best time for war to break out". Though Chamberlain was firmly determined to resist aggression, he had not abandoned the prospect of appeasement and peaceful revision; in the talks in London between the British Government's Chief <b>Industrial</b> <b>Advisor,</b> Sir Horace Wilson (who was a close friend and associate of Chamberlain) and Helmut Wohlat of the Four Year Plan Office in July 1939, Wilson made clear that provided Hitler abandoned his aggressive course against Poland, London would be willing to discuss the peaceful return of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, colonial restoration, economic concessions, disarmament and an Anglo-German commitment to refrain from war against one another, all of which was of absolutely no significance to Hitler. In {{the summer of}} 1939, there were desperate attempts to avert a war by various amateur diplomats such as Göring's deputy Wohltat, Sir Horace Wilson, the newspaper proprietor Lord Kemsley, together with would-be peace-makers like the Swedish businessmen Axel Wenner-Gren and Birger Dahlerus, who served as couriers between Hermann Göring (who had some private doubts about the wisdom of Hitler's policies, and was anxious to see a compromise solution) and various British officials. All efforts at a compromise solution were doomed because Chamberlain demanded as the precondition that Hitler abandon war against Poland as an option, and Hitler was absolutely determined to have a war with Poland. For Chamberlain, war remained the worst-case outcome to the Polish crisis, but he was determined to make a forceful British stand in favour of Poland, leading hopefully to a negotiated settlement of the Danzig crisis, which would result in a British diplomatic victory that would hopefully deter Hitler from a policy of force.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the usual}} case a PhD student is {{enrolled}} and supervised at an academic faculty, in Sweden also most often employed at {{a department of}} the university. The whole doctoral education takes part in one single environment. Younger universities in Sweden {{have the opportunity to}} enroll “classes” of industrial PhD students in industrial graduate schools. The PhD student is in these cases most often employed by a company, in some cases by a research institute. Each PhD student has at least one academic supervisor, but also an industrial mentor. Sometimes the industrial mentor also holds a PhD and can formally also be an <b>industrial</b> <b>advisor</b> or co-supervisor. Even if the funding of the PhD student is a research project, the doctoral work is often not performed as a project. There are often severe delays of the dissertation.  The public defense often happens a year or so after the funded time period. Delays represent a large cost for the university (when the student is employed there) or for the company (in the case of industrial PhD students). There is a large risk for the company that the effort will not pay off entirely. The progression of the student lies outside the control of both the university management and the funding company. It is more {{in the hands of the}} supervisor and the student him/herself. We have conducted a case study to explore the organizing of PhD work with the purpose to describe whether project methodology could or could not support progress of industrial PhD students towards a PhD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Construction Management Program (CMP) {{curriculum}} {{content is}} typically derived from institutional and program mission, historical evolution, accreditation criteria, and student, faculty, and industrial advisory inputs. Accreditation bodies assure that {{critical thinking and}} communication skills are delivered and/or content is delivered in broad topical areas. Accreditation emphasis is upon Program Educational Objectives (PEO) and their measurement. This paper challenges that practice. What are the PEOs based upon? How does a CMP ensure that critical and basic industrial competencies are delivered to students? How does a program track and control the teaching and delivery of these competencies amidst ever changing institutional requirements and individual course changes? This paper proposes that {{the answer lies in}} developing sets of competencies from industrial workflow processes which can then map a course or program’s objectives and outcomes. With critical and analytical thinking underlying the entirety of the educational objectives, this system can be modularized for allocating competencies across the curriculum (courses). The premise of the paper’s proposed model is as follows: Define and validate the work-flow processes of the industry segment, group these defined processes into modules for organizational and classification purposes, define the competencies required to accomplish the modules (industrial processes), develop course and program objectives based upon the competencies, then measure outcomes. This paper is of benefit to Construction Management Program directors, faculty and <b>industrial</b> <b>advisors</b> involved in developing course and curriculum content as it can be applied at the program or course levels. The technique provides a systematic method to allocate and track the scope of course and program competencies...|$|R
