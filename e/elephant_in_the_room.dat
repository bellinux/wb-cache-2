5|$|The sad elephant, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant {{for a short period}} of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Australian {{producer}} Ian Collie {{produced a}} documentary film on P. L. Travers titled The Shadow of [...] "Mary Poppins". During the documentary's production, Collie {{noticed that there}} was [...] "an obvious biopic there" [...] and convinced Essential Media and Entertainment to develop a feature film with Sue Smith writing the screenplay. The project {{attracted the attention of}} BBC Films, which decided to finance the project, and Ruby Films' Alison Owen, who subsequently hired Kelly Marcel to co-write the screenplay with Smith. Marcel's drafts removed a subplot involving Travers and her son, and divided the story into a two-part narrative: the creative conflict between Travers and Walt Disney, and her dealings with her childhood issues, describing it as [...] "a story about the pain of a little girl who suffered, and the grown woman who allowed herself to let go". Marcel's version, however, featured certain intellectual property rights of music and imagery which would be impossible to use without permission from The Walt Disney Company. [...] "There was always that <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> which is Disney," [...] Collie recalled. [...] "We knew Walt Disney was a key character in the film and we wanted to use quite a bit of the music. We knew we'd eventually have to show Disney." [...] In early 2010, Robert B. Sherman provided producer Alison Owen with an advance copy of a salient chapter from his then upcoming book release, [...] [...] The chapter entitled, [...] "'Tween Pavement and Stars" [...] contained characterizations and anecdotes which proved seminal to Marcel's script rewrite, in particular, the anecdote about there not being the color red in London. In July 2011, while attending the Ischia Film Festival, Owen met with Corky Hale, who offered to present the screenplay to Richard M. Sherman. Sherman read the screenplay and gave the producers his support. Later that year, Marcel and Smith's screenplay was listed in Franklin Leonard's The Black List, voted by producers {{as one of the best}} screenplays that were not in production.|$|E

2500|$|By 1934, Durante {{had a major}} record {{hit with}} his own novelty composition, [...] "Inka Dinka Doo", with lyrics by Ben Ryan. It became his theme song {{for the rest of}} his life.

This comedy bit, also reprised in his role in Billy Rose's Jumbo, likely contributed to the popularity of the idiom the <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Durante also appeared on Broadway in Show Girl (1929), Strike Me Pink (1934) and Red, Hot and Blue (1936).|$|E

And then it kind of grew from there, thinking about death… some people are drawn towards it, and just like a magnet, and other people are afraid of it and push. Also the concept that we're all gonna die sometimes is over-talked about and then a lot of times never talked about — no one wants to bring it up; it's <b>the</b> big white <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living <b>room.</b> But we all have to deal with it at some point.|$|R

40|$|Tokenization {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a solved problem due to the high accuracy that rule-based tokenizers achieve. But rule-based tokenizers are hard to maintain and their rules language specific. Like an <b>elephant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living <b>room,</b> it is a problem that is impossible to overlook whenever new raw datasets need to be processed or when tokenization conventions are reconsidered. It is moreover an important problem, because any errors occurring early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pipeline affect further analysis negatively. We believe that regarding tokenization, there is still room for improvement, <b>in</b> particular on <b>the</b> methodological side of the task. We are particularly interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following questions: Can we use supervised learning to avoid hand-crafting rules? Can we use unsupervised feature learning to reduce feature engineering effort and boost performance? Can we use the same method across languages? Can we combine word and sentence boundary detection into one task...|$|R
