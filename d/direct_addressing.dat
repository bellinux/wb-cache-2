40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze Russian <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> forms, both the {{distinct}} truncated vocative and nominative-case <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> forms. I contrast the formal and functional {{restrictions on the}} truncated vocative with vocatives in other languages (e. g. Czech and Polish), and I compare the interpolation of Russian <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> forms in an utterance {{to the situation in}} English. While similarities are found both in the form and the usage of Russian <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> forms with those in other languages, the prosodic and syntactic constraints in English are considerably stronger than in Russian, which means that the punctuating function of <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> forms is considerably more flexible in Russian than in English...|$|R

40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>address</b> {{in theater}} for {{children}} is a unique and remarkable convention unlike anything commonly seen in adult theater. Where an adult audience prefers to sit in silence during a performance, perhaps showing appreciation occasionally with applause or cheering, a youth audience is constantly expressing their responses vocally, and if spoken to by the performers {{it is more than}} likely that they will talk right back. This project explores why and how a young person experiences theater differently, and why this lends itself favorably to <b>direct</b> <b>address.</b> I investigated how frequently <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> is being used in Los Angeles children?s theater and how it is made effective and ineffective through my attending and analyzing productions in the area and through my work this summer as a company member in the Occidental Children?s Theater. I found that the majority of LA children?s theater did indeed incorporate some or many forms of <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> and even audience participation to engage their young audiences to varying degrees of success. <b>Direct</b> <b>address</b> is an art, and numerous factors ranging from the performances to the blocking to the physical nature of the performance space can affect its effectiveness. This project explores these contributing factors and how they affected my own performance in the children?s theater as well as the performances I viewed as a spectator...|$|R

40|$|Sixteenth-century audiences {{expected}} to be spoken to. <b>Direct</b> <b>address</b> had {{always been part of}} their theatrical experience, always enmeshed in the ways stories were told and spectators made sense of the action. In the transitional years between 1585 and 1595 playwrights experimented with the devices of monologue, soliloquy and aside, none more so than Marlowe, whose plays offered new ways for players to speak to the audience and for the audience to engage with the action on stage. <b>Direct</b> <b>address</b> is yet another aspect of Marlowe's transformation of the popular drama: the refashioning of cultural and, importantly, theatrical traditions that underpin the "mighty line" and the spectacle, the astounding heroes and the disturbing ideas. This essay looks at some of Marlowe's innovations to <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> in the context of earlier and contemporary plays from the 1560 s to the mid 1590 s. After considering some definitions and surveying the traditional uses of <b>direct</b> <b>address,</b> I argue that Marlowe's plays transformed the soliloquy and liberated the aside. And the revolution began with The Jew of Malta...|$|R

50|$|The two {{addressing}} modes Indirect register, and Indirect register with auto-increment are then fairly efficient, to perform 8-bit operations {{on the data}} in the accumulator. There are no other {{addressing modes}}, though. Thus, the <b>direct</b> <b>addressing</b> mode needs to be emulated using the four instructions mentioned earlier to load the address into a spare register; followed by an instruction to select that register as the index register; followed, finally, by the intended operation on the data variable that is pointed to by that address.|$|E
50|$|Each 4K {{of memory}} {{was called a}} field. The Memory Extension Controller {{contained}} two three-bit registers: the DF (Data Field) and the IF (Instruction Field). These registers specified a field for each memory reference of the CPU, allowing a total of 15 bits of address. The IF register specified the field for instruction fetches and direct memory references; the DF register specified the field for indirect data accesses. A program running in one field could reference data in the same field by <b>direct</b> <b>addressing,</b> and reference data in another field by indirect addressing.|$|E

50|$|Communication {{can happen}} {{right after the}} association. <b>Direct</b> <b>addressing</b> uses both radio address and {{endpoint}} identifier, whereas indirect addressing uses every relevant field (address, endpoint, cluster, and attribute) and requires that they are sent to the network coordinator, which maintains associations and translates requests for communication. Indirect addressing is particularly useful to keep some devices very simple and minimize their need for storage. Besides these two methods, broadcast to all endpoints in a device is available, and group addressing is used to communicate with groups of endpoints belonging {{to a set of}} devices.|$|E
50|$|Another {{very simple}} {{implementation}} technique, usable when the keys {{are restricted to}} a narrow range of integers, is <b>direct</b> <b>addressing</b> into an array: the value for a given key k is stored at the array cell Ak, or {{if there is no}} binding for k then the cell stores a special sentinel value that indicates the absence of a binding. As well as being simple, this technique is fast: each dictionary operation takes constant time. However, the space requirement for this structure is the size of the entire keyspace, making it impractical unless the keyspace is small.|$|E

All of memory is also directly addressable through a feature, called <b>direct</b> <b>addressing,</b> that combines the twelve bit displacement and the low-order bits of what would normally be the base register field of the instruction (R0-R7) to form a combined fifteen bit address. No storage protection is provided, except for the low 144 bytes of [...] "protected area".|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a short {{presentation}} of the vocative phrase in European Portuguese, to which very {{little attention has been}} paid in the literature. The main contribution of this paper is the argument that certain pragmatic markers involved in <b>direct</b> <b>addresses</b> should be considered for their syntactic function within the vocative phrase, rather than being treated as independent interjections. In this respect, the data allow me to draw the reader’s attention to the grammaticalization process that produces such pragmatic markers. The presentation of the vocative phrase in European Portuguese is organized according to the way it encodes the pragmatic features of the <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> in this language. As the encoding of the <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> is cross-linguistically diverse, this presentation will allow linguists who work on vocatives in other languages to exploit my European Portuguese data for comparative studies in pragmatics or in morpho-syntax...|$|R

50|$|For DEC, none of {{the three}} would be favorably received, and the {{industry}} instead standardized on Intel 8088-based IBM PC compatibles which were all binary program compatible with each other. In some ways, the PDP-11 microprocessors were technically superior to the Intel-based chips. While the 8088 was restricted to 1MB of memory because of its 20-bit address bus, DEC microprocessors were capable of accessing 4MB with their 22-bit addressing (although <b>direct</b> <b>addressing</b> of memory was limited in both approaches to 64KB segments, limiting the size of individual code and data objects). But other factors would weigh more heavily in the competition, including DEC's corporate culture and business model, which were ill-suited to the rapidly developing consumer market for computers. BYTE in 1984 reported that Venix on the PC outperformed the same operating system on the DEC Professional and PDP-11/23.|$|E
50|$|The JR-200 {{did not use}} Microsoft BASIC, but its own dialect, {{one that}} was {{designed}} to be mostly compatible with Microsoft BASIC. JR-BASIC was a greatly extended Basic, with, (for example) graphical commands such as COLOR, (which selected character color, background color and display mode) and PLOT which permitted <b>direct</b> <b>addressing</b> of the low resolution graphics mode (64×48, using text semigraphics characters, which represented pixel blocks that used one-quarter of each character). Eight colors were available for the background and foreground use: blue, red, magenta, green, cyan, yellow, white and black. By re-programming a part of the character-set a limited high resolution graphics mode was achievable with a resolution of 256×192. The basic also supported on-screen editing and direct execution of basic instructions. the machine came with 32K of RAM, and had 30,716 bytes free for a Basic program. User memory could be expanded to 40K. JR-Basic itself occupied 16K of ROM, while the character set video memory and I/O used another 6K.The JR-200 ROM also contained a machine code monitor to enter and execute machine code programs.|$|E
5000|$|The Motorola 6800 and the Intel 8080 were {{designed}} {{at the same}} time and were similar in function. The 8080 was an extension and enhancement of the Intel 8008, which in turn was an LSI implementation of the TTL-based CPU design used in the Datapoint 2200. The 6800 architecture was modeled after the DEC PDP-11 processor. Both the 8080 and the 6800 were TTL compatible, had an 8-bit bidirectional data bus, a 16-bit stack pointer, a 16-bit address bus that could address 64 KB of memory, and came in a 40-pin DIP package. The 6800 had two accumulators and a 16-bit index register. The <b>direct</b> <b>addressing</b> mode allowed fast access to the first 256 bytes of memory. I/O devices were addressed as memory so there were no special I/O instructions. The 8080 had more internal registers and instructions for dedicated I/O ports. When the 8080 was reset, the program counter was cleared and the processor started at memory location 0000. The 6800 loaded the program counter from the highest address and started at the memory location stored there. The 6800 had a three-state control that would disable the address bus to allow another device direct memory access. A disk controller could therefore transfer data into memory with no load on the processor. It was even possible to have two 6800 processors access the same memory. [...] However, in practice systems of such complexity usually required the use of external bus transceivers to drive the system bus; in such circuits the on-processor bus control was disabled entirely in favor of using the similar capabilities of the bus transceiver. In contrast, the 6802 dispensed with this on-chip control entirely in order to free up pins for other functions in the same 40-pin package as the 6800, but this functionality could still be achieved using an external bus transceiver.|$|E
