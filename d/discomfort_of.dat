5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{methods have}} {{confirmed}} the high prevalence of P. falciparum malaria in ancient Egypt. The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus {{wrote that the}} builders of the Egyptian pyramids (circa 2700–1700 BCE) were given large amounts of garlic, probably to protect them against malaria. The Pharaoh Sneferu, {{the founder of the}} Fourth dynasty of Egypt, who reigned from around 2613–2589 BCE, used bed-nets as protection against mosquitoes. Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, similarly slept under a mosquito net. However, whether the mosquito nets were used for the purpose of malaria prevention, or for more mundane purpose of avoiding the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> mosquito bites, is unknown. The presence of malaria in Egypt from circa 800 BCE onwards has been confirmed using DNA-based methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and many people had left {{the city for the}} country. It was an {{intensely}} hot day, which further reduced the number of people prepared to suffer the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{draw for}} {{the third round of}} the FA Cup saw Manchester United take on cup holders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in a repeat of the 1994 final. The outcome was the same: United {{dominated}} from the outset and Chelsea found themselves 3–0 down {{before the end of the}} first half. Cole and Sheringham added to the rout, before Graeme Le Saux and Gianluca Vialli added three between them for Chelsea to keep the score a competitive one. Many journalists and fans regarded the win as United's best of the season. Another five goals were dished out against Division Two outfit Walsall, and in the fifth round they were placed alongside Premiership strugglers, Barnsley, whom they had ripped apart in October. An error by Schmeichel allowed Barnsley to take the lead but Sheringham equalised four minutes later. A replay was needed, much to the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> Ferguson, and in a thrilling cup tie, United were knocked out, putting the ultimate treble dream – comprising the UEFA Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup – on hold for another season.|$|E

Behavioral traits in social situations such as smiling, easily producing suitable conversational topics, assuming a relaxed posture and making good eye contact, may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.|$|E
25|$|When {{they came}} to his studio to place him under arrest, the police seized {{more than a hundred}} {{drawings}} which they considered pornographic. Schiele was imprisoned while awaiting his trial. When his case was brought before a judge, the charges of seduction and abduction were dropped, but the artist was found guilty of exhibiting erotic drawings in a place accessible to children. In court, the judge burned one of the offending drawings over a candle flame. The twenty-one days he had already spent in custody were taken into account, and he was sentenced to a further three days' imprisonment. While in prison, Schiele created a series of 12 paintings depicting the difficulties and <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> being locked in a jail cell.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday afternoons at 3pm, between May and October, Rosary processions are held. These are {{traditionally}} attended {{by thousands of}} visitors. The rosary {{is led by the}} parish priest, a tradition started by Fr. Taylor and carried on by his successor, Fr. George Mullen (later Canon George Mullen). The priest would stand on the parapet of the Glass Chapel, from which a clear view could be obtained, both of the Grotto itself and of the movement of the procession along the shrine's gravel paths. Each Sunday procession culminated in Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament in the upper Glass Chapel. Many local people remember the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> kneeling in the gravel as children, at the moment of adoration in the Benediction service.|$|E

25|$|The feeding {{was done}} {{through the use}} of specially-constructed small wooden boxes, 4cm by 7cm, {{developed}} by Weigl. The boxes were sealed with paraffin on the top which prevented the lice from escaping, and the underside consisted of a screen made of a fabric sieve, adopted by Weigl from sieves that were used by local peasants to separate wheat husks from the seeds. A typical box contained 400 to 800 lice larvae which would mature as the feeding took place. The sieve bottom allowed the lice to stick out their heads and feed on the human flesh. A standard feeding period took thirty to forty-five minutes, and was repeated with the same lice colony for twelve days. Usually, an individual feeder would accommodate from 7 to 11 boxes (of 400 to 800 lice each) on his or her leg, per feeding session. Typically men would place the boxes on their calves, to minimize the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> the bites, while women feeders placed them on their thighs, so that the bite marks could be covered up by a skirt. A nurse had to watch over the feeding process as the lice would feed beyond the point of being gorged on the blood and could burst if left on the human flesh for too long.|$|E
500|$|If Hugill's {{allegiance}} to Social Credit was incongruous, his {{allegiance to}} Aberhart {{was even more}} so. [...] Aberhart, a radio evangelist, did not share Hugill's taste for fine wines, cigars, or flippant humour. [...] Hugill, for his part, objected to Aberhart's belief in the occult, and in particular to his practice of numerology. [...] About his eventual presence in cabinet, McGill University's J. R. Mallory said [...] "one can imagine the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> an experienced barrister...moderate in his political views and absorbed principally in his departmental duties, confronted by a cabinet of hot gospellers, presided over by the Messianic Mr. Aberhart." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nazi {{influence}} behind Heiter {{led to the}} use {{of classical}} music when the doctor is [...] "training" [...] his centipede. The music was deliberately played at low quality to simulate the music coming from a loudspeaker, {{in much the same way}} as music was sometimes played in Nazi concentration camps. Many of the sound effects in The Human Centipede were created by manipulating meat. For example, the sound of a nose being broken was made by snapping bones within cuts of raw meat. Due to the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> spending long periods on their hands and knees, the actors playing the centipede were given massages at the end of each day of filming. Yennie stated that she and Williams experienced jaw pain from holding a bit in their mouths during filming, but overall she did not feel that the physical side of filming had been excessively difficult.|$|E

500|$|Conquistadors often wore steel armour that {{included}} chainmail and helmets. The Spanish were sufficiently {{impressed by the}} quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. Maya weaponry was not sufficiently powerful to justify the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> wearing European armour. Quilted cotton armour, although still uncomfortably hot, was flexible and weighed much less. The Maya armour was adapted by the Spanish, who used knee-length quilted cotton tunics and Spanish-style caps. Horsemen wore long quilted cotton leg protectors; their horses were also protected with padded cotton armour. After the final push to the Petén lakes in early 1697, the Spanish recorded that they left with their garrison over 50 Dutch- and French-made muskets, three [...] calibre light cannons (piezas) cast from iron and mounted on carriages, four iron and two bronze pedreros (2-chambered stone-launchers) and six of at least eight bronze light cannons (known as esmiriles).|$|E
500|$|The Northern Party {{spent the}} 1911 winter in their hut.

Terra Nova returned from New Zealand on [...] 1912, and transferred the party to the vicinity of Evans Cove, a location approximately [...] south of Cape Adare and [...] northwest of Cape Evans. They were to be picked up on [...] after the completion of further geological work, but due to heavy pack ice, the ship was unable to reach them. The group, with meagre rations which they had to supplement by fish and seal meat, were forced to spend the winter months of 1912 in a snow cave which they excavated on Inexpressible Island. Here they suffered severe privations—frostbite, hunger, and dysentery, with extreme winds and low temperatures, and the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> a blubber stove in confined quarters.|$|E
500|$|When Kirk and Spock are {{traveling}} {{on a public}} bus, they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box, to the <b>discomfort</b> <b>of</b> everyone around him. Spock takes matters {{into his own hands}} and performs a Vulcan nerve pinch. Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy's personal experiences with a similar character on the streets of New York; [...] " [...] by the arrogance of it, the aggressiveness of it, and I thought if I was Spock I'd pinch his brains out!" [...] On learning about the scene, Kirk Thatcher, an associate producer on the film, convinced Nimoy to let him play the role; Thatcher shaved his hair into a mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part. Credited as [...] "punk on bus", Thatcher (along with sound designer Mark Mangini) also wrote and recorded [...] "I Hate You", the song in the scene, and it was his idea to have the punk—rendered unconscious by the pinch—hit the stereo and turn it off with his face.|$|E
