50|$|McGalliard was the {{inventor}} of the Solidstat, a single mount electrical control assembly, and issued a U.S. patent February 8, 1978. The Solidstat is widely used for: resistance <b>heater</b> <b>control,</b> lighting control, motor speed control, pipe heating, tank & kettle heating, laminating press <b>heater</b> <b>control,</b> and medical equipment involving heating, lighting, and temperature controls. A single mounting connection at the potentiometer bushing not only mechanically mounts all of the elements but additionally provides a heat sink connection for the circuit. At the same time, the use of a printed circuit board in the combination permits automated assembly and soldering which substantially reduced the cost of the circuit.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} a concepts, guidelines, a toolset {{and experiences}} with defining and implementing on-line visual displays of software development progress, <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> group sets of measurement visualizations providing a multi-dimensional, integrated view of development status. <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> are developed at various organizational levels, serving the information needs of different stakeholders. Navigation between different <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> enables users to drill down to view more detailed information on, e. g., a particular project {{or on the}} progress of a particular development activity. In the constructive part of the work, I describe concepts, and a toolset {{that can be used for}} defining and implementing <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> In addition, I provide guidelines for grouping measures into <b>control</b> <b>panels,</b> and discuss how measurement programs can be partitioned into <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> The toolset, built as a "proof-of-concept" consists of a central measurement database, a visualization client, and a set of data importers that transfer data from external corporate repositories into the measurement database. The empirical part discusses our efforts to define and implement <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> in four high-technology companies in Finland. Framed in the context of "constructive action research", the cases are first described individually, according to the main steps of the action research cycle, then compared in a cross-case analysis. Our results—we succeeded in implementing <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> in only one of four organizations—indicate that the development of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> requires a substantial investment and commitment by the organization, but that it can be feasible even in small organizations. The main obstacles hindering the implementation were organizational and human in nature, and more related to measurement program implementation in general than to tool support per se. Interestingly, the organizations did not consider measurement definition, i. e., the selection of "metrics" to be problematic. Success factors identified included management commitment, dedicated measurement personnel, and organizational change management. While limited, our experiences with the use of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> show that they were felt to be more valuable by management than by the collocated project personnel. We thus hypothesise that the usefulness of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> increases with project size and geographical distance. In the future it would be interesting to develop <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> for distributed software development projects, in which informal status communication is more difficult. reviewe...|$|R
