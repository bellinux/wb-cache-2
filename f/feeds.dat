Samples were taken at 2, 4, 6, and 8 lb for the Ultra- Drop <b>feed</b> dispenser due to a smaller storage capacity for <b>feed</b> with this <b>feed</b> drop. There were five replications (five drops of each type) at each <b>feed</b> setting.

While a number of aggregate livestock <b>feed</b> demand relationships have been estimated, {{little is known about the}} structure of <b>feed</b> demand by livestock type. In this study unique livestock <b>feed</b> demand relationships for <b>feed</b> grains and total concentrates are estimated for each of seven major livestock categories. The estimated relationships show substantial differences in elasticities of concentrate and <b>feed</b> grain <b>feed</b> demand with respect to <b>feed</b> prices and with respect to livestock price across livestock groups. Using <b>feed</b> demand parameters by livestock category enables analysts to evaluate policy effects of changes in <b>feed</b> demand quantities and <b>feed</b> costs within the livestock economy, as well as to provide more reliable estimates of the total change in <b>feed</b> demand. The demand for <b>feed</b> grains and other <b>feed</b> concentrates {{is a collection}} of demands by various livestock categories.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} social monitoring and <b>feeding</b> competition on foraging success {{in relation to the}} <b>feeding</b> group size of wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). Social monitoring is visual scanning by group members that assists them in following their own group. Individuals in smaller <b>feeding</b> groups may frequently use social monitoring while foraging, because they have an increased risk of losing their group. Therefore, social monitoring could be a cost for group-foraging animals. We made four predictions: (1) individuals in smaller <b>feeding</b> groups tend to abandon food patches to follow group members; (2) social monitoring frequency is higher in smaller <b>feeding</b> groups; (3) <b>feeding</b> rate decreases with increased social monitoring frequency; and (4) <b>feeding</b> rate initially increases with <b>feeding</b> group size because decreased social monitoring outweighs increased <b>feeding</b> competition, but after the <b>feeding</b> group reaches a certain size, <b>feeding</b> rate declines with increasing <b>feeding</b> group size due to the high costs of <b>feeding</b> competition. These predictions were supported by our results.

40|$|<b>Feed</b> {{efficiency}} is a trait of enormous importance in any animal production sector including aquaculture. Individuals {{that are more}} <b>feed</b> efficient need to use less <b>feed</b> to achieve similar growth rates as compared to less efficient individuals. Considering that <b>feed</b> represents the largest cost of production {{and one of the}} main causes for the ecological footprint of a farm, more knowledge on the extent of individual differences in <b>feed</b> efficiency and underlying physiological processes are needed. This study is the first to investigate individual differences in <b>feed</b> efficiency, measured as residual <b>feed</b> intake and its relationship with <b>feeding</b> behaviour and stress response {{in one of the most}} important farmed fish, the Nile tilapia. The individual <b>feed</b> intake of twenty-four juvenile of Nile tilapia was followed during 57 days. Fish were fed until apparent satiation with a commercial <b>feed</b> twice per day. Individual <b>feed</b> behavior was registered once per week and consisted on measuring the latency to start <b>feeding</b> (LAT, min), total <b>feeding</b> time (TFT, min) and the number of <b>feeding</b> acts (NFA, min). Blood samples for plasma cortisol was taken at the end of the experiment (control, indicative of undisturbed levels) and after a stress test (netting), 15 days after the previous sampling. Individual growth rates and residual <b>feed</b> intake were determined at the end of the experiment. Results show pronounced individual differences in residual <b>feed</b> intake as well as a significant correlation with both <b>feeding</b> behavior (<b>feeding</b> latency, total <b>feeding</b> time and number of <b>feeding</b> acts) and stress (cortisol) response. Cortisol levels obtained after the stress test and <b>feeding</b> behavior could explain differences in residual <b>feed</b> intake by 4 %. These results show that individuals with higher <b>feeding</b> activity and higher cortisol response are less efficient fish. This suggests that individual differences in <b>feeding</b> activity and stress response explain part of the differences in <b>feed</b> efficiency by explaining variance in maintenance energy expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryMichael D. TokachFive {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} {{determine the influence of}} creep <b>feeding</b> on individual consumption characteristics and growth performance of neonatal and weanling pigs. These evaluated the effects of lactation <b>feed</b> intake and creep <b>feeding</b> (n = 84 litters; Exp. 1), creep <b>feeding</b> duration (n = 54 litters; Exp. 2), creep feeder design and <b>feed</b> accessibility (n = 54 litters; Exp. 3), organoleptic properties of the creep <b>feed</b> (n = 50 litters; Exp. 4) and creep diet complexity (n = 96 litters; Exp. 5). In summary, creep <b>feeding</b> did not affect preweaning gains and weaning weights of pigs weaned at 3 weeks of age. Creep <b>feeding</b> for 18 d did not influence sow performance. However, creep <b>feeding</b> tended to improve litter weaning weights due to improved survivability. Creep <b>feed</b> consumption was related to piglet maturity rather than the induction of creep <b>feeding.</b> In both experimental and field conditions, pigs that consumed creep <b>feed</b> (eaters) had greater post-weaning <b>feed</b> intake and daily gains compared to non-eaters (pigs that did not consume creep <b>feed)</b> and non-creep fed pigs. This led to improvements in pig weight uniformity and reduction of the severity of post-weaning lag. These benefits were achieved regardless of weaning weight, the complexity of the creep diet, and the duration of creep <b>feeding.</b> The proportion of eaters of creep <b>feed</b> in whole litters can be manipulated. Longer duration of creep <b>feeding</b> increased the proportion of eaters. A rotary creep feeder with a hopper created the most eaters with the lowest creep <b>feed</b> disappearance. Creep diet complexity had the greatest effect in increasing the proportion of pigs consuming creep <b>feed.</b> On the other hand, low <b>feed</b> intake of lactating sows and adding <b>feed</b> flavors to the creep <b>feed</b> did not affect creep <b>feed</b> consumption and the proportion of pigs consuming creep <b>feed.</b> Therefore, creep <b>feeding</b> that focuses in encouraging more suckling piglets to eat is beneficial in producing weanling pigs that are better adapted to weaning, which improves post-weaning performance...|$|R

40|$|Changes in <b>feed</b> intake must {{ultimately}} be mediated {{by changes in}} <b>feeding</b> behavior. It follows, therefore, that increased understanding of dairy cow behavior should allow us to manage and house lactating dairy cows {{so that they can}} maximize their dry matter intake (DMI) and the potential of the ration provided. Our research has shown that dairy cows respond strongly to the delivery of fresh <b>feed</b> and that changing the time of <b>feed</b> delivery changes peak activity at the <b>feed</b> bunk. We have also shown that <b>feed</b> bunk push-ups are important for keeping <b>feed</b> in front of cows but have little effect on stimulating <b>feeding</b> activity. Increasing the frequency of <b>feed</b> delivery, however, does result in greater access to the <b>feed</b> bunk and less <b>feed</b> sorting. The provision of increased bunk space per cow, particularly when combined with <b>feed</b> stalls, results in fewer aggressive interactions and increases access to <b>feed,</b> particularly for subordinate cows. Increased competition at the <b>feed</b> bunk promotes <b>feeding</b> behavior patterns that result in some cows having access to the bunk after <b>feed</b> sorting has occurred, increasing the between-cow variation in diet consumed. Using this knowledge of how dairy cows respond to their <b>feeding</b> management and environment, we can design and manage our <b>feeding</b> systems to allow for improved cow health, production, and welfare...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Feeding</b> {{behavior}} {{study is}} important for animal husbandry and production. However, few studies were conducted on the <b>feeding</b> behavior and their relationship with <b>feeding</b> efficiency in Pekin ducks. In order to investigate the <b>feeding</b> behavior and their relationship with <b>feed</b> efficiency and other economic traits in Pekin ducks, we selected 358 male Pekin ducks and recorded <b>feeding</b> information between 3 to 6 wk of age using automatic electronic feeders, and compared the <b>feeding</b> behavior under different residual <b>feed</b> intake (RFI) levels. Results We observed that total <b>feed</b> time, daily <b>feed</b> intake and <b>feed</b> intake per meal had strong positive correlations with <b>feed</b> efficiency traits; moreover, strong correlation between <b>feed</b> intake per meal and body weight was found (R= 0. 32, 0. 36). Daily <b>feeding</b> rate meal and meal duration had weak correlations with <b>feed</b> efficiency (R= 0. 14 ~ 0. 15). The phenotypic correlation of between-meal pauses, with <b>feed</b> efficiency was not observed. When daily changes were analyzed, high RFI ducks had the highest <b>feed</b> consumption over all times, and obvious differences in daily visits were found among different RFI level animals during the middle period; these differences were magnified with age, {{but there was no}} difference in daily meal number. Moreover, our data indicate that high RFI birds mainly take their meals at the edge of the population enclosure, where they are more susceptible to environmental interference. Conclusions Overall, this study suggests that the general <b>feeding</b> behaviors can be accurately measured using automatic electronic feeders and certain <b>feeding</b> behaviors in Pekin ducks are associated with improved <b>feed</b> efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The natural {{behavioural}} repertoire of the pig includes extensive foraging behaviour and long <b>feeding</b> times.
