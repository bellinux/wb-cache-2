Two other unrelated clones (including strains belonging to serovars 1 / 2 b and 1 / 2 c) have often been isolated from meat but not <b>from</b> <b>animals.</b> These findings indicate that contamination of meat with L. monocytogenes might originate mainly from the environment in which it is processed rather than <b>from</b> <b>animals</b> themselves.

5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware <b>from</b> <b>animal</b> husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
40|$|Weanling Lewis rats {{were fed}} for 10 weeks {{on a low}} fat (2. 5 % by weight; LF) diet or on diets {{containing}} 20 % by weight of hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO), olive oil (00) saflower oil (SO), evening primrose oil (EPO), or menhaden fish) oil (MO); all other components of the diets were identical. The chylomicron (CM), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions were isolated from the serum. The serum <b>from</b> MO-fed <b>animals</b> had lower LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations than the serum <b>from</b> <b>animals</b> fed {{each of the other}} diets. The apolipoprotein A-l concentration in the HDL fraction <b>from</b> <b>animals</b> fed the MO diet was also low. The serum <b>from</b> HCO-fed <b>animals</b> had a higher CM triacylglycerol concentration than serum <b>from</b> <b>animals</b> fed each of the other diets. The serum <b>from</b> 00 -fed <b>animals</b> had a higher VLDL triacylglycerol concentration than serum <b>from</b> <b>animals</b> fed each of the other diets. The concentration of apolipoprotein B was also high in the VLDL fraction <b>from</b> 00 -fed <b>animals.</b> The fatty acid composition of each lipoprotein fraction was affected {{by the nature of the}} lipid in the diet; the greatest effects were observed in the CM and VLDL fractions. Each lipoprotein fraction isolated from LF-fed rats inhibited mitogen-stimulated rat spleen lymphocyte proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner; LDL and HDL caused greater inhibition than CM and VLDL. Dietary lipid manipulation did not alter the inhibitory eflects of any of the lipoprotein fractions upon lymphocyte proliferation, except that CM and HDL <b>from</b> MO-fed <b>animals</b> and HDL <b>from</b> 00 -fed <b>animals</b> resulted in enhanced proliferation compared with either CM or HDL <b>from</b> <b>animals</b> fed the other diets. We conclude that the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation caused by feeding rats certain dietary lipids (00, EPO, MO) may be mediated by non-lipoprotein serum components...|$|R

5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled <b>from</b> <b>animal</b> liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use of animals in entertainment and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of animals in cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term.

Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence <b>from</b> <b>animal</b> studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination.

Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved <b>from</b> <b>animal</b> to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer.
