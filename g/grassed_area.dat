25|$|On the {{perimeter}} track, visitors {{will find a}} <b>grassed</b> <b>area,</b> overlooking the sea, which was the original site of a Ngai Tai pa (see Maori Pa). This <b>grassed</b> <b>area</b> has a deep ditch whose internal bank would have once been much higher and topped with a strong palisade of posts. Ō-Manawatere is a relatively small pā. Maori were building pa (earthwork forts) throughout N.Z. starting from around the 16th century. In total they built about 7,000 mainly in the North Island. Most pa were not permanently lived in, but were built close to kainga (villages) and were designed as safe places in case of attack. The depressions inside the pā are pits, once roofed over and used for storing Kūmara tubers, but now largely infilled but still visible.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} is a Spanish-period building which was remodeled by the United States in 1924, with small changes since then. The two-story building has massive masonry walls and large arched entrances to a central courtyard that reflects its Spanish origins, while the false partial gables with Spanish barrel tiles are typical of the United States Spanish Revival architectural work of the 1920s. The {{building is}} situated on the waterfront facing the Caribbean Sea and next to the port of Ponce, {{two miles from the}} center of this second-largest city in Puerto Rico. The customs house fully occupies a small city block. Its principal facade faces Bonaire Street and looks toward the ocean across a <b>grassed</b> <b>area</b> containing a Coast Guard beacon. It is located in an area of traditional warehouses, commercial buildings, mostly one-story and many from the Spanish period. There is a sidewalk around the four sides of the building, with the one on Bonaire Street wider and providing three mature trees.|$|E
500|$|York Prison finally {{closed in}} 1929, and the Tudor Gothic Victorian prison {{buildings}} were demolished in 1935. The Assize Courts building now houses the York Crown Court, while the former Debtors' Prison and Female Prison, {{together with a}} modern entrance area, are now the Castle Museum. The circular <b>grassed</b> <b>area</b> between these buildings that was once known as the [...] "Eyes of the Ridings" [...] {{is now known as}} Castle Green, or the [...] "Eye of York". Clifford's Tower is the most prominent surviving part of the original medieval fortification, although the stone steps {{up the side of the}} motte are modern. Fragments of the bailey wall, parts of the south gatehouse and one of the corner towers also survive.|$|E
500|$|The {{central section}} {{comprises}} Saltwell Towers and its grounds and is some [...] in total area. Saltwell Towers {{is located in}} the middle of the central section of the park and it is surrounded to the south by its accompanying walls, walkways and ha-ha. An enclosed rose garden lies to the east of the building and to the west there is a maze and a dene through which a stream runs into a lily-pond at an entrance to the park at Saltwell Road South. The approach from the southern section is a large <b>grassed</b> <b>area</b> replete with paths which wind towards a footbridge to the Towers, which is used for general leisure activities and picnicking and is home to a stone-built war memorial. The entrance to the footbridge is the site of a bronze war memorial which sits in the centre of a roundabout surrounded by bedding flowers. The footbridge was built in 2003 and is also a war memorial.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{from some}} {{semi-arid}} {{regions of the}} world have shown the beneficial effect of trees in silvopastoral systems, by promoting the formation of resource islands and increasing the sustainability of the system. No data are available in this respect for tree species of common occurrence in semi-arid Northeastern Brazil. In the present study, conducted in the summer of 1996, three tree species (Zyziphus joazeiro, Spondias tuberosa and Prosopis juliflora:) found within Cenchrus ciliaris pastures were selected to evaluate differences on herbaceous understory and soil chemical characteristics between samples taken under the tree canopy and in open <b>grass</b> <b>areas.</b> Transects extending from the tree trunk to open <b>grass</b> <b>areas</b> were established, and soil (0 - 15 cm) and herbaceous understory (standing live biomass in 1 m² plots) samples were taken at 0, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 % of the average canopy radius (average radius was 6. 6 ± 0. 5, 4. 5 ± 0. 5, and 5. 3 ± 0. 8 m for Z. joazeiro, P. juliflora, and S. tuberosa, respectively). Higher levels of soil C, N, P, Ca, Mg, K, and Na were found under the canopies of Z. joazeiro and P. juliflora: trees, as compared to open <b>grass</b> <b>areas.</b> Only soil Mg organic P were higher under the canopies of S. tuberosa trees, as compared to open <b>grass</b> <b>areas.</b> Herbaceous understory biomass was significantly lower under the canopy of S. tuberosa and P. juliflora trees (107 and 96 g m- 2, respectively) relatively to open <b>grass</b> <b>areas</b> (145 and 194 g m- 2). No herbaceous biomass differences were found between Z. joazeiro canopies and open <b>grass</b> <b>areas</b> (107 and 87 g m- 2, respectively). Among the three tree species studied, Z. joazeiro was the one that presented the greatest potential for use in a silvopastoral system at the study site, since it had a larger nutrient stock in the soil without negatively affecting herbaceous understory biomass, relatively to open <b>grass</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

500|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} the park constitutes [...] of land and can be accessed either by external entrances at the north-eastern corner {{of the park and}} West Park Road or internally from the central section through the dene or from Pets Corner. The north-eastern entrance consists of a pair of imposing gateposts and the view from this access point sweeps across the entire northern {{section of the}} park. The eastern perimeter of this section is a terraced walkway known as the Broadwalk with adjacent, banked bedded planting. A central path from the Broadwalk splits a large <b>grassed</b> <b>area</b> almost neatly in half and leads to a lake and two child's play areas. A path circles the perimeter of the lake and seating is placed at the fringe of the lake at various points. To the south of the lake are three bowling greens and to the north are tennis courts. These cannot be seen from the lake due to a screen of plants. The plants within the screen are typical of those bedded throughout the park, which include French marigolds, roses, tulips, phlomis, sedum and silver dust.|$|E
