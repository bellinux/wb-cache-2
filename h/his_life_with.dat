5|$|Coleridge {{began work}} on The Eolian Harp in August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. It details their future union and was inspired by {{his visit to the}} house in Clevedon that would serve as their home after their wedding. The poem is infused by the fact that Coleridge took an idealised view of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> Fricker.|$|E
5|$|Raja(Deepak Raj Giri) {{is a rich}} but {{illiterate}} man enjoying <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> {{his friends}} Ateet(Shivahari Poudel), Saraswati(Jitu Nepal), Magne(Kedar Ghimire) and Buddhi(Budhi Tamang).

Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E

5|$|At Union Station, {{the cars}} are loaded onto a train car {{with the help of}} Wrench. Steve arrives shortly {{thereafter}} and after bribing Wrench, is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him. Steve brandishes a gun and demands his gold back, but Mashkov arrives; Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection. Steve is punched in the face by Stella before being taken away by Mashkov, who reveals he will be tortured and killed. The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an Aston Martin Vanquish, Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants {{to spend the rest of}} <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>with,</b> and he and Stella travel to Venice together.|$|E

The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> <b>with</b> nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{began writing}} The Eolian Harp on 20 August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. Like his previous poem Lines Written at Shurton Bars, the poem discusses both his engagement and his future marriage. Coleridge {{was inspired to}} write the poem after {{a visit to a}} house in Clevedon that would serve as his and Fricker's home after their marriage. As Coleridge worked on the poem, he and Fricker were married and they moved to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> Fricker, and these thoughts work their way into the poem. The poem was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The Eolian Harp was his favourite.|$|E

5|$|Driving on, Marion {{stops for}} {{the night at the}} Bates Motel. The proprietor, Norman Bates, invites her to a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts, but then hears an {{argument}} between Norman and his mother about bringing a woman into her house. They eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life outside of her. Her sense of compassion and responsibility awakened by Norman's story, Marion decides to go back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, and prepares for bed. As she is showering, a shadowy figure comes in and stabs her to death with a chef's knife. Norman discovers the murder and assumes his mother is responsible. He meticulously cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the embezzled money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> the secular history of the age. As stated in , the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Finch's successes have aroused media {{attention}}— in particular, {{the attention}} of investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith. While at first the Doctor feigns ignorance (but is barely able to restrain his pleasure at seeing her again), when Sarah Jane discovers the TARDIS during the night, he reveals his identity to her. Sarah Jane meets Rose and Mickey, with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women. As the group searches the school, they find thirteen bat-like creatures asleep in Finch's office. Returning to Sarah Jane's car, the journalist reveals a battered, inactive K9 Mark III, who—once repaired—identifies the chip oil as Krillitane oil. Rose, unaware that the Doctor had even had past companions, confronts him; he replies sadly that, while she can {{spend the rest of}} her life with him, he cannot spend the rest of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> her, so he must remain aloof.|$|E

5|$|The long, strenuous {{walk from}} Pelotas to Porto Alegre and the hardships endured in the presiganga ruined Marques de Sousa's health, {{and he was}} afflicted with {{articular}} rheumatism {{for the rest of}} <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>With</b> Porto Alegre safe, he was granted a leave of absence to recover. In the middle of 1837, he traveled to Europe for medical treatment. After a year away, and still feeling ill, Marques de Sousa secluded himself in Porto Alegre. He was brevetted lieutenant colonel on 20 August 1838. He only returned to active duty in early 1840 after he was made permanent lieutenant colonel on 2 December 1839 and given the command of the 2nd Regiment of Light Cavalry. However, the war against the Ragamuffins was still being waged, and Marques de Sousa met and defeated a rebel force in the Battle of the Várzea do Varejão on 16 September 1841. A new promotion came on 27 March 1842, when he was given the rank of colonel.|$|E
5|$|The war {{left the}} British, {{under the auspices}} of the British East India Company, in control of {{virtually}} all of present-day India south of the Sutlej River. The famed Nassak Diamond was acquired by the Company as part of the spoils of the war. The British acquired large chunks of territory from the Maratha Empire and in effect put an end to their most dynamic opposition. The terms of surrender Malcolm offered to the Peshwa were controversial amongst the British for being too liberal: The Peshwa was offered a luxurious life near Kanpur and given a pension of about 80,000 pounds. A comparison was drawn with Napoleon, who was confined to a small rock in the south Atlantic and given a small sum for his maintenance. Trimbakji Dengale was captured after the war and was sent to the fortress of Chunar in Bengal where he spent the rest of <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>With</b> all active resistance over, John Malcolm played a prominent part in capturing and pacifying the remaining fugitives.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>With</b> this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E
