25|$|Dr. Cable is {{the head}} of Special Circumstances, and the one who denies Tally the {{operation}} until she finds Shay. She sends Specials to destroy the Smoke. She is described as having an aquiline nose, non-reflective <b>gray</b> <b>eyes,</b> a razor-like voice, and sharp teeth.|$|E
25|$|The Legion works also {{featured}} a force field called AKKA which can erase from the Universe any matter, of any size, anywhere, even a star or a planet. AKKA was {{a weapon of}} mass destruction and the secret of it was entrusted to a series of women. AKKA was used in the past to overthrow the Purple tyranny. It was also used to wipe out most of the Medusae, though they had tried to steal the secret. When they were wiped out, the Moon where they had established their base was erased out of existence. At the end of the story, John Ulnar falls in love with the keeper of AKKA, Aladoree Anthar, and marries her. Aladoree Anthar is described as a young woman with lustrous brown hair and <b>gray</b> <b>eyes,</b> beautiful as a goddess.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times said of her: [...] "The simple realism, nostalgic {{atmosphere}} and luminous color with which Grandma Moses portrayed simple farm life and rural countryside won her a wide following. She {{was able to}} capture the excitement of winter's first snow, Thanksgiving preparations and the new, young green of oncoming spring... In person, Grandma Moses charmed wherever she went. A tiny, lively woman with mischievous <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> and a quick wit, she could be sharp-tongued with a sycophant and stern with an errant grandchild." ...|$|E

500|$|Eston's sons also {{enlisted in}} the Union Army, both as white men from Madison, Wisconsin. His first son John Wayles Jefferson had red hair and <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> like his {{grandfather}} Jefferson.

60|$|I {{stared at}} Mr. Wharton blankly. He {{was a man}} nearing the middle age, with a lacing of red in his cheeks, a {{pleasant}} <b>gray</b> <b>eye,</b> and a singularly quiet manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{might as}} well wear so many Northeastern uniforms with brass buttons," [...] a sinewy hill farmer from Lee put in. He had a lean face that did not move a muscle, but a humorous <b>gray</b> <b>eye</b> that twinkled.|$|R
60|$|The trapper bounded at them, his tanned face glowing, his <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> glad.|$|E
60|$|The {{fingers at}} his throat relaxed, a puzzled, far-away {{expression}} softened the <b>gray</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then the <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> softened, {{and sought}} the blanched {{face of the}} {{stricken}} maiden.|$|E
60|$|The {{speaker was}} a wiry, active man of some forty years old, with a weatherbeaten face, and a keen <b>gray</b> <b>eye.</b> Jonathan, his comrade, was a head taller, with broad shoulders, {{powerful}} limbs, and a quiet but good-tempered face.|$|R
60|$|With the queerest look in {{the world}} had the {{manufacturer}} for some ten minutes been watching the Irish curate, as the latter made free with the punch, when suddenly that steady <b>gray</b> <b>eye</b> changed, as if another vision came between it and Malone. Moore raised his hand.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{laughed and}} looked in a more {{friendly}} manner at Joe. Though {{he said he had}} been frightened, his cool and careless manner belied his words. In Joe's low voice and clear, <b>gray</b> <b>eye</b> there was something potent and magnetic, which subtly influenced those with whom he came in contact.|$|R
60|$|He drew himself up. A {{flicker of}} passion flamed {{in his own}} deep <b>gray</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her with his keen <b>gray</b> <b>eyes,</b> but she {{returned}} the look quite as keenly.|$|E
60|$|The big <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> were {{perfectly}} steady, but a faint trace of color showed in Violet’s cheek.|$|E
6000|$|Kennedy's shrewd <b>gray</b> <b>eye</b> {{glanced at}} him {{in a manner that}} startled him, as he made reply, 'Fellow-alumnus, you speak as Oxford {{scholars}} speak; but I rede ye well that the real is not that which is grossly tangible to the corporeal sense, but the idea that is conceived within the immortal intelligence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The May-weed springs; {{and comes}} a Man [...] And mounts our Signal Hill; A quiet Man, and plain in garb-- [...] Briefly he looks his fill, Then drops his <b>gray</b> <b>eye</b> on the ground, [...] Like a loaded mortar he is still: Meekness and grimness meet in him-- [...] The silent General.|$|R
60|$|The same look of pity {{came into}} Dorian <b>Gray's</b> <b>eyes.</b> Then he {{stretched}} out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table. Having done this, he got up, {{and went over to}} the window.|$|R
60|$|The bored languor of {{his face}} had {{abruptly}} vanished. Every muscle was alert; his <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> glittered.|$|E
60|$|The <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> {{gazed into}} hers with {{lingering}} tenderness; then the film of death came upon them.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Thurwell drew a {{few steps}} backward, and his keen <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> swept the open country round.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{soon have}} {{that out of}} you. I have none o' yer bawling, praying, singing niggers on my place; so remember.

60|$|Queen Mary's {{willingness}} to admit him was notified by Sir Andrew Melville, a tall, worn man, with the typical Scottish countenance and a keen steadfast <b>gray</b> <b>eye.</b> He marshalled the trio up a circular staircase, made {{as easy as}} possible, but necessarily narrow, since it wound up through a brick turret at the corner, to the third and uppermost story of the lodge.|$|R
60|$|For Richards had not {{exaggerated the}} girl's charms. She was indeed dangerously pretty, from her tawny little head to her small feet, and her figure, {{although}} comparatively diminutive, was perfectly proportioned. <b>Gray</b> <b>eyed</b> and blonde {{as she was}} in color, her racial peculiarities were distinct, and only the good-humored and enthusiastic Richards could have likened her to an American girl.|$|R
60|$|Dan {{looked at}} her with his jaws set grimly, and a steely gleam in his steady <b>gray</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tom Gaunt rustled the greenish {{paper he}} was reading, and his little, hard <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed his father.|$|E
60|$|But now, {{resolved}} and desperate, she steeled {{herself against}} him. He tried to face her, but her <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> looked out to him, steadily, from under cool, level brows, and {{he dropped his}} head upon her knee. Her hand strayed into his hair softly, and her face melted into solicitude and tenderness. But {{when he looked up}} again, her <b>gray</b> <b>eyes</b> were steady, her brows cool and level.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the fifth}} {{month of the}} second year of their acquaintance, Mr. McEachern {{proposed}} and was accepted. [...] "The bridegroom," [...] said a society paper, [...] "is one of those typical captains of industry of whom our cousins 'across the streak' can boast so many.

60|$|Lady Jane, who {{had fallen}} in love with the abbey some years before, during a visit to the neighborhood, had prevailed upon her square-shouldered lord to turn his {{twinkling}} <b>gray</b> <b>eye</b> in that direction, and the captain of industry, with the remark that here, at last, was a real bully old sure-fire English stately home, had sent down builders and their like, not in single spies, but in battalions, with instructions to get busy.|$|R
