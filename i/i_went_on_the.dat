500|$|There {{are several}} {{conflicting}} versions {{of what happened}} on the field in the Middlesex game. On the morning of 19 August, replying to suggestions that he was drunk, Peel spoke to a newspaper reporter and stated: [...] "Before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground at Sheffield—I don't blush to say it—I had two small glasses of gin and water. At luncheon time I had nothing". Peel said that he opened the bowling with Stanley Jackson and was eventually rested without a word being said to him. He stated that he later slipped twice while fielding, but the cause was that the spikes on his boots were broken. That evening, when he went to collect his wages {{at the end of the}} game, the Yorkshire secretary, Joseph Wolstenholme, informed him of the suspension on the grounds that his play was [...] "unsatisfactory", and when pressed by Peel for an explanation, he told him: [...] "You have had a glass too much".|$|E
2500|$|Frustrated by the {{futility}} of one-on-one conversions, and following the advice of an uncle in Chicago, Weber decided to take up acting about 1904, and moved to New York City, where she took some singing lessons. Weber later explained her motivation: [...] "As I was convinced the theatrical profession needed a missionary, he suggested {{that the best way}} to reach them was to become one of them so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage filled with a great desire to convert my fellowman".|$|E
2500|$|When {{you lose}} your {{confidence}} you don't want to bowl again. When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets {{at an average of}} about 25, and 10 of them were in first-class games. I only bowled about 78 overs on tour. When {{you lose your}} confidence it's not a nice feeling – you can't do what you used to do, but I'm only sorry it was the wrong day at the wrong time , because if I was myself, I assure you, in my opinion, I would have played more Test cricket, but that's only my assumption. I appreciated the experience , but after three months with no confidence [...] I was pleased to get back home.|$|E

60|$|Yes: I saw it. With my {{own eyes}} I saw it. A pillar of white mist--between five and six feet high, as well as I could judge--was moving beside me {{at the edge of}} the road, on my left hand.

50|$|Who Killed The JAMs? is {{the second}} studio album by The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), and the final one under the JAMs moniker before {{renaming}} themselves The KLF.
