She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her a glass of wine. She thanks him. After a few minutes, she says that she is better and must go. But as she turns to leave, she realizes that she has lost her key.|$|E
25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> the door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: {{when he opened the}} door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon {{back and forth in the}} doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E
25|$|Tullio phenomenon, {{another of}} the more {{identifiable}} symptoms leading to a positive SCD diagnosis is sound-induced loss of balance. Patients showing this symptom may experience a loss of equilibrium, a feeling of motion sickness or even actual nausea, triggered by normal everyday sounds. Although this {{is often associated with}} loud noises, volume is not necessarily a factor. Patients describe a wide range of sounds that affect balance: the 'rattle' of a plastic bag; a cashier tossing coins into the register; a telephone ringing; a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> the door; music; the sound of children playing and even the patient's own voice are typical examples of sounds that can cause a loss of balance when this condition is present, although there are countless others. The presence of Tullio may also mean that involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), sometimes rotational, are set off by sound, giving the sufferer the impression that the world is tipping, clockwise or anticlockwise, depending {{on the site of the}} dehiscence. Some patients report this tilt as being as much as 15°. For such persons, a visit to the concert hall or to a noisy playground may seem like being at the epicenter of an earthquake. A change of pressure within the middle ear (for example when flying or nose-blowing) may equally set off a bout of disequilibrium or nystagmus.|$|E

500|$|James and {{his girlfriend}} Kristen arrive at James' {{childhood}} summer home, tired and irritable after a long evening at a friend's wedding reception. It is revealed through flashback that while they were there, James proposed to Kristen and she refused. James calls his friend Mike and asks him to come pick {{him up in the}} morning. Shortly after 4 a.m., there is a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> the door, surprising since the house is so remote and far from any civilization. A young blonde woman, whose face is obscured by low lighting, asks for Tamara.

500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> the door and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the tension}} between them, James leaves {{to go for a}} drive and {{purchase}} a pack of cigarettes for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. Shortly after he leaves, Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; while she does this, smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the smoke alarm when she is startled by another <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> the door; she drops the alarm on the floor and retreats to the bedroom, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short. When she returns to the living room, she sees the smoke alarm now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone else has been in the house. When she hears a noise from the backyard, she arms herself with a knife, and opens the curtains to find a man wearing a sack mask, staring at her. Panicked, she stumbles into the hallway, and watches as the front door opens. When she goes to push [...] the door closed, she sees the blonde woman outside, now wearing a doll mask. After locking the door, Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears people outside banging violently against the walls of the house.|$|E

He hurriedly hides in a closet when she returns home. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, discovers him and threatens to kill him. Believing his curiosity is merely sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy makes Jeffrey undress at knife-point and begins to fellate him before their encounter is interrupted by a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> the door. Dorothy hides Jeffrey in the closet. From there he witnesses the visitor, Frank Booth, inflict his bizarre sexual proclivities—which include inhaling an unidentified gas, dry humping, and sadomasochism—upon Dorothy. Frank is an extremely foul-mouthed, violent man whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. He continually refers to her as [...] "Mommy" [...] and to himself as both the [...] "Daddy" [...] and the [...] "Baby," [...] who [...] "wants to fuck." [...] Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors; to [...] "Do it for van Gogh." [...] When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she tells him to leave. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay, though he leaves anyway.|$|E
500|$|In July 1916, Dillon was conscripted {{into the}} army, but disliked the {{discipline}} of regimental life. He applied for exemption on the grounds he had to look after his parents and four brothers, but his claim was rejected. In a later failed attempt, he tried to convince army officials {{that he was too}} obese to carry out military duties. [...] On the rare occasions when Dillon was allowed home on leave, he would often indulge in drinking sessions. [...] One night, Lloyd's friend Bella Burge received a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> the front door to find a hysterical Lloyd covered in blood and bruises. [...] When asked to explain what had caused her injuries, she stated that she had caught Dillon in bed with another woman and had had a showdown with her husband. By 1917, Dillon's drinking had become worse. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon's house in Golders Green after Dillon committed a drunken assault on his wife. [...] Police entered the house and found Lloyd and her maid cowering beneath a table. [...] Dillon confronted the constables and assaulted one of them, which resulted in him being taken to court, fined and sentenced to a month's hard labour. Lloyd began drinking to escape the trauma of her domestic abuse. [...] That year, she was earning £470 per week performing in music halls and making special appearances. By 1918, she had become popular with the British-based American soldiers, but had failed to capture the spirits of their English counterparts, and began feeling sidelined by her peers; Vesta Tilley had led a very successful recruitment drive into the services, and other music hall performers had been honoured by royalty. The following year, she performed perhaps her best known song, [...] "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)", which was written for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins. [...] The song depicts a mother fleeing her home to avoid the rent man. [...] The lyrics reflected the hardships of working class life in London {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, and gave her the chance to costume the character in a worn out dress and black straw boater, while carrying a birdcage.|$|E
