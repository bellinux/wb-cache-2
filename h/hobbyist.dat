5|$|Flux-cored welding {{machines}} are most popular at the <b>hobbyist</b> level, as the machines are slightly simpler but mainly because they avoid {{the cost of}} providing shield gas, either through a rented cylinder or with {{the high cost of}} disposable cylinders.|$|E
5|$|The {{first full}} page {{advertisements}} for the Altair computer {{appeared in the}} February issues of Popular Electronics and Radio-Electronics magazines. Soon MITS was advertising in technical journals such as the IEEE Computer, and general interest magazines such as Scientific American. MITS was also the most prominent advertiser in the new <b>hobbyist</b> computer magazines such as Creative Computing and Byte.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, rose <b>hobbyist</b> and Oregon Journal editor Jesse Currey {{convinced}} {{city officials}} {{to establish a}} rose test garden to protect hybrid roses grown in Europe during World War I. Portland's Park Bureau approved the idea in 1917, allowing rose enthusiasts in England to send roses to Portland for preservation. City landscape architect Florence Holmes Gerke began designing the International Rose Test Garden and accompanying amphitheatre in 1921. The garden was dedicated in June 1924 with Currey as the first curator. He served {{until his death in}} 1927. A stone bench in the garden honors Currey's work as founder.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>hobbyists</b> have {{questioned}} the impact of flowerhorn breeding programs {{and their impact on}} the natural species of the fish world. These <b>hobbyists</b> believe that all hybrid fish are detrimental to the aquarium hobby and will always be a topic of issue. These same <b>hobbyists</b> believe the creation of man-made hybrids makes it harder for other <b>hobbyists</b> to find and keep pure species.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, some <b>hobbyists</b> {{have taken}} {{interests}} in lasers. Lasers used by <b>hobbyists</b> are generally of class IIIa or IIIb (see Safety), although some {{have made their}} own class IV types. However, compared to other <b>hobbyists,</b> laser <b>hobbyists</b> are far less common, due to the cost and potential dangers involved. Due {{to the cost of}} lasers, some <b>hobbyists</b> use inexpensive means to obtain lasers, such as salvaging laser diodes from broken DVD players (red), Blu-ray players (violet), or even higher power laser diodes from CD or DVD burners.|$|R
5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based {{primarily}} at Pennsylvania State University, was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most <b>hobbyist</b> beekeepers believed that starvation {{was the leading}} cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were {{the leading cause of}} colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E
5|$|In early 1977, TSR {{created the}} first element of a two-pronged {{strategy}} that would divide D for nearly two decades. A Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up {{the presentation of the}} essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for <b>hobbyist</b> gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the Basic Set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.|$|E
5|$|The {{game that}} became Fez {{began in a}} {{collaboration}} between Montreal-based Phil Fish and Toronto-based Shawn McGrath on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game: a four-sided 3D space with each side in 2D, similar to Fish's 3D pixels (voxels) as incorporated into Fez. The entirety of Fez design, lore, and art descends from this game mechanic. Fish provided the project's art and credited his influence to Shigeru Miyamoto and Hayao Miyazaki. Fish and McGrath's partnership crumbled due to creative differences, as Fish {{wanted to create a}} platform game. Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time and announced his search for a programmer on DeviantArt, and the first person to reply, Renaud Bédard, became lead programmer. They were both the same age and living in Montreal. Though Bédard had some <b>hobbyist</b> experience in 3D graphics and was studying computer science, Fez was his first professional game development project. His first task was to write the level editor and game engine.|$|E
5000|$|As they expected, the Altair {{was very}} popular with <b>hobbyists</b> such as the Homebrew Computer Club. Altair BASIC, as MITS' {{preferred}} BASIC interpreter, was also popular. However, the <b>hobbyists</b> took a [...] "share-alike" [...] approach to software and thought nothing of copying the BASIC interpreter for other <b>hobbyists.</b> Homebrew member Dan Sokol was especially prolific; after somehow obtaining a pre-market tape of the interpreter, he made 25 copies and distributed them at the next Homebrew meeting, urging recipients to make more copies. Gates responded in 1976 with a strongly worded Open Letter to <b>Hobbyists</b> that accused the copiers of theft and declared {{that he could not}} continue developing computer software that people did not pay for. Many <b>hobbyists</b> reacted defensively to the letter.|$|R

Our study evaluated garden center staff knowledge about aquaponics in order to help the staff close their own information and training gaps, and strengthen their exchanges with home <b>hobbyists.</b> Over time this will strengthen the aquaponics network of garden centers and home <b>hobbyists</b> and enhance the diffusion of aquaponics systems...|$|R
50|$|Recently, {{productive}} {{efforts for}} cooperation between professionals and metal detecting <b>hobbyists</b> have begun, including the Montpelier Archeology Project and Battlefield Restoration and Archaeological Volunteer Organization (BRAVO) and many more. In these programs, skilled detector <b>hobbyists</b> work with experienced professionals with common goals of accurate, efficient site discovery and excavation. Away from supervised sites, <b>hobbyists</b> using improved record keeping and employment of global positioning system, GIS, logbooks, photo scales and online databases may aid professionals in evaluating possible sites. When {{searching for a}} site, <b>hobbyists</b> can aid with electronic scanning, reducing the need for test holes. Some land managers, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority have cited a role for amateur archaeologists in protecting sensitive sites from illegal looting and metal detector <b>hobbyists</b> have aided in the location and preservation of many sites.|$|R

25|$|The typical <b>hobbyist</b> {{aquarium}} {{includes a}} filtration system, an artificial lighting system, and a heater or chiller {{depending on the}} aquarium's inhabitants.
