Cats and mice are a particular problem as both prey on breeding seabird colonies. Another particular threat is the danger to diving seabirds caught by long-line fishing of the Patagonian toothfish (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>eleginoides)</b> in the seas around the islands, gray-headed albatross and white-chinned petrel have been especially damaged by this industry as they habitually follow fishing boats.|$|E

Little is known about the biology of D. eleginoides and traditional methods of estimating stock size using trawling techniques have proved ineffective because the adult fish are found in deep waters on the continental slope at depths of 700 – 2500 m. During September 1997, a preliminary study was undertaken using arrival times at an autonomous baited camera vehicle, the Aberdeen University Deep Ocean Submersible (AUDOS), to estimate the abundance and size of toothfish in waters around South Georgia (SG) and the Falkland Islands (FI).

40|$|Longline {{fishing for}} Patagonian {{toothfish}} (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>eleginoides)</b> {{has taken place}} in Falkland Island waters for over 10 years. This species was previously only caught as bycatch in the Loligo gahi and finfish trawl fishery. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the Falkland Islands population of <b>Dissostichus</b> <b>eleginoides</b> using an age-structured production model (ASPM). Two models were investigated; one using a Beverton–Holt stock recruitment relationship and another using trawler CPUE based estimates of toothfish abundance to estimate yearly recruitment. A stock recruitment relationship was not included within the model that used abundance estimates, as recruitment to the population was estimated directly from the index of relative recruit abundance calculated from trawler CPUE. The model was fitted to longline standardised CPUE and to the catch-at-length data. The models produced estimates that provided similar declines in the toothfish population although the start and end biomass estimates varied slightly. The models provided estimates of between 13, 000 and 26, 000 tonnes of current spawning stock biomass and showed current biomass to be between 38 and 46 % of virgin biomass. The fit to CPUE was poor between 1994 and 1996, which we hypothesised could have been due to unreported catches or changes in q or M. This was a time when there was considerable IUU fishing in the southwest Atlantic. When the model was allowed to estimate a level of extra catch the fit was improved and 5000 tonnes of extra catch was estimated. Two further models were briefly examined to investigate the possibility of changes in M and q but both required large changes in those parameters in order to fit. Estimates of MSY varied widely, from 912 to almost 3000 tonnes...|$|E

Additionally, ages were predicted for each fish based on length, and compared with ages estimated from reading otoliths in a goodness-of-fit test. The majority of the otoliths (83. 6 %) were estimated to be from fish 1 + or 2 + years old, with mean total lengths of 32. 5 cm and 41. 3 cm respectively.

This enabled the construction of a realistic field of depth-averaged time-mean slope currents along the 1000 m isobath all around the Kerguelen Islands. The strongest depth-mean velocities of 25 cm s− 1 are associated with the Polar Front, which rounds the islands from the south and flows northward along the inner continental slope immediately east of the islands, strongly supporting previous hydrographic evidence.

40|$|During {{seven days}} of {{operations}} involving the setting and hauling of longlines to catch the toothfish <b>Dissostichus</b> <b>eleginoides</b> around the South Sandwich Islands, actual and potential interactions with seabirds were assessed. Bird numbers increased rapidly after dawn and large numbers of Cape, giant and storm petrels and smaller numbers of white-chinned petrels and black-browed albatrosses were present during day hauling operations. No incidental mortality was seen and only one bird was caught on a hook; nevertheless many species in these aggregations of birds are clearly potentially vulnerable to setting operations in daylight hours. Several species of the seabirds present presumably originated from South Georgia populations; however wandering and grey-headed albatrosses, whose populations are in serious decline at South Georgia, were rare; their vulnerability to longlining operations in the South Sandwich Islands may, therefore, be low.

We conclude that D. exulans breeding at South Georgia have a relatively low potential risk of interaction with longline fisheries around South Georgia between December and February (incubation period) and between late May and October (main chick-rearing period). However during the chick-brooding period, from March through mid-May, adult birds of both sexes {{spend most of their}} time at sea over the South Georgia continental shelf in areas very similar to where the longline fishery operates and are therefore at serious risk from these fisheries at this time.

40|$|International audienceLarge-scale {{transport}} of seawater in ocean currents may generate spatially complex population structure through the advection of life stages of marine fish species. To test this, {{we compared the}} chemistry of otolith nuclei from Patagonian toothfish (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>eleginoides),</b> presently managed as spatially discrete populations corresponding to fishing management areas along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which transports water eastward around the Southern Ocean. The chemistry of otolith nuclei, laid down during early life, differed significantly between fishing areas off South America and the Antarctic and between some Antarctic areas. However, we found significant discrepancies from expectation for a population structure corresponding to fishing areas. We also found evidence of four groups of fish with different early life chemistry: one associated with South America and three Antarctic groups showing mixing consistent with advective transport along the ACC. These results suggest that toothfish populations are structured by their physical environment; population abundance and persistence may rely on a restricted number of breeding members with access to spawning grounds, whereas fisheries may rely substantially on nonbreeding vagrants transported from fishing areas upstrea...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDepredation in {{longline}} fisheries by odontocete whales is {{a worldwide}} growing issue, having substantial socio-economic consequences for fishers {{as well as}} conservation implications for both fish resources and the depredating odontocete populations.

Thus, we examined the factors influencing the decision making process of fishers facing such competition while operating on a patch. Using optimal foraging theory as the underlying hypothesis, we determined that the probability captains left an area decreases with increasing fishing success whereas, in presence of competition from odontocete whales, it increases. Our study provides strong support that fishers behave as optimal foragers in this specific fishery. Considering that captains are optimal foragers and thus aim at maximising the exploitation of the resources, we highlight possible risks for the long-term sustainability of the local ecosystem...|$|E
