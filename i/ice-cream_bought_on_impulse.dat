Impulse purchases account for over $ 4 {{billion in annual}} sales in the U. S. (Mogelonsky, 1998). Retailers have found that over 50 percent of mall shoppers purchase <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> (Nichols et al., 2001).

The logical {{sequence of the}} consumers' actions is replaced with an irrational moment of self gratification. Impulse items appeal to the emotional side of consumers. Some items <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> are not considered functional or necessary in the consumers' lives. Preventing impulse buying involves techniques such as setting budgets before shopping and taking time out before the purchase is made.|$|R

40|$|Current {{theories}} in economics, marketing, and psychology fail to explain underlying reasons for impulse buying and, crucially, why certain goods (e. g., clothes) are bought impulsively {{more than others}} (e. g., basic kitchen equipment). We propose and examine a social psychological model, which predicts that people impulse buy to acquire material symbols of personal and social identity. We predict that consumers will differ systematically in the goods they buy <b>on</b> <b>impulse,</b> and in their reasons for doing so, depending on their attitudes towards shopping, and also along important social categories, such as gender. Specifically, our theoretical model - drawing on a social constructionist model of material possessions (e. g., Dittmar, 1992) and symbolic self-completion theory (e. g. Wicklund and Gollwitzer, 1982) - leads to three sets of hypotheses: (i) some consumer durables {{are more likely to}} be <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> than others, and there may be gender differences in object choices, (ii) differences will emerge in the buying considerations (e. g., functional, emotional, symbolic) that are used for impulse and planned buying, and (iii) magnitude of self-discrepancies will predict relative impulse buying frequency and the buying considerations used, if the individual uses consumption as a self-completion strategy. These predictions were expected to hold particularly strongly for individuals high in compulsive shopping tendencies. We test our model in a questionnaire study with a sample of British consumers (n = 61). The results lend support to all three sets of hypotheses. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to economic and consumer theory, and the treatment offered to the increasing number of ‘addicted’ shoppers...|$|R
40|$|Examines {{customer}} JoyaIty {{for private}} label food brands in the Muncie, Indiana area and isolates factors pertaining to that loyalty. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present findings from a recent research study dealing with possible factors responsible for the consumer’s decision to purchase or not to purchase private food brands. When one realizes that human behavior is responsible for these buying decisions, it is readily apparent that it is quite a formid-able task to measure the factors involved. Because of the lack of a good theoretical base, market researchers have been hindered in their efforts to perform reliable scientific experiments measuring the motives, attitudes, and behavior of the consumer. As far back as 1960, nearly ninety percent of all supermarkets reported carrying some type of private label, It is important to the retailer to determine why the consumer does or does not purchase private brands. Also, the retailer should know whether his private brands are <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> by consumers who switch to his store at the time of purchase, or whether these con-sumers constitute a specific market segment that is actually loyal to his private brand. If the consumers buy <b>on</b> <b>impulse,</b> the retailer can only concentrate on the image of his store. But, if there is a definite market segment for private brands, then he can aim specific marketing efforts at this segment. [1) Data for the study were obtained in personal inter-views with a random sample of 198 food shoppers resid-ing in the Muncie, Indiana metropolitan area during January 1970. A food shopper is defined as that individ-ual or individuals responsible for the food shopping in his or her household. At the time of the study, 25, 294 households were defined as part of the Muncie metro-politan area. The sample yielded characteristics similar to information published by other sources for the Muncie, Indiana area, FINDINGS Respondents were categorized according to the number of seven possible groupings of private brands purchased during the six-week period prior to the inter-view. A private brand is defined as a product manu-factured, packaged, end labeled for sale in a specifi...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the motivational foundations of consumer behavior. The dissertation utilizes insights mainly from motivational psychology, biology, and neuroscience to investigate why we are motivated to consume certain goods, but not others. In particular, the dissertation emphasizes that parts of our motivation can {{be understood in terms}} of needs and their deprivation. The dissertation contains three main chapters (4, 5, and 6). Chapters 4 and 5 deal with intertemporal choice and impulsive consumption. Chapter 4 presents a new intertemporal choice model and shows that impulsive choices can be understood by utilizing recent neuroscientific findings suggesting that cue-triggered “wanting” can be a reason for the occurrence of impulsive urges. When driven by cue-triggered “wanting”, individuals sometimes impulsively “want” rewards, although they do not necessarily “like” the rewards. Chapter 5 uses the cue-triggered “wanting” mechanism to explain that individuals oftentimes buy identity-relevant goods such as clothes in an impulsive fashion. The chapter argues that the “wanting”-“liking” dissociation can explain the regret that individuals sometimes perceive after having <b>bought</b> identity-related products <b>on</b> <b>impulse.</b> Based <b>on</b> the knowledge of the cue-triggered “wanting” mechanism, especially in context of identity-related consumption, the chapter presents implications for libertarian paternalistic policy advice. More precisely, the chapter illustrates how nudges can be used to either reduce unnecessary impulsive consumption or increase the frequency with which ethical goods are impulsively consumed. Finally, chapter 6 presents a formal model explaining the changes in consumer behavior over the long run based on needs and their deprivation patterns. The model explains, for example, the empirical regularity that expenditure shares devoted to food consumption decrease with rising income...|$|R

40|$|Research {{into the}} {{influence}} of affect <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> buying has to date produced contradictory results, partly due to confusion between the potentially discrete influences of, respectively, state and trait affect. Additionally, studies on how the five-factor personality model’s dimensions influence impulse buying have also produced contradictory results. Moreover, while the established link between trait affect and personality suggests dimensions of this latter could account for whatever influence the former has <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> buying, no study has yet attempted to examine this possibility. We draw on self-regulation theory to examine three unanswered questions: (1) {{the extent to which}} trait affect influences impulse buying whilst controlling for state affect; (2) establish which dimensions of the five-factor personality model predict impulse buying; and (3) test whether or not any influence of trait affect <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> buying is additive to the effects of the five-factor personality model. Analyses of cross-sectional data (n = 842) find that trait affect does have a significant (p <. 05) influence <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> buying controlling for state affect, but that this influence is fully accounted for by the five-factor personality model (p <. 001), the extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism dimensions of which are found consistently to predict impulse buying...|$|R
