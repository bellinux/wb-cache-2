40|$|Vortex tube is {{a simple}} energy {{separation}} device, also known as Ranque tube or <b>Hilsch</b> <b>tube,</b> which can separate a high-pressure stream into two different hot and cold streams. Since its simple structure and unique temperature separation characteristics, vortex tube has been widely used in various industries. In recent years, with the in-depth study of the vortex tube, {{it has been found}} that compared with the conventional expansion expander and the throttle valve, the vortex tube is much more structurally simple and efficient, respectively. Researchers have proposed the use of the vortex tube in the refrigeration system {{in order to reduce the}} throttling loss and improve system efficiency. This has important implications for improving the performance of the system, to achieve energy saving and emission reduction. However, due to the different physical properties of the different working fluid, energy separation in the vortex tube are not the same. In the existing studies on the vortex tube, the working fluid mainly used air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and other natural refrigerants, the research about the influence of refrigerants is few. Due to the fact that the vortex tube is increasingly used in refrigeration and heating system, it is urgent to study the coupling characteristics between vortex tube and refrigerants and find optimal conditions in different systems. The different temperature separation effect of the refrigerants in the vortex tube in the low inlet pressure(300 kPa) have been studied in our previous study and three fluid characteristics (specific heat ratio, kinematic viscosity, thermal conductivity) were considered as main influencing factors of energy separation. The influence of different working fluid in high pressure conditions has not been considered,which is part of research work in this paper. The coupling characteristic between vortex tube and refrigerants wais studied and the closed loop system was constructed. R 134 a, R 744, R 32, R 227 ea were selected as the working fluids, experiments were carried out in different inlet pressure(500 kPa? 850 kPa), different inlet temperature (308. 15 K? 333. 15 K), different cold flow ratio (20 %? 97 %). The temperature separation of different working fluids under different conditions were explored and the influences of different characteristics of the working fluids on the temperature separation process were discussed. These studies can help more profound understanding of the vortex tube temperature separation process, and also has certain significance on the applications of the vortex tube in the refrigeration system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube air cooling on surface roughness quality and carbon footprint when turning mild steel workpiece with coated carbide cutting tool. The cutting parameters involved in this study were cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The cutting speed and feed rate were fixed at 160 m/min and 0. 10, 0. 18 and 0. 28 mm/rev, while the depth of cut was varied from 1. 0 to 4. 0 mm. During the turning process, the cutting temperatures were measured using infrared thermometer and the power consumption was measured using a power and harmonics analyzer and then converted into carbon footprint. The machined parts surface roughness were measured using a surface roughness tester. The results show that machining with Ranque- <b>Hilsch</b> vortex <b>tube</b> reduces the cutting temperature, but the surface roughness and carbon footprint is better under ambient condition except at a higher feedrate...|$|R
40|$|The Ranque <b>Hilsch</b> Vortex <b>Tube</b> (RHVT) is a {{very simple}} device well known for its phenomenal {{temperature}} separation effect. With a single input of compressed gas, the tube simultaneously produces two different streams of gas ? one being hotter and other being colder than input gas. Over the years, different theories have attempted to explain this effect without achieving any universal agreement. Small size of RHVT presents considerable difficulties towards predicting temperature, pressure and flow field inside it. This is where Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis comes {{to the aid of}} researchers. Many of researchers have attempted such analysis using turbulence models such as The Standard k-ε model, RNG k-ε model & Realizable k-ε model, Large Eddy Simulation Technique (LES) etc. This paper attempts to present a review of such recent qualitative studies carried out on RHVT using CFD. Care has been taken to explore diversified parameters related to flow physics inside RHVT, instead of being monotonous one. This review is expected to help future researches in the related domai...|$|R
