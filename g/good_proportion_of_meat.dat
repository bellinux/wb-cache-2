Müller fed his children bread, with treacle or dripping; oatmeal; potatoes and other vegetables; stew; corned beef; rice. [...] W Elfe Taylor notes that [...] "The food of the Orphans at breakfast is always oatmeal porridge; they use milk with it. No doubt this wholesome food is one cause of the healthy, ruddy appearance of the Orphans generally; for notwithstanding a strong prejudice against it in this country, a more wholesome, nutritious article of diet certainly does not exist.

40|$|Most {{analyses}} of technical efficiency and productivity {{focus on the}} activities of firms or institutions using inputs to produce outputs. In this paper, we report {{the results of an}} efficiency analysis that is couched in a different context. We analyse the efficiency with which physical characteristics of individual lot-fed Australian beef cattle are combined with conventional inputs to produce a final product with several attributes that consumers value. Data on 214 animals across seven breeds were used to estimate a stochastic input distance function with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Estimates were obtained after controlling for differences between breeds, seasons and sex. Because of variations in feeding regimes for different markets, the data set was confined to animals whose meat was destined for the Korean export market. Technical efficiency measures are reported for each animal, along with the estimated mean technical efficiency. The conventional inputs included in the analysis are feed and number of days in a feedlot (reflecting capital, veterinary and supervisory inputs). Physical measures of cattle traits on their entry into the feedlot are age, liveweight, muscle score, eye muscle area, rump fat depth and rib fat depth. Outputs are carcass weight, meat quality (assessed by using sensory scores on tenderness, juiciness, flavour and overall acceptability), marbling and the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> weight retained after cooking. A high mean technical efficiency was estimated for the cattle but it was found that breeds have significantly different output frontiers and inefficiency levels. These differences are most likely associated with variation in genetic merit between sires within a breed and the different farming and climatic backgrounds of cohorts of animals. Results are reported on the input-output relationships as well as the relationships between the outputs. Important findings in respect of output relationships in this sample are that the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> weight retained after cooking is highly significantly and positively associated with the meat quality sensory score, and carcass weight is significantly and negatively associated with the meat quality sensory score. No significant relationship was discerned between carcass weight and the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> weight retained after cooking. beef, feedlot, input distance function, meat quality, scope economies, technical efficiency, Livestock Production/Industries, Productivity Analysis,...|$|R

BOHUSLÁVEK Technical faculty, Czech University of Agriculture in Prague, Czech Republic ABSTRACT: Based on a statistical analysis of data acquired {{in the process of}} instrument testing (video image analysis, bioelectrical impedance analysis) for objective classification, the objective character of the criteria for classification of conformation and fatness was also identified. During the tests, inspectors subjectively classified 118 young bulls and carried out their detailed dissection. The analysis identified significant correlations between conformation and weight of beef carcass (correlation coefficient r = 0. 82) and its cuts. In addition, the analysis revealed almost a zero correlation between conformation and the relative (percentage) <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> in beef carcass. On the contrary, the estimated fatness proved a close dependence on the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> fat in the whole carcass and in its separate cuts. During the analysis of a group of animals with similar fatness values, significant correlations were identified between conformation and the relative <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> saleable <b>meat</b> and meat I – large cuts (r = 0. 758). It is evident from the data ascertained in this way that an estimate of fatness is very important for the actual quality of the carcass and <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> its lean <b>meat.</b> The analysis also revealed that the fatness as an autonomous criterion offers a relatively precise estimate of the fat content in carcass...|$|R
