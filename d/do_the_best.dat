The stuntmen, dressed in woolen costumes, {{were in danger}} of catching pneumonia. Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, the crew had to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> they could. Batteries drained after minutes of filming in the cold, and the lack of snow was compensated by dropping fake precipitation into the scene by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|By 02:15 on 30 April one CH-46 and one CH-53 were {{landing at}} the Embassy every 10 minutes. At this time, the Embassy {{indicated}} that another 19 lifts would complete the evacuation. At that time Major Kean {{estimated that there}} were still some 850 non-American evacuees and 225 Americans (including the Marines), and Ambassador Martin told Major Kean to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> he could. At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to move all the remaining evacuees {{into the parking lot}} LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to the rooftop LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that President Ford had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to the rooftop LZ for evacuation.|$|E

When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (phronesis) and their intellect (nous) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.|$|E

500|$|George {{dictated}} {{his will}} in May and became very devout {{in his final}} months, confessing to an archdeacon that he repented of his early dissolute life, but hoped mercy would be shown {{to him as he}} had always tried to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> for his subjects. By June, he was unable to lie down, and received the Sacrament on 14 June in the presence of Lady Conyngham, Halford and a clergyman.

500|$|The team {{aimed for}} Marlene's {{physical}} design {{to make her}} look [...] "capable and in control", while conveying compassion, to result in players believing that she does care for Ellie.

Though she personally believed that Marlene is a fundamentally [...] "good" [...] person, Dandridge felt that the ambiguous morality of the characters is a significant contributor to the interest in their humanity.
