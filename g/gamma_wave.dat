25|$|The Temporal Binding Hypothesis has {{a history}} in {{neuroscience}} which spans back to at least the early 1980s.

A decade later Francis Crick & Christof Koch developed the model further by explaining the synchronization of distant neurons by transient <b>gamma</b> <b>wave</b> oscillations being guided by attention.

25|$|The most {{prominent}} eye-induced artifacts {{are caused by}} the potential difference between the cornea and retina, which is quite large compared to cerebral potentials. When the eyes and eyelids are completely still, this corneo-retinal dipole does not affect EEG. However, blinks occur several times per minute, the eyes movements occur several times per second. Eyelid movements, occurring mostly during blinking or vertical eye movements, elicit a large potential seen mostly in {{the difference between the}} Electrooculography (EOG) channels above and below the eyes. An established explanation of this potential regards the eyelids as sliding electrodes that short-circuit the positively charged cornea to the extra-ocular skin. Rotation of the eyeballs, and consequently of the corneo-retinal dipole, increases the potential in electrodes towards which the eyes are rotated, and decrease the potentials in the opposing electrodes. Eye movements called saccades also generate transient electromyographic potentials, known as saccadic spike potentials (SPs). The spectrum of these SPs overlaps the gamma-band (see <b>Gamma</b> <b>wave),</b> and seriously confounds analysis of induced gamma-band responses, requiring tailored artifact correction approaches. Purposeful or reflexive eye blinking also generates electromyographic potentials, but more importantly there is reflexive movement of the eyeball during blinking that gives a characteristic artifactual appearance of the EEG (see Bell's phenomenon).|$|E

Thus, these pairings connect with Gestalt psychology and its theory that objects are seen independently of their separate pieces, in a more global manner. A study done by Gray, Konig, Engel and Singer in 1989 reported that when studying visual cortex cells, light moving in opposite directions had low relation to one another.

50|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>wave</b> thalamocortical {{oscillation}} is prominent during REM sleep, {{similar to}} the awakened, active brain. Contrary to the conscious state, however, it appears that sensory input may be blocked or gated from interfering with the intrinsic activity of the brain during REM. Measures of bulk electrical signalling in the brain by MEG show no impact of auditory stimuli on the <b>gamma</b> <b>wave</b> patterns; measurements on conscious subjects show a distinct modulation due to the auditory input. In this way, the thalamocortical system acts to gate the brain from external stimuli during REM.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>waves</b> were {{initially}} ignored before {{the development of}} digital electroencephalography as analog electroencephalography is restricted to recording and measuring rhythms that are usually less than 25 Hz. One of the earliest reports on them was in 1964 using recordings of the electrical activity of electrodes implanted in the visual cortex of awake monkeys.|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{potential}} oscillations in {{the range}} of 35 - 45 Hz (<b>gamma</b> <b>waves)</b> have recently been shown to occur rather ubiquitously in the brain of awake humans. During selective somatic attention, we demonstrate a transient phase-locking of the <b>gamma</b> <b>waves</b> generated in the contralateral prefrontal and parietal cortical areas that we had previously shown to be involved in such selective attention tasks. In line with other microphysiological evidence obtained on mammalian visual cortex, this selective functional synchronization between critical human brain areas (as far as about 9 cm apart) is proposed to reflect the transient 'binding' of discrete cognitive features that are processed in distributed neuronal assemblies of the brain whereby the conscious perception of an object or event can be achieved. On this basis we emphasize that the conscious function of the brain is neither epiphenomenal nor delayed, but operates transiently to integrate relevant perceptual features at the time of target object identification and of conscious behavioural decision.

50|$|Thus {{the claim}} is that when all these {{neuronal}} clusters oscillate together during these transient periods of synchronized firing, they help bring up memories and associations from the visual percept to other notions. This brings a distributed matrix of cognitive processes together to generate a coherent, concerted cognitive act, such as perception. This has led to theories that <b>gamma</b> <b>waves</b> are associated with solving the binding problem.|$|R

50|$|Many neuroscientists are not {{convinced}} of the <b>gamma</b> <b>wave</b> argument.

2500|$|In EEG recordings, REM {{sleep is}} {{characterized}} by high frequency, low amplitude activity and spontaneous occurrence of beta and <b>gamma</b> <b>waves.</b> The best candidates for generation of these fast frequency waves are fast rhythmic bursting neurons in corticothalamic circuits.

50|$|Gamma-range {{oscillations}} are not {{the only}} rhythms associated with conscious thought and activity. Thalamocortical alpha frequency oscillations have been noted in the human occipital-parietal cortex. This activity could be originated by the pyramidal neurons in layer IV. It has been shown that alpha rhythms seem {{to be related to the}} focus of one's attention: external focus on visual tasks diminishes alpha activity while internal focus as in heavy working memory tasks show an increase in alpha magnitudes.

5000|$|The {{ability to}} {{consciously}} detect an image when presented at near-threshold stimulus varies across presentations.

50|$|No {{effects are}} {{produced}} by current alternations at the theta wave or <b>gamma</b> <b>wave</b> frequencies. These experiments make tACS a potentially interesting tool to investigate the causal role of oscillatory synchrony in cortical processing. But the claim that tACS phosphenes originate in the visual cortex has been disputed; the alternative claim is that current spread from the occipital electrode evokes phosphenes in the retina. The frequency dependence of the phosphene strength can also be explained by retinal ganglion cell dynamics. Hence experiments involving tACS applied at the visual cortex needs appropriate control studies {{to rule out the}} retinal interference.|$|E
5000|$|Stochastic {{resonance}} {{has been}} observed in the neural tissue of the sensory systems of several organisms. Computationally, neurons exhibit SR because of non-linearities in their processing.

Single neurons in vitro including cerebellar Purkinje cells and squid giant axon could also demonstrate the inverse stochastic resonance, when spiking is inhibited by synaptic noise of a particular variance.|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>gamma</b> <b>waves</b> {{have been}} observed in Tibetan Buddhist monks. A 2004 study took eight long-term Tibetan Buddhist practitioners of meditation and, using electrodes, monitored the patterns of electrical activity produced by their brains as they meditated. The researchers compared the brain activity of the monks {{to a group of}} novice meditators (the study had these subjects meditate an hour a day for one week prior to empirical observation). In a normal meditative state, both groups were shown to have similar brain activity. However, when the monks were told to generate an objective feeling of compassion during meditation, their brain activity began to fire in a rhythmic, coherent manner, suggesting neuronal structures were firing in harmony. This was observed at a frequency of 25-40 Hz, the rhythm of <b>gamma</b> <b>waves.</b> These gamma-band oscillations in the monk’s brain signals were the largest seen in humans (apart from those in states such as seizures). Conversely, these gamma-band oscillations were scant in novice meditators. Though, a number of rhythmic signals did appear to strengthen in beginner meditators with further experience in the exercise, implying that the aptitude for one to produce gamma-band rhythm is trainable.|$|R
25|$|Most {{experiments}} {{show that}} one neural correlate of attention is enhanced firing. If a neuron {{has a certain}} response to a stimulus when the animal is not attending to the stimulus, then when the animal does attend to the stimulus, the neuron's response will be enhanced even if the physical characteristics of the stimulus remain the same. In many cases attention produces changes in the EEG. Many animals, including humans, produce <b>gamma</b> <b>waves</b> (40–60Hz) when focusing attention on a particular object or activity.|$|R
