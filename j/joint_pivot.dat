40|$|A digital creature’s {{performance}} {{can be thought}} of as a combina-tion of specifically defined motion and form; a combination that allows the viewer to comprehend the creature’s action and intent. Computer graphics offers a variety of methods for defining motion including key-frame animation, data-driven action, rule-based and physically-based motion. However, all of these methods can be complex and time-consuming to implement. Essentially, most com-puter animation methods force the animator to think about motion at a low-level of abstraction. To create animation tools that simplify the process of creating expressive motion, we need to allow anima-tors to work at a high-level of abstraction. We need determine the minimal elements of form and motion that visually communicate a maximal amount of information about an actor’s identity or in-tentions.

40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} {{to the understanding of}} the combination of in vivo sternum displacement, sternal angle variations and sternocostal joints (SCJ) kinematics of the seven first rib pairs over the inspiratory capacity (IC). Retrospective codified spiral-CT data obtained at total lung capacity (TLC), middle of inspiratory capacity (MIC) and at functional residual capacity (FRC) were used to compute kinematic parameters of the bones and joints of interest in a sample of 12 asymptomatic subjects. 3 D models of rib, thoracic vertebra, manubrium and sternum were processed to determine anatomical landmarks (ALs) on each bone. These ALs were used to create local coordinate system and compute spatial transformation of ribs and manubrium relative to sternum, and sternum relative to thoracic vertebra. The rib angular displacements and associated orientation of rotation axes and <b>joint</b> <b>pivot</b> points (JPP), the sternal angle variations and the associated displacement of the sternum relative to vertebra were computed between each breathing pose at the three lung volumes. Results can be summarized as following: (1) sternum cephalic displacement ranged between 17. 8 and 19. 2 mm over the IC; (2) the sternal angle showed a mean variation of 4. 4 °± 2. 7 ° over the IC; (3) ranges of rib rotation relative to sternum decreased gradually with increasing rib level; (4) axes of rotation were similarly oriented at each SCJ; (5) JPP spatial displacements showed less variations at first SCJ compared to levels underneath; (6) linear relation was demonstrated between SCJ ROMs and sternum cephalic displacement over the IC. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Building upon the Sebenza’s success, the Umnumzaan features: a stronger <b>pivot</b> <b>joint,</b> a thicker blade, a different blade grind with a reinforced tip, improved ergonomics, thicker titanium handles, a thicker titanium lock bar, a stronger ceramic ball detent system, a larger titanium spacer (sometimes called a “stand off”), a phosphor-bronze washer system designed to act as a ‘dry-sump’ to retain lubrication and keep dirt out, an oversized ambidextrous-thumb studs & extended lock bar to aid operation when wearing gloves, a lanyard <b>pivot</b> <b>joint</b> that uses <b>pivoting</b> lanyard tie bars, and a deeply textured grip.|$|R

25|$|The knife also {{features}} a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip {{is part of the}} blade itself which protrudes from the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve folding knife to incorporate a lanyard <b>pivot</b> <b>joint,</b> which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord lanyards. It also allows easy swapping of lanyards without a need to cut and retie if the owner has multiple lanyard pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The lanyard <b>pivot</b> <b>joint</b> has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.|$|R

The effects of rib curvature variation for bonded joints were found to be negligible. Rib slenderness for both joints did not influence the coefficient of thermal expansion.

40|$|We present here {{a method}} and some tools {{developed}} to build linear models of multi-body systems for space applications (typically satellites).

Each appendage can {{be connected to the}} hub by a cantilever <b>joint</b> or a <b>pivot</b> <b>joint.</b> More generally, our method can be applied to any open mechanical chain. In our approach, the rigid six degrees of freedom (d. o. f) (three translational and three rotational) are treated all together. That is very convenient to build linear models of complex multi-body systems. Then, the dynamics model used to design AOCS, i. e. the model between forces and torques (applied on the hub) and angular and linear position and velocity of the hub, can be derived very easily. This model can be interpreted using block diagram representation...|$|R

25|$|A {{dynamically}} tuned gyroscope (DTG) is a rotor {{suspended by}} a universal <b>joint</b> with flexure <b>pivots.</b> The flexure spring stiffness {{is independent of}} spin rate.

50|$|<b>Pivot</b> <b>joints</b> {{allow for}} rotation, {{which can be}} {{external}} (for example when rotating an arm outward), or internal (as in rotating an arm inward). When rotating the forearm, these movements are typically called pronation and supination.

In contrast, a forearm in pronation would have the palm facing backward and the thumb would be closer to the body, pointing medially.|$|R
