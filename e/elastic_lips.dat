40|$|The {{system is}} {{particularly}} for disc- or washer-type workpieces of rigid or elastic material. These are discharged from a storage hopper (2) by a conveyor (8), with which a scraper mechanism (15) works, together forming the outlet gap (18). The conveyor {{can be of}} the linear type, particularly with a belt or vibrator. The scraper can be formed by a rotary component on a vertical or horizontal axis, and turning against the conveyor working direction or a rigid baffle plate. The height or width of the gap can be adjustable. The rotary component can have <b>elastic</b> <b>lips,</b> brushes or spherical bodies round the periphery. USE/ADVANTAGE - Highly reliable discharge and orientation of workpieces from heap...|$|E
40|$|The {{partition}} wall components are column structures (1) with elliptical or round cross-section. The ring cords (3) are insertable in groove-shaped ring cord guides (2) in adjacent column structures (1). The ring cord guides are arranged {{at the upper}} and lower ends of the column structures. The ring cords (3) are of an elastic material. The column structures are formed from two interconnected half shells. The column structures have <b>elastic</b> sealing <b>lips</b> (4) or on opposing longitudinal straight sides incisions and nose-shaped projections which engage one another. The lips or the incisions and projections are on contact surfaces with adjacent column structures. ADVANTAGE - The {{partition wall}} is easy to erect and is flexibly inserted and arranged...|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies have}} shown soft tissue profile changes after {{orthodontic}} treatment in Class II Division 1 patients. Kirjavainen et al [2] found that after cervical headgear treatment, the nasolabial angle was increased and the interlabial gap was decreased, indicating upper lip retrusion, while the lip thickness and depth of the chin did not change. The upper and lower lips were retrusive after orthodontic treatment involving extraction of four premolars [3 â€“ 5]. After using Class II intermaxillary <b>elastics,</b> the lower <b>lip</b> advanced relatively more than the upper lip and this contributed to an improvement of the lip relationship [6].|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the flow}} of {{polymeric}} fluids is important for optimizing commercial processes such as injection molding and fiber spinning. The combination of streamwise curvature and elastic normal stresses {{can lead to the}} onset of elastic flow instabilities, severely rate-limiting such processes. This thesis focuses on the stability of two complex non-Newtonian flows of dilute polystyrene solutions: the viscometric flow between a rotating cone-and-plate and the flow through an axisymmetric contraction-expansion. Torsional shear flows of elastic fluids with closed streamlines can accumulate heat from viscous dissipation resulting in spatial nonuniformities in the temperature profile and viscometric properties. In this thesis, a detailed study of the effect of viscous heating on the steady shearing of elastic fluids between a rotating cone-and-plate is performed. The relative importance of viscous heating and elasticity can be quantified by a new dimensionless thermoelastic number. This parameter is a fluid material property which is a function of polymer molecular weight, geometry and temperature. As the thermoelastic number is increased, strong temperature gradients reduce the elasticity of the test fluid and delay the onset of the instability, eventually stabilizing the flow completely. The flow of elastic fluids into an axisymmetric abrupt contraction-expansion is a complex flow containing regions of both shear and extension that tests the limits of current viscoelastic constitutive models. (cont.) A large extra pressure drop above that measured for a similar Newtonian fluid is documented and found to correlate to the stress-conformation hysteresis observed in transient uniaxial extension measurements. Laser Doppler velocimetry, particle image velocimetry and flow induced birefringence are used to investigate the global kinematics upstream of contraction-expansions of various contraction ratios and degrees of re-entrant corner curvature. For a contraction ratio of beta= 2 a steady <b>elastic</b> <b>lip</b> vortex is observed whereas for 4 <beta< 8, no lip vortex is observed and instead a corner vortex is seen. At large Deborah numbers a time-dependent elastic flow instability is observed. Measurements of the transient extensional rheology show that the differing vortex growth pathways in viscoelastic fluids can be systematically understood in terms of a dimensionless ratio of the normal stress differences in shear and in extension. by Jonathan P.

40|$|International audiencePhysical high-fidelity {{models of}} brass {{instruments}} {{are available in}} the literature, but controlling them to obtain a proper musical restitution is still a challenge. The inversion of the model from a unique observation, namely the sound produced by the instrument, is therefore a natural way to deal with this situation. The observer design problem consisting in an estimation of the vibro-acoustic state of the system is essential for that purpose. The observer design problem was addressed in [@AN 10] for an elementary brass system using <b>elastic</b> player <b>lips</b> and straight pipe models. A neutral system representation of the system and Lyapunov methods were used; a proof of the observer stability was obtained and simulations have demonstrated that the estimation method is robust in the presence of noisy measurements. However no adaptation to the noise power was performed, leading to a rate of convergence of the observer that was suboptimal. Moreover, as the observer dynamics was related to the uncoupled lips dynamics, the response could be slow and oscillatory. Using a representation of the same brass model as a delay-differential algebraic system [@B 13], together with a sensitivity analysis and Kalman filter theory, we address these limitations through a new observer design resulting in a substantial improvement of the observer rate of convergence...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the outcome of nonextraction edgewise orthodontic treatment of thirty-five caucasian patients with Class II molar relationships (13 division 1 and 22 division 2 cases). Twenty-three females and 12 males aged between 10 and 16 years old were treated using Class II intermaxillary elastics worn with 0. 016 " x 0. 022 " stainless steel archwires and without extra-oral traction. Thirty cephalometric landmarks were identified and digitized, and used to calculate 41 parameters. Space analyses were conducted on pretreatment study models. Most of the cases had between 0 - 4 mm space shortage in both maxillary and mandibular dentitions. Results of this study indicated that the mean SNA angle decreased by 1. 580 degrees, and that this change was largely due to posterior movement of point A. The mean pre-treatment ANB value was 4. 490 degrees which decreased to a mean posttreatment value of 2. 810 degrees (p< 0. 05). No {{significant changes in the}} growth direction of the jaws were found, showing that the use of Class II intermaxillary elastics in this sample had no detrimental effect on this parameter (p< 0. 05). The SNB angle increased by a mean of 0. 110 degrees, which can be attributed to anterior mandibular growth. The dentoalveolar changes included a mean overjet reduction of 3. 816 mm (mean posttreatment overjet was 2. 2 mm) and proclination of the lower incisors relative to the APo line and the mandibular plane, probably caused by the use of Class II intermaxillary <b>elastics.</b> The lower <b>lip</b> advanced relatively more than the upper lip, and this contributed to an improvement of the lip relationship. The amount of nose growth observed during the study was normal for this age group, and compared favourably with other data in the literature. Revie...|$|R
