5|$|In March 2017, to {{coincide}} with International Women's Day and Women's History Month, the Tory Burch Foundation launched Embrace Ambition, a global campaign to address the <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> that exists around ambition, which is often seen as a positive trait in men and a negative one in women. The campaign includes a video PSA featuring a variety of celebrities, both women and men. In September 2017, Burch wrote an opinion piece in TIME on pay equity for women, noting how equal pay benefits society and business across the board.|$|E
5|$|Utami {{has also}} noted that the novel is a {{reflection}} of her own restlessness and anxiety. Although little of it directly reflects events in her life, she notes that Saman's loss of religion reflects her own, and the book reflects her belief that a <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> exists regarding virginity in Indonesian culture. Although the novel touches on racial harmony, Utami said that she considers the theme to be undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|During the 1946 postseason, rumors {{began to}} swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was {{lobbying}} Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher {{to leave the}} Dodgers and manage the Yankees. The move angered Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, who encouraged Chandler to begin {{an investigation into the}} gambling habits of Durocher and his associate, actor George Raft. In the offseason, Chandler and Durocher had a meeting wherein Chandler counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling. Branch Rickey charged Chandler with maintaining a <b>double</b> <b>standard,</b> however, when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees–Dodgers preseason exhibition in Havana, Cuba. MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches—Chuck Dressen and John Corriden—as aides to Yankee manager Bucky Harris while they were still employed by the Dodgers. Chandler suspended Dressen for 30 days and levied $2,000 fines against MacPhail and the Yankees.|$|E
40|$|Split-ballot {{data are}} often used to study <b>double</b> <b>standards.</b> The key problem of this design is that {{individual}} <b>double</b> <b>standards</b> cannot be identified. We propose a simple two-step approach based on a matching pre-processing of the data to estimate individual <b>double</b> <b>standards.</b> Once this preliminary first step is completed, any statistical technique (e. g., regression models) can be applied on the new data. We illustrate the method with an application concerning gender <b>double</b> <b>standards</b> on attitudes toward age at leaving home {{using data from the}} third round of the European Social Survey. We show that the proposed method simplifies regression analyses of the effects of covariates on <b>double</b> <b>standards</b> and offers new opportunities for research on <b>double</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|While Jyllands-Posten has {{published}} satirical cartoons depicting Christian figures, it rejected unsolicited cartoons in 2003 which depicted Jesus, opening it to accusations of a <b>double</b> <b>standard.</b> In February 2006, Jyllands-Posten refused to publish Holocaust cartoons, which included cartoons that mocked or denied the Holocaust, offered by an Iranian newspaper which had held a contest. Six {{of the less}} controversial images were later published by Dagbladet Information, after the editors consulted the main rabbi in Copenhagen, and three cartoons were later reprinted in Jyllands-Posten. After the competition had finished, Jyllands-Posten also reprinted the winning and runner-up cartoons.|$|E
5|$|In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} make the claim for gender {{equality}} using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s, as {{baby boomers}} were {{entering}} high school, {{there was a}} growing backlash against enforced nude male swimming and by the 1970s, it had largely been phased out along with gender integration of pools.

50|$|The 1880s saw the {{so-called}} Sedlighetsdebatten (Virtue Debate), where gender roles were discussed in literary debates {{in regards to}} sexual <b>double</b> <b>standards,</b> as opposed to sexual equality.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{investigate}} gender differences in the use of <b>double</b> <b>standards</b> in ethical judgements of questionable conduct instigated by business or consumers. We investigate if consumers are more critical towards unethical corporate versus consumer actions and if these <b>double</b> <b>standards</b> depend on the gender of the respondent. In the first study, we compared evaluations of four specific unethical actions (cfr. DePaulo, 1987) instigated by either the consumer or the corporation. In a second study, we investigated the perception of some general consumer and corporate (un) ethical actions in addition to DePaulo’s unethical scenarios. Both researches show that females use less <b>double</b> <b>standards</b> when it comes to their own (un) ethical behaviour compared to corporate (un) ethical actions. Furthermore, gender differences in the use of <b>double</b> <b>standards</b> depend on the type of unethical behaviour. Limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed.

25|$|Josephine Butler, already {{experienced}} in prostitution issues, a charismatic leader, and a seasoned campaigner, {{emerged as the}} natural leader of what became the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts in 1869. Her work demonstrated the potential power of an organized lobby group. The association successfully argued that the Acts not only demeaned prostitutes, but all women and men by promoting a blatant sexual <b>double</b> <b>standard.</b> Butler's activities resulted in the radicalization of many moderate women.

25|$|Amnesty International (AI) {{has been}} accused by the American Jewish Congress and NGO Monitor of having a <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> with its {{assessment}} of Israel. Professor Alan Dershowitz, an American legal scholar and columnist for the Huffington Post, has attacked Amnesty International's perceived bias against Israel, claiming that AI absolves Palestinian men of responsibility for domestic violence and places the blame on Israel instead and that it illegitimately characterises legal acts of Israeli self-defence as war-crimes. Dershowitz has joined NGO Monitor's calls for an independent evaluation of anti-Israeli bias within the organisation.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{recognition}} of Abkhazia and South Ossetia {{is also an}} issue. On one hand, Circassians are often highly enthusiastic to help the Abkhaz, who they view as brothers, and are enthusiastic also for Abkhazia's independence. On the other hand, however, it evidences a perceived <b>double</b> <b>standard</b> used negatively on the Chechens (whom many Circassians supported during the First Chechen War), {{and to a lesser}} extent, the Circassians as well. Paul Goble noted that the {{recognition of}} South Ossetia, in addition to enraging the Chechens and Ingush, also radicalized many Circassians against Russia, because of the mass of double standards.|$|E

25|$|The legal code of Moroland was reformed. Disputes between Moros and non-Christians {{had been}} left to Moro laws and customs, with Philippine laws only {{applying}} to disputes with Christians. This led to a <b>double</b> <b>standard,</b> with a Moro who killed a Christian facing a stiff prison sentence, but with a Moro who killed another Moro facing only a maximum fine of 150 pesos. Wood attempted to codify Moro law, but there was simply too much variance in laws and customs between the different tribes and even between neighboring cottas. Wood placed the Moros underneath the Philippine criminal code, but actual enforcement of this proved difficult.|$|E
