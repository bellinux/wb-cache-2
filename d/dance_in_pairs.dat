50|$|Traditional Eritrean Tigrinya dancing {{involves}} {{two main}} styles of dance. In the first {{which is called}} 'quda', the dancers form a circle and slowly circumambulator or move around in an endless circular motion {{to the rhythm of}} the music. Then, they cease the circular musical flow/motion and <b>dance</b> <b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> or 3's facing each other for a short while before resuming the circular motion in a file again. During this time, they shuffle their feet to the beat of the music and bob their shoulders in a rhythmic fashion. Female dancers usually move their shoulders more than the male dancers. Towards the end, the musical tempo increases and the drum beat quickens to signal this musical crescendo. The dancers round off their dancing by facing each other in twos and threes and moving their shoulders faster. This can also involve jumping and bending one's knees, as well as going down to the floor to sit in a squatting position while bobbing those shoulders and moving the head sideways to the strong drum beats.|$|E

50|$|The goti puas are boy dancers who {{dress up}} as girls. They are {{students}} of the akhadas, or gymnasia, established by Ramachandradeva in Puri, in {{the periphery of the}} temple. As they were offshoots of the akhada system, goti puas also {{came to be known as}} akhada pilas - boys attached to akhadas. Another reason often given to justify the emergence of the goti pua system is that some followers of the Vaishnava religion disapproved of dancing by women as a pretext for worship - they introduced the practice of dancing by boys dressed as girls.The word goti means 'one', 'single' and pua, 'boy', but the goti puas always <b>dance</b> <b>in</b> <b>pairs.</b> Boys are recruited about the age of six and continue to perform till they are 14, then become teachers of the dance or join drama parties. Goti puas are now part of professional teams, known as dals, each headed by a guru.The boys are trained for about two years, during which, after having imbibed the basic technique, they learn items of dance, ornamental and expressional. The goti puas, being youngsters in their formative years, can adapt their bodies to the dance in a far more flexible manner as opposed to the maharis.A goti pua presentation is ably supported by a set of three musicians, who play the pakhawaj, the gini or cymbals and the harmonium. The boys do the singing themselves, though at times the group has an additional singer.|$|E
50|$|Jongos {{usually take}} place during a nightlong party in which several people <b>dance</b> <b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> or in a circle, {{to the sound}} of two or more drums, while a soloist sings short phrases {{answered}} by the group. The drums, built from hollow tree trunks covered with animal hide in one of the extremities and tuned by the heat of a bonfire, are called caxambu or tambu (the bigger one) and candongueiro (the smaller one). Other instruments can also be used, such as a large and low-pitched friction drum, called puíta or angoma-puíta, and a rattle made of straw and small beads, called guaiá, inguaiá, or angóia. Jongo songs, also called pontos, are sung in Portuguese but may include words of African origin. Often improvised, they are of several types, each one with a particular function: the pontos de louvação are used to salute spiritual entities, the owners {{of the house and the}} ancestors; the pontos de visaria or bizarria are sung for fun purposes, to enliven the dancers or as a vehicle for satirical commentaries; the pontos de demanda, porfia, or gurumenta are used by singers who challenge eachOn the coffee plantations during the nineteenth century, jongos occupied an intermediate position between religious ceremony and secular diversion. Performed on weekends or on the eve of holidays, they were often the only form of entertainment available to the slaves, and also the only opportunity to perform forbidden African religious rites, even if disguised as profane dances. The use of African terms, combined with a rich metaphorical language, made jongo songs obscure to the white masters, thus providing a means for the expression of social criticism and cryptic messages from one slave to the others.|$|E

When the Kalmyks came to Russia their dances were influenced by those of their new neighbors.

Kalmyk women’s dances are usually performed smoothly, involving the waiving of both hands that imitate the flight of birds. The sleeves in women’s dance costumes are wide. In contrast, the movement of male dancers is more rhythmic and complex.
