40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{most common}} process in image {{analysis}} is noise reduction, {{with the objective}} of diminishing image components considered to be extraneous. This paper presents an <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>Program</b> that evolves image noise reduction procedures in form of dynamical rules for Cellular Automata. The method takes advantage of the pattern processing capabilities of Cellular Automata combined with the search power of <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>Programs.</b> The fitness function that guides the evolutionary search consists on a measure of the noise reduction quality obtained from the application of the Cellular Automata on a set of reference images conveniently contaminated with several levels of white noise. The method is applied both to simple monochromatic and 256 grayscale images, with different noise content, observing a performance comparable or better to that of traditional noise reduction methods. This work shows that the hybridization of Cellular Automata with <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>Programs</b> is a very promising approach for the implementation of general adaptive image processing tools...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Typical {{applications}} of evolutionary optimization involve the off-line approximation of extrema of static multi-modal functions. Methods which use a vari-ety of techniques to self-adapt mutation parameters {{have been shown}} to be more suc-cessful than methods which do not use self-adaptation. For dynamic functions, the interest is not to obtain the extrema but to follow it as closely as possible. This paper compares the on-line extrema tracking performance of an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>program</b> with-out self-adaptation against an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>program</b> using a self-adaptive Gaussian update rule over a number of dynamics applied to a simple static function. The experi-ments demonstrate that for some dynamic functions, self-adaptation is effective while for others it is detrimental. ...|$|R

40|$|An <b>evolutionary</b> <b>program,</b> {{based on}} a real-code genetic {{algorithm}} (GA), is applied to calculate optimal control policies for bioreactors. The GA {{is used as a}} nonlinear optimizer in combination with simulation software and constraint handling procedures. A new class of GA-operators is introduced to obtain smooth control trajectories, which leads also to a drastic reduction in computational load. The proposed method is easy to understand and has no restrictions on the model type and structure. The performance and optimal trajectories obtained by the extended GA are compared with those calculated with two common methods: (i) dynamic programming, and (ii) a Hamiltonian based gradient algorithm. The GA proved to be a good and often superior alternative for solving optimal control problems. 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|<b>Evolutionary</b> <b>programs</b> (EPs) and <b>evolutionary</b> pattern search {{algorithms}} (EPSAs) are {{two general}} classes of evolutionary methods for optimizing on continuous domains. The relative performance {{of these methods}} has been evaluated on standard global optimization test functions, and {{these results suggest that}} EPSAs more robustly converge to nearoptimal solutions than EPs. In this paper we evaluate the relative performance of EPSAs and EPs on a real-world application: flexible ligand binding in the Autodock docking software. We compare the performance of these methods on a suite of docking test problems. Our results confirm that EPSAs and EPs have comparable performance, and they suggest that EPSAs may be more robust on larger, more complex problems. 1 Introduction <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>programs</b> (EPs) and <b>evolutionary</b> pattern search algorithms (EPSAs) are two classes of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that have been specifically developed for solving problems of the form min x 2 R n f(x) : In particula [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{computation}} is {{a promising}} technique for automating time-consuming and expensive software maintenance tasks, including bug repair. The {{success of this}} approach, however, depends at least partially on the choice of representation, fitness function, and operators. Previous work on evolutionary software repair has employed different approaches, {{but they have not}} yet been evaluated in depth. This paper investigates representation and operator choices for source-level <b>evolutionary</b> <b>program</b> repair in the GenProg framework [17], focusing on: (1) representation of individual variants, (2) crossover design, (3) mutation operators, and (4) search space definition. We evaluate empirically on a dataset comprising 8 C programs totaling over 5. 1 million lines of code and containing 105 reproducible, humanconfirmed defects. Our results provide concrete suggestions for operator and representation design choices for <b>evolutionary</b> <b>program</b> repair. When augmented to incorporate these suggestions, GenProg repairs 5 additional bugs (60 vs. 55 out of 105), with a decrease in repair time of 17 – 43 % for the more difficult repair searches...|$|R

40|$|<b>Evolutionary</b> <b>program</b> {{induction}} using binary {{machine code}} {{is the fastest}} known Genetic Programming method. It is, in addition, the most well studied Genetic Programming system that uses a linear genome. This chapter describes recent advances in genetic programming of machine code. <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>program</b> induction using binary machine code was originally referred to as Compiling Genetic Programming System (CGPS). For clarity, the name was changed in early 1998 to Automatic Induction of Machine Code—Genetic Programming (AIM-GP). AIM-GP stores evolved programs as linear strings of native binary machine code, which are directly executed by the processor. The absence of an interpreter and complex memory handling increases the speed of AIM-GP by about two orders of magnitude. AIM-GP {{has so far been}} applied to processors with a fixed instruction length (RISC) using integer and floating-point arithmetic. We also describe several recent advances in the AIM-GP technology. Such advances include enabling the induction of code for CISC processors such as the INTEL x 86 as well as JAVA and many embedded processors. The new techniques also make AIM-GP more portable in general and simplify the adaptation to any processor architecture. Other additions include the use of floating point instructions, control flow instructions, ADFs and new genetic operators e. g. aligned homologous crossover.
