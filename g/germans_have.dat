5|$|On 19 November 1941, Sydney was {{involved}} in a mutually destructive engagement with the , and was lost with all 645 aboard. The wrecks of both ships were lost until 2008; Sydney was found on 17 March, five days after her adversary. Sydneys defeat is commonly attributed to the proximity of the two ships during the engagement, and Kormorans advantages of surprise and rapid, accurate fire. However, the cruiser's loss with all hands compared to the survival of most of the <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> resulted in controversy, with some alleging that the German commander used illegal ruses to lure Sydney into range, that a Japanese submarine {{was involved}}, and that the true events of the battle are concealed behind a wide-ranging cover up.|$|E
5|$|Phil Read and Max Biaggi {{have won}} the most championships, with four each. Dani Pedrosa is the {{youngest}} to win the championship; he was 19 years and 18 days old {{when he won the}} championship in 2004.

Riders from Great Britain have won the second most; four riders have won a total of nine championships. <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> won the third most, as four riders have won a total of seven championships. Bruno Ruffo won the inaugural championship in 1949. Hiroshi Aoyama was the last rider to win the 250cc championship in 2009. Toni Elías was the first champion of the Moto2 category. Franco Morbidelli is the current champion.|$|E

25|$|The Poles' {{resistance}} in Warsaw is a Jewish resistance.

What is happening on the frontier with Bukovina is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country.

500|$|Patton {{developed}} {{an ability to}} deliver charismatic speeches, {{in part because he}} had trouble with reading. He used profanity heavily in his speech, which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command but offended other generals, including Bradley. The most famous of his speeches were a series he delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord. When speaking, he was known for his bluntness and witticism; he once said, [...] "The two most dangerous weapons the <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> are our own armored halftrack and jeep. The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic, thinking they are in a tank. The jeep because we have so many God-awful drivers." [...] During the Battle of the Bulge, he famously remarked that the Allies should [...] "let the sons-of-bitches [...] {{go all the way to}} Paris, then we'll cut them off and round them up." [...] He also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could [...] "drive the British back into the sea for another Dunkirk." ...|$|E
500|$|Lody {{returned}} to Edinburgh on 17 September, taking the train from King's Cross to Edinburgh. He met a young Scottish woman, Ida McClyment, gave her his card {{and talked with}} her a while before going into another carriage to smoke. There he overheard a conversation between two men, one apparently a submariner travelling to the naval base at Rosyth {{and the other a}} sailor who talked about Harwich. Lody later professed his surprise at how the two men were [...] "talking in a rather free way, considering the present times". One of the men talked about the difficulties of serving on a submarine, while the other asked Lody: [...] "What country are you? Are you from the other side?" [...] Lody replied, [...] "Yes, I am an American." [...] They began discussing the war and talked about the recent sinking of the cruiser HMS Pathfinder, which had become the first ship ever to be sunk by a torpedo fired by a submarine. The sailor told Lody, [...] "We are going to put out mines as the <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> done so. We have a big surprise in store for the Germans." [...] Lody was not convinced and, after shaking hands with the sailor, left the smoking car.|$|E

Hamburg, Munich and Cologne also saw big demonstrations. The New York Times reported that [...] "most <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> a deep-seated aversion to nuclear power, and the damage at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan has galvanized opposition".|$|E
2500|$|The Baltic Germans ( [...] , later Baltendeutsche) are ethnic German {{inhabitants}} of the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea, in what today are Estonia and Latvia.

2500|$|German analysts {{rejected}} the French concept of mixed horse-and-motor troops as unworkable. The Wehrmacht {{had its own}} opponents of mechanization, but with Adolf Hitler's support Ludwig Beck, Werner von Fritsch and Heinz Guderian succeeded in forging a compact but effective panzer force that coexisted with masses of traditional foot infantry and horse-drawn artillery throughout World War II. Willis Crittenberger observed that [...] "the French are limited to the armored division, while the <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> created an armored branch." [...] By 1939 the Wehrmacht disbanded their 18 cavalry regiments, leaving a single active cavalry brigade; the cavalrymen with their war horses were integrated into infantry divisions.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there is}} a view that while {{it is likely that}} the Germans were expecting an attack somewhere on the French shoreline, {{evidence}} of expectation of an attack at Dieppe in particular, at that particular time, is less conclusive. [...] Proponents of this view point out that elements of the Canadian forces, such as at Green beach, landed without trouble. [...] Lt Col Merrit has been quoted as saying 'How could the <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> known if we got in on our beach against defences which were unmanned?' [...] No 4 Commando's troops also reported that they achieved surprise against the gun batteries they were tasked with destroying. [...] Under this view, the statements by German POWs that the raid was fully expected are explained as being propaganda.|$|E
