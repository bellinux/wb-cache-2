25|$|Furtwängler {{has never}} been a National Socialist. Nor <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> made any bones about it. Which Jews and emigrants thought was {{sufficient}} to consider him as one of them, a key representative of so-called 'inner emigration'. Furtwängler stance towards us has not changed in the least.|$|E
25|$|In a {{statement}} released on November 28, 2005, Dorgan responded by asserting {{that he has}} never personally met Jack Abramoff, nor <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> received money from Abramoff. Dorgan did acknowledge receiving money from Abramoff's clients, but the donations began prior to their involvement with Abramoff. Dorgan's statement {{went on to say that}} he has supported the programs that benefited Abramoff's clients years prior to the contribution.|$|E
500|$|Eaton: [...] "Have {{you ever}} seen {{anything}} {{in the conduct of}} General Babcock, or <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> said anything to you, which indicated to your mind that he was in any way interested in or concerned with the Whiskey Ring at St. Louis or elsewhere?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{little boy}} was spell-bound. Naught like this <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> seen or dreamed.|$|R
60|$|Not for wealth, in its vulgar sense, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> sighed; {{not for the}} {{enjoyment}} of rich things <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> longed; but for the allotted share of worldly bliss which a wife, and children, and happy home could give him, for that usual amount of comfort which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ventured to reject as unnecessary for him, he did now feel that <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> been wiser to have searched.|$|R
6000|$|... nor <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> before {{found his}} accomplishments treated as aught but matters of scorn among the princes and nobles with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{occasionally}} been thrown.|$|R
2500|$|Jack Limpert {{published}} {{evidence as}} early as 1974 that Felt was the informant. On June 25 of that year, {{a few weeks after}} All the President's Men was published, The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial, [...] "If You Drink Scotch, Smoke, Read, Maybe You're Deep Throat." [...] It began [...] "W. Mark Felt says he isn't now, nor <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> been Deep Throat." [...] The Journal quoted Felt saying the character was a [...] "composite" [...] and [...] "I'm just not that kind of person." [...] In 1975, George V. Higgins wrote: [...] "Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a Washington Post alias borrowed from a dirty movie." [...] During a grand jury investigation in 1976, Felt was called to testify and the prosecutor, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights J. Stanley Pottinger, discovered that Felt was [...] "Deep Throat", but the secrecy of the proceedings preserved the secrecy of Felt's alter ego from the public.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} Dan Baxter {{wants to}} be major," [...] said Stuffer. [...] "Talk about gall! What <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> done for the school? Nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One of the commonest {{delusions}} among insane persons, Mrs. Wagner--the delusion that he {{has been}} poisoned. <b>Has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> betrayed it in your presence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's an infernal shame. What harm <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> done you? For me I {{had some}} ground of quarrel with him, but for you there was none." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's like me," [...] replied Dick {{with another}} smile, the {{softness}} of which would have driven March to an immeasurable distance from the truth, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> been near it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{to simplify}} it somewhat, was <b>he,</b> or rather <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> been {{connected}} with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and devoted to self-sacrifice {{in the interests}} of morality?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he {{had once}} said the word to me, he should not change. But then what right have I to expect it? What <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> said about me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With Italy {{and with}} you," [...] said Mr. Goodwood with gloomy plainness and no {{appearance}} {{of trying to}} make an epigram. [...] "What <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> done?" [...] he added abruptly.|$|E
6000|$|... "How kind <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> been {{to all my}} follies! how {{tender and}} indulgent to all my wishes!" [...] sobbed Alice. [...] "We have been selfish, sister, in urging our visit at such hazard!" ...|$|E
60|$|Eric gripped Skallagrim {{round the}} middle and looked aft. On rushed the wave, no such wave <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> seen. Now it struck and the Gudruda burst asunder beneath the blow.|$|R
60|$|The {{horses were}} ordered {{on the next}} day for three, and, at two, Mr Gazebee came to the house. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> never been there before, nor <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> met Dr Thorne except at the squire's dinner. On this {{occasion}} he asked only for the baronet.|$|R
60|$|It would ill become me {{to attempt}} to {{describe}} this dear boy to you, for of course I know really nothing about children, so I shall say only this, that I thought him very like what Timothy would <b>have</b> been <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a chance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Andre!" [...] His mother swung {{upon him}} with that cry. And yet again that question. [...] "Have you no heart? What <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> done {{to you that you}} should nurse so bitter a hatred of him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MY son, Mr. Redlaw!" [...] {{said the}} old man. [...] "MY son, too! The boy talking to me of MY son! Why, what <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> done to give me any pleasure, I should like to know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{opposing}} counsel begs, whatever else you do, {{you will not}} admit that man's testimony. You ask, 'Why? <b>Has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> been accused of want of veracity on other subjects?'--'No: he has stood high {{as a man of}} probity and honour for years.'--'Why, then, throw out his testimony?' ...|$|E
60|$|Although at {{this time}} nearly twenty years had passed {{over the head of}} Norman of Torn, he was without {{knowledge}} or experience in the ways of women, nor <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> spoken with a female of quality or position. No woman graced the castle of Torn nor had the boy, within his memory, ever known a mother.|$|R
60|$|And so {{the matter}} is ended; and various men will long have various {{opinions}} upon it. I add only this one small Document from Maria Theresa's hand, which all hearts, and I suppose even Friedrich's <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> read it, will pronounce to be very beautiful; homely, faithful, wholesome, well-becoming in a high and true Sovereign Woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Injury!" [...] shouted Neefit, upon whose {{mind the}} word {{produced}} an unintended idea. [...] "No, no! Our Polly ain't like that. By G----, I'd eat him, {{if it was}} that way! There ain't a duchess in the land as 'd 've guv' him his answer more ready than Polly <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> spoke to her that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't like it,' pettishly {{returned}} Venus as before. 'I {{came into}} it without enough consideration. And besides again. Isn't your own Mr Boffin {{well acquainted with}} the Mounds? And wasn't he well acquainted with the deceased and his ways? And <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> showed any expectation of finding anything?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} answer for the ought, {{the simple fact}} being a {{sufficient}} reply to the question. The cousin of Captain Ducie is not an Englishman; nor, as I see you suspect, <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> served {{a day in the}} British navy, or in any other navy than that of his native land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Men {{have lied}} to you about Him, mother: but <b>has</b> <b>He</b> <b>ever</b> {{lied to you}} about Himself? He did not lie to me when He sent me {{out into the world}} to find a man, and sent me back again to you with the good news that The Man is born into the world.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} Wyandotté, dear sir, from childhood, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been my friend. He promised me, in particular, {{to be true}} to Bob, and I am happy to say <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> kept his word." ...|$|R
60|$|The people I lodged with {{told me his}} history. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> {{lived there}} many years, and {{everybody}} knew him, but nobody liked him,--a cunning, foxy, grabbing old rascal; unsocial, suspicious, unutterably mean. Never {{in all the years}} of his life in the village <b>had</b> <b>he</b> given a sixpence or a penny to anyone; nor a cabbage, nor an apple, nor <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> lent a helping hand to a neighbour nor shown any neighbourly feeling.|$|R
50|$|Simply put, the president's {{deposition}} testimony regarding whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> {{been alone}} with Ms. (Monica) Lewinsky was intentionally false, and his statements regarding whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> engaged in {{sexual relations with}} Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally false....|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care about}} your consorting so much with that man. He drinks and gambles, and does you no good. What good <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> done himself? Take care {{that he does not}} fleece you." [...] The {{merchant}} felt instinctively, as he glanced at the shrewd, dark face of his son, that the warning was a superfluous one.|$|E
60|$|But {{another and}} {{stronger}} force was exerting {{itself in the}} girl's favor. However low a man may sink, honor and chivalry, <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> possessed them, are never entirely eradicated from his character, and though Albert Werper had long since ceased to evidence the slightest claim to either the one or the other, the spontaneous acknowledgment of them which the girl's speech had presumed had reawakened them both within him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And said I {{knew well}} what qualities he possessed; {{that he was}} {{moderately}} rich; in good repute; and high in his favour and confidence. But seeing me very much distressed, {{he said that he}} would not control or force my inclinations, but would content himself with telling me the fact. He would not pain me by dwelling on it, or reverting to it; nor <b>has</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> done so since, but has truly kept his word.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The only {{name with}} much support was former President Millard Fillmore. Historian Allan Nevins says Fillmore {{was not a}} Know-Nothing or a nativist. He {{was out of the}} country when the {{nomination}} came and had not been consulted about running. Furthermore, Fillmore was neither a member of the party nor <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> attended an American Know-Nothing gathering nor <b>had</b> <b>he</b> by [...] "spoken or written word ... indicated a subscription to American tenets".|$|R
50|$|At no time <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> {{been seen}} by a Japanese doctor. There was no doubt {{whatever}} of the great regret of {{the bulk of the}} Indian warders and several of them expressed their resentment at the attitude of the Japanese in not affording him qualified medical aid. The ‘M.O.’, in particular, had done everything his limited power and ability enabled him to do.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{criticism}} in the press, Bowie at the time said that performing on this tour was the most fun <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> had on the road {{because it was the}} [...] "most inventive" [...] tour <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been involved with.|$|R
