5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E
5|$|The croupade and {{ballotade}} are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, {{the horse}} jumps with both fore and <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> remaining tucked under {{the body and}} he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks his <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> slightly, he does not kick out, but the soles of the hind feet are visible if viewed from the rear.|$|E

40|$|Forty-four New Zealand White x Californian rabbits {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the real time ultrasonography (RTU) in assessing <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> muscle weight and <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> muscularity. For in vivo muscularity determination animals were scanned over the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> using a RTU machine equipped with a 5 MHz probe. The RTU images were taken on <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> at three positions perpendicular to femur bone. At each position a section of <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> muscle was analysed and the area of muscles was determined. The muscle volume of the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> was calculated by combining the muscle area measurements with the femur length. The weight of <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> muscle was estimated from this volume of the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> and knowing the rabbit muscle density. Information related to <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> muscle weight and femur length was used for <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> muscularity. After scanning, animals were weighed, slaughtered and the reference carcass was cut. The right <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> was dissected and the muscle was weighed and femur length was measured. The <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> muscularity in carcass was calculated as previously described for RTU measurements. Correlations between the RTU measurements and thei...|$|R

5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E

50|$|The null {{hypothesis}} {{is that there is}} no difference between the <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> and foreleg length in deer. The alternative {{hypothesis is that}} there is a difference between <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> length and foreleg length. Note that this is a two-tailed test, rather than a one-tailed test. For the two tailed test, the alternative hypothesis is that <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> length may be either greater than or less than foreleg length. A one-sided test could be that <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> length is greater than foreleg length, so that the difference can only be in one direction (greater than).|$|R
5|$|Those {{species that}} make easily heard noises usually {{do so by}} rubbing a row of pegs on the <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> against {{the edges of the}} {{forewings}} (stridulation). These sounds are produced mainly by males to attract females, though in some species the females also stridulate.|$|E
5|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned grasshoppers {{in the family}} Acrididae. Swarming behaviour {{is a response to}} overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E

5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> Another problem that affects some Finnhorses {{is a tendency to}} trot with the front and <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E
5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage.

5|$|At {{the tip of}} {{the abdomen}} is a pair of long cerci (paired {{appendages}} on rearmost segment), and in females, the ovipositor is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny. The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E
5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). The eyes were large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance on its <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may {{jump in the}} air and strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E

5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
