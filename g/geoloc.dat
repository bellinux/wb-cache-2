40|$|This work {{presents}} a (Data Reception Network) DRN software investigation considering simulated conditions inserting purposely errors into the Doppler measurements, satellites ephemeris, and time stamp, {{to characterize the}} geographical location software (<b>GEOLOC)</b> developed by Sousa (2000) and Sousa et al. (2003). The extension of reception stations in Brazilian territory can result in more precise locations if the network is considered in the <b>GEOLOC.</b> The results and analyses were first obtained considering the ground stations separately, to characterize their effects in the geographical location (GL) result. Six conditions were investigated: ideal simulated conditions, random and bias errors in the Doppler measurements, errors in the satellite ephemeris, and errors in the time stamp in order to investigate the DRN importance to get more accurate locations; an analysis was performed considering the random errors of 1 [*]Hz in the Doppler measurements. The results are quite satisfactory and also show good compatibility between the simulator and the <b>GEOLOC</b> using the DRN...|$|E

Several important practical issues are raised here {{that will be}} important particularly for those who will be working with economic and demographic databases. The difference between continuous and discrete georeferencing is described before focusing on five {{of the most common}} methods of discrete georeferencing: address matching, postal code systems, the US Public Land Survey System, the <b>GEOLOC</b> grid and census systems. Examples illustrate each, and the unit concludes with a discussion of issues associated with discrete georeferencing...|$|E
40|$|The current Brazilian System of Environmental Data Collection is {{composed}} of several satellites (SCD- 1 and 2, CBERS- 2 and 2 B), Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) spread mostly over the Brazilian territory, and ground reception stations located in Cuiabá and Alcântara. An essential functionality offered to the users is the geographic location of these DCPs. The location is computed by the in-house developed “GEOLOC” program which processes the onboard measured Doppler shifts suffered by the signal transmitted by the DCPs. These data are relayed and stored on ground when the satellite passes over the receiving stations. Another important input data to <b>GEOLOC</b> are the orbit ephemeris of the satellite corresponding to the Doppler data. In this work, {{the impact on the}} geographic location accuracy when using orbit ephemeris which can be obtained through several sources is assessed. First, this evaluation is performed by computer simulation of the Doppler data, corresponding to real existing satellite passes. Then real Doppler data are used to assess the performance of the location system. The results indicate that the use of precise ephemeris can improve the performance of <b>GEOLOC</b> by reducing the location errors, and such conclusion can then be extended to similar location systems...|$|E

40|$|Resource {{allocation}} (RA) {{is one of}} the key {{stages of}} distributed query processing in the Data Grid environment. In the last decade were published a number of works in the field that deals with different aspects of the problem. We believe that in those studies authors paid less attention to such important aspects as definition of allocation space and criterion of parallelism degree determination. In this paper we propose a method of RA that extends existing solutions in those two points of interest and resolves the problem in the specific conditions of the large scale heterogeneous environment of Data Grids. Firstly, we propose to use a geographical proximity of nodes to data sources to define the Allocation Space (AS). Secondly, we present the principle of execution time parity between scan and join (build and probe) operations for determination of parallelism degree and for generation of load balanced query execution plans. We conducted an experiment that proved the superiority of our <b>GeoLoc</b> method in terms of response time over the RA method that we chose for the comparison. The present study provides also a brief description of existing methods and their qualitative comparison with respect to proposed method...|$|E
40|$|GNSS {{positioning}} in {{the urban}} environment remains challenging, because of the occurrence of many satellite signal reflection and diffraction, also called multipath, that, in the best case, combine with the direct signal, but - in the worst case when the direct signal is obscured - make signal tracking drift unboundedly. Recent research investigations {{carried out in the}} <b>GEOLOC</b> laboratory of the Ifsttar (the French institute of science and Technology for transport, development and network) with the SCM (Société de Calcul Mathématique) have shown that a simplified 3 D modelling of buildings at both sides of streets, named 'urban trench' for that reason, can benefit in the process of satellite visibility check and GNSS positioning. These urban trenches can be computed from 3 D-city-model using road and buildings layers. Initially, the rover is assumed to occupy the arc segment that represents the street. That way, only left and right distance and height attributes depict any urban trench section, which has the advantage of being easily compliant with the existing formats of navigable maps. Using the satellite positions in azimuth and elevation, our algorithm determinates whether their signal is in Line-Of- Sight or Not (NLOS), with respect to the modelled facades all around. In case of NLOS, a correction of the pseudorange measurement is made. The geometry of this model being simplified, and the initial position approximated, the first deterministic approach has been modified: a probabilistic approach is proposed. From this second approach, an urban trench protection level can be computed (UTPL), which provides an integrity indicator adapted to the urban environment. This article is divided into 2 main parts: the first part gives an overview of the deterministic approach, whilst the second part concerns the probabilistic approach. Afterward experimental results are presented, with improvement {{not only in terms of}} accuracy, but also in terms of accuracy...|$|E
