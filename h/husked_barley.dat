40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{hydrolysis}} of lignocellulosic agricultural residues, by means of combined pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, {{to be used for}} ethanol production. Four agricultural by-products, i. e. <b>barley</b> <b>husk,</b> wheat bran and the waste streams of a combined starch and ethanol factory, denoted wheat starch fibres and starch-free fibres B, were investigated. The starch in wheat bran and wheat starch fibres was removed by treatment with amylases, resulting in the materials denoted starch-free bran and starch-free fibres A. Pretreatment of these four materials was performed either by microwave or steam pretreatment with or without the addition of acid. The effect was assessed with enzymatic hydrolysis. A higher sugar yield was obtained with the addition of small amounts of sulphuric acid, although only the pretreatment conditions without the addition of acid were optimised for starch-free fibres A and B. The highest sugar yields obtained after hydrolysis of starch-free bran, starch-free fibres A, starch-free fibres B and <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> corresponded to 80 %, 69 % 87 % and 68 % of the theoretical, respectively. The hydrolysates from starch-free bran and <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> showed no inhibition in fermentability tests. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with S. cerevisiae of a 10 % total DM steam-pretreated <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> resulted in 81 % of the theoretical ethanol yield, corresponding to 71 % of the ethanol yield based on carbohydrate composition. The use of the wheat fibres and the wheat bran in the combined starch and ethanol factory would increase the ethanol yield in 25 and 20 %, respectively. Utilisation of the husk fraction in plants producing ethanol from barley grain could increase the ethanol yield by more than 10 %...|$|R

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was employed for selection of target spectra regions responsible for group discrimination. Classification models were developed based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and recognition and prediction abilities of these models were 100 %, with the samples being separated into six groups: pure coffee, adulterated coffee (adulteration levels as low as 1  g/ 100  g), spent coffee grounds, coffee <b>husks,</b> corn and <b>barley.</b> Such results confirm that DRIFTS can be a valuable analytical tool for detection of adulteration in ground and roasted coffee...|$|R

Biodegradable films of native starch or oxidized starches and glycerol with different concentrations of cellulose fibers (0 %, 10 % and 20 %) were prepared. The films {{were characterized by}} morphological, mechanical, barrier, and thermal properties. Cellulose fibers isolated from the <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> were obtained with 75 % purity and high crystallinity. The morphology of the films of the oxidized starches, regardless of the fiber addition, was more homogeneous {{as compared to the}} film of the native starch. The addition of cellulose fibers in the films increased the tensile strength and decreased elongation. The water vapor permeability of the film of oxidized starch with 20 % of cellulose fibers was lower than the without fibers. However the films with cellulose fibers had the highest decomposition with the initial temperature and thermal stability. The oxidized starch and cellulose fibers from barley have a good potential for use in packaging. The addition of cellulose fibers in starch films can {{contribute to the development of}} films more resistant that can be applied in food systems to maintain its integrity...|$|R
40|$|Background: The biobed is {{a simple}} biopurification system used to prevent the point-source {{pesticide}} contamination that occurs at farm level. The typical composition of the biomixture used in this system is soil, peat and straw in volumetric proportions of 1 : 1 : 2. The principal component is straw due to its positive effects on biological activity and thus pesticide degradation. However, access to straw can be limited in some regions, {{so it must be}} replaced by other more readily available lignocellulosic residues. Results: Therefore, two alternate lignocellulosic materials (<b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> and pine sawdust) were evaluated as partial substitutes for straw. The degradation of a repeatedly applied mixture of six pesticides by these alternates was assessed. The microbial respiration and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis activity were also assessed. The results showed that the highest degradation efficiency was found in mixtures containing straw and <b>barley</b> <b>husks.</b> Each biomixtures tested achieved a high degradation (50 to 90 %) of all the pesticides used except iprodione. Repeated applications of pesticides resulted in a slowing of the degradation rate of all pesticide types in all biomixtures. FDA activity and microbial respiration were higher in the biomixtures containing <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> and straw compared to the mixture with pine sawdust, a result consistent with the pesticide degradations observed. Conclusions: This paper demonstrates that the straw in the traditional biomixture can be partially replaced by other lignocellulosic materials to efficiently degrade a mixture of pesticides, even when the pesticides are added in successive applications and high concentrations...|$|R

The color of husk at barely development stage could influence the agronomic traits and malting qualities of grains. A barley mutant with a white husk was discovered from the malting barley cultivar Supi 3 and designated wh (white husk). Morphological changes and the genetics of white <b>husk</b> <b>barley</b> were investigated. <b>Husks</b> of the mutant were white at the heading and flowering stages but yellowed at maturity. The diastatic power and α-amino nitrogen contents also significantly increased in wh mutant. Transmission electron microscopy examination showed abnormal chloroplast development in the mutant. Genetic analysis of F 2 and BC 1 F 1 populations developed from a cross of wh and Yangnongpi 5 (green husk) showed that the white husk was controlled by a single recessive gene (wh). The wh gene was initially mapped between 49. 64 and 51. 77 cM on chromosome 3 H, which is syntenic with rice chromosome 1 where a white husk gene wlp 1 has been isolated. The barley orthologous gene of wlp 1 was sequenced from both parents and a 688 bp deletion identified in the wh mutant. We further fine-mapped the wh gene between SSR markers Bmac 0067 and Bmag 0508 a with distances of 0. 36 cM and 0. 27 cM in an F 2 population with 1115 individuals of white husk.

40|$|Purpose {{and method}} of the study: The {{production}} of activated carbon from <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> (BH) by chemical activation with zinc chloride was optimized {{by using a}} 23 factorial design with replicates at the central point, followed by a central composite design with two responses (the yield and iodine number) and three factors (the activation temperature, activation time, and impregnation ratio). Both responses were simultaneously optimized by using the desirability functions approach to determine the optimal conditions of this process. The experimental data from the batch phenol adsorption onto <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> activated carbon (BHAC) was represented by adsorption isotherms (Langmuir and Freundlich) and kinetic models (pseudo-first and pseudosecond order, and intraparticle diffusion models), besides the regeneration of phenolloaded BHAC with different solvents was evaluated. Experimental data confirmed that the breakthrough curves were dependent on BHAC dosage, phenol initial concentration, air flow rate, and influent flow rate. Adaline and feed-forward backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were developed to predict the breakthrough curves for the adsorption of phenol onto <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> activated carbon (BHAC) in an airlift reactor. Feed-forward back-propagation networks were tested with different quantity of neurons at the hidden layer to determine the optimal number of neurons in the ANN architecture to represent the breakthrough curves performed at different operational conditions for the airlift reactor. Contributions and conclusions: After the simultaneous dual optimization of BHAC production, the maximal response values were obtained at an activation temperature of 436 °C, an activation time of 20 min, and an impregnation ratio of 1. 1 g ZnCl 2 g BH- 1, although the results after the single optimization of each response were quite different.

40|$|Hemicelluloses are, {{together}} with cellulose and pectins, the polysaccharide constituents {{in the cell}} walls of higher plants. Xylans {{are the most common}} hemicelluloses, and are considered to be the second most abundant biopolymer in the plant kingdom. Xylans have an inherent affinity to cellulose and will thus adsorb on cellulose surfaces; a propensity providing great opportunities for modification of cellulose fibres. The molecular structure of xylan is proposed to affect the solubility and the level of cellulose interaction. This thesis investigates the influence of xylan composition on solution properties in aqueous systems, and its effect on cellulose fibre adsorption. In addition, the effects of xylan adsorption on softwood pulp properties and the possibility of utilising xylans from agricultural residues, i. e. <b>barley</b> <b>husks,</b> in cellulose fibre modification are studied. Lignin has been shown to have a great influence on the self-assembly behaviour of birch xylan. It is proposed that the agglomeration starts with the nucleation of lignin polymer molecules that are complexed with water-soluble lignin-containing xylan molecules via secondary bonds. As lignin affects the solubility of xylan, it most probably also influences the driving force for xylan accumulation and adsorption on cellulose surfaces. Xylans isolated from <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> have been shown to interact with cellulose. Temperature and initial concentration of xylan {{has been shown to be}} important parameters in controlling the level of adsorption on cellulose fibres, but the adsorption appears to be largely dependent on xylan molecular structure. Arabinoxylans with a low degree of substitution have an enhanced capacity to interact with each other and with other polysaccharides; a feature that explains the observed propensity of low substituted xylan to form agglomerated structures and adsorb on cellulose surfaces. Furthermore, <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> xylan has shown great potential as a dry strengthening agent for bleached once-dried softwood pulp. Adsorption of birch xylan on never-dried bleached softwood kraft pulp has been shown to improve tensile strength and beatability, but tensile strength at a given °SR, density and light scattering coefficient is more or less unaffected. The effects are more pronounced for once-dried pulp than for never-dried pulp. It is hypothesised that adsorbed xylan has a stabilising effect on cellulose fibrils, preventing aggregation upon drying, and thus reducing the effect of hornification...|$|R
40|$|The {{growing amount}} of {{household}} waste {{and the limited}} supply of fossil fuel on earth make it important to find renewable resources {{for the production of}} biodegradable polymers for a variety of applications, particularly as packaging and other disposable products. Hemicelluloses are important components in all plants and the second most abundant plant biopolymers on earth. Although hemicelluloses are biosynthesized to a large extent they are not yet utilized as polymeric materials. The aim {{of the study was to}} find a suitable method to isolate arabinoxylans from barley in order to produce a film forming product that could be used for preparation of oxygen barrier films or coatings. Arabinoxylan has been extracted from <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> and endosperm fiber using different methods and the chemical composition and detailed structure has been determined. In the husks, the arabinoxylan is tightly bond to cellulose and lignin, building up a complex composite structure. Relatively high amount of chemicals was needed to render them soluble, and a delignification step was necessary to obtain good yields and high purity. The arabinoxylans in the cell walls of the starchy endosperm were more water soluble and could be extracted using less chemicals. This raw material had a higher starch and protein content. It also contained more β-glucans, which might have an effect on material properties and oxygen barrier of films. There were also differences in the fine structure of arabinoxylans from <b>husk</b> and fiber. <b>Barley</b> <b>husk</b> arabinoxylan was found to have longer branches with a terminal xylose unit on the arabinose, and also glucuronic acid substituents, as shown by NMR. Barley fiber arabinoxylan on the other hand had disubstituted xylose residues. The Ara/Xyl ratio was a lot higher in the fiber sample, 0. 63 compared to 0. 22 for the husk arabinoxylans. Films have been made by water casting and material and barrier properties of these have been evaluated. The isolated arabinoxylan formed films without addition of external plasticizer. The degree of arabinose substitution had a large effect on water holding capacity and plasticization of the material. The films were transparent, strong, rather stiff and moisture sensitive. They had good gas barrier properties, and thus have a potential application as biodegradable oxygen barrier films in multilayer food packaging...|$|R

30|$|Environmental {{pollutant}} is {{the major}} cause for most of health illness. Water is {{the main source of}} contamination and pollution which effects health through biomagnification. Water gets polluted by harmful chemicals, dyes, oils etc. All the wastewater that contains harmful chemicals is drained into nearby water bodies. This causes water pollution and will lead to various health problems to flora and fauna. Among the pollutants of water, dyes play a major role. Most of the dyes released from the pharma and textile industries are mutagenic, toxic and teratogenic that can cause serious health hazards to humans and live stock [1]. Dyes released into environment can impart color to water and also decrease or stop capacity of water reoxygenation by blocking sunlight thereby increasing BOD value. Therefore these conditions can prevent or disturb the growth of aquatic plants and animals [2, 3]. The color removal from wastewater from industries is the main concern in green chemistry [4]. Removal of dyes from wastewater has become a tough issue due to their stable character under harsh condition and biodegradation resistance [5]. There have been reports on usage of natural materials like coconut <b>husk,</b> sunflower stalks, <b>barley</b> <b>husk,</b> lemon peels, rice husk to remove dyes [6]. Advanced oxidation process (AOP) of photocatalysis is really efficient in industrial effluent treatment process with more success rates. Many studies reported that TiO 2 nanoparticles are an excellent photocatalysts for decolorization of dyes. TiO 2 microparticles are less toxic, less resistance and less corrosive than other photocatalysts [7, 8]. TiO 2 oxidation is also known as a type of “green” or environmental friendly method [9]. TiO 2 nanoparticles are used extensively because of its intensity and very high refractive index. We used dopants such as Zn and Cu to observe the efficiency of TiO 2 microparticles on dye degradation. Doping techniques are used to incorporate metal ions to enhance photocatalytic effects of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Metal ions such as Cobalt, Iron, Nickel, Tungsten, Zinc can be incorporated during preparation [10, 11].|$|R
40|$|Xylans {{are among}} the most {{abundant}} polymers on earth. Nature has created xylans with different molecular structures in different plant species. This molecular architecture is not a coincidence but is tailored to create a particular desirable functionality. If we were able to understand the effect of the molecular architecture on the material properties, we could create tailor-made xylan-based materials and utilise this immense natural resource in material applications now fulfilled by non-renewable resources. This is of the utmost importance as oil supplies are reducing rapidly and the greenhouse effect {{is becoming more and more}} pronounced. In this work, xylans were isolated from various sources and modified chemically and physically. The material properties were evaluated with a focus on softening behaviour and film formation. Aspen glucuronoxylan extracted with alkali was deacetylated. It aggregated in aqueous solution and crystallized when cast from water. In contrast, DMSO-extracted aspen glucuronoxylan contained acetyl groups, had a higher water solubility and was totally amorphous. The irregularity introduced with the acetyl groups impedes crystallization. The same phenomenon was observed for arabinose substituents when using <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> arabinoxylan. Aspen glucuronoxylan was acetylated to different degrees of acetyl substitution. Acetylation decreased the interactions with water and introduced a glass transition temperature (Tg). When the effect of esterification on the Tg of corn fibre arabinoxylan was evaluated, it was found that Tg decreased with an increasing degree of substitution and side chain length. It was also shown that xylan has a potential in film applications, such as food packaging. Plasticization of aspen glucuronoxylan with xylitol or sorbitol enabled the formation of continuous films with low oxygen permeability. <b>Barley</b> <b>husk</b> arabinoxylan formed films without the addition of an external plasticizer. An attempt was made to decrease the interactions with water by surface fluorination, at which the films became more hydrophobic with an increasing fluorine content at the film surface.

40|$|Biomass is an {{important}} energy carrier since it is a renewable source and the energy content in the fuel can be stored over time and also generate high temperatures. Bioenergy can be in liquid form, gas-phase or solid. The most common phase is as a solid. Before use, the biomass needs harvesting and refining. Pelletization {{is one of the}} most promising solid fuel qualities with a wide range of benefits which are needed before the product can enter the market and compete with more traditional sources of energy like heating oil and electricity. Despite its benefits, the pellet market still requires development. Several barriers need to be lifted such as understanding the market behavior, finding how bioenergy systems are adapted and what the level of technology is. Pellet feedstock is normally bi-products from sawmills, but increasing demand makes other feedstock alternatives interesting. Pulpwood from pine, straw and husk from agriculture and residue from the furniture industry are examples of new types of feedstock for pellet production. Different feedstocks can bring challenges due to the mechanical properties of the pellet fuel. Also chemical properties can be demanding if the inorganic content in the feedstock is high. The main objectives of the present work are divided into three selected areas; small scale pellets users in Norway, pretreatment of pure feedstock from pine and manufacturing of low-grade feedstock pellets with additives. The following research questions were settled for the work: 1) Which factors lead single household owners to choose wood pellet stoves compared to heat pump solutions and direct electrically heated systems? 2) How will existing users of wood pellets stoves choose if they should have any new system? 3) What is the practical experience of existing wood pellet stove users with aspects like the technical properties of fuel, stove or stakeholders? 4) How does extended storage of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 5) How does high and low temperature drying of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 6) How is the mechanical quality properties of pellets affected by the use of different selected additives? 7) Is the low-grade feedstock pellets made with additives combustible in ordinary grate furnaces/boilers? 8) How are the ash melting properties of difficult fuels affected by the use of selected additives? The research questions are aimed to solve by investigation of market penetration of wood pellet stoves through a survey. Further new pellet feedstocks like pulpwood, agricultural and furniture residues have been produced and tested. Also mixtures with different additives have been produced. The purpose of additives is mechanical fuel quality improvement and increasing the melting point of the ash in the fuel. Finally the new pellet fuel assortments were combusted and tested. All experiments and data collections performed this work is done in an industrial context. Chipping, grinding and pelletization were performed in ordinary industrial plants. Feedstock samples are collected from ordinary harvesting or side-product processes. Combustion is performed in ordinary furnaces/boilers. All processes mentioned above were set up with necessary measurement equipment. This way of experiment approaches have given good validity of the results from the experiments. The market investigation work was performed by a questionnaire among 188 random non-wood pellet users and 461 wood pellet users in Norway. The survey reached a response rate of 45 % from the existing wood pellet users. Factors that influence the decision of purchasing a heating system were identified like the age of the consumer, regional constraints in the availability of pellets and also that economic competitiveness is also weak compared to electrical heating. It was also found that pellet stoves need technical improvements to meet the end-user expectations. The ignition, control system, noise and imperfect combustion are examples of technical factors which need improvement. New pellet feedstocks need treatment prior to the pelletization process. Such process steps are chipping, grinding, storage, drying and possibly the use of additives. In this thesis, several feedstock assortments were manufactured. Pine pulp was stored outside for a year and dried at both high and low temperatures. The high temperature dried material and also stored material resulted in higher energy use for pelletization. There was lower energy consumption for fresh, low temperature dried material. Fresh material was found to have higher durability. <b>Barley</b> straw, <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> and residue from furniture contain a larger amount of ash and a higher concentration of problematic ash-forming elements compared to conventional woody biomasses. This causes normally severe ash sintering and slagging which were observed in this study. Different raw feedstock were pelletized and combusted together with different additives. These additives might have multifunction such as: 1) improve the properties of fuel pellets from the mechanical point of view and 2) abate fuel ash slagging to achieve an efficient and smooth combustion process. In this work, each raw feedstock was pelletized with different additives in various additive-to-fuel ratios. The influence of additive addition on the pellet production process (i. e., power consumption) and pellet properties (i. e., bulk density, durability and particle density) were investigated. For furniture residue, both sewage sludge and marble sludge improved the durability of the pellets. But when there was a high content of marble, the durability was reduced and the levels of fines increased. Barley straw and <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> durability were also improved with the lignosulfonate additive. With the marble sludge additive the <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> durability was increased. Opposite barley straw durability was lowered with marble sludge additive. With combinations of both additives, the positive effect of marble sludge additive for both the barley straw and <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> was to some extent eliminated. There are significant differences between the composition and ash chemistry of the formed slags. The slag from wood wastes was dominated by K, Na, Si and Ca, which were completely melted and fused into large blocks. The results from the chemical composition analyses of slag samples suggest intensive formation and fusion of low temperature melting alkali silicates. For the barley straw and <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> that are rich in Si, K, P and Ca, most of the K reacts with both P and Si in ash residues and forms ash melts containing low temperature melting potassium silicates and phosphates. The ash melts were not transported from the grate area in the furnace and gives thereby initiated and enhanced ash slagging which reduces the operation stability of the furnace. Lignosulfonate, marble sludge and sewage sludge are proposed as additives to mitigate ash slagging during the combustion of the studied fuels. Marble sludge served as the most efficient additive to eliminate ash slagging during the combustion of pelletized <b>barley</b> straw, <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> and wood wastes, respectively. The addition of marble sludge led to the formation of high temperature melting calcium-rich alkali silicates and/or phosphates. This process was accompanied by a significant reduction in ash melts and slag formation. A less pronounced anti-slagging effect was observed from the combustion of lignosulfonate added to barley straw and <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> pellets. However, the addition of lignosulfonate altered the ash chemistry and promoted the formation of high temperature melting potassium calcium phosphates in ash residues. As result of this, the fraction of ingoing fuel ash that forms slag decreased, and the slags had smaller size and a lower degree of sintering. The addition of sewage sludge slightly reduced the slag formation during the combustion of wood waste pellets. This occurred because sewage sludge contributed to the formation of high temperature melting alkali aluminum silicates. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|This {{work has}} focused on using {{agriculture}} residues as raw material for new polymeric materials. Arabinoxylans have been isolated from <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> and endosperm fiber using alkali extraction, and the chemical composition and detailed structure have been determined. Different isolation conditions, pre-treatments, and purification steps were investigated to find an optimized and environmentally sustainable process. It was shown that a key operation for successful extraction of arabinoxylan from <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> is the degradation of the lignin network prior to extraction. Delignification was not needed when using endosperm fiber as raw material. The extracts were mixtures of arabinoxylan, β-glucan, starch, and proteins. Sequential purification showed that residual starch makes arabinoxylan films more brittle; β-glucan makes them more flexible, and proteins {{have little or no}} effect at all. If only mechanical properties of films are taken into account, enzymatic removal of starch is the only purification needed. This is very useful information when designing an isolation process, since the number of operations should be kept at a minimum for economic and environmental reasons. Differences in the molecular structure between arabinoxylans from husk and fiber were determined. Barley husk-derived arabinoxylan was found to have disaccharide branches with a terminal xylose unit on the arabinose, and also glucuronic acid substituents, as shown by NMR. Barley fiber arabinoxylan, on the other hand, had xylose residues disubstituted with only arabinose. The Ara/Xyl ratio was much higher in the fiber sample, 0. 63 compared to 0. 22 for the husk arabinoxylans. Films have been made by casting from water solution and material and barrier properties were evaluated. The films were transparent, strong, rather stiff and moisture sensitive. They had good gas barrier properties, and thus have a potential application as biodegradable oxygen barrier films in multilayer food packaging. The isolated arabinoxylan formed films without addition of external plasticizer. This special property was explained by internal plasticizing by water, caused by the ability of arabinose to attract water. Controlled debranching of arabinose substituents showed that the degree of arabinose substitution had a large effect on water holding capacity, plasticization, and crystallinity of the material. Optimal mechanical properties were obtained for arabinoxylan with an Ara/Xyl ratio of 0. 35 - 0. 40. Enzymatic treatment was demonstrated to be a very attractive tool for tailor-making xylans with specific properties. This work shows that bioprocessing of agricultural residues through an optimized, environmentally sustainable process, together with an understanding of the relationship between structure and properties of biopolymers will lead {{to the development of a}} biorefinery for the production of future materials, chemicals, and fuels...|$|R

The parameters optimized in the steam pretreatment step were residence time (5 - 15 min), temperature (190 - 215 degreesC), and concentration of the acid catalyst (0 or 0. 5 % H 2 SO 4). A microwave oven was employed for screening of the optimal conditions to obtain the highest sugar yield following combined pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. The final optimization of the pretreatment prior to enzymatic hydrolysis was performed on a larger scale, in a steam pretreatment unit. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation was carried out following steam pretreatment on 5 and 10 % dry matter steam-pretreated slurries. Fermentability tests were performed {{to determine the effect}} of by-products (ie furfural and 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural) in the bioconversion of glucose to ethanol by baker's yeast.

Radioactively-labelled phosphine is a useful and sensitive tool to study residues of phosphine in grains and their fractions. This research will assist industry to improve phosphine fumigation practice. Five representative grains (wheat, barley, oats, canola and lupins) were fumigated with 32 P labelled phosphine at 700 ppm and 25 ± 2 °C for two weeks exposure. Two types of residues were formed in grains from phosphine fumigation – phosphine residue and phosphine converted non-volatile residues. After one week exposure to atmosphere, the levels of 32 P radioactive residue in the grains and their fractions were analysed. The results show that more than 85 % of absorbed phosphine which was converted to non-volatile compounds cannot be removed by ventilation. Furthermore, 80 - 90 % of non-volatile 32 P residues were present in water and acid soluble extractions. Radiation imagery shows that more than 80 % of 32 P residues were located or distributed in the embryo, testa, pericarp and <b>husk</b> of wheat, <b>barley,</b> canola, lupins and oats.

In this work, methods of extracting and isolating hemi¬celluloses from agricultural and forestry waste streams have been studied. Hemi¬celluloses are biodegradable polymers that can replace fossil-fuel-based products for use in various applications, such as barrier films and hydrogels. Arabinoxylan was extracted from <b>barley</b> <b>husks,</b> wheat straw and barley straw, by steam pretreatment, and then further concentrated and purified by conventional filtration, microfiltration and ultrafiltration. Xylan yields of 25 to 50 wt%, based on the content in the raw material, were achieved in the steam pretreatment stage by optimizing the operating conditions. The pH should be kept above 8 and a severity factor of about 4 used to obtain a high yield of arabinoxylan with large molar mass. The extraction of hemicelluloses from agricultural residues can be combined with ethanol production, which could be of great interest in future biorefineries. Galactoglucomannans were extracted from process water from a thermo¬mechanical pulp mill. These hemicelluloses were isolated by common filtration combined with membrane filtration. Drum filtration and microfiltration were used to remove solids and ultrafiltration to concentrate and purify the hemicelluloses. A hemicellulose concentration above 60 g/l was achieved with a purity of about 80 %.

40|$|Many ions and {{elements}} {{have to be}} present in a certain concentration range to be suitable for the brewing process and / or the subsequent beer. No restriction in concentration holds for silicon (Si) in beer. Despite the fact that Si is not well studied in human metabolism, more and more agreement exists that it is an essential element for bone mineral density, potentially reducing the chance to develop osteoporosis and bone fractures. Si also reduces the biological availability of aluminium. Many food products have higher concentrations of Si per weight unit (e. g. cereals and soups) than beer but beer has the highest bioavailability. Belgium represents an excellent case study to investigate the variation of Si concentrations among a wide range of beer styles, fermentation processes and used ingredients. 120 Belgian beers were analysed for dissolved Si and the results were compared with typical beer parameters (alcohol content, real extract, original extract, fermentation degree, colour, pH and bitterness). Process conditions were also taking into account. The study confirmed that all beers contain significant dissolved Si (6 - 58 mg L[*]−[*] 1). Most Si is available in strong ales like abbey and trappist ales. Si in the beer originates from the <b>husks</b> of the <b>barley</b> malt.

30|$|Development of {{effective}} technologies to remove dyes from water drew great attention {{over the last}} two decades. At present, several physicochemical and biological methods are used for decolorization of waste water such as ion exchange, lime softening, membrane filtration, coagulation, precipitation, advanced oxidation process (Roy and Mondal 2014) and adsorption (Diouri et al. 2015). Among these, most of the techniques have been restricted due to high consumption or expensive chemicals and after removal generate new type of toxic sludge. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for development of innovative method. A simple and cost-effective adsorbent was used by Roy et al. (2013) in their earlier work. Previous literature demonstrated many adsorbents for removal of organic dye. However, the most important dye adsorbent is granular activated carbon. Activated carbon adsorption method is a method applied earlier, and this method is very effective for the removal of dissolved organic matter. Many other materials like tree fern (Ho et al. 2005), orange peel (Arami et al. 2005), banana pith (Namasivayam et al. 1997), date pits (Fawzi et al. 2003), peanut hulls (Gong et al. 2005), giant duck weed (Waranusantigul et al. 2003), teak tree bark powder (Patil et al. 2011), corn cobs and <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> (Chandran et al. 2002), rice husk and saw dust (Vadivelan and Kumar 2005; Malik 2003), Agave americana (L.) fibers (Ben Hamissa et al. 2007) have been tested for their dye adsorption capacity. The search for an appropriate and inexpensive biomass is a continuing process. The most effective and optimized utilization of a biomass demands a detailed understanding of the binding mechanism.|$|R

However, ash related problems are inclined to occur due to high contents of problematic ash forming matter in such residues. The aims of this work were to examine ash characteristics of <b>barley</b> straw and <b>husk</b> and to find mixtures of fuels and additives {{that can be used}} as basis for producing pellets giving minimal problems during combustion. Influence of kaolin and calcite additives on the two fuel ashes’ sintering behaviors were investigated by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), ash fusion analyzer and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The results showed that, compared to barley straw ash, the <b>barley</b> <b>husk</b> ash has a higher sintering tendency, with observation of severe melting during combustion. Kaolin and calcite addition increased the melting temperatures of ashes from both <b>barley</b> straw and <b>husk.</b> Reactions between kaolin and potassium containing species in the <b>barley</b> straw and <b>husk</b> ashes were revealed by XRD analyses. With formation of high temperature melting species due to kaolin addition, the severe sintering of <b>barley</b> straw and <b>husk</b> ashes were significantly reduced. The dilution effect from calcite {{is supposed to be a}} main reason for improved <b>barley</b> straw and <b>husk</b> ash sintering behaviors. In addition, calcite addition led to formation of more calcium rich phases, which have higher melting points and contribute to low ash sintering degrees.

In addition, high-fat and low-fat controls as well as partially hydrolyzed guar gum were included in the study.

To verify the electron treatment of barley by e-ventus® technology, three physical detection methods were investigated: photostimulated luminescence (PSL), thermoluminescence (TL) and electron spin resonance (ESR). Influencing factors such as storage time and temperature, geographic origin of samples and light exposure were studied. All three detection methods proved to be suitable, with PSL being the most convenient. But also ESR by measuring the <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> offered a simple and rapid verification. Although TL was more laborious to perform, it was highly reliable. PSL was able to classify electronically dressed seeds after storage times of at least 12 - 13 months independent of storage temperatures, assayed {{in the range of}} 5 - 23 °C. The applicability of ESR after storage was dependent on the measuring system used and on storage temperature. At room temperature the advanced E-ScanTM spectrometer allowed verification of treatment for at least 7. 5 months, whereas the EMS 104 spectrometer was applicable only up to 2 months of storage. Storage temperatures of 5 °C markedly prolonged the verifiability of treatment. Using TL, treated samples stored at room temperature could be easily verified for at least 13 months. Fading of the PSL signal of treated barley was observed under the influence of light, the extent of fading being influenced by illuminance but not by treatment of the samples with high or low energy electrons.

40|$|Xylans are polysaccharides {{present in}} large amounts in cell walls of {{vascular}} plants. They possess an inherent affinity to cellulose and will thus adsorb irreversibly on cellulose surfaces. This propensity, {{along with the}} great abundance in nature, provides great opportunities {{for the use of}} xylans as renewable and biodegradable cellulose fibre modifying agents. The research presented in this thesis provides further knowledge of how the composition of xylan fractions influences solution properties and characteristics of xylan adsorption on cellulosic fibres. The study also describes how xylan adsorption can be used to improve the strength properties of bleached softwood kraft pulp. Furthermore, the work investigates the potential of utilizing xylan isolated from agricultural waste materials in cellulose fibre modification. Results show that lignin has a great influence on the aggregation behaviour of glucuronoxylan (GX) from birch. As lignin affects the solubility of xylan, it most likely also influences the driving force for xylan adsorption and deposition on cellulosic surfaces. Adsorption of GX on bleached softwood kraft pulp before drying is shown to preserve a considerable part of the fibre-swelling, fibre wall porosity, specific fibre surface area and wet fibre flexibility observed in the never-dried state. It is therefore suggested that GX adsorption reduces the degree of drying-induced fibre wall cross-linking. The use of GX as a hornification inhibitor provides once-dried fibres with increased tensile strength and beatability. Water-soluble (glucurono) arabinoxylan (GAX) isolated from <b>barley</b> <b>husks</b> is shown to interact with cellulose fibres. GAX with a low degree of substitution has an enhanced propensity to form aggregates in aqueous solutions and adsorb on cellulosic surfaces. In order to increase the driving force of adsorption of the more highly substituted xylan, GAX was cationized. This chemical modification increases the rate and magnitude of GAX adsorption extensively, due to the induced electrostatic interaction between anionic pulp fibres and cationic xylan. Furthermore, it is shown that adsorption of GAX on never-dried fibres may be beneficial in the production of market pulps with increased tensile strength and beatability...|$|R

Hemicelluloses are among the major groups of compounds in plant cell walls, together with cellulose and lignin. These three components are closely associated, making them difficult to separate from each other. Hemicelluloses are complex polysaccharides and two major classes are heteroxylans and heteromannans. In this work, the extraction, isolation, characterisation, modification and enzymatic hydrolysis of hemicelluloses from agricultural and forestry crops have been investigated. Extraction of the hemicelluloses arabinoxylan from <b>barley</b> <b>husks,</b> and corn fibres and acetylated galactoglucomannan (AcGGM) from spruce chips, was performed with heat treatment at neutral conditions, using microwave irradiation or steam pretreatment. Extraction of polymeric hemicelluloses was possible and the hemicelluloses extracted from all species investigated were acetylated. Isolation and concentration of the soluble hemicelluloses were performed with membrane filtration and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), respectively. Glycosyl hydrolases are important tools for the characterisation and modification of the properties and structure of hemicelluloses. The influence of side group substitution on AcGGM solubility was investigated using an a-galactosidase and chemical de-acetylation with alkali. B-mannanase catalysed hydrolysis of AcGGM with various degrees of natural and chemical substituents revealed steric hindrance and decreased hydrolysis rate with increased substitution. Hydrogels were made from chemically modified AcGGM. BSA was incorporated as a model drug. The release of BSA from AcGGM hydrolgels was increased by the addition of b-mannanase. The affinity of a mannan-binding module to galactomannan was demonstrated in an aqueous two-phase system.

In conclusion, methods of extracting hemicelluloses are presented together with further isolation with membrane filtration, characterisation with SEC and enzymatic hydrolysis.

Si also reduces the biological availability of aluminium. Beer is one of the prime sources of Si for humans and is a quintessential part of Belgian heritage. Sripanyakorn et al. (2004) found that Si concentrations in blood serum rise to a peak within 2 h after ingestion of beer, suggesting an efficient uptake of dissolved Si into the bloodstream. A substantial fraction of the beer Si is effectively retained within the body. Although other food products have higher concentrations of Si per weight unit (e. g. cereals and soups), beer has the highest in vitro availability of Si found {{in a wide range of}} consumption products (Robberecht et al., 2009). Si in the beer originates from the <b>husks</b> of the <b>barley</b> malt.

Belgium represents an excellent case study to investigate variation of Si concentrations among a wide range of beer styles, fermentation processes and ingredients. Several studies have confirmed considerable variability in Si concentrations in beer. Sripanyakorn et al. (2004) found no direct link to beer type, country of origin or alcohol content. Other studies have suggested a link to fermentation (e. g. Robberecht et al., 2009).

Most Si is available in strong ales like abbey and trappist ales. Concentrations of Si ranged between 214 and 2, 071 μmol L[*]−[*] 1. The alcohol content was related to the Si content. A more significant relation is found between the real extract and the Si content.

30|$|Adsorption {{is a major}} {{industrial}} separation technique for the purification of effluent media. It is a mass transfer operation through which a solid material can selectively remove dissolved components from an aqueous solution by attracting the dissolved solute to its surface. Therefore, it involves the interphase accumulation of concentrated substances at a surface or at the interphase. This separation technique finds wide application in the removal of dye from aqueous media. Specifically, adsorption finds application in textile, leather, dyeing, cosmetics, plastics, food and paper industries where water recovery is very essential. To achieve and sustain efficient recovery of the desired water quality, a careful selection of adsorbent {{is of paramount importance}} (Abd El-Latif et al. 2010; Albarins and Hela 1993; Menkiti and Onukwuli 2011).

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the main}} roles of food {{packaging}} is to retard the natural processes that lead to food deterioration and reduction in quality, safety or both. Food industry has long {{recognized the importance of}} using antioxidants (AOs) for this purpose. The use of antioxidants is not restricted to its direct addition to foods, but they can also be added to the food packaging which can act as a reservoir and release them by a controlled mechanism of diffusion. Packaging designed to foster desirable food packaging interactions have been called as active packaging. The active packaging with antioxidant properties either uses AOs in the form of independent sachets or incorporates them in the polymeric matrix of the packaging. Although many of these antioxidants are artificial molecules like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) or butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), nowadays {{there is a tendency to}} search for natural molecules with the same properties but which are not related with possible toxicological side effects. The most recent contributions on active packaging with natural antioxidants have been reviewed. Material and Methods: For this study, an extensive bibliographic review on food packaging with incorporated natural antioxidants was carried out. Special attention is given to the antioxidants activity tests carried out in both packaging and packed foods. Results and conclusion: In the last years, different pure standards of natural antioxidants were incorporated in food packaging such as alpha-tocopherol, caffeic acid, catechin, quercetin or carvacrol. On the other hand, sources of natural antioxidants have also been incorporated in packaging for food applications such as cinnamon, oregano, clove, rosemary, ginger, clove and lemongrass essential oils and extracts of <b>barley</b> <b>husks,</b> green tea, mint and pomegranate peel. DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) is the most common test used to evaluate the antioxidant activity (AA) in packaging, while most of the times the determination of the AA of packed foods is carried out with TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay, although other methods are also used (peroxide value, free fatty acids, conjugated dienes and conjugated triene hydroperoxides, p-anisidine value and hexanal analysis). Generally, because there is no consensus on the best test, most of the studies use more than one test to evaluate the AA. Attention was also devoted to the study of the migration of natural antioxidants into food simulants or foods. Recently, there were great improvements in food packaging materials in order to increase food shelf life and to decrease the impact of packaging in the environment. Therefore, there is a growing interest on the association of active packaging with natural AOs with biodegradable and edible packaging. This work was funded under the Project “SafePack – Evaluation of the food safety of active packaging with antioxidant properties“ of the National Institute of Health Dr Ricardo Jorge, I. P., Lisbon (Portugal).
