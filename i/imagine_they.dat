25|$|How {{would it}} have joyed brave Talbot (the terror of the French) to think that after he had lien two hundred years in his tomb, he should triumph again on the stage, and have his bones new embalmed with the tears of ten {{thousand}} spectators at least (at several times), who, in the tragedian that represents his person, <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> behold him fresh bleeding.|$|E
25|$|With Murray’s support, in {{the autumn}} of 1916 Robertson had {{resisted}} attempts to send as many as 4,000 men to Rabegh to help the nascent Arab Revolt, stressing that logistical support would bring the total up to 16,000 men, enough to prevent Murray’s advance on El Arish. Robertson accused the ministers (8 December 1916) of “attaching as much importance to a few scallywags in Arabia as I <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> did to the German attack on Ypres two years ago”, {{but for the first time}} ministers contemplated overruling him. Encouraged by hope that the Russians might advance to Mosul, removing any Turkish threat to Mesopotamia, Robertson authorised Maude to attack in December 1916.|$|E
500|$|In May 1920, the Spanish Flu reached Fairbanks and {{infected}} most of {{the newspaper}} staff. [...] "We had to keep writing of flu and the typesetters kept setting flu stories until they began to <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> had the flu and went—one, two, three—just like that," [...] said Thompson in {{a story on the}} outbreak. Two years later, Thompson and the News-Miner strongly protested the city's order to evict the prostitutes living in a regulated district within Fairbanks. On September 24, 1922, Thompson reported that the News-Miner's press had been sabotaged, oil had been mixed with the paper's printing ink, and a fire had been set in its office, presumably {{as a result of the}} paper's stance against eviction.|$|E

500|$|About casting, Singer said, [...] "You pick {{people not}} {{for what they}} are, but what you <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> can turn into." [...] To {{research}} his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die." [...] Del Toro told Singer, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say so I can go really far out with this and really make it uncomprehensible." ...|$|E
500|$|They were {{concerned}} that it would end in a riot, or even a rebellion, and had arranged for {{a substantial number of}} regular troops and militia yeomanry to be deployed. The military presence comprised 600men of the several hundred infantrymen; a Royal Horse Artillery unit with two six-pounder (2.7kg) guns; 400men of the Cheshire Yeomanry; 400special constables; and 120cavalry of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry. The Manchester & Salford Yeomanry were relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among local shopkeepers and tradesmen, the most numerous of which were publicans. Recently mocked by the Manchester Observer as [...] "generally speaking, the fawning dependents of the great, with a few fools and a greater proportion of coxcombs, who <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> acquire considerable importance by wearing regimentals, they were subsequently variously described as [...] "younger members of the Tory party in arms", and as [...] "hot-headed young men, who had volunteered into that service from their intense hatred of Radicalism". Socialist writer Mark Krantz has described them as [...] "the local business mafia on horseback".|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} to the handheld praises its accomplishments, but defines it as a [...] "niche" [...] device that appeals to only certain gamers. Jeremy Parish considers the WonderSwan the ultimate expression of Gunpei Yokoi's design philosophy and notes its modest impact on the market, but blames Bandai for its lack of success, stating, [...] "While WonderSwan ultimately {{will be remembered as}} a highly localized blip in the history of handheld games, as a platform it genuinely held its own... the system's obscurity resulted more from poor timing and Bandai's strangely meek strategy, not from any inherent flaws {{in the design of the}} machine itself." [...] Parish also goes on to hypothesize on the lack of a WonderSwan release in North America, stating, [...] "given how hard it was to find Neo Geo Pocket systems and games at U.S. retail, it's hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> were clamoring for yet another niche portable from Japan." [...] Luke Plunkett from Kotaku praised the WonderSwan's challenge to Nintendo, stating, [...] "t tried some pretty unique and interesting things, and put up a much sterner fight than most other handhelds ever managed." [...] Retro Gamers Kim Wild criticizes some aspects of the handheld, including its lack of a headphone and AC port, as well as its poor control scheme for left-handed individuals and inability to play multiplayer link games with the headphone adapter connected. Wild offers some praise for the handheld, however, stating [...] "what [...] managed with the WonderSwan was impressive given the competition. The low price even today makes it more than worthy of consideration." ...|$|E

[...] An early plan to continue the basic pattern of the previous records with one side of songs and the other instrumentals was dropped, Bowie instead adding lyrics that foreshadowed the more worldly concerns of his next album, Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps).|$|E

[...] As humans, {{we have the ability to}} see with the mind's eye – to have a perceptual {{experience}} in the absence of visual input. For example, PET scans have shown that when subjects, seated in a room, <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> are at their front door starting to walk either to the left or right, activation begins in the visual association cortex, the parietal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex - all higher cognitive processing centers of the brain.|$|E

[...] Northwestern made 5 and 1/2 round trips, of 550 miles one way from Bethel to McGrath, in the 1940 season, which lasted five months and ended October 1, 1940. [...] According to Robert W. “Bert” Kern, chief engineer and a Portland resident, “we pushed two barges most of the time, hauling mining machinery, caterpillars, bulldozers, dredging outfits, ready-built houses to be put together at McGrath, and anything else you can <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> might need. [...] The airfield at McGrath was almost midway between Anchorage and Nome, and 8 to 10 planes were landing there every day during the summer of 1940.|$|E

I feel very lucky and privileged to be given the opportunity [...] " [...] Grey has various tattoos on his body, each seeming having a specific story, including Gilliam's name tattooed on the heart side of his chest. After the film's release Bong revealed background information, [...] "There are homosexual relationships among the men. Gilliam and Grey seem like a couple with a large age gap. Gilliam is someone whom Grey admires deeply, of course, but one could <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> sleep together too. And Gilliam sends Grey to Curtis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christie, Wildstein, Samson and Baroni were photographed {{together}} {{at the site of}} the World Trade Center during a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. On that occasion, Wildstein later testified, Baroni sarcastically told Christie, [...] "Governor, there is a tremendous amount of traffic in Fort Lee, please know Mayor Sokolich is frustrated he can't get his calls returned," [...] to which Christie was said to have responded, [...] "I <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't be getting their calls returned." [...] According to Wildstein, Baroni then told Christie that Wildstein would monitor the traffic, and Christie responded, [...] "Well, I'm sure Mr. Edge wouldn't be involved in anything political," [...] and laughed. ("Wally Edge" [...] was the pseudonymous persona used by Wildstein in his earlier highly political blog.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints commented: [...] "this {{decision}} {{represents only}} {{the opening of}} a vigorous debate over the rights of the people to define and protect this most fundamental institution – marriage..." [...] The Roman Catholic bishops of California stated: [...] "...the courts do {{not have the right to}} distort the meaning of marriage". National Organization for Marriage (NOM) chairman Maggie Gallagher also disagreed with the ruling. She targeted the judge's sexuality and accused Walker of [...] "substituting his views for those of the American people and of our Founding Fathers who I promise you would be shocked by courts that <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> have the right to put gay marriage in our Constitution". Brian Brown, President of NOM, complained of the [...] "biased way [...] conducted the trial." [...] Some critics have characterized the ruling as judicial activism. The American Family Association called for Walker's impeachment.|$|E
2500|$|That Harey Vj {{is not a}} lost play, however, {{seems to}} be {{confirmed}} by a reference in Thomas Nashe's Piers Penniless his Supplication to the Devil (entered into the Stationers' Register on 8 August 1592), which supports the theory that Harey Vj is 1 Henry VI. Nashe praises a play that features Lord Talbot: [...] "How would it have joyed brave Talbot (the terror of the French), to think that after he had lain two hundred years in his tomb, he should triumph again on the stage, and have his bones new embalmed with the tears of ten thousand spectators (at least), who in the tragedian that represents his person <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> behold him fresh bleeding." [...] It is thought that Nashe is here referring to Harey Vj, i.e. 1 Henry VI, {{as there is no}} other candidate for a play featuring Talbot from this time period (although again, there is the slight possibility that both Henslowe and Nashe are referring to a now lost play).|$|E
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I <b>imagine</b> <b>they</b> are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E
