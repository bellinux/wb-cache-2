This {{depends on how}} far you are from home (displacement), how fast (velocity) you can travel, and how often you must start and stop (acceleration). This module treats kinematics, which {{is the part of}} physics {{concerned}} with the description of the motion of a body. The body may be an automobile, a baseball, a raindrop, a flower in the wind, or a running horse. The change in position of a body can be described in terms of the vector quantities: displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Calculus can be used to define the relationships among these quantities. It is therefore essential to know some basic techniques of calculus to understand the content of this module. The applications in this module only consider motion in one dimension. A later module will treat the more general case of motion in two or three dimensions, but the fundamental concepts will be essentially the same...|$|E

Chances are your {{response}} is a ball park estimate and its value {{depends on how}} fast you have scanned the text, how prepared you have been for this question, perhaps your mood or how much attention you have paid to these words. Time perception is here addressed in three sections. The first section summarizes theoretical difficulties in time perception research, specifically those pertaining to the representation of time and temporal processing. The second section reviews non-exhaustively temporal effects in multisensory perception. Sensory modalities interact in temporal judgement tasks, suggesting that (i) at some level of sensory analysis, the temporal properties across senses can be integrated in building a time percept and (ii) the representational format across senses is compatible for establishing such a percept. In the last section, a two-step analysis of temporal properties is sketched out. In the first step, it is proposed that temporal properties are automatically encoded at early stages of sensory analysis, thus providing the raw material for {{the building of a}} time percept; in the second step, time representations become available to perception through attentional gating of the raw temporal representations and via re-encoding into abstract representations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Because the item, "How {{concerned}} are {{you about}} [...] . ? " asks respondents to indicate their level of concern about an issue, some respondents may sense it assumes they are con-cerned or {{should be concerned about}} the issue. Using a filter question to first determine if people are concerned about the issue before asking for their degree of concern may help solve this problem. To test this hypothesis, a split-ballot experiment was embedded in a national random digit dialing telephone survey on food-related issues. For the four items included in the experi-ment, the group receiving the filter versions of the questions gave roughly double the percentages of "not concerned " responses as the group receiving standard items, and the filter group also gave fewer responses at {{the upper end of the}} response scale. Research on the social uses of language shows that questions often contain presuppositions (i. e., unstated assumptions) about their in-tended respondents (Clark 1985; Grice 1975; Luch and Thomas 1990; Myers 1984). "How long does <b>it</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> drive to work? " assumes the respondent has a job, while "What did you do after jogging?" presupposes the respondent went for a run. Presuppositions are uni-versal elements of human discourse that allow people to communicate with an economical use of words. They are pervasive in all forms of social intercourse, including standardized surveys (Hippler and Schwarz 1987; Suchman and Jordan 1990). The wording of some questions may suggest they are based on pre-An earlier draft of this article was presented at the forty-seventh annual meeting of th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The project sought to produce new knowledge, processes and products with major implications for improving sleep and hence {{quality of life}} for older individuals in both the community and care homes. This was done through a series of 8 work packages (WP) that each collected a range of data: WP 1 : looked at the epidemiology of disrupted sleep through secondary analysis of several large-scale datasets. WP 2 : looked at poor sleep among older people in the community with 2 phases. Phase 1 used a self-completion, postal questionnaire administered to 1158 people over the age of 65 forming one data file with 54 variables (age, sex, marital status, last occupation, number of health conditions, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI. The PSQI asks questions about sleep in the previous month, such as how long did <b>it</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> fall asleep, number of awakenings in the night and use of sleeping medication). Phase 2 comprised of 62 qualitative interviews with poor sleepers identified through phase 1; plus 59 daily audio-sleep diaries over two weeks. 60 daily sleep and activities diaries were also recorded for 14 days equaling one data file of 60 cases, coded in 30 minute periods, 13 variables coded per 30 min block (i. e. 48 blocks x 13 variables per day, plus additional 12 variables per person), totaling 650 variables per person within the file (food and drink intake, social contact, main and secondary activities). Actigraphy was also used. WP 3 : looked at the determinants of poor quality sleep in care homes through a 2 week collection period in 10 care homes. Sleep and activity diaries were completed by researchers daily for 14 days - one data file for 125 residents, 68 variables coded for each day comprising 72 variables in total. Profiles of residents were also recorded with 66 variables for 145 residents in total. WP 4 : explored supported self-management for insomnia among chronically ill patients through a randomised control trial over 6 months. WP 5 : evaluated light therapy among older people in the community with a randomised cross-over 11 week trial of 2 different light intensities with 33 older people. WP 6 : was similar to WP 5 in that it evaluated light therapy but this time in care home residents. A cross -over 12 week trial of 2 different light intensities in 7 care homes involving 80 residents was carried out. WP 7 : looked at the development and evaluation of sensor-based devices to improve sleep of older people through engineering developments and trials of a range of novel devices. WP 8 : focused on the development of a website. Project description: Good sleep in later life reduces risk of falls and depression, is essential for maintaining activity and performance levels, and reduces challenging behaviour encountered in dementia sufferers. This multi-disciplinary research project addresses practice and policy relevant issues arising from the nature, impact and management of the sleep-wake balance in later life. It will extend and 'join up' strategically targeted areas of sleep research relevant to understanding and improving autonomy, active ageing, and quality of later life. Academic partners from six disciplines and four institutions, together with five non-academic partners, will achieve these objectives through research within eight inter-linked work packages. Multiple methods will be used to improve understanding of disrupted sleep and associated medication use in later life, using secondary analysis of existing large databases, and in-depth research with older people in the community and care homes. Interventions will be conducted to evaluate the effects of ‘blue-enriched’ light on quality of sleep in the community and care homes, evaluate a supported self-management programme for insomnia among older patients in general practice, and evaluate newly-developed sensor-devices to improve sleep. A user-friendly information and advice website on sleep will be developed, and a sleep education module prepared for the DIPEx website...|$|E
