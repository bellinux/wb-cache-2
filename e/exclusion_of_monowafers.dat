However, it is not known if long-term <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> livestock grazing has positive effect on above-and belowground community properties in typical steppe of the Loess Plateau. We studied the long-term (20 -year) cumulative effects <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> livestock grazing on above-and belowground community properties compared with that before <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> livestock grazing in a typical steppe of the Loess Plateau, NW China. Our results show that twenty-year <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> livestock grazing significantly increased above-and belowground biomass, species richness, cover and height for five different communities. Most of belowground biomass was in the 0 - 20 cm horizon and grazing exclusion increased biomass especially at the depth of 0 - 10 cm. Our study suggests that long-term <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> livestock grazing can greatly improve community properties of typical steppe in the Loess Plateau...|$|R

40|$|The hukou {{system has}} long been {{regarded}} as the root cause <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> rural-urban migrants in China, so the abolition of this system is considered {{the best way to}} bridge the rural-urban division. This article empirically analyses the extent <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> rural-urban migrants in a transitional period from three dimensions: geographical, opportunity and psychological. It argues that the hukou status is playing a declining role in the social <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> rural-urban migrants, and the market competition appears to play a more important role in social exclusion. This article suggests taking a 'beyond hukou' perspective to re-examine the social <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> rural-urban migrants in urban China. 14 page(s...|$|R

50|$|The {{question}} under s. 24(2) {{is whether}} the system's repute will {{be better served by}} the admission or the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> the evidence, and it is thus necessary to consider any disrepute that may result from the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> the evidence. In my view, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> evidence essential to substantiate the charge, and thus the acquittal of the accused, because of a trivial breach of the Charter.|$|R

40|$|Ethnophaulisms (A. A. Roback, 1944) are {{the words}} used as ethnic slurs to refer to out-groups in hate speech. The results of {{previous}} archival research have suggested {{that it is the}} complexity, more so than the valence, of ethnophaulisms that predicts the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> ethnic immigrant out-groups from the receiving society. This article reports the results of 3 experimental examinations of the relative contributions of complexity and valence in ethnophaulisms to the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> an ethnic out-group. Experiment 1 demonstrated that <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> the ethnic out-group was increased by the use of low-complexity ethnophaulisms. Experiment 2 demonstrated that <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> the ethnic out-group decreased by the use of high-complexity ethnophaulisms. Experiment 3 confirmed the demonstration that exclusion decreased by the use of a different set of high-complexity ethnophaulisms. The results of these three experiments converge to indicate that low complexity exerts more of an effect than negative valences on the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> an ethnic out-group. The implications of these results for theoretical approaches to intergroup behavior are considered...|$|R
