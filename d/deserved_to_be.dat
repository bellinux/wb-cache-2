Several games were chosen initially and the public could vote for which games they felt <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> displayed via a poll on the exhibit's website. BioShock was considered a front runner to be displayed because of its status as a game that demonstrated how artistic the medium can be.|$|E
5|$|The WWE Draft {{also took}} place on Raw and {{resulted}} in The Great Khali being drafted to SmackDown!, thus ending his feud with John Cena. Bobby Lashley was drafted to Raw {{and was forced to}} relinquish his ECW World Championship. Lashley, along with King Booker, Randy Orton and Mick Foley entered a feud with John Cena. On the June 18 episode of Raw, all men began cutting promos on how they <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the number one contender to the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|While {{the general}} public were baffled {{that a man who}} just scored a century against Australia could be left out of the team, the English cricketing press were divided on the decision. Some journalists {{supported}} the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket correspondents of The Times and The Daily Telegraph. Others, prominently the former England captain Ted Dexter, the former Test player Trevor Bailey and E.W. Swanton, all of whom generally sided with the cricket establishment, contended that D'Oliveira <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the team on merit. Swanton said he had received no letters which actually agreed with the omission. Other commentators, such as the Worcestershire club secretary and the former West Indies Test player Learie Constantine, openly stated that D'Oliveira was omitted either because of his race or because the MCC supported apartheid. Some Labour politicians also expressed concern. John Arlott, while asserting that D'Oliveira <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> included, suggested that to demonstrate opposition to apartheid, the MCC should perhaps have selected him even if this were not the case. The general press took a wider view, with several newspaper columns reporting that the decision appeared to have been made to avoid offending the South African government. According to Williams, the public positions held by much of the MCC committee towards South Africa led to suspicions that D'Oliveira may have been left out simply to save the tour.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P. Chary accused the film of being based on a novel that he had written and published as a serial under the title Chanderi in a monthly magazine in 1998. He demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using his idea without consent, and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands, or remade the film in another language. He added that he <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> credited for the story and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish were trying to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Kirthana Ramisetti of Entertainment Weekly posted that The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{released}} on DVD. Gord Lacey, {{the creator of}} the website TVShowsonDVD.com, told the New York Daily News that Brisco was among the five most requested shows on the site. Lacey spent several years lobbying industry contacts to get Brisco {{released on}} DVD. This led to correspondence with Cuse, who also wanted to get a DVD set produced. On July 18, 2006, Warner Home Video released The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1, an 8-disc DVD set that contains all 27 episodes of the series. The release includes commentary tracks from Campbell and Cuse; an interactive menu of Brisco's signature references narrated by Campbell; The History of Brisco County, Jr., documentary; a feature called A Reading from the Book of Bruce; and another gallery hosted by Campbell focusing on the gadgets from the show.|$|E
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

25|$|The {{audience}} on You're Fired unanimously agreed that Jenny <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fired, but were more divided on Jennifer.

25|$|The {{majority}} of the You're Fired studio audience, combined {{with two of the}} panellists, disagreed with the decision, feeling that Claire should have been fired for her complete lack of respect, although Simon himself said that he <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fired. Sir Alan would later go on to say that he kept Claire as she still had more potential, even if her attitude was lacking.|$|E

Though Lord Sugar indicated that he felt Haya had actually been more consistent overall than James, James's two victories as project manager ended up earning him the other finalists' spot.|$|E
25|$|Though Fortunato is {{presented}} as a connoisseur of fine wine, L. Moffitt Cecil of Texas Christian University argues that his actions in the story make that assumption questionable. For example, Fortunato comments on another nobleman being unable to distinguish amontillado from sherry when amontillado is in fact a type of sherry, and treats De Grave, an expensive French wine, with very little regard by drinking it in a single gulp. Cecil also states that a true wine connoisseur would never sample wine while intoxicated and describes Fortunato as merely an alcoholic. Cecil also suggests that some people might feel Fortunato <b>deserved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried alive for wasting a bottle of fine wine.|$|E
