5|$|Omphalea, {{like many}} {{other members of the}} Euphorbiaceae, {{possesses}} leaf nectaries that attract polistine wasps, which are predators of early instar caterpillars. The leaf nectaries also attract ants. The ants usually protect their host plant, eating both the nectar and plant-eating insects on it. However, they generally completely ignore Chrysiridia caterpillars, making it likely that the caterpillars possess a chemical <b>deterrent</b> as a primary defence. This chemical <b>deterrent</b> comes from the host plants. Omphalea species contain polyhydroxy alkaloids potentially sequestered or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.|$|E

The study used a qualitative research design, as students, teachers, and administrators from two ESL program sites were interviewed in {{focus groups and}} individual interviews. Findings suggest that Hispanic immigrants face <b>deterrents</b> due to both their personal situations (personal <b>deterrents)</b> and to ESL program characteristics (institutional <b>deterrents).</b> Furthermore, some institutional <b>deterrents</b> may be easily reduced, which may in turn increase Hispanic ESL program participation...|$|R

40|$|In Lincoln County, Washington, USA, greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) {{are managed}} as reintroduced and {{augmented}} populations, respectively. Predation by raptors and corvids is a concern, particularly where utility poles may provide hunting perches near leks (i. e., breeding areas). Perch <b>deterrents</b> may offer a mitigating strategy if <b>deterrents</b> reduce the frequency or duration of perching. To investigate {{the effects of}} various perch <b>deterrents,</b> we deployed <b>deterrents</b> on 5 power poles retained for use in this study when 33 poles were removed from occupied grouse habitat. We rotated <b>deterrents</b> among poles every 15 to 28 days (x = 19. 4 days) from November 17, 2011, through November 20, 2012, so that all <b>deterrents</b> occurred multiple times on all poles. We compared perch frequency and duration on 4 pole caps, 3 insulator <b>deterrents,</b> an untreated control cross arm, and 5 cross-arm-length deterrents: Pupi™ cross arms mounted at a 22 ° angle from horizontal; Birdzoff™ deterrents; an experimental shroud; Power Line Sentry X™ deterrents; and Zena Designs™ minispike <b>deterrents.</b> We collected 862 independent records of perching events. Raptors and corvids perched most often (χ 2 = 146. 0, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) on untreated cross arms ( = 0. 60 perches/day), and insulator <b>deterrents</b> (x = 0. 47 perches/day), and perched least often on pole caps with spikes (x = 0. 11 perches/day) and Zena Designs mini-spikes (x = 0. 10 perches/day). Perching events were shorter on pole caps with spikes and Zena Designs mini-spikes compared to all other treatments (F 8, 853 = 23. 53, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Prey captures also were significantly less likely from treated cross arms than from the control cross arm (χ 2 = 86. 5, df = 4, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Birds attempting to perch on <b>deterrents</b> often flapped their wings broadly where energized conductors would have existed if the poles had not been decommissioned. On energized poles, electrocution {{would have been possible}} in this situation. When perch <b>deterrents</b> are used, insulation or isolation of energized equipment also must be installed to minimize electrocution risk...|$|R

In July 1934, the ship was featured in a Jimmy Cagney film, Here Comes the Navy, about the romantic troubles of a sailor.

Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a <b>deterrent.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: For the {{shortage}} of high-quality general practitioners (GPs) in China's rural areas, Chinese government has taken steps to encourage rural specialists to participate in transition training for future GPs. Specialists’ initial participation motivations and their perceived <b>deterrents</b> during training may play important roles for their learning engagement in the transition training. This study aimed at revealing the relationships among the variables of initial participation motivations, perceived <b>deterrents</b> in training, and learning engagement. Methods: A questionnaire survey {{was used in this}} study. A total of 156 rural specialists who participated in transition training for future GPs filled out the questionnaire, which consisted of the measurements of initial participation motivations, perceived <b>deterrents,</b> and learning engagement in training. The data about specialists’ demographic variables were collected at the same time. Results: The variance of initial escape/stimulations motivation significantly predicted the variance of learning engagement through the full mediating role of perceived <b>deterrents</b> in training. In addition, initial educational preparation motivations predicted the variance of learning engagement directly. Conclusions: Specialists’ initial participation motivations and perceived <b>deterrents</b> in training played important roles for learning engagement in the transition training...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of variables that may influence the decision of seniors {{over the age of}} 60 not to participate in adult learning activities and literacy skills. Three research questions were of interest to the researcher. First, which of five socio-economic status (SES) variables (age, income, gender, employment status, education) are the best predictors of <b>deterrents</b> to participation in adult learning activities by seniors 60 years of age and over? Second, which of six <b>deterrents</b> to participation (lack of confidence, lack of course relevance, time constraints, low personal priority, cost, and personal problems) are the best predictors of participation in adult learning activities by seniors 60 years of age and over? Finally, is participation in adult learning activities by seniors 60 years of age and over a predictor of seniors' literacy skills? To measure seniors' reasons for not participating in adult learning activities, the <b>Deterrents</b> to Participation Scale-General was administered. Literacy skills were measured by the Tests of Applied Literacy Skills document literacy domain. To test the factors that were expected to affect non-participation, a survey questionnaire was administered to two groups, those who were currently participating in an organized adult learning activity and those who were not. Multiple regression estimates demonstrated that none of the regression lines could be plotted against any of the six <b>deterrents</b> to participation as criterion variables on the five SES variables as predictors. However, when the SES variables were held constant, only the effect of the variable employment status using the <b>deterrents</b> to participation lack of course relevance and low personal priority had a tendency to deliver the strongest explanatory power among all other predictor variables. Furthermore, regression estimates demonstrated that none of the six <b>deterrents</b> to participation had any effect on participation and that document literacy skills could not be predicted as a function of participation. In addition, the DPS-G showed low reliability estimates suggesting that the instrument needs to be revised taking into consideration other dimensions of <b>deterrents</b> to participation that are more relevant to seniors' lives...|$|R
