50|$|In December 1930, Adler {{assigned}} the German engineer Josef Ganz, {{who was also}} editor-in-chief of Motor-Kritik magazine, as a consultant engineer.

50|$|In 1929, Josef Ganz started {{contacting}} German motorcycle manufacturers Zündapp, Ardie and DKW {{for collaboration}} {{to build a}} prototype, small people's car. This resulted in a first prototype, the Ardie-Ganz, built at Ardie in 1930 and a second one completed at Adler in May 1931, which was nicknamed the Maikäfer (‘May-Beetle’, common European cockchafer Melolontha melolontha). News about the prototypes spread through the industry.

50|$|The first {{company to}} build a car {{according}} to the many patents of Josef Ganz was the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik, which introduced its Standard Superior model at the IAMA (Internationale Auto- und Motorradausstellung) in Berlin in February 1933. It featured a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and <b>independent</b> <b>wheel</b> suspension with swing-axles at the rear. Here the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler expressed interest in its design and low selling price of 1,590 Reichsmark. Under the new anti-Semitic government, however, Josef Ganz was a target for his enemies from the automotive industry that opposed his writings in Motor-Kritik.|$|E

5000|$|Talgo has {{developed}} recently a train known as [...] "AVRIL" [...] (Alta Velocidad Rueda Independiente Ligero — Light High-Speed <b>Independent</b> <b>Wheel),</b> intended for speeds of 380 km/h. The system uses underfloor traction {{in the front}} and rear vehicles, with the intermediate carriages having the Talgo Pendular system (which cannot use motored axles on the axles corresponding to the system).

It won its first major contract in November 2016, for the Mediterranean corridor in Spain, and its link to Paris.|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the railway {{industry}} has focused its attention on new bogie designs and secondary suspension technologies, {{as well in}} the field of high speed trains as in the field of urban tramways. The goal mainly consists in improving the vehicle rolling behaviour in terms of stability and longevity, but also to enhance the passenger comfort and to reduce the inconvenience of the railway track neighborhood (noise, vibration, etc.). The use of <b>independent</b> <b>wheels</b> certainly represents one of the most ”revolutionary” innovation of the last decades. Indeed, it aims at replacing the traditional wheelset which exists for more than one century and {{is at the root of}} the bogie guidance thanks to its well-established self-steering capability. Various contributions have pointed out the advantages of bogies equipped with <b>independent</b> (or ”freely-rotating”) <b>wheels</b> such as the absence of the hunting critical speed (high speed train dynamics) or the possibility of low-floor vehicles (tramway design). On the other hand, freely rotating wheels lack the steering performances of the traditional rigid wheelsets and must rely, to steer the vehicle back into a centered position, on the wheel/track gravitational stiffness phenomenon and/or on any additional”mechanism” to ensure a good bogie guidance (active/passive steering mechanism, left/right actuation control, steerable wheels, etc.). The goal of the present paper is to show that, thanks to the multibody approach, it is possible to analyze the dynamic behavior of a complex articulated bogie with <b>independent</b> <b>wheels,</b> to reveal its stable and unstable motions and to propose, via ”numerical experimentations” a technical solution in order to re-stabilize the vehicle...|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{a lot of}} work in the {{definition}} of traction control algorithms for electric vehicles (EV) has been developed [9 – 15]. In EV, the torque generation is very quick and accurate, both for accelerating and decelerating. The torque control of each wheel is ensured by the inverter, and it does not require a mechanical differential gear. The electronic control of the torque and of the speed of each one of the four <b>independent</b> <b>wheels</b> allows the EV to operate more efficiently avoiding slippage. Furthermore, an efficient control of the torque allows an increment of the energy efficiency of the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|With the Ardie-Ganz, Adler Maikäfer and Standard Superior cars, {{as well as}} his {{progressive}} {{writings and}} promotion of the concept of a Volkswagen (people's car) in Motor-Kritik magazine since the 1920s, Josef Ganz is claimed by some to have had input into the Volkswagen Beetle.
