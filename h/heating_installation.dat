40|$|This paper applies a semi-parametric {{approach}} to estimating a generalised model of investments in <b>heating</b> <b>installations.</b> The {{results suggest that}} marginal costs of investments in <b>heating</b> <b>installations</b> increase quickly at small investment levels, whereas the increase slows down at higher investment levels. Therefore, standard parametric adjustment cost models are probably biased such that they underestimate the costs of small investments and overestimate the costs of large investments. Results also show that investments in <b>heating</b> <b>installations</b> are very responsive to changes in energy prices. Therefore, an energy tax may be an effective instrument to encourage investments in new energy-saving <b>heating</b> <b>installations.</b> Copyright 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

50|$|Flowing screeds {{are made}} from inert fillers such as sand, with a binder system based on calcium sulphate. Consequently they can look very similar to a sand/cement screed Flow screeds are often {{preferred}} to traditional cement based screeds as they are faster to install and provide a similar finish. Flow screed is most often used in combination with underfloor <b>heating</b> <b>installation</b> as the reduced thickness provides for more effective and efficient heat transfer. One of the main advantages of liquid flow screed is that, it offers few additional benefits compared to sand and cement. It is anything but difficult to pour, with fluid properties that consider an expedient application and quicker drying time. There aren't any bigger advantages of this product than when combined with underfloor heatingsystem, a lesser thickness of liquid flooring screed, when compared with conventional screeds, minimises heat storage leading to a floor that reacts quickly to user requirement hence raising the efficacy of your underfloor heating method.|$|E

5000|$|In 1963, finally, the Cantonal Bank {{decided that}} the Sporthotel had no longterm {{commercial}} future, and [...] "Sporthotel Pontresina AG" [...] was placed in liquidation. [...] On 17 August 1963 the cantonal land registry recorded a change in ownership in respect of the hotel building. [...] The next year a new owner invested new money in a major renovation exercise. The 1913 central <b>heating</b> <b>installation</b> was replaced in 1965. The south wing, the oldest part of the hotel, was extensively reconfigured {{and the number of}} guest rooms was reduced through the substitution on the first and second floors of two large apartments. [...] Further upgrades took place in 1967, with {{an increase in the number}} of guest rooms permanently incorporating their own en suite bathroom facilities. [...] The large retail space at the southern end of the front facade, which had for some decades accommodated a branch of the Graubündner Kantonalbank, was rebuilt as a sports goods shop using a plan by the architect Otto Kober, opening in 1971, while the bank branch had already been relocated, in 1970, to a newly constructed extension attached to the [...] "Hotel Schweizerhof".|$|E

At this part of the university, there are six Bachelor Degrees (Mechanical-, Electrical-, Electronic-, Chemical-, Computer- and Surveying Engineering) and one Master Degree (Industrial Engineering). The design of a <b>heating</b> <b>installation</b> in a house starts with a heat loss {{calculation}} for the whole building. The calculation will be done with the help of excel. The <b>heating</b> <b>installation</b> {{needs to be able to}} overcome these losses in the worst possible weather situation. So this value defines the whole installation. The next step in this project is to calculate the capacity of the underfloor heating and the rest of the installation. The information of the underfloor heating can be found on the website of Rehau. The use of underfloor heating makes it possible to use heating boilers at low regime 30 °C/ 50 °C. A solar system will provide hot sanitary water. &# 8195...|$|E

40|$|In {{a global}} climate of {{environmental}} awareness, the expectations regarding energy performance of dwellings are increasingly high. Finding the appropriate heating system in such houses is sensitive. Such a system must meet reduced heating needs while not generating excessive emissions. Emissions would wreck {{the efforts to}} reduce the heating needs of these new or renovated homes. Moreover, {{in a context of}} economic crisis, the budget allocated to housing is limited. That is why the aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate and compare different systems in the framework of energy efficient renovation (i. e., nearly zero energy buildings) to identify which one best meets the current economic and environmental objectives. Different systems are modelled and simulated using TRNSYS in an attached dwelling. They are then evaluated and compared on the basis of their investment, operating, and long-term costs as well as the emissions and primary energy consumption they generate. The main conclusion is that the performance of the <b>heating</b> <b>installation</b> is not the most important factor when choosing a heating system for highly insulated houses. The optimum system identified from an environmental and economic point of view is the recovery of the existing <b>heating</b> <b>installation,</b> followed by installation of a gas-condensing boiler...|$|E
