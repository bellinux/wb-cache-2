But far be it <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That was very hard for me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also a admiration thing <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing".|$|E

He installed in the college a master, Laurence Chaderton, three fellows, and four scholars; but subsequent benefactions soon increased the fellowships to fourteen and the scholarships to fifty. According to Fuller, Mildmay, on coming to court, after the college was opened was addressed by the Queen with the words: [...] "Sir Walter, I hear you have erected a puritan foundation", to which Mildmay replied: [...] "No, madam; far be it <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> countenance anything contrary to your established laws; but I have set an acorn, which when it becomes an oak, God alone knows {{what will be the}} fruit thereof".|$|E
2500|$|In {{another such}} tradition, Ali was once reciting a sermon {{in the city}} of Kufah, when Ash'as ibn Qays, a {{commander}} in the Arab army protested, [...] "Amir-al-Momeneen!

[...] Ali immediately retorted, [...] "While fat Arabs rest in soft beds, the Iranians work hard on the hottest days to please God with their efforts. And what do these Arabs want <b>from</b> <b>me?</b> <b>To</b> ostracize the Iranians and become an oppressor! I swear by the God that splits the nucleus and creates Man, I heard the prophet once say, just as you strike the Iranians with your swords in the name of Islam, so will the Iranians one day strike you back the same way for Islam." ...|$|E

Remember that I willingly let you enter me and I gave birth to your sons, [...] enduring pain to bring them into the world. As different as we are, we are of one spirit. As dissimilar as we are, you and I, we are of equal worth. As different as we are, there must be solidarity between us. There can be no harmony in the universe unless there is harmony between us.

2500|$|On March 26, Butch {{was greeted}} at Pearl Harbor by {{a horde of}} reporters and radio announcers. During a radio {{broadcast}} in Honolulu, he enjoyed the opportunity {{to say hello to}} Rita ("Here's a great big radio hug, the best I can do under the circumstances") and to his mother ("Love <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> you"). On April 8, he thanked the Grumman Aircraft Corporation plant at Bethpage (where the F4F Wildcat was made) for 1,150 cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes, a grand total of 230,000 smokes. Ecstatic Grumman workers had passed the hat to buy the cigarettes in appreciation of O'Hare's combat victories in one of their F4F Wildcats. A loyal Camel smoker, Butch opened a carton, deciding that it was the least he could do for the good people back in Bethpage. In his letter to the Grumman employees he wrote, [...] "You build them, we'll fly them and between us, we can't be beaten." [...] It was a sentiment he would voice often in the following two months.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} year came {{responses}} to the ode by two Romantic writers. Leigh Hunt, a second-generation Romantic poet, added notes to his poem Feast of the Poets that respond to the ideas suggested in Wordsworth's poetry. These ideas include Wordsworth's promotion of a simple mental state without cravings for knowledge, and it is such an ideas that Hunt wanted to mock in his poem. However, Hunt did not disagree completely with Wordsworth's sentiments. After quoting the final lines of the Ode: Intimations of Immortality, those that [...] "Wordsworth has beautifully told us, that to him '--the meanest flow'r that blows can give/ Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears", Hunt claims, [...] "I have no doubt of it; and far be it <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> cast stones into the well in which they lie,-- to disturb those reposing waters,-- that freshness {{at the bottom of}} warm hearts,-- those thoughts, which if they are too deep for tears, are also, in their best mood, too tranquil even for smiles. Far be it also <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> hinder the communication of such thoughts to mankind, when they are not sunk beyond their proper depth, so as to make one dizzy in looking down to them." [...] Following Hunt, William Hazlitt, a critic and Romantic writer, wrote a series of essays called [...] "Character of Mr. Wordsworth's New Poems" [...] in three parts, starting in the 21 August 1814 Examiner. Although Hazlitt treated Wordsworth's poetry fairly, he was critical of Wordsworth himself and he removed any positive statements about Wordsworth's person from a reprint of the essays. The 2 October 1814 essay examined poetry as either of imagination or of sentiment, and quotes the final lines of the poem as an example of [...] "The extreme simplicity which some persons have objected to in Mr. Wordsworth's poetry is to be found only in the subject and style: the sentiments are subtle and profound. In the latter respect, his poetry is as much above the common standard or capacity, as in the other it is below it... We go along with him, while he is the subject of his own narrative, but we take leave of him when he makes pedlars and ploughmen his heroes and the interpreters of his sentiments." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, pastel blue, pink, {{and green}} {{wrappers}} were introduced for Easter, and in 1986, Valentine's Day-themed wrappers {{of red and}} silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine’s Day. [...] "Fall Harvest" [...] colors were introduced in 1991. Independence Day has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with [...] "ribbons" [...] on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper.

2500|$|Richey {{recalled}} {{that he met}} in Columbia with former Governor John McKeithen, who had been instrumental in Winters's election as national committeewoman. Richey found that the two were [...] "apparently ... on the outs ... {{at the time of}} our election. At one meeting ... he suggested that I make a big push with black voters by informing them that 'Mary Lou Winters was a member of not one, but two Lily-white country clubs.' That exact line appeared in campaign letters <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> black voters in the waning days of the election." [...] Richey ran first in the primary and defeated Mrs. Winters in the second balloting, 58-42 percent. Prior to the Senate election, Winters, a graduate of Louisiana State University, had been the chief lobbyist for the Louisiana State Medical Society, in which capacity she worked pro bono in 1975 to obtain passage of legislation to protect the medical profession against questionable lawsuits. Winters served for thirty-two years on the Democratic National Committee and attended all of the presidential nominating conventions during her tenure. In 1996, Winters was an elector for President Bill Clinton, who carried Louisiana in both of his elections. She was later the vice chairman of her state party.|$|E
2500|$|From George Wilkins Kendall's {{account of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition: [...] "In their habits, they are clannish, social, and {{extremely}} convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the contrary, always found in villages or large settlements. They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting from hole to hole to gossip and talk over each other's affairs—at least so their actions would indicate. On several occasions I crept close to their villages, without being observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre {{of one of them}} I particularly noticed a very large dog, {{sitting in front of the}} door or entrance to his burrow, and by his own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events, he was the 'big dog' of the place. For at least an hour I secretly watched the operations in this community. During that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles. All this while he never left his post for a moment, and I thought I could discover a gravity in his deportment not discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it <b>from</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say that the visits he received were upon business, or had anything to do with the local government of the village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the prairie dog." ...|$|E
