40|$|Local {{failure and}} damages have led several {{buildings}} {{around the world}} progressively collapsed {{during the last few}} decades. Consequently, several design codes and standards have provoked considering the progressive collapse in designing the buildings according to their occupancy and the potential resulted hazards. In this thesis, a new mitigation scheme is proposed to resist the progressive collapse of reinforced concrete buildings that resulted from potential column failure. The proposed scheme comprises installing steel cables parallel to the columns either externally connected the ends of the beams for retro fitting existing buildings or embedded in the columns for upgrading new buildings. Also, the proposed scheme includes placing a <b>hat</b> braced steel <b>frame</b> {{on the top of the}} buildings by which the vertical cables are hanged and supported. When a column failure occurs, the vertical cables will transfer the floor loads upward to the <b>hat</b> braced <b>frame</b> which in turn redistributes these transferred loads to the adjacent columns. A finite element modelling is developed by using the finite element program ANSYS 11. 0 (2008) and a nonlinear dynamic analysis is conducted following the alternate path method recommended by GSA (2003) and UFC (2009) guidelines to investigate the validity of the proposed scheme. In addition, a simplified technique is developed and programmed in MATLAB 7. 8. 0 (2009) for designing the vertical cables of the proposed mitigation scheme. Conventional reinforced concrete building models designed according to the Australian Standards AS 3600 (2009) have been adopted in the investigations.

The new scheme comprises of installing vertical cables along the columns and hanging {{at the top of}} the building to a <b>hat</b> braced steel <b>frame</b> to provide an alternate load path above the potential failed columns. This scheme has been initially proposed by [1, 2]. The authors conducted two dimensional finite elements analysis to investigate the viability of the proposed new scheme in which they considered embedding the cables in the columns for the new buildings and connecting the cables at the ends of the beams for the existing buildings. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element analysis is conducted to investigate the viability of the new mitigation scheme in which the effect of the out of plane (transverse) beams and the <b>hat</b> braced <b>frame</b> members as well as their imposed loadings are considered. The investigations are conducted in conjunction with the alternate path method recommended in [3] in which different scenarios of the first floor columns failure are adopted and used for checking the performance of old buildings and in designing new buildings. In this study, a numerical investigation is undertaken for a ten-storey reinforced concrete building considering the progressive collapse performance of the building with and without applying the mitigation scheme. The commercial general purpose finite element software ANSYS 11. 0 [4] is used in the numerical investigation. In this study, the failure of the corner column is considered. The results of the investigation of the building model show that the new approach of using cables and a steel braced frame is efficient in absorbing the loss of a first floor column and resisting the progressive collapse of the building...|$|R

He returned Deronda's notice till at last their eyes met; an undesirable chance with unknown persons, and a reason to Deronda for not looking again; but he immediately found an open prayer-book pushed toward him and had to bow his thanks. However, the congregation had mustered, the reader had mounted to the almemor or platform, and the service began. Deronda, having looked enough at the German translation of the Hebrew in the book before {{him to know that}} he was chiefly hearing Psalms and Old Testament passages or phrases, gave himself up to that strongest effect of chanted liturgies which is independent of detailed verbal meaning--like the effect of an Allegri's Miserere or a Palestrina's Magnificat. The most powerful movement of feeling with a liturgy is the prayer which seeks for nothing special, but is a yearning to escape from the limitations of our own weakness and an invocation of all Good to enter and abide with us; or else a self-oblivious lifting up of Gladness, a Gloria in excelsis that such Good exists; both the yearning and the exaltation gathering their utmost force from the sense of communion in a form which has expressed them both, for long generations of struggling fellow-men. The Hebrew liturgy, like others, has its transitions of litany, lyric, proclamation, dry statement and blessing; but this evening, all were one for Deronda: the chant of the Chazaris or Reader's grand wide-ranging voice with its passage from monotony to sudden cries, the outburst of sweet boys' voices from the little choir, the devotional swaying of men's bodies backward and forward, the very commonness of the building and shabbiness of the scene where a national faith, which had penetrated the thinking of half the world, and moulded the splendid forms of that world's religion, was finding a remote, obscure echo--all were blent for him as one expression of a binding history, tragic and yet glorious. He wondered at the strength of his own feeling; it seemed beyond the occasion--what one might imagine to be a divine influx in the darkness, before there was any vision to interpret. The whole scene was a coherent strain, its burden a passionate regret, which, if he had known the liturgy for the Day of Reconciliation, he might have clad in its authentic burden; [...] "Happy the eye which saw all these things; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul. Happy the eye that saw our temple and the joy of our congregation; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul.

That fat, faint lady could only goggle up like a dying fish at the enormous new gentleman, who politely offered himself as a lodger, with vast gestures of the wide white hat in one hand, and the yellow Gladstone bag in the other. Fortunately, Mrs. Duke's more efficient niece and partner was there to complete the contract; for, indeed, {{all the people of}} the house had somehow collected in the room. This fact, in truth, was typical of the whole episode. The visitor created an atmosphere of comic crisis; and from the time he came into the house to the time he left it, he somehow got the company to gather and even follow (though in derision) as children gather and follow a Punch and Judy. An hour ago, and for four years previously, these people had avoided each other, even when they had really liked each other. They had slid in and out of dismal and deserted rooms in search of particular newspapers or private needlework. Even now they all came casually, as with varying interests; but they all came. There was the embarrassed Inglewood, still a sort of red shadow; there was the unembarrassed Warner, a pallid but solid substance.

Swaggering on short legs with a prosperous purple tie, he was the gayest of godless little dogs; but like a dog also in this, that however he danced and wagged with delight, the two dark eyes on each side of his protuberant nose glistened gloomily like black buttons.

She also, like Mr. Moon, had a new companion, new so far as this narrative goes, but in reality an old friend and a protegee. This was a slight young woman in dark gray, and in no way notable but for a load of dull red hair, of which the shape somehow gave her pale face that triangular, almost peaked, appearance which was given by the lowering headdress and deep rich ruff of the Elizabethan beauties.

40|$|The {{most popular}} {{technique}} for inspecting natural gas pipelines {{involves the use}} of magnetic flux leakage (MFL) methods. The measured MFL signal is interpreted to obtain information concerning the structural integrity of the pipe. Defect characterization involves the task of calculating the shape and size of defects based on the information contained in the signal. An accurate estimate of the defect profile allows assessment of the safe operating pressure of the pipe. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been employed for characterizing defects in the past. However, conventional neural networks such as radial basis function neural networks are not always suitable for the following reasons: (1) It is difficult to quantify and measure the confidence level associated with the profile estimates. (2) They do not provide adequate control over output accuracy and network complexity trade-off. (3) Optimal center selection schemes typically use an optimization technique such as least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm [...] -a tedious and computationally intensive procedure. These disadvantages can be overcome by employing a wavelet basis function (WBF) neural network. Such networks allow multiple scales of approximation. For the specific application on hand, Gaussian radial basis functions and Mexican <b>hat</b> wavelet <b>frames</b> are used as scaling functions and wavelets respectively. The proposed basis function centers are calculated using a dyadic expansion scheme and the k-means clustering algorithm;The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated by predicting defect profiles from simulation data as well as experimental magnetic flux leakage signals. The results demonstrate that wavelet basis function neural networks can successfully map MFL signatures to three-dimensional defect profiles. The center selection scheme requires minimal effort compared to conventional methods. Also, the accuracy of the output can be controlled by varying the number of network resolutions. It is also shown that the use of a priori information such as estimates of the geometric parameters of the defect helps improve characterization results...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to GPS (Global Positioning System) attitude determination for small satellite application in LEO (low Earth orbit). Prior knowledge of attitude and integer resolution is not required. The methodology of the new approach includes integer ambiguity search, initial estimation of attitude and line bias, attitude initialisation, path difference estimation and fine attitude determination. The observable is the carrier phase difference measurement between two GPS antennas. A dual short baseline (typical baseline length up to 30 cm) is assumed in this research. The key point to initialising attitude is to estimated the attitude of individual baseline vectors with respect to the reference frame. Elimination of integer ambiguity is a simple task. Two set of vectors are required to determine an initial attitude. Once attitude is initialised, an estimation algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter starts to determine the attitude. The integer ambiguities and cycle slips can be resolved properly. The filter now is converged and, fine attitude is estimated. The robustness of the filtering estimator is tested with simulated anomalous conditions.

Through multi-sited fieldwork in Vietnam (Hanoi, Tam Kỳ, Quy Nhơn, and Hồ Chí Minh City) and the Vietnamese refugee community of southern California, my research focuses on the musical theatre genre hát bội, with origins that can be traced {{as far back as the}} eleventh century. This art form has undergone transformations during Vietnam's tumultuous history, through French colonialism, independence, a communist revolution, recent economic reforms, and in the refugee community that fled the war. The myriad ways (films, fiction, memoirs, photographs, political speeches, memorials) in which Vietnamese history, especially the war, has been told, are often highly contested. This dissertation centers around the social and political meanings ascribed to hát bội today across national and diasporic communities, and how hát bội is a medium through which the negotiation and construction of contested memories have taken place. In Vietnam, I examine three state-sponsored hát bội troupes and their performances at a highly political national competition, organized by the government. In this state-sponsored competition, I look at the ways in which performances of hát bội have been able to both sustain and subvert nationalist memories. In southern California, I argue that performances of <b>hát</b> bội are <b>framed</b> in the context of nostalgia, loss, and longing for a no longer existing homeland, and in the context of American society that has so often left South Vietnamese experiences unacknowledged.

40|$|When fire {{takes place}} in a steel frame, any heated column may buckle at some {{temperature}} due to deterioration in both the stiffness and the strength, although the external load to the frame remains unchanged during fire. This column’s buckling is likely a main cause of the instability for steel frames subjected to fire. Researches on the high temperature buckling of columns span, in fact, for decades. Culver (1973) was the first to analyze precisely the behavior of the buckling of columns by using finite element analysis. Referring to the experimental studies conducted by Burgess et al. (1992), Franssen has recently made a specific comparison between the test and numerical analysis results (1995, 1996). Although the studies on centrally compressed and simply supported columns provide the basic knowledge on the problem, the behaviors of the heated columns incorporated into the frame are different from those of isolated members. In fact, when fire occurs in a steel frame, the expanded and therefore elongated column is axially restrained by the rest of members, so that thermal compressive force is applied additionally to the heated column (Neves, 1995; Correia Rodrigues et al., 2000). As a result, the buckling temperature of the heated column is lowered due to this thermal stress. On the other hand, since the incorporated column is, at the same time, restrained rotationally at its ends by the neighboring members, the effective length of this column should become shorter than the column height and this raises in turn the buckling temperature of the column. Another facet of the problem is the overall stability of the frame, when and after the incorporated columns buckle due to fire. Some frames may fall into instability directly after the incorporated column buckle, while the other may remain stable and be able to sustain further increase in member temperature. Once the instability takes place, the former frame cannot maintain static equilibrium any more. This means that, to solve the problem, ordinary load controlled analysis is not applicable in this case, but we need to develop another new numerical method to analyze the unstable frames. For the latter stable frames with heated and buckled columns, on the other hand, stress redistribution capacity of the neighboring members may play an essential role on controlling their ultimate states. Therefore, to clarify the structural performances of the frames with heated and buckled columns, a special emphasis must be placed on their stabilities as well as their ultimate load carrying characteristics when and after several heated columns buckle. The adopted analysis method must be able to trace these natures of the problem accordingly. In view of the above observations, the main objectives of this study are to be set as follows: 1. To understand and to clarify the mechanics which control the overall stabilities of steel frames with heated and buckled columns. 2. To develop a numerical analysis program that can solve such stability problems of steel frames subjected to fire. 3. To clarify the buckling temperatures of the incorporated columns as well as the frame’s ultimate temperatures. 4. To find the actual ultimate states and the corresponding ultimate temperatures of steel frames subjected to fire. 5. To find the means to prevent the frames subjected to fire from instability. In order to achieve the above presented objectives, this dissertation is divided into five chapters, which are briefly described below. Chapter one starts with brief review of previous studies. Fire resistant design of steel structures is reviewed in many relevant aspects, the experimental tests, and numerical analysis. After that, the problem about instability in steel structure that occurred in the collapse of WTC Towers is summarized. This is considered an indispensable background for conceiving the objective of this study, which constitutes the above sections. In chapter 2, the stabilities and the ultimate behaviors of steel frames after the incorporated heated columns buckle are investigated extensively. If the surrounding members can redistribute the vertical load of the frame which has been carried by the buckled column, it may retain the stability and may not collapse immediately. On the contrary, when the surrounding members are weak, an overall frame will fall into instability directly due to column buckling. This chapter describes and discusses these problems specifically. Furthermore, in this chapter, the development of the numerical analysis method is described specifically, which can simulate both the stable and unstable behaviors of steel frames subjected to fire. The development is focused on the computational procedure to simulate an unstable and therefore actually a dynamic frame behavior purely by a static means. At the end of this chapter, example numerical solutions solved by the method developed are shown, where complete fire responses and realistic ultimate states due to fire of steel frames are illustrated and discussed extensively. By using the numerical method whereby the control of the analysis is switched between load and displacement methods, we can examine the behavior of the steel column subjected to fire until it overall collapses. The load controlled analysis is the increase-in-temperature method. While the displacement analysis is the analysis that one degree-of-freedom of the unstable member’s node is gripped, and it is moved in the direction that the unstable state is growing. The displacement analysis is carried out under the temperature that the structure loses its stability. By using this analysis method to analyze some examples of a steel structure subjected to fire, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The main unstable condition of a steel structure subjected to fire is the “snap-through” process. This snap-through easily occurs in the structure when the post-buckling residual force is low and the stiffness and the strength of the restraining members in the structure are low. That means that the structure’s ability to remain stable while the surrounding members restrain the buckling column is intimately connected with the instabilities of the structure itself. ･ The collapse of the structure is not decided solely by the buckling of the heated column. The ultimate temperature of the structure’s collapse mode varies according to the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members. If the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members is low, the structure loses its stability and collapses suddenly after the column buckles. In this case, the ultimate temperature of this kind of structure is lower than the column buckling temperature due to the thermal stress. However, if the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members is high, the structure still keeps its stability even though the column buckles. The ultimate temperature of this kind of structure is more than the column buckling temperature. The third chapter clarifies specifically the buckling temperatures of steel columns incorporated into frames. The buckling temperature is defined as the one at which a column begins to show an apparent buckling deformation. The incorporated columns are restrained rotationally by the adjacent members when they buckle. Therefore the effective buckling length of the column is shorter than its height. In this chapter, simple closed form formulae are presented to estimate both the effective buckling length and the buckling temperature of an incorporated heated column. Finally, comparisons are made between the numerically solved buckling temperatures of incorporated columns and the corresponding theoretical predictions, and the accuracy and the applicability of the formula are discussed in detail. From the investigated results, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The rotationally restraining effect of the connecting members has an effect on the column’s buckling temperature. However, the thermal expansion of the beam does not have a direct affect on the buckling temperature. ･ The exterior column is not axially restrained by the adjacent members during the fire. The lower end of the heated column is rotationally restrained by the unheated connecting members, so its boundary condition can be assumed to be fixed end. On the other hand, for {{the upper end of the}} heated column’s case, the rotationally restraining effect of the upper-story unheated column can be neglected due to the thermal expansion of the beam. The buckling temperature of the exterior column can be assumed to be the theoretical buckling temperature when the effective length is determined from the proposed equation. ･ The interior column is strongly rotationally restrained by the adjacent members, so its effective length is equal to 0. 5 h. However, it is also axially restrained by the adjacent members. As a result it buckles at a temperature that is lower than the estimated buckling temperature. In this case, when considering the buckling temperature, the thermal effect should be included. An incorporated column is not only restrained rotationally as discussed in the previous chapter but, if it is heated, it is also restrained axially by the surrounding members. Chapter 4 clarifies the latter problems specifically. The axial restraint of the surrounding members plays two contrary roles on the stability action of the frame. Firstly, it adds axial compressive force to the incorporated column and so increased compressive force lowers the column’s buckling temperature. On the contrary, once the column buckles, the surrounding members turn to work so as to redistribute a part of the axial compressive force carried by the bucked column to other sound columns, which is therefore helps to strengthen the overall stability and to raise the ultimate temperature of the frame. This is called herein stress redistribution effect of the surrounding members. In this chapter, the lowering of the column’s buckling temperature and the raise of the frame’s ultimate temperature, which are both brought by the effects of the surrounding members, are formulated respectively in theoretical closed forms. Finally the numerical analysis, which are developed in Chapter 2, are conducted extensively to obtain the realistic column’s buckling and the frame’s ultimate temperatures of a lot of practical steel frames, which are used to verify the accuracy and the applicability of the above derived formulae. In this chapter, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The effects of the axially restraining members have two mechanical roles. The first role is to restrain an expanded heated column. As a result of this action, the thermal compressive force is added to the heated column. This causes a drop in buckling temperature of heated columns. On the contrary, the second role is to redistribute a part of the compressive force of the buckled column to other sound columns. As a result of this action, the structure can retain its stability after the column buckles. It causes a rise of the ultimate temperature of a frame. However, if the second stress redistribution ability is not enough, it falls into instability immediately after the heated column buckles. The ultimate temperature for this frame is lower than the theoretical buckling temperature, since the buckling is affected by the first thermal effect. ･ Based on the above observation, it is found that a higher ultimate temperature of a frame is obtained if it has higher stress redistribution capacity. A way to improve the fire-resistance capacity of a frame is to install a suitably proportioned hat truss. A <b>hatted</b> <b>frame</b> is found to have definitely an improved redundancy. ･ Closed form formulae to predict both the buckling temperature of a heated column and the beam plastified temperature of a frame is presented herein. Conducting the numerical fire response analysis, the predicted temperatures are found to be in good agreement with the numerical results for various structural and heating conditions. The prediction to estimate the improved ultimate temperature of <b>hatted</b> <b>frames</b> is also proposed herein. In chapter 5, the conclusion of this thesis is drawn: ･ The “snap-through” phenomenon is the main unstable condition of steel structures subjected to fire. This snap-through easily occurs in the structure when the post-buckling residual force is low and the stiffness and the strength of the restraining members in the structure are low. ･ The column’s buckling temperature can be estimated by the theoretical buckling temperature when the effective length is determined from the proposed equation. The exterior column’s effective length ratio can be calculated from the proposed equation while the interior column’s effective length ratio is 0. 5. ･ In the case that the stress redistribution ability is not enough to retain the stability of the steel frame, the structure falls into the instability state and failure at the buckling temperature under thermal effect. It means the ultimate temperature of that structure is lower than the theoretical buckling temperature. However, in the case that the stress redistribution ability is high, a part of the compressive force of the buckled column is redistributed to other sound columns. As a result the structure can retain its stability after the column buckles. ･ The ultimate temperature can be determined by the higher temperature among the bucking temperature under thermal effect and the beam plastified temperature. ･ A way to improve the fire-resistance capacity of a steel frame is to increase the redundancy of the axial force to the steel frame.
