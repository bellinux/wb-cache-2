5|$|Adi Da {{initially}} {{became known}} in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s for his books and public talks, and for the activities of his religious community. His philosophy was essentially similar to many eastern religions which see spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate priority of human life. Distinguishing his from other religious traditions, Adi Da declared {{that he was a}} uniquely historic avatar (incarnation of a god or divinity in human form). As such, Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else,</b> even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{provision}} for review or appeal of a grant of a warrant application, only of a denial. That is because in both the FISC and the FISCA, the government - the party who seeks a warrant to conduct surveillance - is the only party before the court, and it is unusual <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> {{to become aware of}} the warrant application in the first place.|$|E

25|$|At New Year's Revolution, Duggan {{teamed with}} Super Crazy in a tag team turmoil match to {{determine}} the number one contenders to the World Tag Team Championship, in a losing effort. On the January 15 edition of Raw, Duggan was dragged out by Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton) and was beaten to a pulp. Edge and Orton feared Duggan would help out Shawn Michaels in a handicap match and wanted to set an example <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> backstage that wished to do the same. On the March 5 edition of Raw, he faced Chris Masters in a Masterlock Challenge, but was unable to break the hold.|$|E
25|$|Also {{writing in}} 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered {{an entirely new}} view of the play's love story lines. He argued that what passes for love in this play is {{actually}} a self-destructive expression of passion. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a sadomasochistic type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At {{the same time it}} protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own egotism protects him from feeling passion <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{seeing the}} {{multitude}} that had gathered, however, Yahya ordered his troops to surround {{the crowd and}} blockade the streets and alleys to prevent anyone from escaping. An offer was given for any Muhallabids to enter the palace, after which the gates to the building were shut. A signal was then given for the Zanj to slaughter the crowd, and nearly everyone who had assembled was killed. After the massacre was complete, the Zanj spent the morning and afternoon searching <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> they could find; anyone who was rich was tortured in order to extract their possessions and then put to death, while the poor were killed immediately. At the same time, the mosque and city port were burned down on the orders of 'Ali ibn Aban, resulting in further casualties {{and the destruction of}} goods, merchandise and livestock.|$|E

25|$|Public-key {{cryptography}} {{can also}} be used for implementing digital signature schemes. A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary signature; they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce, but difficult <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> to forge. Digital signatures {{can also be}} permanently tied to the content of the message being signed; they cannot then be 'moved' from one document to another, for any attempt will be detectable. In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms: one for signing, in which a secret key is used to process the message (or a hash of the message, or both), and one for verification, in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature. RSA and DSA are two of the most popular digital signature schemes. Digital signatures are central to the operation of public key infrastructures and many network security schemes (e.g., SSL/TLS, many VPNs, etc.).|$|E
25|$|According to {{classical}} rabbinical literature, {{in order for}} the Urim and Thummim to give an answer, it was first necessary for the individual to stand facing the fully dressed high priest, and vocalise the question briefly and in a simple way, though it was not necessary for it to be loud enough <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> to hear it. The Talmudic rabbis argued that Urim and Thummim were words written on the sacred breastplate. Most of the Talmudic rabbis, and Josephus, following the belief that Urim meant lights, argued that divination by Urim and Thummim involved questions being answered by great rays of light shining out of certain jewels on the breastplate; each jewel was taken to represent different letters, and the sequence of lighting thus would spell out an answer (though there were 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and only 12 jewels on the breastplate); two Talmudic rabbis, however, argued that the jewels themselves moved {{in a way that made}} them stand out from the rest, or even moved themselves into groups to form words.|$|E
500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

500|$|Christian Bale as Alfred Borden (The Professor)/Fallon, {{a working}} class magician. Christian Bale {{expressed}} interest in playing the part and was cast after Jackman. Although Nolan had previously cast Bale as Batman in Batman Begins, he did not consider Bale for the part of Borden until Bale contacted him about the script. Nolan said that Bale was [...] "exactly right" [...] for the part of Borden {{and that it was}} [...] "unthinkable" [...] <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> to play the part. Nolan described Bale as an actor [...] "terrific to work with" [...] who [...] "takes what he does very, very seriously".

500|$|In August 1987 Tennstedt, taken ill at a rehearsal, felt so unequal to {{continuing}} in his post that he resigned on the spot. He continued to appear with the LPO as a guest, {{with the title}} of [...] "conductor laureate"; in 1989 Richard Morrison of The Times wrote that the LPO still played better for Tennstedt than <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> Tennstedt's resignation was a severe blow to the orchestra, {{and there was no}} obvious successor: Morrison observed that the best-known conductors – Barenboim, Riccardo Muti and Simon Rattle – with whom the orchestra was then associated were committed to other projects until the 1990s, and that possible contenders such as Semyon Bychkov and Franz Welser-Möst were largely unknown in London. No successor was appointed until 1990, when Welser-Möst was named as the new principal conductor. His tenure was controversial; he received the nickname [...] "Frankly Worse than Most" [...] and many harshly critical reviews. He brought with him a recording contract with EMI, but management turnover, financial stresses, and political disputes at the Southbank Centre at the time contributed to the difficulty of the working atmosphere in the orchestra. There were complaints that the orchestra's high standards of playing were not consistently maintained.|$|E

500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. She remembered that a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me {{her father was}} dead. The only thing that was true was she nicked stuff from the shop", which Guy said was worth £20,000. She admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped, and when Guy reported the theft, she was put on probation.|$|E

50|$|Judaism {{does not}} believe that God {{requires}} the sacrifice of any human. This is emphasized in Jewish traditions concerning the story of the Akedah, the binding of Isaac. In the Jewish explanation, this is a story in the Torah whereby God wanted to test Abraham's faith and willingness, and Isaac {{was never going to be}} actually sacrificed. Thus, Judaism rejects the notion that anyone can or should die <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else's</b> sin. Judaism is more focused on the practicalities of understanding how one may live a sacred life in the world according to God's will, rather than a hope of a future one. Judaism {{does not believe}} in the Christian concept of hell but does have a punishment stage in the afterlife (i.e. Gehenna, the New Testament word translated as hell) as well as a Heaven (Gan Eden), but the religion does not intend it as a focus.|$|R
