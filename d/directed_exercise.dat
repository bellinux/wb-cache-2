As people age in industrialized societies, there is a concomitant loss of muscle strength. This loss of strength is often thought to be a direct result of the aging process. There is a direct association between the loss of strength and loss of cross-sectional area of muscle. Thus, decreased strength seems to be the result of atrophy and not some inherent change in the function of the muscles themselves. There are morphological changes to skeletal muscle that are also associated with aging. Specifically, there is a shift in muscle fiber types from type II to type I fibers. Thus, endurance increases and power decreases. There seems to be a morphological shift from random distribution of both fiber types toward a tendency for type II fibers to localize to the boundaries of muscle fascicles and for type I fibers to localize more centrally in the fascicle. These changes in muscle fibers may be the result of age-related decrease in number of motor neurons. Studies have investigated the effectiveness of self-directed and investigator- <b>directed</b> <b>exercise</b> programs in preventing and reversing the age-related loss of muscle strength. These studies have shown that the ability of the elderly to increase muscle strength is comparable with that of young people. Few studies have looked at preventing morphological changes, but these studies have found that exercise prevents the changes thought to be the result of aging. It is concluded that most of the changes seen in the muscles of the elderly are the result of lifestyle and are not direct effects of the aging process. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{efficacy}} of polestriding exercise (walking with modified ski poles with a movement pattern similar to cross-country skiing) to increase exercise tolerance {{of persons with}} intermittent claudication pain caused by peripheral arterial disease was tested in this 24 -week prospective randomized clinical trial. Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} a Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital with 52 individuals who gave written informed consent and were randomized into either a polestriding exercise (n = 27; age, 65. 5 ± 7. 0 years; ankle brachial index, 0. 64 ± 0. 25) or nonexercise control (n = 25; age, 68. 6 ± 8. 9 years; ankle brachial index, 0. 69 ± 0. 14) group (P >. 05 for all comparisons). The polestriding exercise program consisted of supervised training three times per week for 4 weeks, two times per week for 8 weeks, one time per week for 4 weeks, biweekly for 4 weeks and unsupervised training for 4 weeks. Starting in week 5, subjects took their poles home with instructions to repeat the most recent supervised training walk at an appropriate and convenient location near their residence. This was referred to as unsupervised but <b>directed</b> <b>exercise.</b> Subjects were provided with a personal log book for documenting unsupervised exercise sessions. With both supervised and unsupervised exercise, subjects were expected to complete a total of four 30 -minute to 45 -minute polestriding exercise sessions per week. The main outcome measures were exercise duration on symptom-limited incremental treadmill test, Walking Impairment Questionnaire, rating of perceived leg pain at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks, and constant work-rate treadmill exercise tests at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Results: Polestriding significantly (P <. 001) improved exercise tolerance on the constant work-rate and incremental treadmill tests. Ratings of perceived claudication pain were significantly less after the polestriding training program. Subject perceived distance and walking speed scores on the Walking Impairment Questionnaire improved in the polestriding trained group only (P <. 001 and. 022, respectively). Conclusion: This randomized clinical trial provides empirical evidence that 24 weeks of polestriding training significantly improves quantitative and qualitative measures of the exercise tolerance of persons limited by intermittent claudication pain.

40|$|Costs and {{effectiveness}} of pre- and postoperative home physiotherapy for total knee replacement: a randomised controlled trial. Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common effective intervention for knee osteoarthritis (OA) with potential to further improve patient outcomes. There {{is a lack of}} evidence assessing physiotherapy within the TKR care pathway; previous studies lack statistical power and measures of health related quality of life (HRQoL). Pre- and postoperative home physiotherapy rehabilitation for TKR has not previously been evaluated as an alternative to NHS hospital outpatient rehabilitation. Objective To assess the costs {{and effectiveness}} of pre- and postoperative physiotherapy at home for unilateral total knee replacement (TKR). Design This was a pragmatic RCT comparing patient reported HRQoL, and NHS costs of home physiotherapy pre- and postoperatively for TKR with usual hospital outpatient postoperative physiotherapy. Setting 160 Sheffield knee OA patients awaiting TKR, randomly allocated to an intervention (home care) group (n= 80) or a control (usual care) group (n= 80). Intervention Individual home physiotherapy assessment and treatment; 3 sessions preoperatively, continuing for maximum 6 sessions postoperatively, supplemented by advice on self- <b>directed</b> <b>exercise</b> routines. Usual Care 8 to 10 knee classes postoperatively; average 10 patients with 2 physiotherapists and one assistant, individual treatments for up to 15 minutes and an exercise circuit in the outpatient gym, supplemented by advice on self-directed exercise routines. Outcome Measures (OCM) Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) and Short Form 36 health survey (SF- 36) questionnaires measured at trial entry and 12 weeks post TKR. Primary OCM; WOMAC pain dimension scores. A patient satisfaction questionnaire was used and NHS resource use also assessed. Results 116 participants completed follow up, well matched by group with a 98 % questionnaire response rate. 45 (28. 1 %) participants withdrew, 24 (15 %) due to TKR cancellation, 2 patients died. There {{was no significant difference in}} primary OCM post TKR between groups (p = 0. 53) or in any other dimension of the WOMAC or SF- 36. Participants were equally satisfied with physiotherapy in both groups (86 %). The home group had a significantly greater mean number of physiotherapy sessions (8. 7 sessions vs 3. 5 sessions, p= 0. 001). Home physiotherapy for TKR was significantly more expensive per patient than hospital outpatient physiotherapy (£ 197. 9 vs £ 61. 5, mean difference = -£ 136. 5; p= 0. 001) The hospital group had additional transport costs, (mean £ 38. 7). There was no significant difference in consumption of other NHS services or in total NHS costs per patient between groups; £ 5, 376 (intervention group) vs £ 5, 372 (control group). Conclusions This study demonstrated the effectiveness of home physiotherapy for TKR, but home care was more intensive and expensive than usual hospital care; additional preoperative home physiotherapy did not improve patient outcomes. The cancellation rate for TKR was high and supports the need for clearer selection criteria with greater consideration of co-morbidity and willingness to undergo surgery. Investigation of whether a less intensive individualised physiotherapy intervention at home would deliver expected patient group outcomes and individual rehabilitation goals is important if a more cost- effective home physiotherapy programme were to be provided for TKR patients...|$|E

METHODS: 101 adolescent swimmers were investigated with mannitol provocation and sport specific exercise challenge test. Mannitol positivity was defined as either direct FEV(1) PD 15 (ordinary criteria) or as β(2) -reversibility ≥ 15 % after challenge (extended criteria). A <b>direct</b> positive <b>exercise</b> test was defined as a drop in FEV(1) of 10 % (ordinary criteria) or a difference in FEV of ≥ 15 % either spontaneous, variability, or with β 2 -agonist, reversibility (extended criteria).

Twenty-six swimmers were mannitol direct positive and 14 were <b>direct</b> <b>exercise</b> positive using ordinary criteria. Using extended criteria 43 were mannitol positive and 24 were exercise positive. When including reversibility and variability to define a positive test the sensitivity for current asthma with or without exercise induced symptoms increased while the specificity remained roughly unchanged.
