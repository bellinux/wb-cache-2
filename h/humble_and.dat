5|$|The {{attitude}} of Suetonius toward Germanicus' personality and moral temperament {{is that of}} adoration. He dedicates {{a good portion of}} his Life of Caligula to Germanicus, claiming Germanicus' physical and moral excellence surpassed that of his contemporaries. Suetonius also says that Germanicus was a gifted writer, and that despite all these talents, he remained <b>humble</b> <b>and</b> kind.|$|E

5|$|Nri people {{believed}} that the sun was the dwelling place of Anyanwu (Light) and Agbala (Fertility). Agbala was the collective spirit of all holy beings (human and nonhuman). Agbala was the perfect agent of Chukwu or Chineke (the Creator God) and chose its human and nonhuman agents only by their merit; it knew no politics. It transcended religion, culture and gender, and worked with the <b>humble</b> <b>and</b> the truthful. They believed Anyanwu, The Light, to be the symbol of human perfection that all must seek and Agbala was entrusted to lead man there.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are <b>humble</b> <b>and</b> lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E
5|$|Since our blessed Lord, {{instead of}} a rich and honourable station in this world, was pleased to choose his lot among men of the lower condition; let not those, on whom the bounty of Providence hath {{bestowed}} wealth and honours, despise the men who are placed in a <b>humble</b> <b>and</b> inferior station; but rather, with their utmost power, by their countenance, by their protection, by just payment of their honest labour, encourage their daily endeavours {{for the support of}} themselves and their families. On the other hand, let the poor labour to provide things honest in the sight of all men; and so, with diligence in their several employments, live soberly, righteously, and godlily in this present world, that they may obtain that glorious reward promised in the Gospel to the poor, I mean the kingdom of Heaven.|$|E

5|$|Barry is {{described}} as the most famous St. Bernard by the Natural History Museum of Bern. Following his death, his skin was preserved by a taxidermist for the museum, {{while the rest of}} his body was buried. He was originally given a <b>humble</b> <b>and</b> meek pose, as the taxidermist felt that this would serve as a reminder of servitude to future generations. In 1923, his body was refurbished by Georg Ruprecht, as his coat had become brittle and had broken into more than 20 pieces. During the restoration, his body was re-posed and his skull shape was modified to match the shape of the St. Bernard of that time, in a compromise between Ruprecht and the Museum's director. His original head shape was rather flat with a moderate stop, with the modification resulting in a larger head with a more pronounced stop. A barrel was added hanging from his collar, following the popularization of the myth of the monastery's dogs using these during the rescues, which was originally introduced by Edwin Landseer's work Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller. The barrel was removed in 1978 by Professor Walter Huber, the director of the museum, although it has since been replaced. A monument to Barry is located opposite the entrance to the Cimetière des Chiens in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next faced San Francisco at home, winning 37–14 {{before one}} of the biggest crowds of the season. Chet Adams opened the scoring for the Browns with a 44-yard field goal; he and Lou Saban shared kicking duties in the game after Groza pulled his leg muscle during pre-game warmups. On the ensuing possession, Albert had the ball {{stripped}} by Cleveland's Weldon <b>Humble,</b> <b>and</b> the Browns took over and scored their first touchdown on a Graham pass to Lavelli. San Francisco scored a touchdown near the beginning of the second quarter, but Cleveland dominated the scoring thereafter. Lavelli caught seven passes for a total of three touchdowns, setting an AAFC single-game record. Graham also rushed for a one-yard touchdown and threw for 222 yards. His touchdown passes made him the league leader in that category, with 18 on the season. It was the biggest margin of victory the Browns had ever recorded against the 49ers. Cleveland was helped by an adjustment Paul Brown made in his receivers' routes; the coach had Lavelli and Speedie run toward {{the middle of the field}} instead of trying to get open near the sidelines, as they had done in past games. The victory clinched the AAFC's western division for the Browns and assured the team a spot in the championship game.|$|E
5|$|Other scriptures {{describe}} other {{visits by}} Shiva to Deodar Forest in his Bhikshatana form. The Vamana Purana mentions Shiva entering the Deodar Forest twice as a beggar. Maddened {{by the death}} of his first wife Sati but chased by the love-god Kamadeva, Shiva escapes to the Deodar Forest and lives as a mendicant. The sages' wives who come to grant him food become sexually excited at the mere sight of him. The sages curse his Linga to fall off and it becomes the infinite pillar. Brahma and Vishnu propitiate him and Shiva reabsorbs the Linga into his body. In another instance, while passing the Deodar Forest, Parvati notices sages who worship Shiva and have emaciated their bodies with fasts and severe vows. Parvati requests Shiva to save them from further pain, but Shiva declares that the sages are simply foolish and have not restrained their passion and anger. He enters the forest as a handsome man, wearing only a garland of sylvan flowers. He entices the sages' wives, who give him alms. As before, the Linga of the cursed Shiva falls off, but eventually the sages realise their folly and worship the Linga. Similar accounts of Bhikshatana-Shiva's visit to the Deodar Forest to <b>humble</b> <b>and</b> enlighten the false sages, Bhikshatana-Shiva's emasculation and establishment of Linga worship also appear in the Mahabharata, the Shiva Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana.|$|E

25|$|A {{reporter}} who attended {{an event in}} Boston in August 1973 which drew 9,000 attendees wrote that Rawat appeared <b>humble</b> <b>and</b> human, and seemed to intentionally undercut the claims of divinity made by followers. Sociologist James Downton said that from his beginnings Rawat appealed to his followers to give up concepts and beliefs that might impede them from fully experiencing the Knowledge (or life force), but this did not prevent them from adopting a fairly rigid set of ideas about his divinity, and to project millennial preconceptions onto him and the movement.|$|E
