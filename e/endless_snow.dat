50|$|Red Lobster {{has offered}} an <b>endless</b> <b>snow</b> crab leg {{promotion}} twice in its history. However, in 2003, the promotion resulted in parent company Darden Restaurants taking a $3 million charge to third-quarter earnings, resulting in president Edna Morris' {{departure from the}} company. The ill-timed promotion was launched amid high wholesale crab leg prices. The chain also underestimated how many times a customer would order more. Further complicating matters at the restaurant level was {{the amount of time}} a customer spent table-side in the restaurant cracking crab legs. This resulted in increased wait times in the lobby and overall diminished customer capacity per hour.|$|E
50|$|Amundsen spurned the {{traditional}} white tent, and instead dyed his tent material black. He stated {{that this was}} to serve three purposes: First, black would absorb what little solar radiation would fall upon the tent. Second, a black tent would provide the best possible contrast against the <b>endless</b> <b>snow</b> and ice if one became lost. And finally, the black provided a rest for the eyes. In addition, the square, pyramid-style tent was equipped with a single central pole that was lashed {{to one of the}} sledges in its full length during travel, avoiding the need to assemble tent-poles and making the job of pitching the tent very simple and quick. The tent also featured a sewn-in floor, which was an innovation several years ahead of its time.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{considerable}} period of time, Ferbert {{was out of}} contact in the Klondike, but he emerged on the Seward Peninsula. [...] An article published in 1909 after his return reported that Ferbert had struck it rich. [...] The article stated: [...] "Eight years ago, with the determination to come back rich or not at all, 'Dutch' Ferbert, old Michigan coach {{and one of the}} most famous football players, left Cleveland for the Klondike. [...] For eight years he has toiled over <b>endless</b> <b>snows,</b> fought fierce hardships, endured everything in his battle to win his wordto come back home a rich man. [...] And now he has made a strike and is coming back to civilization. [...] He sailed from Nome and is rushing homeward with $1,000,000 as his reward." ...|$|R
60|$|It worried {{him that}} postscript. He {{could not make}} out for a long time why it worried him. Suddenly, in a waste of <b>endless</b> <b>snows,</b> the {{explanation}} flashed across him. Sylvia of the letters was a living woman! She could travel--with a box, he supposed, possibly with two or three, and parcels. Could take tickets, walk up a gangway, stagger about a deck feeling, maybe, a little seasick. All these years he had been living with her in dreamland she had been, if he had only known it, a Miss Somebody-or-other, who must have stood every morning in front of a looking-glass with hairpins in her mouth. He had never thought of her doing these things; it shocked him. He could not help feeling it was indelicate of her--coming to life in this sudden, uncalled-for manner.|$|R

50|$|In 2006, {{together}} {{with support from}} the Uruguayan government and military, Batuz goes to Antarctica and realizes, with scientists from different nationalities posted throughout the continent {{together with}} members of the military, his project ‘no mas fronteras en la Antartida’. Along the <b>endless</b> background of <b>snow</b> and ice, aerial documentation is taken of the participants forming a line that reenacts the image of his painting held {{in the collection of the}} Guggenheim museum.|$|R
6000|$|Mechanically they {{swept the}} ice and snow with their eyes. It was a {{homogeneous}} scene, devoid of contrasts or bold contours, dreary, desolate, and monotonous,--the ice-packed sea, the slow slope of the beach, the background of low-lying hills, and over all thrown the <b>endless</b> mantle of <b>snow.</b> [...] "No trees, no bluffs, no cabins, no telegraph poles, nothin'," [...] moaned Red Bill; [...] "nothin' respectable enough nor big enough to swing the toes of a five-foot man clear o' the ground. I give it up." [...] He looked yearningly at that portion of Jan's anatomy which joins the head and shoulders. [...] "Give it up," [...] he repeated sadly to Lawson. [...] "Throw the rope down. Gawd never intended this here country for livin' purposes, an' that's a cold frozen fact." ...|$|R
60|$|But on its {{northern}} side Canada is set fast against the frozen seas of the Pole and the desolate region of barren rock and ice-bound island that is joined to the polar ocean {{by a common}} mantle of snow. For {{hundreds and hundreds of}} miles the vast fortress of ice rears its battlements of shining glaciers. The unending sunshine of the Arctic summer falls upon untrodden snow. The cold light of the {2} aurora illumines in winter an endless desolation. There is no sound, save when at times the melting water falls from the glistening sides of some vast pinnacle of ice, or when the leaden sea forces its tide between the rock-bound islands. Here in this vast territory civilization has no part and man no place. Life struggles northward only to die out in the Arctic cold. The green woods of the lake district and the blossoms of the prairies are left behind. The fertility of the Great West gives place to the rock-strewn wilderness of the barren grounds. A stunted and deformed vegetation fights its way to the Arctic Circle. Rude grasses and thin moss cling desperately to the naked rock. Animal life pushes even farther. The seas of the frozen ocean still afford a sustenance. Even mankind is found eking out a savage livelihood on the shores of the northern sea. But gradually all fades, until nothing is left but the <b>endless</b> plain of <b>snow,</b> stretching towards the Pole.|$|R
