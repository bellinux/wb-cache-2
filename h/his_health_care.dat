On the issue of taxes, Bradley trumpeted his sponsorship of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which had significantly cut tax rates while abolishing dozens of loopholes.

2500|$|On April 29, 2008, McCain {{detailed}} <b>his</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> plan in {{the context}} of his campaign for president. His plan focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. At the heart of his plan are tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or {{do not have access to}} health care through their employer. He says the money could be used to purchase insurance and force insurance companies to be competitive with their costs in order to attract consumers. To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain would work with states to create what he calls a [...] "Guaranteed Access Plan". He did not provide details, but pointed to states such as Florida and North Carolina where such systems are in place. <b>His</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> plan has an estimated annual cost of $7 billion, according to McCain's health-policy experts.

40|$|Although <b>health</b> {{information}} systems (<b>HIS)</b> hold {{the promise of}} improving patient safety, healthcare quality and efficiency, {{how do we know}} whether a particular HIS introduced into a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> organization meets the above expectations? Without evaluating the processes and outcomes of HIS introduction, it is impossible to validate whether the system's promised outcomes have been achieved. Therefore, an important area of health informatics research is to evaluate the processes and outcomes of introducing <b>HIS</b> in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> organizations. A lack of unified methods and approaches for evaluating HIS has been a long-standing challenge for health informatics researchers. To draw the attention of health informatics researchers in China to the importance of systematic, rigorous evaluation for the successful introduction of <b>HIS</b> into <b>health</b> <b>care</b> organizations, this paper discusses various methods and approaches to evaluating HIS and suggests a holistic, multi-method approach to HIS evaluation. ...|$|R
