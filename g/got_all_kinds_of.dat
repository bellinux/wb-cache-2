5000|$|Dalle married Tim Armstrong, {{frontman}} of Rancid, in 1997 {{when she}} was 18; however, the two had met and {{were said to have}} been dating prior to that. Armstrong detailed their relationship in songs such as [...] "Who Would've Thought" [...] and [...] "Corazón de Oro" [...] from Rancid's 1998 album, Life Won't Wait. The couple went through a bitter divorce in 2003 after Armstrong spotted Dalle making out with Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme in Rolling Stone magazine. Rancid's 2003 album Indestructible featured songs ("Fall Back Down", [...] "Ghost Band", [...] "Tropical London") that dealt with the divorce and Armstrong's feelings towards it. Their divorce also led to a back and forth feud between Armstrong and Homme. Homme claims he received multiple death threats from Armstrong to stay away from Dalle. [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> threats. They were saying, 'We're gonna kill you.' And I was saying, 'I'm six-foot-five and I have red hair and I'm not hiding. Go ahead.'

There was Tim saying anything he could say and pretty much now it's established that fake English accent-singing f**king copycat motherf**ker is full of s**t. Don't be mad, just be gone."Dalle claims Armstrong was very controlling of her and it took her three years to leave him. When she did she said Armstrong and his friends had her blacklisted from the music scene which forced the break-up The Distillers. Armstrong denies these comments and claims that she had used him to come to the United States and his status in the music business to help her form a band and get noticed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{novel and}} its main {{character}} are particularly notable for the breadth of time and history and stories they recall. In addition to the plethora of fictional characters who populate Jane's narrative, Jane and others make many references to historical events and figures over the close-to-a hundred years Miss Jane can recall. In addition to its obvious opening in the American Civil War, Jane alludes to the Spanish-American War and her narrative spans across both World Wars {{and the beginning of}} the Vietnam War. Jane and other characters also mention Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Jackie Robinson, Fred Shuttlesworth, Rosa Parks, and others. Corporal Brown's voice give these historical meditations a kind of [...] "setting the record straight" [...] mood to the storytelling presented in this novel. For instance, an entire section is dedicated to Huey P. Long in which Miss Jane explains [...] "Oh, they <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> stories about her now .... When I hear them talk like that I think, 'Ha. You ought to been here twenty-five, thirty years ago. You ought to been here when poor people had nothing.'" [...] Because of the historical content, some readers thought the book was non-fiction. Gaines commented: Some people have asked me whether or not The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman is fiction or nonfiction. It is fiction. When Dial Press first sent it out, they did not put [...] "a novel" [...] on the galleys or on the dustjacket, so a lot of people had the feeling that it could have been real. ... I did a lot of research in books to give some facts to what Miss Jane could talk about, but these are my creations. I read quite a few interviews performed with former slaves by the WPA during the thirties and I got their rhythm and how they said certain things. But I never interviewed anybody.|$|E
5000|$|A post-World War II feel-good movie, It Happened in Brooklyn {{begins in}} England {{at the end}} of the war. Danny Miller (Frank Sinatra) is with a group of GIs {{awaiting}} transportation home to the US. On his last night there, he meets Jamie Shellgrove (Peter Lawford), who is a very shy young man whose grandfather feels should be taken under someone's wing. After observing Miller come to his grandson's aid at the piano, he asks Danny to speak with his son, to give him [...] "some words of encouragement". In order to look good in front of the Brooklyn-born nurse (Gloria Grahame) who scolded him for not making friends, he agrees, even going so far as to saying what would really fix Jamie up would be for him to come to Brooklyn. As he rushes out to catch his transport to the docks for the voyage home, Danny discovers that Jamie is really the heir to a duke. Upon Danny's return to Brooklyn, the film revolves around characters realizing their dreams of escaping working-class drudgery: in Sinatra's case to become a singer/musician rather than a shipping clerk, in Lawford's case to break out of his extreme shyness to gain a wife and a career as a songwriter, and in Grayson's case to break out of her schoolteaching job to star in the opera (although this last is not shown coming to pass, but she presumably lives happily ever after as she is brought to England as the fiancée of the Lawford character, who is heir to a dukedom). The story ends with Danny realizing the nurse he talked to at the start of the film is the only girl for him, and since he figures she's got to be back in Brooklyn herself, and he's <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> friends now, he's optimistic about finding and winning her. The film's tagline was [...] "Happy songs! Happy stars! Happy romance!". Lawford dances while singing a song, a performance that was particularly well received by both critics and public, outshining future fellow Rat Pack member Sinatra. One highlight of the film is seeing and hearing Sinatra and Grayson singing [...] "Là ci darem la mano" [...] from Mozart's 1787 opera Don Giovanni.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays discussions {{regarding}} corporates {{social responsibility}} and related principals just like human rights, {{health and environmental}} restrictions, ethical business conducts, labour policies (including child labour abuses), anti bribery and corruption, the rule of law, transperency, free markets etc. has been speeded up towards. The main question is whether there is 'an implied contract' or just 'a deal' between society and corporates. Whether corporates revealed {{that they are the}} ones that could not continue to exploit society's intellectual capital and natural resources in order to produce good and services for their owners and shareholders' profit unless they satisfy society's needs for better standarts of life. No doubt that variety of further elaborations has been realized and will be realized by the public intensely throughout the sad events including environmental pollution of petrolium companies, child labour abuses of variety of western companies or allegation of corruption among governmental officers for the sake of their own good which have been on media over and over. As far as corporates point of view analysed, it has been acknowledged that certain steps were being taken in order to satisfy the needs list of society which is getting longer and longer everyday. In order to keep up with that needs lists, corporates are striving to change the strategy and forcing society to higher the principals and standards of life for better society. Bettering the standards of society necesitate enhancing of conditions within the corporates first. Corporates are striving to reach the new mission of changing culture which is affecting their intellectual capital and work force within the corporates who are constituting the society, towards complying to new principals: human rights, health and environmental restrictions, ethical business conducts, labour policies (including child labour abuses), anti-bribery and coruption, the rule of law, transperency, free markets. That would suppose to have certain impacts towards society's standarts to be enhanced. Of course, some experts are still arguing about that this will be the manouver of corporates will have silincing affect on the nationalistic powers within the emerging socities, who are claiming that multinational companies are forcing their national governments for exploiting their national resources for the profit maximisation in exchange of nothing for their citizens benefit. Even in Turkey, a country which has preferred financial liberilazition since 1989 and <b>got</b> rid <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> barriers in front of foreign direct and portfolio investments, that discussion has been erupted drastically.

To {{study the}} stress {{condition}} {{at the junction}} of the spherical shell with opening nozzle, using the finite element analysis, a finite element model is built {{in view of the}} same spherical shell joining a flatting nozzle and inside-stretching nozzles with different inner lengths differently. The maximum stress and stress distribution are <b>got.</b> <b>All</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> stresses are obtained by the total stress which is carried on linear processing. The result shows the inside-stretching nozzle can reduce the maximum stress in comparison with the flatting nozzle, mainly reducing the local membrane stress, but not the peak stress. The maximum stress falls with increasing the inner length of the nozzle to some extent, and beyond the extent, the maximum stress tends to reach a stable value basically without changing the inner length. The stress variation can effectively provide a reference for improving the strength of the spherical shell...|$|E
