50|$|High energy {{biscuits}} (HEB) are wheat biscuits containing high-protein cereals {{and vegetable}} fat.

50|$|While {{capacitors}} {{tend not}} to be as temperature sensitive as batteries, they are significantly capacity constrained and without the strength of chemical bonds suffer from self-discharge. Power-to-weight ratio of capacitors is usually higher than batteries because charge transport units within the cell are smaller (electrons rather than ions), however <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> is conversely usually lower.|$|E
50|$|The {{lead-acid}} battery {{was invented in}} 1859 by French physicist Gaston Planté and is the oldest type of rechargeable battery. Despite having a very low <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and a low energy-to-volume ratio, its ability to supply high surge currents means that the cells have a relatively large power-to-weight ratio. These features, along with their low cost, makes it attractive for use in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by automobile starter motors.|$|E
50|$|Battery {{discharge}} profiles {{are often}} {{described in terms}} of a factor of battery capacity. For example, a battery with a nominal capacity quoted in ampere-hours (Ah) at a C/10 rated discharge current (derived in amperes) may safely provide a higher discharge current - and therefore higher power-to-weight ratio - but only with a lower energy capacity. Power-to-weight ratio for batteries is therefore less meaningful without reference to corresponding <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and cell temperature. This relationship is known as Peukert's law.|$|E

5000|$|A {{pilot in}} combat {{attempts}} to conserve his aircraft’s energy through carefully timed and executed manoeuvres. By using such manoeuvres, a pilot will often make trade offs between the fighter’s potential energy (altitude), and kinetic energy (airspeed), {{to maintain the}} <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of the aircraft, or the [...] "specific energy". A manoeuvre such as the [...] "low yo-yo" [...] trades altitude for airspeed to gain closure on an enemy, and to decrease turn radius. The opposite manoeuvre, a [...] "high yo-yo", trades speed for height, literally storing energy in [...] "the altitude bank", which allows a fast moving attacker to slow his closing speed.|$|E

50|$|Basic fighter {{maneuvers}} (BFM) are tactical movements {{performed by}} fighter aircraft during air combat maneuvering (also called ACM, or dogfighting), {{in order to}} gain a positional advantage over the opponent. BFM combines the fundamentals of aerodynamic flight and the geometry of pursuit with the physics of managing the aircraft's <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> called its specific energy. Maneuvers are used to gain a better angular position in relation to the opponent. They can be offensive, to help an attacker get behind an enemy, or defensive, to help the defender evade an attacker's air-to-air weapons. They can also be neutral, where both opponents strive for an offensive position, or disengagement maneuvers, to help facilitate an escape. Awareness is often taught as the best tactical defense, removing the possibility of an attacker getting or remaining behind the pilot; even with speed a fighter is open to attack from the rear.|$|E
50|$|Electric-vehicle {{batteries}} {{differ from}} starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) batteries {{because they are}} designed to give power over sustained periods of time. Deep-cycle batteries are used instead of SLI batteries for these applications. Traction batteries must be designed with a high ampere-hour capacity. Batteries for electric vehicles are characterized by their relatively high power-to-weight ratio, <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and energy density; smaller, lighter batteries reduce the weight of the vehicle and improve its performance. Compared to liquid fuels, most current battery technologies have much lower specific energy, and this often impacts the maximal all-electric range of the vehicles. However, metal-air batteries have high specific energy because the cathode is provided by the surrounding oxygen in the air. Rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles include lead-acid ("flooded", deep-cycle, and VRLA), NiCd, nickel-metal hydride, lithium-ion, Li-ion polymer, and, less commonly, zinc-air and molten-salt batteries. The amount of electricity (i.e. electric charge) stored in batteries is measured in ampere hours or in coulombs, with the total energy often measured in watt hours.|$|E
40|$|A {{completely}} self-contained, small, {{neodymium laser}} {{has been designed}} and demonstrated {{for use in a}} pyrotechnic ignition system. A nominal 16 J of laser energy (1. 06 micron wavelength, 1 -ms duration) was achieved in a rectangular 10. 5 -X 15. 1 -X 25. 4 -cm package weighting 5. 14 kg. This high <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> is encouraging for laser applications in which specific energy efficiency (energy per unit weight or volume) is important. The laser design concepts are described, and some results on pyrotechnic ignition are given. Some details on a laser currently under construction, which will be 1 / 8 the size of the above laser, are included...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the calculated feasibility {{of improving the}} energy characteristics of power pulses in a system consisting of a reactor and a subcritical block. A BARS-type fast neutron reactor {{is used as a}} self-quenching pulsed reactor. The subcritical block is a cylindrical structure comprising laser-active elements, moderator components and two reflectors (internal and external). The internal reflector material is zirconium hydride, and the external reflector material is beryllium. The pumping area containing the laser-active elements consists of zirconium hydride moderator, aluminum and uranium–molybdenum fuel (95 % enriched uranium). The system operates in a pulsed mode. Fast neutrons are generated in the nuclear reactor at the pulse moment, many of which are leakage neutrons entering the subcritical block, slowing down there and inducing fissions of uranium nuclei in the laser-active elements. After the pulse terminates, the reactor changes to a deeply subcritical state, and the laser pulse generation stops. The neutron kinetics in the system under consideration is modeled based on a modified integral model. The pulse maximum power and energy in the system's subcritical block, as well as its weight and <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> are selected as functionals for the optimization. The fissile material and moderator weight and the thickness of the subcritical block's internal and external reflectors are adopted as variables. The calculations have shown {{that it is possible to}} improve the energy characteristics of a reactor-laser system by increasing the amount of the fissile material in the block, not using the moderator in the block and fixing the thickness of the internal zirconium hydride reflector at a level of 3. 1 cm. It has been shown that a change in the external beryllium reflector thickness leads to a highly multidirectional behavior of the functionals (energy and maximum power, as well as the block weight and <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The ultra-light {{photovoltaic}} {{sandwich structure}} {{is a new}} multifunctional structure concept enabling weight and thus energy to be saved in high-tech solutions such as solar cars, solar planes or satellites. The novelty {{of this approach is}} to use solar cells as a load carrying element in the structure. The aim of this work was to investigate the failure mechanisms of such ultra-light sandwich structure and their correlation with microstructure, processing pressure, and strength in order to obtain optimal design and processing. To this end, composite sandwich structures were extensively studied with weights in the range of 650 – 850 g/m 2, and comprising one 140 µm thick skin made of 0 / 90 ° carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP), one skin made of 130 µm thick mono-crystalline silicon solar cells, and a 29 kg/m 3 honeycomb core. As a first step, core-to-skin bonding in a symmetric (CFRP / core / CFRP) sandwich, for which a design criterion was lacking, was especially studied. An adhesive deposition technique was developed enabling the adhesive weight used for core-to-skin bonding to be tailored. Based on adhesive contact angles, the formation of the adhesive fillets between honeycomb cell walls and skin was modeled. Core / skin debonding energy was measured and compared to core tearing energy measured with a new video-based method, and the failure mechanisms during skin peeling were investigated. It was thus ascertained that, to provide the highest debonding <b>energy-to-weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> the optimal adhesive weight was 35 - 40 g/m 2. Furthermore, in contrast with classic sandwich structures with thicker skins, it was observed that the bending strength of the ultra-light sandwich panels increased with adhesive weight. This was due to the formation of adhesive fillets, which significantly increased the bending stiffness of the thin CFRP skin, and thus increased the compressive load causing local instability of the skin. Models taking into account the increased skin stiffness showed that the best adhesive quantity required to increase the strength-to-weight ratio was ∼ 40 g/m 2. In a second step, the influence of processing pressure on the morphology and strength of symmetric (CFRP / core / CFRP) ultralight sandwich structures was investigated by using one-shot vacuum bag processing. This showed that higher processing pressures caused the formation of larger adhesive fillets and an increased waviness of the CFRP skin on vacuum bag side. These two effects had conflicting impacts on the strength of the structure. Waviness of the skin favored local instabilities, whereas adhesive menisci stabilized the skin. Modeling of the local instability of the skin by taking into account the waviness of the skin {{and the size of the}} menisci as a function of processing pressure enabled an optimal processing pressure of 0. 7 bar to be identified, giving the highest strength-to-weight ratio. The third step of the study was devoted to the mechanical analysis of the mono-crystalline silicon solar cells. The brittle behavior of the cells was confirmed, and the Weibull failure probability curve was established with the mean tensile strength at 221 MPa. It was demonstrated by experimental testing and finite element modeling (FEM) that the low strength of the cells compared to the intrinsic strength of silicon (∼ 6. 9 GPa) was not due to surface texturation of the cells used for increased efficiency, but to more severe surface or edge defects. FEM also showed that no significant reinforcing effect of the cells could be obtained with polymer encapsulation. In addition, thermo-mechanical stresses due to a mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the Si cells and the polymer encapsulation were found to be negligible. In order to protect the cells against the environment, encapsulation of the cells was successfully carried out, using highly transparent fluoropolymer films treated with SiO 2 plasma sputtering for improved adhesion, together with silicone adhesive. Finally, the integration of solar cells as a photovoltaic skin of an ultra-light sandwich structure was achieved using thin stress transfer ribbons to ensure load transfer between adjacent cells. It was observed that the cells were not damaged by sandwich panel processing, even in curved panels, thus showing that the processing windows of the different constituents were compatible. The asymmetric (Si / core / CFRP) photovoltaic sandwich structure with a weight equal to 800 g/m 2 and a specific power density equal to ∼ 250 W/kg (i. e. 20 times more than standard commercial photovoltaic panels) demonstrated an equilibrated mechanical behavior, i. e. the CFRP skin, reinforcing ribbons, and solar cells had similar failure loads...|$|E
