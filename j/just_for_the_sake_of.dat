5|$|Reception for {{individual}} elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed {{sufficient for the}} needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by ANN and Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag, both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something {{that he was going to}} do <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E

In 2005, the Prime Minister's press secretary estimated that only 700 to 800 people potentially satisfied the criteria. This may be contrary to the principle of equality under the law as it [...] "impairs the equal right of candidature". It also runs contrary to the principle of democracy which [...] "demands that a broad selection of people should be able to stand for high public office".

[...] From the beginning of her sport climbing career, Hill was aware that the sport was evolving and growing.

500|$|Retrospectively, Kristan Reed of Eurogamer called Another World [...] "one of {{the most}} visionary and memorable games of its time." [...] Reviewing the 15th Anniversary Edition in 2010, Eurogamer's John Walker called it [...] "still utterly beautiful", adding that the game's art style is [...] "just fantastic. Chahi's design is exquisitely simple and {{enormously}} evocative. Built from spare polygons, its paper-craft-like animation conjures the world, the creatures and the threat wonderfully." [...] In a 2014 review of the 3DS version, Bob Mackey of USGamer opined [...] "Another World is definitely an experience every gamer should have— and not <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> checking out a historical curiosity. Another World still feels incredibly forward-thinking, almost as if Chahi had developed a game for this decade's indie scene without even realizing it." ...|$|E

500|$|The game {{world was}} well {{received}} for its number {{and variety of}} side missions and distractions but its scale was criticized as unnecessarily large, with GameSpot describing it as [...] "bigger <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> being bigger"; Joystiq described the city as unattractive, with the expanded play area increasing the commute but not the enjoyment. Others criticized changes in navigating the city; some areas prevented grappling, slowing (or stopping) travel. Polygon called the world more linear, with fewer chances to revisit areas with new gadgets to open new paths and deviation from the most obvious path necessary only to find collectables. However, some reviewers considered the city's vastness and activities engrossing. Kotaku criticized the side quests as [...] "busywork" [...] for not advancing the narrative or providing appropriate rewards. Others found the use of previous elements tedious, with replacements simply mimicking the old (such as the glue grenade, with an identical purpose to Arkham Citys ice grenades).|$|E
500|$|Radiant Dawn holds a {{score of}} 78/100 on the review {{aggregator}} Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews. GameSpot's Lark Anderson noted that, although players can save mid-battle, the difficulty [...] "will easily overwhelm even experienced tacticians." [...] Eurogamer's Keza MacDonald appreciated the depth and refinement of the game, but proceeded to note a lack of accessibility due to greater complication and difficulty as Radiant Dawn progresses. Some reviewers were also critical of the developers' choice {{not to use the}} Wii's motion controls, although RPGamer's Bryan Boulette commented that [...] "the game thankfully delivers a traditional experience that isn't changed <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> changing it." [...] In general, critics praised the gameplay system recognized in previous Fire Emblem games, but noted that the game felt too similar to its GameCube predecessor, with ONMs Chandra Nair commenting that Radiant Dawn has [...] "refused to move forward." [...] Hypers Yuri Spadeface commends the game for its [...] "deep strategy and for being hard". However, he criticises it for being [...] "unforgiving", noting that it features [...] "permanent death and is not really a Wii game".|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} from xx were {{licensed}} by XL to television programs in the UK and North America. [...] "Intro" [...] became widely used as theme music in television, including sports highlights, episodes of series such as Law & Order and Cold Case, an advertisement for AT, and BBC's coverage of the 2010 British general election. Along with their placement in television, songs from the record were used by North American chain stores such as Starbucks and Urban Outfitters as background music at their locations. According to McCormick, these marketing strategies helped the xx develop enough media presence to garner [...] "over half a million sales around the world without ever having anything as vulgar as a hit". Kris Chen, XL's A senior vice president, believed the exposure was desired and necessary for promoting an album that was not [...] "driven by pop radio". Although the band realised their music had to be marketed somehow, Croft expressed reservations about [...] "putting our music on everything, just to put it to anything <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> money".|$|E

5000|$|Following the film's British {{theatrical}} release, {{film magazine}} Little White Lies awarded 4 stars, expressing that [...] "This surprisingly touching tragicomedy revolves around love and friendship, and it’s a gem of low-budget British cinema that ignores discussing the political issues {{that come with}} societal collapse, instead focussing on something more emotive and soulful." [...] continuing with [...] "this is not <b>just</b> surrealism <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> of it. It’s bonkers, but with a point. Far from being pure dystopian tragedy, Set the Thames on Fire is a weirdly warming, visually affecting fable about needing a mate when the whole world has gone to crap".|$|R
500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's {{going to go on}} over a six-month or eight-month period, how am I going to get [...] {{to be able to go}} be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{focused on}} the show's fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs. TV Guides Matt Roush, for instance, called the show [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "offbeat", and noted how {{literally}} the series took the metaphor of space operas as Westerns. Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was [...] "jarring", but that once he got used to this, he found the characters cleverly conceived, and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension and humor. Several reviewers, however, criticized the show's setting; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that the melding of the western and science fiction genres was a [...] "forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> being different" [...] and called the series a [...] "vast disappointment", and Carina Chocano of Salon.com {{said that while the}} [...] "space as Wild West" [...] metaphor is fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of the New York Times, reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured [...] "an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, a hard sell during a season dominated by Joe Millionaire".|$|E

AppSpy said [...] "Quell is a beautifully relaxing puzzle title to delve in to and even when things get rough it's {{easy to get lost}} in the moment and <b>just</b> play <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> of chilling out". Eurogamer wrote [...] "At less than the price that airports charge for a packet of Extra, Quell is yet another way to make you feel Zen about spending hundreds of pounds on Apple hardware".

500|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> fame, no matter what— sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how she could come out of that [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying: ...|$|E
