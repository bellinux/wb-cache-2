25|$|Human rights <b>groups</b> <b>say</b> the lèse-majesté {{laws have}} been used as a {{political}} weapon to stifle free speech. iLaw, a Thai non-profit organization seeking legislative change, released a 2014 annual report which details changes after the 2014 coup. The junta issued orders and invoked martial law to hold persons in custody for seven days without pressing any charges against them. Secret trials were used. The officials seized personal communication devices to search for incriminating evidence.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 the Israeli {{parliament}} {{gave the}} rabbinical court expanded legal power to sanction men {{who refuse to}} give their wives a get by suspending their driver's licenses, seizing their bank accounts, preventing travel abroad and even imprisoning {{those who do not}} comply with an order to grant a divorce; however, women's <b>groups</b> <b>say</b> the 1995 law is not very effective because the court uses sanctions in less than 2% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Although China outlawed torture in 1996, {{human rights}} <b>groups</b> <b>say</b> {{brutality}} and degradation {{are common in}} Chinese arbitrary detention centres, Laojiao prisons and black jails. People who are imprisoned for their political views, human rights activities or religious beliefs have {{a high risk of}} being tortured. While the existence of black jails is acknowledged by {{at least part of the}} government, the CPC strongly denies facilitating the operation of such jails and officially cracks down on them, leading to at least one trial.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} the parade banned gay <b>groups,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>groups</b> could not display banners {{identifying}} their sexuality. On September 3, 2014, {{the organizers of}} the parade announced a decision to lift the ban on gay <b>groups,</b> <b>saying</b> they preferred to keep the parade non-political and the ban was having the opposite effect. In 2015 OUT@NBCUniversal, an organization of gay employees of NBCUniversal, became the first gay group to march in the parade.|$|R

25|$|Human {{rights groups}} and the UN use the Gaza Health Ministry's number of Palestinians killed in Gaza as {{preliminary}} and add to or subtract from it after conducting their own investigations. For example, human rights <b>groups</b> <b>say</b> that the casualty count provided by the Health Ministry most likely includes victims of Hamas executions, domestic violence, and natural deaths, but they (the human rights groups) remove the accused collaborators (who were shot as close range) from their own counts. Israel contends that the Health Ministry's casualty count also includes deaths caused by rocket or mortar malfunctions.|$|E
25|$|The Central Tibetan Administration {{also says}} that {{millions}} of Chinese immigrants to the TAR are diluting the Tibetans both culturally and through intermarriage. Exile <b>groups</b> <b>say</b> that despite recent attempts to restore the appearance of original Tibetan culture to attract tourism, the traditional Tibetan {{way of life is}} now irrevocably changed. It is also reported that when Hu Yaobang, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, visited Lhasa in 1980 he was unhappy when he found out the region was behind neighbouring provinces. Reforms were instituted, and since then the central government's policy in Tibet has granted most religious freedoms. But monks and nuns are still sometimes imprisoned, and many Tibetans (mostly monks and nuns) continue to flee Tibet yearly. At the same time, many Tibetans believe projects that the PRC implement to benefit Tibet, such as the China Western Development economic plan or the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, are politically motivated actions to consolidate central control over Tibet by facilitating militarization and Han Chinese migration while benefiting few Tibetans; they also believe the money funneled into cultural restoration projects as being aimed at attracting foreign tourists. They also say that there is still preferential treatment awarded to Han Chinese in the labor market as opposed to Tibetans.|$|E
500|$|The July 2009 Ürümqi riots were {{a series}} of violent riots over several days that broke out on 5 July 2009 in Ürümqi, {{the capital city of}} the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), in northwestern People's Republic of China (PRC). The first day's rioting, which {{involved}} at least 1,000 Uyghurs, began as a protest but escalated into violent attacks that mainly targeted Han people. People's Armed Police were deployed, and two days later hundreds of Han people clashed with both police and Uyghurs. PRC officials said that a total of 197 people died, among those killed most of them are Hans, with 1,721 others injured and many vehicles and buildings destroyed; however, Uyghur exile <b>groups</b> <b>say</b> the death toll is higher. Many [...] men disappeared during wide-scale police sweeps in the days following the riots; Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented 43 cases and said figures for real disappearances were likely to be much higher.|$|E

50|$|The {{debate has}} three sides: one <b>group</b> <b>says</b> the crash caused the {{depression}} by drastically lowering {{expectations about the}} future and by removing large sums of investment capital; a second <b>group</b> <b>says</b> the economy was slipping since summer 1929 and the crash ratified it; the third <b>group</b> <b>says</b> that in either scenario the crash could not have caused more than a recession. There was a brief recovery in the market into April 1930, but prices then started falling steadily again from there, not reaching a final bottom until July 1932. This was the largest long-term U.S. market decline by any measure. To move from a recession in 1930 to a deep depression in 1931-32, entirely different factors had to be in play.|$|R
500|$|Welfare {{groups have}} {{expressed}} {{concerns about the}} treatment of this segment of the Hong Kong workforce, and the 2014 Erwiana Sulistyaningsih abuse case (which attracted international news headlines) focused on the plight of foreign workers in the territory. Thousands took to the streets, demanding justice for Sulistyaningsih. Although the government calls her case an isolated one, welfare <b>groups</b> <b>say</b> that many workers are victims of [...] "modern-day slavery" [...] and abuse by employers. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor reported that a substantial percentage of workers are mistreated by their employers; of 2,500 workers interviewed, at least 25 percent said they had experienced violations of their contract (including pay less than the MAW and being denied their mandatory weekly day of rest and statutory holidays). More than 25 percent had also experienced physical and verbal abuse, including a [...] "significant incidence" [...] of sexual abuse. According to Caritas Hong Kong, their Asian Migrant Worker Social Service Project helpline received over four thousand calls from workers and 53 workers received assistance to remain in Hong Kong and pursue their claims. According to Belthune House executive director Adwina Antonio, the shelter dealt with 7,000 cases of alleged abuse in the first three-quarters of 2013 (compared with 3,000 for all of 2012).|$|E
500|$|Filipino {{workers have}} protested Philippine {{government}} targeting of overseas Filipino workers, and a 1982 protest opposed Executive Order No. 857 (EO-857) implemented by Ferdinand Marcos. According to the order, overseas contract workers {{were required to}} remit 50 to 70 percent of their total earnings through authorised government channels only. Migrant-worker <b>groups</b> <b>say</b> that overseas Filipino workers must pay up to PHP150,000 ($3,400) in government and recruiting-agency fees before they can leave the country. In 2007, the Philippine government proposed a law requiring workers to submit to a [...] "competency training and assessment program" [...] which would cost them PHP10,000 to P15,000 (US$215 to US$320) – about half their average monthly salary (typically US$450). According to the Philippine Department of Labor and Employment, the policy would help protect domestic overseas workers from abuse by employers. Government agencies receive {{a total of about}} PHP21billion ($470million) a year from foreign workers in police clearances, National Bureau of Investigation and passport fees, membership in the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, local health insurance and Philippine Overseas Employment Agency and Home Development Mutual Fund fees. Although charges by Indonesian agencies for dormitory housing, lessons in Cantonese, housework and Chinese cuisine were capped at about HK$14,000 by the government in 2012, interest is excluded from the cap. In 2012, Bloomberg reporters suggested that many agencies contract with workers to convert sums owed before their arrival in Hong Kong into [...] "advances" [...] from moneylenders (bypassing Hong Kong law).|$|E

According to the press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders, [...] "The Israeli media were once again in 2005 the only ones in the region that had genuine freedom to speak out." [...] However, in 2010, human rights groups operating in Israel complained of a hostile environment in the country, and said they were coming under attack for criticising Israeli policies. The <b>groups</b> <b>say</b> that some Israeli leaders see human rights criticism as a threat to Israel's legitimacy, especially following war crimes allegations against the Israeli military over the Gaza War (2008–09).|$|E
2500|$|Even in 2007, at {{the tenth}} {{anniversary of the}} massacre, members of Las Abejas {{reported}} {{that some of the}} killers have not been brought to justice.

[...] "These guys in jails were killers, and there are more killers out there. [...] That's the truth," [...] he insists. [...] Many of those imprisoned, however, insist that they are not guilty, such as Agostin Gomez Perez, who has been imprisoned for more than a decade. [...] "What happened in Acteal is very sad," [...] he says, [...] "But I wasn't involved in it. [...] I didn't kill a soul."
