However, gravitational perturbations from giant planets cause their orbits to change. Single-apparition comets have a hyperbolic or parabolic osculating orbit which allows them to permanently exit the Solar System after a single pass of the Sun. The Sun's Hill sphere has an unstable maximum boundary of 230,000 AU (...)

2500|$|Aerocapture is a {{much more}} {{aggressive}} manoeuver, converting an incoming <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>orbit</b> to an elliptical orbit in one pass. [...] This requires a heat shield and much trickier navigation, because it must be completed in one pass through the atmosphere, and unlike aerobraking no preview of the atmosphere is possible. If the intent is to remain in orbit, then at least one more propulsive maneuver is required after aerocapture—otherwise the low point of the resulting orbit will remain in the atmosphere, resulting in eventual re-entry. Aerocapture has not yet been tried on a planetary mission, but the re-entry skip by Zond 6 and Zond 7 upon lunar return were aerocapture maneuvers, because they turned a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>orbit</b> into an elliptical orbit.

2500|$|A {{relatively}} {{simple way to}} get a first-order approximation of delta-v is based on the 'Patched Conic Approximation' technique. One must choose the one dominant gravitating body in each region of space through which the trajectory will pass, and to model only that body's effects in that region. [...] For instance, on a trajectory from the Earth to Mars, one would begin by considering only the Earth's gravity until the trajectory reaches a distance where the Earth's gravity no longer dominates that of the Sun. [...] The spacecraft would be given escape velocity to send it on its way to interplanetary space. [...] Next, one would consider only the Sun's gravity until the trajectory reaches the neighbourhood of Mars. [...] During this stage, the transfer orbit model is appropriate. [...] Finally, only Mars's gravity is considered during the final portion of the trajectory where Mars's gravity dominates the spacecraft's behaviour. [...] The spacecraft would approach Mars on a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>orbit,</b> and a final retrograde burn would slow the spacecraft enough to be captured by Mars.|$|E

40|$|Compact {{binaries}} in <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>orbits</b> are plausible {{gravitational wave}} (GW) {{sources for the}} upcoming and planned GW observatories. We develop an efficient prescription to compute post-Newtonian (PN) accurate ready-to-use GW polarization states for spinning compact binaries, influenced by the dominant order spin-orbit interactions, in <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>orbits.</b> This is achieved by invoking the 1. 5 PN accurate quasi-Keplerian parameterization for the radial sector of the orbital dynamics. We probe the influences of spins and gravitational radiation reaction on h_+ and h_× during the hyperbolic passage. It turns out that both polarization states exhibit the memory effect for GWs from spinning compact binaries in <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>orbits.</b> In contrast, only cross polarization state exhibits the memory effect for GWs from non-spinning compact binaries. Additionally, we compute 1 PN accurate amplitude corrected GW polarization states for hyperbolic non-spinning compact binaries in a fully parametric manner and perform initial comparisons with the existing waveforms.
