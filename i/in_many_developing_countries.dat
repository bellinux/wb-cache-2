5|$|<b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> the {{ketogenic}} diet {{is expensive}} because dairy fats and meat {{are more expensive}} than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> cholera still {{reaches its}} victims through {{contaminated}} water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease.

The Haitian government's inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{was used for}} disinfecting wounds, partly because of its low cost and prompt availability compared to other antiseptics. It is now thought to slow healing and lead to scarring because it destroys newly formed skin cells. Only a very low concentration of H2O2 can induce healing, and only if not repeatedly applied. Surgical use can lead to gas embolism formation. Despite this it is still used for wound treatment <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E
