Embryonic {{stem cells}} • Induced {{pluripotent}} stem cells • Cancer vaccine • Oncofetal antigen • Myeloid-derived suppressor cells The history of immunizing with <b>embryonic</b> <b>materials</b> to generate an antitumor immune response dates back to a century ago. The premise is that cancer cells share the expression of oncofetal antigens with <b>embryonic</b> <b>materials</b> and that the immune response against these antigens in the embryonic tissues is cross-protective against cancer. However, such a practice has never advanced beyond ex-perimental animal settings, {{because of lack of}} uniformed source tissues and ethical challenges.

40|$|Direct {{reprogramming}} of {{somatic cells}} into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells {{has emerged as}} an invaluable method for generating patient-specific stem cells of any lineage {{without the use of}} <b>embryonic</b> <b>materials.</b> Following the first reported generation of iPS cells from murine fibroblasts using retroviral transduction of a defined set of transcription factors, various new strategies have been developed to improve and refine the reprogramming technology.

This review summarizes current and evolving strategies in the generation of iPS cells, including types of somatic cells for reprogramming, variations of reprogramming genes, reprogramming methods, and how the advancement iPS cells technology can lead to the future success of reproductive medicine...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the developing embryo (both plant and animal) and a gravitational field has long been contemplated. The difficulty in designing critical experiments {{on the surface of}} the earth because of its background of 1 g, has been an obstacle to a resolution of the problem. Biological responses to gravity (particularly in plants) are obvious in many cases; however, the influence of gravity as an environmental input to the developing embryo is not as obvious and has proven to be extremely difficult to define. In spite of this, over the years numerous attempts have been made using a variety of <b>embryonic</b> <b>materials</b> to come to grips with the role of gravity in development. Three research tools are available: the centrifuge, the clinostat, and the orbiting spacecraft. Experimental results are now available from all three sources.

40|$|The Arabidopsis {{endosperm}} {{consists of}} a single cell layer surrounding the mature embryo and playing an essential role to prevent the germination of dormant seeds or that of nondormant seeds irradiated by a far red (FR) light pulse. In order to further gain insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the germination repressive activity exerted by the endosperm, a "seed coat bedding" assay (SCBA) was devised. The SCBA is a dissection procedure physically separating seed coats and embryos from seeds, which allows monitoring the growth of embryos on an underlying layer of seed coats. Remarkably, the SCBA reconstitutes the germination repressive activities of the seed coat {{in the context of}} seed dormancy and FR-dependent control of seed germination. Since the SCBA allows the combinatorial use of dormant, nondormant and genetically modified seed coat and <b>embryonic</b> <b>materials,</b> the genetic pathways controlling germination and specifically operating in the endosperm and embryo can be dissected.

40|$|Seed {{dormancy}} is an ecologically important adaptive trait {{in plants}} whereby germination is repressed even under favorable germination {{conditions such as}} imbibition with water. In Arabidopsis and most plant species, dormancy absolutely requires an unidentified seed coat germination-repressive activity and constitutively higher abscisic acid (ABA) levels upon seed imbibition. The mechanisms underlying these processes and their possible relationship are incompletely understood. We developed a "seed coat bedding" assay monitoring the growth of dissected embryos cultured on a layer of seed coats, allowing combinatorial experiments using dormant, nondormant, and various genetically modified seed coat and <b>embryonic</b> <b>materials.</b> This assay, combined with direct ABA measurements, revealed that, upon imbibition, dormant coats, unlike nondormant coats, actively produce and release ABA to repress embryo germination, whatever the embryo origin, i. e., from dormant, nondormant, or never dormant aba seeds, unable to synthesize ABA. The persistent high ABA levels in imbibed dormant seeds requires the permanent expression of the DELLA gene RGL 2, where it remains insensitive to gibberellins (GA) unlike in nondormant seeds. These findings present the seed coat as an organ actively controlling germination upon seed imbibition and provide a framework to investigate how environmental factors break seed dormancy...|$|R

50|$|In 2013, Araújo et al. {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} specimen ML1188, a clutch of crushed dinosaur eggs and <b>embryonic</b> <b>material</b> attributed to Torvosaurus. This discovery further supports the hypothesis that large theropod dinosaurs were oviparous, meaning that they laid eggs and hence that embryonic development occurred outside the body of female dinosaurs. This discovery was made in 2005 by the Dutch amateur fossil-hunter Aart Walen at the Lourinhã Formation in Western Portugal, in fluvial overbank sediments that {{are considered to be}} from the Tithonian stage of the Jurassic Period, approximately 152 to 145 million years ago. This discovery is significant paleontologically for a number of reasons: (a) these are the most primitive dinosaur embryos known; (b) these are the only basal theropod embryos known; (c) fossilized eggs and embryos are rarely found together; (d) it represents the first evidence of a one-layered eggshell for theropod dinosaurs; and (e) it allows researchers to link a new eggshell morphology to the osteology of a particular group of theropod dinosaurs. The specimen is housed at the Museu da Lourinhã, in Portugal. As the eggs were abandoned due to unknown circumstances, it is not known if Torvosaurus provided parental care to its eggs and young or abandoned them shortly after laying.|$|E

Results: Pancreases developed in culture and expressed the full complement of exocrine (both acinar and ductal) and endocrine cell types. Betacellulin enhanced branching morphogenesis and the proliferation of mesenchyme, increased Pdx 1 and insulin production and inhibited the production of the exocrine cell marker amylase and the endocrine hormone glucagon.
