5|$|After {{the third}} volume, a new editor was {{assigned}} to the series. Kamiya noted the third volume contained a lot of plot progression, and was going to balance <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth volume with more lighthearted and carefree events.. Volumes four and five were written as a single volume; since volume four lacked a climatic ending, Kamiya had to restructure the story. This, along with communication problems with his new editor, and other problems in Kamiya's life caused a month delay in volume four's release. After completing volume five, Kamiya was asked to submit volume six's manuscript before 2014 for the anime adaptation, and to complete the volume before the anime's premiere.|$|E

Although {{the idea of}} {{partitioning}} Poland came from the King Frederick II of Prussia, Catherine took {{a leading role in}} carrying <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1790s. In 1768, she formally became protector of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which provoked an anti-Russian uprising in Poland, the Confederation of Bar (1768–72). After the uprising broke down due to internal politics in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, she established in the Rzeczpospolita, a system of government fully controlled by the Russian Empire through a Permanent Council, under the supervision of her ambassadors and envoys.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1970s, Genoa would mostly play {{in second}} league. Under the {{management}} of Arturo Silvestri the club made its way back to Serie A for the 1973–74 season, but they were relegated straight back down. For the return of Il Grifone to Series A a couple of seasons later, the squad featured the likes of Roberto Rosato, Bruno Conti and a young Roberto Pruzzo. This time they stuck <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top division for two seasons before succumbing to relegation in 1977–78; the relegation was particularly cruel as the side above them Fiorentina survived on goal-difference of just a single goal, the two teams had played {{each other on the}} final day of the season ending in a 0–0 draw.|$|E
25|$|The Nazi Party was {{the largest}} party in the {{national}} elections of 1932. On 31 July 1932 it received 37.3% of the votes, and in the election on 6 November 1932 it received less, but still the largest share, 33.1%, making it the biggest party in the Reichstag. The Communist KPD came third, with 15%. Together, the anti-democratic parties of far right and far left were now able to hold the majority of seats in Parliament, but they were at sword's point with each other, fighting <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets. The Nazis were particularly successful among Protestants, among unemployed young voters, among the lower middle class in the cities and among the rural population. It was weakest in Catholic areas and in large cities. On 30 January 1933, pressured by former Chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservatives, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor.|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{the fight}} for the top spots means that the most {{significant}} rivalries are with the other Top 14 big guns, Toulouse and Biarritz Olympique. Stade Français {{has been seen as}} the rising threat by the all-powerful Toulousains who had won four consecutive titles (1994–97), before Paris won the next one. The clubs alternated for four years, winning two titles each until 2001, though they never met in the final. When they finally did, Stade Français walked over Toulouse for a victory (32–18) in 2003. Toulouse got their revenge in 2005, when they won a tight Heineken Cup final in overtime (18–12 a.e.t.) at Murrayfield. The clubs often fight <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press, but there have never been any real tensions on the pitch, largely because many players have been playing together for France. Regular season games are rarely spectacular. In October 2005, Toulouse was the guest for the first ever regular season match at the Stade de France, but coach Guy Novès chose to leave key regular starters at home, so the Stade Français 29–15 victory was maybe not as significant.|$|E

500|$|The {{reaction}} in Britain to Wodehouse's broadcasts was hostile, {{and he was}} [...] "reviled... as a traitor, collaborator, Nazi propagandist, and a coward", although, Phelps observes, {{many of those who}} decried his actions had not heard the content of the programmes. A front page article in The Daily Mirror stated that Wodehouse [...] "lived luxuriously because Britain laughed with him, but when the laughter was out of his country's heart,... was not ready to share her suffering. He hadn't the guts... even to stick <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> internment camp." [...] In the House of Commons Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, regretted Wodehouse's actions.

[...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the sense that you don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{features}} a reappearance by Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), a recurring character during the first season. The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode, which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool. The alternate ending starts {{the same way as}} the regular ending, with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant. But instead of the episode ending there, Meg's mom comes into the room while Veronica hides in the bathroom. When the mom leaves, Meg is dead with a pillow over her face, indicating smothering. However, Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in. Thomas commented that the alternate ending was never going to be the actual conclusion to the episode. He said: [...] "We never seriously considered having that be the ending. There were various other endings that we did have, but they were so subtly different, it was like, 'When does Veronica enter the room?'" [...] The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver. After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending, he decided to make it very different from the episode's actual conclusion. [...] "But once we could have a [...] alternate ending, we thought, 'Let's make it rock.' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don't have to play <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next episode." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{most violent}} escape attempt {{occurred}} on May 2–4, 1946, when a failed attempt by six prisoners {{led to the}} Battle of Alcatraz, {{also known as the}} [...] "Alcatraz Blastout". It was carried out by six prisoners; Bernard Coy, Joseph Cretzer, Sam Shockley, Clarence Carnes, Marvin Hubbard and Miran Thompson. They daringly took control of the cell house by overpowering correctional officers, and were able to enter the weapons room and obtain the keys to the recreation yard door. Their aim was to escape by boat from the dock, but when they failed to obtain the keys to the outside door, they decided to battle <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> fight that ensued they managed to hold two correctional officers hostage whom they eventually killed after two days. Prompted by Shockley and Thompson, Cretzer shot the hostages at very close range. One of the guards, William Miller, succumbed to his injuries while the second guard, Harold Stites, was also killed at the cellhouse. Although Shockley, Thompson, and Carnes returned to their cells, the other three, Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard, persisted with their fight. The U.S. Marines intervened to help the correctional officers and killed the three prisoners. In this battle, apart from the guards and prisoners killed, 17 other guards and one prisoner were also injured. Shockley, Thompson, and Carnes were tried for the killing of the correctional officers. Shockley and Thompson were sentenced to death through the gas chamber, which was carried out at San Quentin in December 1948. However, Carnes, who was only 19 years of age, was given a second life sentence.|$|E
