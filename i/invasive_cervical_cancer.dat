Pathological material was collected from 9 hospitals across Wales (UK), and HPV typing and pathology review was conducted at a central laboratory. Genotyping for high-risk HPV DNA was performed by PCR-enzyme immunoassay using the GP 5 +/ 6 + primer set. DNA was successfully extracted from 297 cases.

The proportion of cases which had only HPV 16 and/or 18 was 219 of 280 (78. 2 %, 95 % CI = 73. 0 – 82. 7); the proportion of cases which had HPV 16 or 18 and another HPV type was 230 of 280 (82. 1 %, 95 % CI = 77. 2 – 86. 2). The proportion of <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> associated with infection with HPV types 16 and 18 has previously been estimated at around 70 %.

50|$|Interval {{evaluation}} of the woman after therapy is imperative.

50|$|The {{second most}} common {{malignant}} tumor in women is <b>invasive</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> (ICC) and more than 50% of all <b>invasive</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> (ICC) is caused by oncongenic human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16). Furthermore, cervix intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is primarily caused by oncogenic HPV16. As in many cases, the causative factor for cancer does not always take a direct route from infection {{to the development of}} cancer. Genomic methylation patterns have been associated with <b>invasive</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer.</b> Within the HPV16L1 region, 14 tested CpG sites have significantly higher methylation in CIN3+ than in HPV16 genomes of women without CIN3. Only 2/16 CpG sites tested in HPV16 upstream regulatory region were found to have association with increased methylation in CIN3+. This suggests that the direct route from infection to cancer is sometimes detoured to a precancerous state in cervix intraepithelial neoplasia. Additionally, increased CpG site methylation was found in low levels in most of the five host nuclear genes studied, including 5/5 TERT, 1/4 DAPK1, 2/5 RARB, MAL, and CADM1. Furthermore, 1/3 of CpG sites in mitochondrial DNA were associated with increased methylation in CIN3+. Thus, a correlation exists between CIN3+ and increased methylation of CpG sites in the HPV16 L1 open reading frame. This could be a potential biomarker for future screens of cancerous and precancerous cervical disease.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of human papillomavirus (HPV) types in <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> {{is essential for}} design and evaluation of HPV type-specific vaccines. To follow up on a previous report that HPV types 35 and 58 were the dominant HPV types in cervical neoplasia in Mozambique, the HPV types in a consecutive case series of 74 <b>invasive</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> in Mozambique were determined.

A previous study on human papillomavirus (HPV) geno-types in Mozambique, reported that the HPV type distribu-tion was unusual. The most common worldwide oncogenic HPV type 16 was infrequent and HPV type 35 was dominant (Castellsague et al., 2001). The authors {{drew attention to the}} fact that type-specific HPV vaccines are currently being produced (Koutsky et al., 2002) and proposed that the type composition of such vaccines should be modified for different populations to reflect the HPV type distribution in the population. To investigate further this important issue, we analysed the HPV types present in a comprehensive case series of <b>invasive</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> from Mozambique. From June 2002 to April 2003, all women with suspected <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> at the Department of Gynaecology at the Central Hospital of Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, were asked to participate.

30|$|Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are non-enveloped, {{double-stranded}} circular DNA {{viruses and}} {{are associated with}} a wide spectrum of benign and malignant neoplasia (Zheng and Baker, 2006). Until now, more than 120 HPV subtypes have been identified and characterized (Bernard et al., 2010). According to oncogenic potentials epidemiologically, some of them are classified into “high-risk (HR)” group and “low-risk (LR)” group (Munoz et al., 2003). Persistent infection of multiple HR-HPVs is the major cause of <b>cervical</b> <b>cancer</b> in female. As a representative HR-HPV, HPV 16 is responsible for approximately ~ 60 % of <b>invasive</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>cancers</b> worldwide (Zheng and Baker, 2006). HR-HPVs bound up with malignancies have developed many oncogenic strategies which are rarely found in LR-HPVs. Examples include that viral crucial oncoproteins efficiently degrade tumor suppressors (such as E 6 target p 53) (Scheffner et al., 1990), and integration of the viral DNA segments into the human genome increases E 6 expression leading to oncogenesis (Alp Avci, 2012).|$|R
