5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{for many}} Italians the name of Kesselring, whose {{signature}} appeared on posters and printed orders announcing <b>draconian</b> measures adopted by the German occupation, had become synonymous with the oppression and terror that had characterised the German occupation. Kesselring's name headed the list of German officers blamed for a long series of atrocities perpetrated by the German forces.|$|E
5|$|King Ladislaus promulgated {{laws that}} {{prescribed}} <b>draconian</b> punishments against criminals. His laws also regulated {{the payment of}} customs duties, of tolls payable at fairs and fords, and of the tithes. He forbade Jews from holding Christian serfs, and introduced laws aiming at the conversion of local Muslims, who were known as Böszörménys.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, Thai workers rioted {{over the}} <b>draconian</b> {{treatment}} they received as foreign workers. These workers lived in poor conditions and had limited freedom. The Chen administration vowed {{to take action}} on August 25. Chen apologized {{to the public for}} the social turmoil caused by the incident and offered to resign three times. Then-premier Frank Hsieh authorized Chen's resignation on September 12, and replaced him with former vice premier Yeh Chu-lan.|$|E

50|$|Plotting revenge, Kang {{orders a}} small group of five <b>draconians,</b> {{including}} himself and Slith, to enter the dwarven town to find out who burned down their village. Slith and the other three shape shift into dwarven guards, while Kang turns invisible. However, when the dwarves discover one of the <b>draconians,</b> the five beat a hasty retreat. Slith managed to steal a book with the map secreted within it from Selquist before they retreated; however, Selquist now pursues the <b>draconians.</b> After he catches Kang, he drives a knife into Kang's leg, temporarily crippling him. The dwarf and the <b>draconians</b> squabble over the book, ending up with the dwarf regaining the book, but the <b>draconians</b> keeping the cover, which has the map hidden inside it. The <b>draconians</b> retreat into their camp, unbeknownst to the fact they have the map to the Nerakan treasures.|$|R

5|$|A {{letter of}} support from 120 members of the German parliament, the Bundestag, {{was sent to the}} Russian Ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin. It {{described}} proceedings against the women as disproportionate and <b>draconian.</b> On August 9, 2012, 200 Pussy Riot supporters in Berlin marched, wearing colored balaclavas, in a show of support for the group. Attending the trial, British MP and Shadow Foreign Office Minister for Human Rights, Kerry McCarthy, also backed the group, describing proceedings as “surreal”. Lech Wałęsa criticised the church performance as “tasteless”, but nevertheless wrote to Putin urging him to pardon the women.|$|E
5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered <b>draconian</b> building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Wonder Mountain's Guardian {{version of}} the {{attraction}} features eight characters. Stansien is the riders' guide who leads them through the mountain. Crazy Crabs are characterized as attractive but dangerous. Beasty Bats are recognizable by their oversized fangs compared to those of regular bats. Sneaky Spiders {{have the ability to}} ambush riders and their bites contain venom. Archers fight with bows and arrows, and can move around quickly. Wet Ones are reptilian creatures similar to fish but they can walk on land. These reptiles are most dangerous when they are in the water. Draconians protect <b>Draconian</b> City and carry swords and shields. Ormaar is the dragon that lives inside the mountain and confronts riders {{at the end of the}} ride.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Draconians</b> are an {{extraterrestrial}} race. They were {{featured in}} the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Their only television appearance to date was in the 1973 serial Frontier in Space. Unlike many [...] "monster" [...] races in Doctor Who, the <b>Draconians</b> were articulate and portrayed as having a sophisticated and advanced culture like feudal Japan. In later interviews, Jon Pertwee cited the <b>Draconians</b> as his favourite of all the monsters he had encountered during his time as the Doctor.|$|R

5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and <b>draconian.</b> Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E
5|$|The border was a {{physical}} manifestation of Winston Churchill's metaphorical Iron Curtain {{that separated the}} Soviet and Western blocs during the Cold War. It marked the boundary between two ideological systems– capitalism and communism. Built by East Germany in phases from 1952 to the late 1980s, the fortifications were constructed to stop the large-scale emigration of East German citizens to the West, about 1,000 of whom {{are said to have}} died trying to cross it during its 45-year existence. It caused widespread economic and social disruption on both sides; East Germans living in the region suffered especially <b>draconian</b> restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further <b>draconian</b> measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
50|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} module, Dragons of Despair, players reenact the Dragonlance story using the pre-generated players. The player characters return to their hometown and find it overrun by evil; the elves of Qualinost hire them to free captives that the <b>Draconians</b> have imprisoned in the fortress of Pax Tharkas. In Dragons of Flame, the brave Innfellows are suffering thanks to the <b>Draconians,</b> and require aid in the beleaguered North Lands before setting off to rescue an enslaved population. When the adventure starts, Solace has been captured by Kapak <b>Draconians.</b> The dragon armies control the plains, but Qualinesti is not conquered. Plainsmen are being taken by caravan to Pax Tharkas to be slaves.|$|R
50|$|The book {{begins with}} Kang and his force of <b>draconians</b> {{preparing}} to ambush {{an army of}} goblins which are trying to destroy Kang's force because they have females. After springing the ambush, they {{find out that the}} goblins were aware of the ambush, and turned the ambush around on the <b>draconians.</b> Hobgoblins quickly appear, and so Kang tells his main force to retreat, while signaling a support force to cover.|$|R
5|$|In the jungle-covered {{subterranean}} {{ruins of}} Xak Tsaroth the player characters search for {{knowledge of the}} ancient gods of good, and first encounter the invading <b>draconians.</b> They also find baby dragons and encounter Khisanth, an ancient black dragon. The PCs follow the fleeing dragon down a well, where they must negotiate the first level of a dungeon typical of Dungeons & Dragons adventures, filled with <b>draconians,</b> gully dwarf slaves, and other monsters.|$|R
5|$|Henry quickly took {{revenge on}} his enemies after the Battle of Evesham. He {{immediately}} ordered the sequestration {{of all the}} rebel lands, triggering a wave of chaotic looting across the country. Henry initially rejected any calls for moderation, but in October 1266 he was persuaded by the Papal Legate, Ottobuono de' Fieschi, to issue a less <b>draconian</b> policy, called the Dictum of Kenilworth, which allowed {{for the return of}} the rebels' lands, in exchange for the payment of harsh fines. The Statute of Marlborough followed in November 1267, which effectively reissued much of the Provisions of Westminster, placing limitations on the powers of local royal officials and the major barons, but without restricting central royal authority. Most of the exiled Poitevins began to return to England after the war. In September 1267 Henry made the Treaty of Montgomery with Llywelyn, recognising him as the Prince of Wales and giving substantial land concessions.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as {{the leader}} of South Vietnam's {{military}} junta in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made considerable efforts to consolidate his power, opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded his power within the military junta. In response to General Khánh's political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling {{for an end to the}} <b>draconian</b> laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that his power could be weakened by those demonstrations, General Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and new police powers. He promised to reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.|$|E
5|$|In a rare move, District Judge Earnest Lau {{released}} a 14-page judgment explaining the court's denial of Odex's request for Pacific Internet's client information. He compared Odex's demands to an Anton Piller order, which {{provides for the}} right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. Seen as <b>draconian,</b> it is only used under extreme circumstances. He held that only copyright holders themselves, or their exclusive licensees, can bring such applications and that he was not satisfied with the evidence harvested by BayTSP for the identification of downloaders. Out of all the anime licensed to Odex, only the license in respect of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED had been granted exclusively to the company. The judge noted that, out of the 13 authorisation letters presented in court, ten of them authorised the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS), not Odex, to act for the copyright holders. Odex was ordered to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$7,000.|$|E

5000|$|The siege continues, {{with the}} <b>draconians</b> unable to break out. Kang and his forces begins {{to build an}} {{explosive}} fake dragon that can fly to scare the goblins, but by then is not welcomed by Maranta anymore. About this time, Kang begins to notice that his <b>draconians</b> are disappearing. Events reach a climax when the goblins attack the fort, causing Kang {{to admit that the}} females should be treated {{just like the rest of}} the males, and so, with the females, and Huzzad, enters the Bastion to search for Slith, one of the missing <b>draconians.</b> He finds out that Maranta has the Heart of Dracart, a magical orb that duplicates <b>draconians</b> by splitting the draconian's soul into hundreds of parts, or hundred of [...] "new" [...] <b>draconians.</b> Discovering that Maranta intends to do this to Slith, he and the females manage to kill Maranta. They attempt to leave the Bastion, but Maranta's personal guards attempts to stop them, with a crossbowman managing to fatally wound Huzzad. The females then become berserker-like by the death of their friend and kill almost all of the guards. Then, after finally exiting the bastion, they find that the goblins have breached the fort. Kang gives the command to release the fake dragon, and Thesik casts an illusion on the dragon to look like a real gold dragon. The dragon flies over the wall, but Kang realizes that the fuse for the explosives have gone out. He crushes the Heart of Dracart in his hand, mangling his hand, but gaining enough magical power to cast a fireball, which causes the dragon to explode, destroying part of the goblin army and the hobgoblin general.|$|R
5|$|John of Palisna, Prior of Vrana, rose up in open {{rebellion}} against the rule of Mary and her mother {{in the spring of}} 1383. The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia. The royal army marched to Croatia and laid siege to Vrana, forcing John of Palisna to flee to Bosnia. The defenders of Vrana surrendered to Mary, who had been present during the siege along with her mother, on 4November. To strengthen Mary's position against Charles of Naples, Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to France and opened negotiations on the marriage of Mary to the younger brother of CharlesVI of France, Louis, who had once been engaged to Mary's sister, Catherine. Mary and the queen mother only left Croatia and Slavonia early next year. Queen Elizabeth replaced Stephen Lackfi with Thomas Szentgyörgyi, who used <b>draconian</b> measures {{to put an end to}} a conspiracy against the queens in Zadar in May 1384.|$|E
5|$|Prison {{films of}} the pre-Code era often {{involved}} {{men and women who}} were unjustly incarcerated, and films set in prisons of the north tended to portray them as a bastion of solidarity against the crumbling social system of the Great Depression. Sparked by the real-life Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930, in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells, causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions inside prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a <b>draconian</b> system of discipline in the blazing outdoor heat, where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{sought help}} from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and P. R. China for funding for several projects and military advice. The failure of several GDR-led projects including the New Zanzibar Project, a 1968 urban redevelopment scheme to provide new apartments for all Zanzibaris, led to Zanzibar focussing on Chinese aid. The post-revolution Zanzibar government was accused of <b>draconian</b> controls on personal freedoms and travel and exercised nepotism in appointments to political and industrial offices, the new Tanzanian government being powerless to intervene. Dissatisfaction with the government {{came to a head}} with the assassination of Karume on 7 April 1972, which was followed by weeks of fighting between pro and anti-government forces. A multi-party system was eventually established in 1992, but Zanzibar remains dogged by allegations of corruption and vote-rigging, though the 2010 general election was seen to be a considerable improvement.|$|E

5|$|The main {{shopping}} area was Jackson Square, with about 20 shops. The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition, but this met with limited success {{due to the}} captive nature of the population, and the requirements of security, which meant that firms and goods could not freely move in and out. The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague information about {{how many people were}} in or would be in the town, and concessions were only {{for the duration of the}} war. Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a fixed fee. The Army avoided imposing <b>draconian</b> price controls, but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville. By 1945, community amenities included 6 recreation halls, 36 bowling alleys, 23 tennis courts, 18 ball parks, 12 playgrounds, a swimming pool, a 9,400-volume library, and a newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Using <b>draconian</b> drills that {{required}} officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted {{to reduce the}} incidence of malaria to zero. For the most part they were successful but in the Aitape-Wewak campaign the 6th Division suffered an epidemic of malaria despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of South East Asia Command and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation. A special section was formed from the LHQ Medical Research Unit to assist the 6th Division and certain relapsing personnel were evacuated to Cairns. The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling the dosage of atebrin. Fairley was forced to confront the fact—confirmed by research at Cairns—that an atebrin resistant strain of malaria had arisen. The ability of malaria to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself <b>draconian</b> police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E
5|$|Dragonlance {{is set on}} {{the world}} of Krynn. The {{majority}} of the novels {{take place in the}} various regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, located northeast of Ansalon. The world's major gods are the High God and his children: good Paladine, neutral Gilean, and evil Takhisis. The gods are opposed by Chaos, who seeks to destroy Krynn. Depending on the time period, the evil chromatic and the good metallic dragons are rare or plentiful. Humans are Krynn's most common humanoid race, but elves, dwarves, kender, gnomes, and minotaurs occupy the world as well. Clerics derive magical powers from their gods, and wizards derive their power from the three moon gods, Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari. Hickman had previously served as a Mormon missionary in Java for two years, and uses Indonesian in Dragonlance spells. During Krynn's various wars, armies of <b>draconians</b> are used as troops. <b>Draconians</b> are created by corrupting a dragon egg, thereby creating a reptilian humanoid. The eggs of good dragons create evil <b>draconians,</b> and vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{on a hill}} a short {{distance}} away, the guarded female <b>draconians</b> notice that Kang's force is retreating, and becoming suspicious, they question the male <b>draconians</b> that are guarding them; however, they only learn that [...] "The...uh...commander does that sometimes. Marches...er...backward. Good for...discipline." [...] Obviously realizing {{that they are being}} given an excuse, Fonrar sends in a sivak, Shanra, disguised as a male to discover the truth, since the female sivaks had an ability to blend in with their surroundings.Later, after Shanra returns, Fonrar and Thesik learn that the bozaks saw flashes of light in a nearby canyon. Knowing that the males wouldn't believe them, Fonrar and Thesik set out to learn more. After getting closer to the light, Fonrar accidentally trips, which causes the mysterious shapes that caused the light to question them. They are faced with answering, or getting attacked within five seconds, and so, Thesik and Fonrar jump onto a boulder to announce their presence. The moonlight shines off of Thesik's scales, revealing her as an aurak to the <b>draconians</b> that were the mysterious shapes.|$|R
