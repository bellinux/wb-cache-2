40|$|Glacier {{advances}} and rock-glacier activity are reconstructed for the Late-Glacial and Holocene periods in the Colle del Sabbione-Colle del Vei del Boue area (French-Italian Alps). Detailed geomorphological mapping and pollen analysis of radiocarbon-dated sediment cores reveal three pre-Little Ice Age <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> (S 1, S 2, and S 3) and two rock-glacier generations (R 1, R 2). Former Equilibrium Line Altitudes (ELA) were obtained using the Balance Ratio method. Micro- and macro-scale features of glacial erosion {{were used to}} reconstruct the paleoshape of glaciers and their movement directions. The ELAs of the Vei del Boue and Sabbione glaciers were located respectively 500, 300, and 200 m below Present (about 2800 m a. s. l.). Rock glacier generations are correlated with <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> {{on the basis of}} their spatial relationships with end moraines. The three <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> are related to global climatic oscillations: Oldest Dryas, Younger Dryas, and late Subboreal. During the Younger Dryas, glacier fronts were located at about 2400 m, with the mean ELA at about 2500 m and the Lower Discontinuous Permafrost Boundary (LDPB) at 2300 - 2400 m. During the Hypsithermal the Vei del Boue and Sabbione glaciers were probably strongly reduced and divided into minor bodies. Timberline rose and Abies likely reached altitudes of 2000 m. Evidence for a pre-LIA maximum Holocene glacial advance is dated to the late Subboreal on the basis of regional vegetation history. A quantitative reconstruction of temperature and precipitation was calculated for the S 2 and S 3 phases using past ELA and LDPB. During these phases, a depression compared to present of about 4 °C and 1. 8 °C of mean annual air temperature was obtained, with correspondent 50 % and 23 % reduction of mean annual precipitations. Permafrost today still characterizes the Subboreal rock glaciers and the flow units above 2600 m of the Lateglacial rock glacier...|$|R

40|$|Glacial {{features}} were described {{for the first}} time on the Galicia Mountains, a mountain range separating the lakes of Ohrid and Prespa in Macedonia. The geomorphological mapping of part of this range allowed to document the existence of frontal and lateral moraines, as well as trimlines, cirques and polished rocks. These glacial features allowed the reconstruction of the original topography of the glaciers that deposited the frontal moraines. The Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) of three different phases of expansion was calculated (ca. 1850 m, ca. 2000 m and 2130 m a. s. l.) through the Area-Altitude Balance Ratio (AABR) method, and correlated with the values available for the Balkan region and northern Greece. An attribution to Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Lateglacial (Oldest and Younger Dryas) was argued for the <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> of Galicica Mountains, in agreement with the ELAs of dated moraines in the region, as well as in the Apennines and Maritime Alps. Through the extrapolation of summer temperatures at the ELAs for the single <b>glacial</b> <b>phases,</b> the amount of precipitation needed to sustain the glaciers existence was calculated (3500 - 3700 mm of weq) using a well established polynomial regression. The attribution to the LGM of the lowermost frontal moraine points out to an older age for the till found well below the examined area, near the Prespa Lake shore.

The reconstruction of global terrace sequences has enabled {{the identification of}} numerous external and internal forcing mechanisms which operate within the Quaternary landscape system. The relative effects of these forcing mechanisms are highly variable over a range of spatial and temporal scales. In this research, a combined study approach is adopted in order to ascertain the significance of external (e. g. tectonics, climate) and/or internal (e. g. lithological thresholds) forcing mechanisms upon patterns of Quaternary landscape development within the Tabernas Basin, SE Spain. The results of extensive field investigation have developed a four-tiered landform stratigraphy (i. e. basin wide terrace levels) for the Tabernas Basin. Chronological constraints for the Quaternary stratigraphy were obtained from Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating. Age estimations develop a pattern of climatically driven terrace aggradations during <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> throughout the Middle to Late Pleistocene. This pattern fits well with regional models of enhanced terrace formation during <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> after the Middle Pleistocene. The Quaternary stratigraphy of the Tabernas Basin was investigated by methods of geospatial interpolation and numerical modelling. The results of conceptual and quantitative modelling approaches highlight the dominance of non-uniform rates of base-level change driven by variable rates of tectonic uplift throughout the Mid-Late Pleistocene. Enhanced uplift in {{the west of the}} basin associates well with regional patterns, with tectonically driven base-level changes focused in the eastern Alpujarran Corridor.

The recent availability of continuous three-dimensional seismic data between the coasts of Britain and the Netherlands provides the opportunity to establish a new seismic interpretation workflow adapted to the intracratonic glaciogenic successions. By analysing the geomorphology of the buried basal glaciogenic unconformity, four distinct major ice fronts are identified and correlated onshore. The ice fronts provide robust relative timelines, and the analysis of tunnel-valley orientations and their merging points indicates that the number of <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> has been underestimated. By comparing the erosion capacities of sand and chalk substrates, it is suggested that mechanical abrasion processes are also involved during tunnel-valley genesis.

The successions studied in this formation consist mainly of non-marine to glacial-marine mudstones and sandy mudstones. The palynological assemblages yielded by 32 samples collected from two outcrops and thirty borehole samples demonstrate that not significant floral changes took place through the considered stratigraphic range. The correlation of these assemblages with biostratigraphic palynozones, proposed previously for the Paraná/ Chacoparaná Basin of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay point to their Early Permian age. The most widespread spore genera in these assemblages are Punctatisporites, Lundbladispora, Vallatisporites and Granulatisporites. Among pollen grains, Caheniasaccites, Vittatina, Potonieisporites, Protohaploxypinus and Plicatipollenites are the most representative. Palynomorphs assigned to Chlorophyta, Prasinophyta, and acritarchs indicate the development of brackish to fresh water lacustrine environments. The results from the facies and palynological analyses suggest that these deposits were formed during interglacial or postglacial warmer climatic episodes. This fact would agree well with the proposal that Gondwana glaciations were characterized by discrete <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> (with multiple <b>glacial</b> lobe advance-retreat <b>phases)</b> alternating with warmer climatic episodes. These episodes could be recognized thanks to sub-glacial and melt water related continental deposits that would bear characteristic palynological assemblages, like the recorded in the Cerro Pelado Fm. successions...|$|R
40|$|We have {{observed}} {{what appears to}} be a first-order phase change from deeply supercooled liquid triphenyl phosphite at 1 atm to a rigid, “apparently ” amorphous phase which we denote as the “glacial phase”. This is a new, crisper, and rather different addition to the examples of polyamorphism that have recently been studied. In order to “deeply ” supercool the liquid, it must be quick-quenched to a low temperature: if heated slowly, but immediately, it crystallizes; if allowed to stand for several hours at low temperature, it transforms to the glacial phase; and if subsequently heated it, too, crystallizes, but at a higher temperature than that for liquid crystallization. The <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> can be clearly distinguished from both the normal crystal and the ordinary glass.

40|$|We {{measure the}} {{dielectric}} susceptibility 2 ̆ 6 egr;(ν) of supercooled liquid glycerol and map {{it out as}} a function of pressure, temperature and volume. We build a high pressure cell made of beryllium copper to exert high pressure (up to 900 MPa) on glycerol at low temperature (near glass transition temperature). The frequency range is from 0. 01 Hz to 100 kHz. We also measure the susceptibility of triphenyl phosphite, TPP, to study its polyamorphic phases. ^ We find that the glass transition temperature, the fragility, and the width of the dielectric loss spectrum of glycerol increase with pressure. We introduce the notion of the generalized fragility to separate the effects due to volume and temperature on the glass transition and conclude that both volume and temperature are comparably important for glycerol. We point out a connection between the generalized fragility and a recently discovered volume-temperature scaling exponent and find that our conclusion holds for many glass formers. The relation between the traditional fragility and the width is compatible with a correlation found between these quantities at 1 atmosphere. The width, too, changes more quickly {{as a function of}} fractional changes in volume than the corresponding change in temperature. We verify the Nernst-Einstein relation between the ionic conductivity and the relaxation frequency at various pressures and find that the effective hydrodynamic radius in this relation decreases with density. ^ We have measured 2 ̆ 6 egr;(ν) of TPP from 0. 01 Hz to 10 kHz. The <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> of TPP has a longer relaxation time, wider loss spectrum, and lower dielectric constant compared to the supercooled liquid.

We have also videotaped, in real time, the phase transformation from the supercooled phase to the glacial.

40|$|The Torngat Mountains of {{northern}} Labrador portray a complex history of {{regional and local}} ice movements during the Wisconsinan. Research undertaken in outer Nachvak Fiord, central Torngat Mountains, provides {{the basis for a}} morphostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic framework. The application of relative and absolute dating techniques allows reconstruction of a tentative glacial and relative sea level chronology for the area. [...] The Nachvak <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> represents the last regional ice advance into the outer Nachvak Fiord area. During this event, tributary valleys were backfilled by fiord ice as far east as the fiord threshold, whereas south of the fiord, ice terminated at the western end of Adams Lake. This ice advance is distinguished from previous glacial events {{on the basis of its}} drift properties. The earlier Adams Lake <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> is considered to be local m origin. The eastern limit of this advance, as defined by the maximum extent of local lithological and geochemical drift characteristics, was Valley of the Flies terminal moraine. The MI <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> represents an extensive, older regional ice advance and is characterized by the upper limit of till and moraine in the study area. [...] Acoustic stratigraphy of Nachvak Fiord and Adams Lake sediments supplements the terrestrial glacial geology of the region. Acoustic units are interpreted as representing sedimentary facies related to one or more glacial - deglacial cycles, in both the fiord and lake basins. Tentative models of deposition require a grounded to partially-grounded outlet glacier m the fiord during the last regional ice advance, and a significant ice margin at the western end of Adams Lake. [...] Analysis of raised marine evidence reveals eleven shorelines, ranging in elevation from 9 m to 73 m above present sea level. The extent and geometry of the shorelines are the bases of a model of relative sea level change during deglaciation from the Nachvak phase maximum. This permits the identification of the Shoal Water Cove and Tessersoak glacial readvances, and the Kogarsok and Townley Head glacial still-stands which appear consistent w 1 th the morphological evidence of moraines in the region. Locations of major loading centers which affected the Nachvak Fiord region, are based on the assumption of synchronous shoreline formation in the outer fiord area. Radiocarbon-dated shells from sediments associated with a raised marine shoreline suggest that approximately 30 m of emergence has occurred since 9 ka BP. [...] A tentative chronology of glacial events is reconstructed from radiocarbon dates, amino acid ratios, and soil development rates. The Nachvak glacial maximum is tentatively dated at 22 ± 2 ka BP. It is estimated that the Adams Lake <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> occurred during the period 29 - 50 ka BP. The MI <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> is tentatively dated at ≥ 75 ka BP, based on comparisons with similar regional ice advances on Baffin Island. [...] Correlations with local chronologies from northern Labrador are proposed, and critically examined in the context of previous models of glaciation. The Early Wisconsinan in northern Labrador was likely characterized by an extensive advance of Laurentide ice which may have extended onto the Labrador Shelf. The Middle Wisconsinan is suggested to have been a period of local cirque glacier expansion, with associated high relative sea levels. The extent of Late Wisconsinan ice may have been topographically controlled in northern Labrador. In the Nachvak Fiord region ice was restricted to the fiord basin, whereas in areas north and south of the Torngat Mountains the ice advance may have been more extensive than during the Early Wisconsinan. The deglacial chronology proposed for Nachvak Fiord suggests that a stepwise recession of Laurentide ice characterized the late-glacial period...|$|E
50|$|Ice ages {{are driven}} by changes in Mars's orbit and tilt, which can be {{compared}} to terrestrial Milankovich cycles. Orbital calculations show that Mars wobbles on its axis far more than Earth does. The Earth is stabilized by its proportionally large moon, so it only wobbles a few degrees. Mars may change its tilt—also known as its obliquity—by many tens of degrees. When this obliquity is high, its poles get much more direct sunlight and heat; this causes the ice caps to warm and become smaller as ice sublimes. Adding to the variability of the climate, the eccentricity of the orbit of Mars changes twice as much as Earth's eccentricity. As the poles sublime, the ice is redeposited closer to the equator, which receive somewhat less solar insolation at these high obliquities. Computer simulations have shown that a 45° tilt of the Martian axis would result in ice accumulation in areas that display glacial landforms. A 2008 study provided evidence for multiple <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> during Late Amazonian glaciation at the dichotomy boundary on Mars.|$|R

The existence of widespread waterlain sediments which {{are thought to have}} been deposited in a cold ice-free period of Middle/Early Weichselian age, the Gudbarndsdalen Interstadial, gives evidence of surprisingly modest ice erosion during the last ice age, even in valleys close to the highest mountains. Judging by the nearly total evacuation of older deposits fro the tributaries, the ice-free period seems to have lasted for a long time, with very strong slope processes. Huge quantities of proglacial sandur sediments accumulated in the main valleys indicate that the last inland ice sheet grew slowly. By comprehensive analyses the authors have succeeded in correlating the overlying tills with four regional <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> of the last ice age reconstructed mainly through analyses of striae. It is found that the conservation of the sediments, as well as the distribution of different tills, was dependent on the relative location of the ice divide...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Some decades ago, biogeographers {{distinguished}} {{three major}} faunal types of high importance for Europe: (i) Mediterranean elements with exclusive glacial {{survival in the}} Mediterranean refugia, (ii) Siberian elements with glacial refugia in the eastern Palearctic and only postglacial expansion to Europe and (iii) arctic and/or alpine elements with large zonal distributions in the periglacial areas and postglacial retreat to the North and/or into the high mountain systems. Genetic analyses have unravelled numerous additional refugia both of continental and Mediterranean species, thus strongly modifying the biogeographical view of Europe. This modified notion is particularly true for the so-called Siberian species, which in many cases have not immigrated into Europe during the postglacial period, but most likely have survived the last, or even several <b>glacial</b> <b>phases,</b> in extra-Mediterranean refugia in some climatically favourable but geographically limited areas of southern Central and Eastern Europe.

40|$|The stratigraphic {{record of}} the Asbestos-Valcourt region {{indicates}} that glacial sediment deposite during at least two regional glacial advances underlie Late Wisconsinan ice-contact and glaciolacustrine sediments. Glaciolacustrine sediments (unit B), which underlie surface till (drift unit C), were deposited during a rather short-lived interstade, prior to the Late Wisconsinan glacial maximum; unit B is a probable correlative of the Gayhurst Formation (Middle Wisconsinan).;Till deposited in the Appalachian Uplands during the earlier glacial advance (drift unit A) contains only rare Shield-type erratics and has a distinctive Appalachian provenance. Till geochemistry as well as till clast lithology and fabrics indicate that drift unit A was deposited by a glacier that was advancing westward from Appalachian outflow centers. However, the presence of some northwest-derived clasts in till of drift unit A provides evidence for an earlier phase of southeastward ice-flow. Ice-flow sequences recorded in drift unit A suggest that a shift of outflow centers with an Appalachian-based glacier took place toward the close of <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> A; it is during this part of <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> A that a northward ice-flow episode occurred in uplands of the Asbestos region. This glacial unit {{is believed to be}} a correlative of Chaudiere Till (Early to Middle Wisconsinan).;Till deposited during the last regional ice advance (drift unit C) commonly contains Precambrian erratics as well as abundant northwest derived local debris.

Pedogenesis was mostly driven by the time and climate factors. In the proximal fan location, pedogenesis was initially influenced by a warm subtropical-tropical climate of the Late Pliocene and subsequently by warm and humid interglacial phases of the Pleistocene. These phases were also responsible for soil formation in the middle fan. In the distal reaches of the fan, pedogenesis was driven by the different climatic pulses of the Late Pleistocene Tyrrhenian interglacial (MIS 5).

These data are in good agreement with pollen records from northwest Europe and with d 18 O curves from Mediterranean and Atlantic deep-sea cores. Quantitative palaeoclimatic reconstructions from Pliocene pollen data of the Mediterranean region cannot be based on conventional modern analogue techniques, as individual Pliocene pollen spectra contain taxa representing temperate, warm-temperate and subtropical plants that do not grow together today. Instead, we propose a new method that uses a climatic amplitude method modified to take partially into account the relative abundances of the taxa. We applied this method to the Pliocene Garraf 1 palynological sequence from Catalonia, which provides a long continuous record of climatic change from 5. 3 Ma to the Early Pleistocene. We estimate that annual temperatures were 1 to 5 ºC higher than today and the annual precipitation 400 to 1000 mm higher than today prior {{to the beginning of}} the late Cenozoic glacial–interglacial cycles.

By contrast to expectations, we found that genetic variation increased with elevation. Estimates of recent migration rates and a contrasting pattern of genetic differentiation observed at the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and nuclear microsatellites support the hypothesis that higher genetic diversity at high elevation results from contemporary gene flow. Although historical recolonization processes can have marked effects on the genetic structure of populations, the present study provides an example where contemporary processes along an environmental gradient can reverse predicted patterns of genetic variation...|$|R

The Cape Verde fauna immigrated from the Carribean, presumably by way of a compressed subtropical gyre during a mid Pleistocene <b>glacial</b> <b>phase.</b> The fauna was found in a beach terrace, formerly considered Tertiary, on the island of São Tiago. A lava flow directly above this deposit was radiometrically dated 700. 000 ± 200. 000 years B. P...|$|E
30|$|As in Wang et al. (2008, 2009), the ice {{deglaciation}} {{history is}} taken to be Peltier’s (1994) ICE- 4 G model. During the <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> from 108 ka BP to 18 ka BP (the last glacial maximum or LGM), ice thickness is assumed to increase linearly at every ice location. However, during the deglaciation phase, the ice load disappearance is dependent on both location and time. According to the ICE- 4 G model, this time is around 10 kyr BP for Fennoscandia and {{to the south of}} Hudson Bay, and 6 kyr for Antarctica. The step-size of the deglaciation phase is 1 kyr, and this starts from LGM to 6 kyr BP, when Pleistocene deglaciation virtually stopped.|$|E
40|$|The {{timing and}} number of prehistoric migrations {{involved}} in the settlement of the American continent is subject to intense debate. Here, we reanalyze Native American control region mtDNA data and demonstrate that only an appropriate phylogenetic analysis accompanied by an appreciation of demographic factors allows us to discern different migrations and to estimate their ages. Reappraising 574 mtDNA control region sequences from aboriginal Siberians and Native Americans, we confirm in agreement with linguistic, archaeological and climatic evidence that (i) the major wave of migration brought one population, ancestral to the Amerinds, from northeastern Siberia to America 20, 000 - 25, 000 years ago and (ii) a rapid expansion of a Beringian source population {{took place at the}} end of the Younger Dryas <b>glacial</b> <b>phase</b> approximately 11, 300 years ago, ancestral to present Eskimo and Na-Dene populations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a combined geomorphological, sedimentological and geochronological investigation into the glacial history of the Clearwater Basin, Mid Canterbury, New Zealand. The study demonstrates that a thick wedge of glacial and paraglacial sediments are preserved in the valley. These are > 100 m thick and preserve evidence of at least 3 <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> (> 180 ka). The study presents a new and detailed geomorphology map for the Clearwater valley and adjacent areas and has added 17 new recessional positions to the local glacial record. Surface Exposure Dating (SED) has been used to directly date the moraines of the Clearwater Basin providing the first detailed chronology for glacial moraine in this area. In total 31 cosmogenic ages from 9 separate moraines are presented. The results demonstrate that the LGM advance is the Trinity moraine of Mabin (1980) and not the Hakatere moraine as previously assumed and that the LGM was achieved at or about 23 ka. The Clearwater glacier receded up valley between 23 and 13 ka with some indication of accelerated retreat after c. 16 ka. The correlation to the adjacent Lake Heron Valley is also revised...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBiomes {{and climate}} reconstructions {{are based on}} {{variations}} of the pollen content of the sediments. Pollen analysis was conducted on sediment deposits sampled at Chantemerle site (Vienne department, France). The pollen diagram covered only the last 7200 years BP. Consequently, additional pollen sequences, derived from the European Pollen Database, {{have been used to}} provide a first climate and biome reconstruction on a longer period, from the Riss (ca 140 ka BP) to the present-day. These pollen sequences show that the succession of the biomes and of the climate has been similar throughout a large part of France since about 140 000 years BP. However it is noteworthy that near the Atlantic coast, a warmer biome is recorded during the temperate periods: the warm mixed biome. This homogeneity allows us to extrapolate the results obtained from all these sequences to the Vienne region. The climate was warmer and more humid than today, or equivalent, during the Eemian, Saint-Germain I and Saint-Germain II. These periods were characterised by temperate deciduous or mixed forests with warmer episodes of warm mixed forests. On the other hand, climate was colder and dryer than today during the <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> (Melisey I, Melisey II, Würm, Late Glacial) which were characterised by cold steppes andror tundra...|$|R
40|$|The Chile Trench of the {{convergent}} {{continental margin}} of Central Chile is a sediment-filled basin that stretches over 1500 ?km in a north–south direction. The sediment fill reflects latitudinal variations in climate {{as well as}} in the morphology and geology of Chile, but also of sediment transport processes to the trench and within the trench. We try to untangle these signals by calculating the total volume and the latitudinal volume distribution of trench sediments and by relating this distribution to a number of factors that affect this pattern. The volume calculation is based on a model geometry of the top of the subducting oceanic plate that is buried beneath trench sediments and the sea floor as measured by swath bathymetry. We obtain the model geometry of the subducting plate by interpolating between depth-converted seismic reflection profiles that cross the trench. The total volume of the trench fill between 32 and 46 °S is calculated to be 46000 ?±? 500 ?km 3. The resulting latitudinal volume distribution is best explained by a sedimentation model that alternates between (1) <b>glacial</b> <b>phases</b> of high sediment flux from Southern Chile combined with active latitudinal sediment transport within the trench and (2) interglacial phases over which sediment input is dominated by local factors...|$|R
