5|$|In <b>dressage,</b> the Finnhorse is able {{to compete}} with warmbloods up to {{national}} levels, and in lower levels it has the upper hand because it can easily perform the required movements, and has smoother gaits that allow for ease of riding. In 2010, a Finnhorse medaled in international paraequestrian <b>dressage</b> competition. In higher level <b>dressage,</b> the breed however it is hindered by its less-flashy movement, restricted by a somewhat upright shoulder. Despite this there are successful <b>dressage</b> horses, {{and a number of}} Finnhorses even earn their keep with their <b>dressage</b> winnings, a notable achievement as competing in Finland is expensive and prize money low. Most Finnhorses used in <b>dressage</b> compete at the national 4th level (US) or Grade IV (GB), though some individuals have competed at the Prix de St. Georges level.|$|E
5|$|Although the Thoroughbred is {{primarily}} bred for racing, the breed {{is also used}} for show jumping and combined training because of its athleticism, and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses, <b>dressage</b> horses, and youth show horses. The larger horses are sought after for hunter/jumper and <b>dressage</b> competitions, whereas the smaller horses are in demand as polo ponies.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed for show jumping and three-day eventing. Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (<b>dressage,</b> three-day eventing and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In <b>dressage,</b> the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the <b>dressage</b> system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show jumping and <b>dressage.</b> In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in <b>dressage,</b> beaten by many of the more popular <b>dressage</b> breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E
5|$|Ulla Salzgeber (born 5 August 1958 in Oberhausen) is a German equestrian and Olympic {{champion}} who competes in {{the sport}} of <b>dressage.</b> Competing in the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics, she won two team gold medals, one individual silver and one individual bronze. She also won numerous medals at the World Equestrian Games, <b>Dressage</b> World Cup and European <b>Dressage</b> Championships. After the retirement of her Olympic horse, Rusty, after the 2004 Games, and unexpected death of her second international-level mount in 2005, Salzgeber struggled {{to find a new}} Grand Prix-level horse.|$|E
5|$|Following Ravel's retirement, Legolas became Peter's main {{competition}} horse. The pair went on {{to compete}} at the 2014 World Equestrian Games in Normandy, France. Peters placed 10th in both of the individual events and 4th in the team <b>dressage</b> competition. At the beginning of 2015, he participated at the <b>Dressage</b> World Cup finals in Las Vegas. Peters was however eliminated because of a blood on Legolas' side. Later that year he participated at the 2015 Pan Am Games, where he successfully defended both of his gold medals from 2011.|$|E
5|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of their history, Andalusians have been used for both riding and driving. Among the first horses used for classical <b>dressage,</b> they are still making a mark in international competition in <b>dressage</b> today. At the 2002 World Equestrian Games, two Andalusians were on the bronze-medal winning Spanish <b>dressage</b> team, a team that went on to take the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Today, the breed is increasingly being selectively bred for increased aptitude in classical <b>dressage.</b> Historically, however, they were also used as stock horses, especially suited to working with Iberian bulls, known for their aggressive temperaments. They were, and still are, known for their use in mounted bull fighting. Mares were traditionally used for la trilla, the Spanish process of threshing grain practiced until the 1960s. Mares, some pregnant or with foals at their side, spent full days trotting over the grain. As well as being a traditional farming practice, it also served as a test of endurance, hardiness and willingness for the maternal Andalusian lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Rembrandt and Uphoff {{began to}} compete at events for young riders, and in 1986, the pair began working with Uwe Schulten-Baumer, a {{well-known}} <b>dressage</b> coach. In 1987, the pair began to compete, and win, at the international level. They rose {{to the top of}} the <b>dressage</b> world with unheard-of speed, due to Rembrandt's elegance and expression in the ring. Their rise to fame resulted in a 1988 Olympic nomination. Uphoff switched trainers four months before the Games began, leaving Schulten-Baumer to work with Harry Boldt, the German national coach.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Dover {{defeated}} Reiner Klimke, a six-time Olympic gold medalist, at the German Aachen Grand Prix freestyle competition. In doing so, {{he became}} the first American in 27 years to win that event. In 1994 he was named the US Olympic Male Equestrian Athlete of the Year, and in 1995 awarded the Whitney Stone Cup, given by the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) for excellence in international competition. Dover has been named the USEF <b>Dressage</b> Champion five times, and ridden seven times in the FEI World Cup Final. In 1994, Dover rode with the United States <b>dressage</b> team at the World Equestrian Games, winning a team bronze. He was also amassed more than 100 Grand Prix victories. Overall, Dover has won more honors in <b>dressage</b> than any other rider from the United States. In 2009, Dover announced his retirement from competitive riding, instead choosing to focus on teaching and philanthropy.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Bonfire {{made his}} European <b>Dressage</b> Championship debut at Donaueschingen, Germany, {{where he and}} Van Grunsven took an {{individual}} 5th, while assisting the Dutch team to a bronze medal. At the 1995 Championships in Mondorf, Luxembourg, the pair took the silver medal both individually and with the Dutch team. At the 1999 Championships at Arnhem, the Netherlands Bonfire and Van Grunsven took the title – gold in the individual – as well as assisting the Dutch team to another silver medal. He was also a nine-time national <b>dressage</b> champion in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, van Grunsven {{sustained}} a fracture of a bone in her upper leg {{in a fall}} from a horse in training, and required surgery. A metal plate was embedded in her leg to immobilize the bone during the healing process, and van Grunsven recovered, winning the 2003 Dutch <b>Dressage</b> Championships in June. In September, she underwent a second surgery to have the plate removed. In 2004, {{she became the first}} Dutch rider to win the CHIO Aachen <b>dressage</b> competition, a top international competition.|$|E
5|$|Rembrandt (15 March 1977 – 30 October 2001) {{was a dark}} bay Westphalian gelding ridden for Germany by Nicole Uphoff in <b>dressage</b> competitions. Together, {{the pair}} won four Olympic gold medals, three gold and one silver World Equestrian Games medals, and {{numerous}} other international championships. Although known as a sensitive horse prone to spookiness, Rembrandt's elegance and expression in the ring allowed him {{to become one of}} the top horses in the sport of <b>dressage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Andalusian {{is closely}} related to the Lusitano of Portugal, and has been used to develop many other breeds, {{especially}} in Europe and the Americas. Breeds with Andalusian ancestry include many of the warmbloods in Europe as well as western hemisphere breeds such as the Azteca. Over its centuries of development, the Andalusian breed has been selected for athleticism and stamina. The horses were originally used for classical <b>dressage,</b> driving, bullfighting, and as stock horses. Modern Andalusians are used for many equestrian activities, including <b>dressage,</b> show jumping and driving. The breed is also used extensively in movies, especially historical pictures and fantasy epics.|$|E
5|$|The only equestrian events {{held in the}} Paralympic Games are in the <b>Dressage</b> discipline. Five American riders competed, in both {{individual}} and team events.|$|E
5|$|Van Grunsven {{holds the}} record for winning the most Olympic medals by an equestrian, with nine medals, {{and is the only}} person to have won any equestrian event in three {{successive}} Olympics. She is also the only person to compete at seven successive Olympics in <b>dressage.</b> She has competed in every Olympic Games between 1988 and 2012, winning a total of three gold medals, five silvers and one bronze. At the 1988 Summer Olympics, riding Prisco, she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds of the individual <b>dressage,</b> and was the lowest-scoring member of the fifth-place Dutch team, meaning her score was not used to determine the team's standing. At the 1992 Summer Olympics, her performance improved, and riding Bonfire she took fourth individually and won her first silver medal in the team competition. At the 1996 Games, again riding Bonfire, she won double silver in the individual and team <b>dressage</b> competitions.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{of the top}} 25leading sires {{of winning}} Arabian <b>dressage</b> horses since 1960, Desperado V was ranked number2 (following Khemosabi), Bey Shah was number4, Huckleberry Bey was tied for fifth, and Barbary was also on the list, in {{addition}} to five other grandsons of Bay El Bey.|$|E
5|$|In late 2009, Dover was {{selected}} as a Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian <b>dressage</b> team, with a contract that extended through the 2010 World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky. After the Games, {{it was announced that}} Dover and the Canadian team {{had not been able to}} agree on contract renewal terms, but in late 2010 it was announced that Dover would remain as the interim trainer for the first quarter of 2011. In March 2011, German equestrian Markus Gribbe was hired, and Dover's term as a Canadian coach came to an end. Dover is known for his coaching abilities, with some of the best <b>dressage</b> riders with top international titles to their credit coming from his stables. During his time as a trainer for Canada, he was no longer be eligible to train top riders with the USEF. In April 2013, Dover was named Technical Advisor/Chef d'Equipe of the US national <b>dressage</b> team. He is expected to remain in the position through the 2016 Summer Olympics. Dover is currently a rider and trainer at Stillpoint Farm in Florida.|$|E
5|$|Lusitanos {{can be any}} solid color, {{although}} they are generally gray, bay or chestnut. Horses of the Alter Real strain are always bay. Members of the breed are of Baroque type, with convex facial profiles, heavy muscling, intelligent and willing natures, with agile and elevated movement. Originally bred for war, <b>dressage</b> and bullfighting, Lusitanos are still used today in the latter two. They have competed in several Olympics and World Equestrian Games {{as part of the}} Portuguese and Spanish <b>dressage</b> teams. They have also made a showing in driving competitions, with a Belgian team of Lusitanos winning multiple international titles. Members of the breed are still used in bloodless bullfighting today, where it is expected that neither horse or bull will be injured.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{was born}} in Washington, D.C. His English-born mother, Sally O'Connor, was a <b>dressage</b> rider, judge and author. David began riding at a young age, and as a child participated in a cross-US horseback ride {{with his mother and}} brother, {{covering}} 3,000 miles over several months.|$|E

5|$|Arabians are {{versatile}} {{horses that}} compete in many equestrian fields, including horse racing, the horse show disciplines of saddle seat, Western pleasure, and hunt seat, {{as well as}} <b>dressage,</b> cutting, reining, endurance riding, show jumping, eventing, youth events such as equitation, and others. They are used as pleasure riding, trail riding, and working ranch horses {{for those who are}} not interested in competition.|$|E
5|$|Because of the breeds {{that make}} up the Azteca, they are known for their athleticism. They have been seen in {{competition}} in western riding events such as reining, cutting, team penning and roping, as well as English riding events such as <b>dressage</b> and other events such as polo and bullfighting. They are also used for pleasure riding.|$|E
5|$|Born 5 August 1958 in Oberhausen as Ulla Helbing, Salzgeber began riding at age 10, {{competing}} in the sport of vaulting. In 1977, at age 19, she was the Young Riders European Championships. She attended college, graduating from law school before building a training stable in Bad Worishofen, Germany, that focuses on <b>dressage.</b> Salzgeber is married to Sebastian Salzgeber, and has one daughter, Kim.|$|E
5|$|Haflingers {{have many}} uses {{including}} light draft, harness work and various under-saddle disciplines such as endurance riding, <b>dressage,</b> equestrian vaulting and therapeutic riding. They are also still {{used by the}} Austrian and German armies for work in rough terrain. The World Haflinger Federation (WHF), the international governing body that controls breed standards for the Haflinger, {{is made up of}} a confederation of 22nationalregistries, and helps set breeding objectives, guidelines and rules for its member organizations.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Salzgeber {{was named}} {{as the new}} <b>dressage</b> {{training}} adviser to the Australian national equestrian team. In the role, Salzgeber held training camps, approved team members' training programs and helped choose team members for international competitions. In late 2006, she resigned, citing a mix of training duties at home in Europe and disagreements with the Equestrian Federation of Australia. Under her tenure, however, the Australian team made their best-ever placing at the 2006 World Equestrian Games, finishing 9th.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her Olympic and World Equestrian Games successes, van Grunsven holds {{the record for the}} most wins at the <b>Dressage</b> World Cup, winning the event nine times between 1995 and 2008. She has also competed numerous times at the European <b>Dressage</b> Championships, winning seven individual medals and eight team medals between 1991 and 2009. Although van Grunsven has ridden many horses over her career, she won the majority of her top events on two horses: Bonfire and Salinero. Bonfire, upon whom she had many of her early successes, was retired in 2002. Salinero quickly took over as van Grunsven's top horse, and remained in that position until his retirement in 2013, after making a major comeback to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games. Van Grunsven has been closely linked with the controversial training method rollkur, although she has moved to distance herself from the practice after it was banned from international competition.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005, Salzgeber's then-current Grand Prix mount, Wall Street, was euthanized {{following}} {{an episode of}} colic. This, combined with the recent retirement of Rusty, left her with no Grand Prix-level horses. Wall Street, while a relatively successful <b>dressage</b> horse, had suffered health problems and {{had never been able}} to compete with Rusty as Salzgeber's top horse. In 2008, Salzgeber again began competing at the Grand Prix level on Herzruf's Erbe, who would develop into one of her top international horses. In that year, the pair won the Otto Lorke Prize, given each year to the best German Grand Prix horse under 10 years old. During 2008, Salzgeber and Herzruf's Erbe had won 10 Grand Prix competitions. In 2009, the pair were expected to compete at the European <b>Dressage</b> Championships, but were not chosen for the German team after Herzruf's Erbe sustained an injury at a competition in July. The immediate diagnosis was a severely pulled tendon, although a later diagnosis was that the horse had strained a suspensory muscle, expected to heal in about three months. By early 2010, the horse was again able to be ridden, but was still not in top condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} Mérens horses {{were used for}} farm work, {{particularly}} on steep or difficult terrain, as packhorses and for draft work in mining or hauling timber or sledges. Today, following breeding selection towards a slightly taller and livelier type, they are used principally as saddle horses, especially for trekking in mountainous areas; but have also proved successful in carriage driving. Some {{have been used for}} vaulting, <b>dressage,</b> show jumping and three-day eventing.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 2012, Tan won Singapore's first {{medal at}} the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, a bronze in the <b>dressage</b> Individual Championship Test (class Ia). She {{followed}} this up with a silver medal in the Individual Freestyle Test (class Ia) on 4 September. For her achievements, Tan was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) by the President in November 2012.|$|E
5|$|Outside of breed-specific shows, the Saddlebred is also {{promoted}} as suitable for competitive trail riding, endurance riding, <b>dressage,</b> combined driving, eventing, and show jumping. Some Saddlebreds are also suitable for fox hunting, cutting and roping. Because {{they are so}} closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition, they are sometimes mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events. They are also suitable family horses used for trail and pleasure riding and ranch work.|$|E
5|$|The Castillonnais is used {{mainly for}} {{pleasure}} riding, {{and it is}} well adapted to the mountainous terrain of the Pyrenees, which makes is useful for equestrian tourism in the area. It {{can be used for}} driving, and is sometimes seen in <b>dressage</b> competitions. Some Castillonnais are used for logging and as pack horses for taking food and equipment to mountainous areas otherwise only accessible by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The Charolais was {{appreciated}} for its gaits and endurance. It {{was known}} for its ability as a cavalry horse, and in 1933 was called a perfect war horse. It was also used for <b>dressage</b> and show jumping, {{and members of the}} breed competed in international events in these sports. It was considered to be a better galloper than the Anglo-Norman horse, another French breed.|$|E
5|$|The only equestrian events {{held in the}} Paralympic Games are in the <b>Dressage</b> discipline. Seven British riders competed, in both {{individual}} and team events, winning five gold and five silver medals. Lee Pearson won three titles for the third successive Games, and Anne Dunham, {{at the age of}} 59, won her first individual Paralympic Games gold medal, having previously won three team golds and been a five–time world champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} horse training {{methods for}} Lipizzans were {{developed at the}} Spanish Riding School and {{are based on the}} principles of classical <b>dressage,</b> which in turn traces to the Ancient Greek writer Xenophon, whose works were rediscovered in the 16th century. His thoughts on development of horses' mental attitude and psyche are still considered applicable today. Other writers who strongly influenced the training methods of the Spanish Riding School include Federico Grisone, the founder of the first riding academy in Naples, who lived during the 16th century; and Antoine de Pluvinel and François Robichon de la Guérinière, two Frenchmen from the 17th and 18th centuries. The methods for training the Lipizzan stallions at the Spanish Riding School were passed down via an oral tradition until Field Marshal Franz Holbein and Johann Meixner, Senior Rider at the School, published the initial guidelines for the training of horse and rider at the School in 1898. In the mid-20th century, Alois Podhajsky wrote a number of works that serve as textbooks for many <b>dressage</b> riders today.|$|E
