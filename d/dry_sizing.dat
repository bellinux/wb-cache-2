The functional unit used in LCA was the kilograms of <b>dry</b> <b>sizing</b> chemical required for the production of 1 kg of paper. Two paper grades were used; copy paper, where AKD and ASA are mostly applied and solid board, where ASA and Rosin are applied. The Carbon Footprint for copy paper and a distribution distance 1500 km was found to be 2, 5 kg CO 2 eqv/ton paper for AKD, 5, 1 kg CO 2 eqv/ton paper for ASA and 4, 9 kg CO 2 eqv/ton paper for Rosin. The Energy Footprint results for the same case were 62 MJ/ton paper consumed by AKD, 136 MJ/ton paper by ASA and 228 MJ/ton paper by Rosin. The Water Footprint results for copy paper and 1500 km distribution distance were 0, 1 m 3 water/ton paper consumed by AKD, 0, 3 m 3 water/ton paper by ASA and 0, 5 m 3 /ton paper by Rosin. Dominance analysis diagrams illustrated that for all three sizing chemicals raw material production is a hotspot both for the Carbon Footprint and the Energy Footprint.

The Differential Aerosol Sizing and Hygroscopicity Spectrometer Probe (DASH-SP) quantified size-resolved diameter growth factors (GF = D-p,D-wet/D-p,D-dry) that are used to infer the hygroscopicity parameter kappa. Thermokinetic simulations were conducted to estimate the impact of partial particle volatilization within the DASH-SP across a range of sampling conditions.

The hygroscopic particle diameter growth factor (Gf) was measured when taken from a dehydrated to a humidified state for particle diameters between 30 350 nm (<b>dry</b> <b>size)</b> using a Hygroscopic Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (H-TDMA). Particles of a certain <b>dry</b> <b>size</b> all showed similar diameter growth and the Gf at RH = 90 % for 110 / 100 nm particles was 1. 68 in the 1 MW boiler, and 1. 5 in the 1. 5 MW boiler.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} predict the {{physical}} properties of aerosol particles, {{it is necessary to}} adequately capture the behaviour of the ubiquitous complex organic components. One of the key properties which may affect this behaviour is the contribution of the organic components to the surface tension of aqueous particles in the moist atmosphere. Whilst the qualitative effect of organic compounds on solution surface tensions has been widely reported, our quantitative understanding on mixed organic and mixed inorganic/organic systems is limited. Furthermore, it is unclear whether models that exist in the literature can reproduce the surface tension variability for binary and higher order multi-component organic and mixed inorganic/organic systems of atmospheric significance. The current study aims to resolve both issues to some extent. Surface tensions of single and multiple solute aqueous solutions were measured and compared with predictions from a number of model treatments. On comparison with binary organic systems, two predictive models found in the literature provided a range of values resulting from sensitivity to calculations of pure component surface tensions. Results indicate that a fitted model can capture the variability of the measured data very well, producing the lowest average percentage deviation for all compounds studied. The performance of the other models varies with compound and choice of model parameters. The behaviour of ternary mixed inorganic/organic systems was unreliably captured by using a predictive scheme and this was composition dependent. For more "realistic" higher order systems, entirely predictive schemes performed poorly. It was found that use of the binary data in a relatively simple mixing rule, or modification of an existing thermodynamic model with parameters derived from binary data, was able to accurately capture the surface tension variation with concentration. Thus, it would appear that in order to model multi-component surface tensions involving compounds used in this study one requires the use of appropriate binary data. The effect of deviations between predicted and measured surface tensions on predicted cloud activation properties was quantified, by incorporating the surface tension models into an existing thermodynamic framework. Critical saturation ratios as a function of <b>dry</b> <b>size</b> for all of the multi-component systems were computed and it was found that deviations between predictions increased with decreasing particle <b>dry</b> <b>size.</b> As expected, use of the surface tension of pure water, rather than calculate the influence of the solutes explicitly, led to a consistently higher value of the critical saturation ratio indicating that neglect of the compositional effects will lead to significant differences in predicted activation behaviour even at large particle <b>dry</b> <b>sizes...</b>|$|R

The pelletization of biomass consists {{of a series of}} unit operations: <b>drying,</b> <b>size</b> reduction, densifying, cooling, screening, and warehousing. Capital and operating cost of the pelleting plant was estimated at several plant capacities. Pellet production cost for a base case plant capacity of 6 t/h was about $ 51 /t of pellets. Raw material cost was the largest cost element of the total pellet production cost followed by personnel cost, drying cost, and pelleting mill cost. An increase in raw material cost substantially increased the pellet production cost. Pellet plants with a capacity of more than 10 t/h decreased the costs to roughly $ 40 /t of pellets. Five different burner fuels – wet sawdust, dry sawdust, biomass pellets, natural gas, and coal were tested for their effect on the cost of pellet production.

Optical particle sizing {{in association with}} thermal heating extracted volatile components and resolved sizes for dust and refractory soot that usually dominated light absorption. BC was internally mixed with volatile aerosol in 85 % of accumulation mode particles and constituted 5 – 15 % of their mass. These optically effective sizes constrained the soot and dust size distributions and the imaginary part of the dust refractive index, k, to 0. 0006 ± 0. 0001.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of studies focusing on improving our understanding of atmospheric aerosols using both observational data and model simulations. EOF analysis of Aerosol Index (AI) product from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) reveals global distribution of absorbing aerosols, with major sources lying in Sahara deserts, the Sahel region, South America and South Africa. Analysis of aerosol Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) data from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) further indicate trends in SSA over a number of globally distributed stations, which might be associated with changes in aerosol composition and thus their optical properties. More importantly, the changes in SSA alter the radiative forcing of aerosols. They may also potentially impact satellite retrievals of aerosol properties as generally a constant SSA is assumed in the retrieval algorithms. In order to assess satellite retrieved aerosol optical properties, collocated pixel level Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Ångström Exponent (AE) data from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are compared with AERONET measurements over 10 stations representing typical aerosol regimes. The results show that while MODIS AOD well agrees with AERONET in both the magnitude and seasonal variability for all stations, comparatively large discrepancies are found in the AE, especially for over land. Further investigation reveals that the dependence of the AE on AOD for MODIS data are quite different from AERONET data, which suggest problems in the aerosol models used in MODIS retrieval. MODIS ocean data are generally reliable. Focusing on ocean data, a strong correlation between the AE and ENSO index has been found, and the roles of relevant physical mechanisms are discussed. While the exact cause of the correlation is still unclear, the results indicate aerosol properties can be influenced by major climate modes such as ENSO. The sensitivity of aerosol Direct Radiative Forcing (DRF) to perturbations of major aerosol parameters are tested using the GISS GCM. Among the three perturbed parameters, AOD, SSA and asymmetry parameter g, DRF appears to be most sensitive to SSA. Moreover, changing aerosol <b>dry</b> <b>sizes</b> result in larger fluctuation in DRF than the previous three parameters. Based on the sensitivity studies, an optimal fitting technique based on AERONET data is developed to better constrain aerosol <b>dry</b> <b>size</b> parameterization in the GCM. Model results for AOD and SSA are also improved by adjusting the size and applying "uncertainty parameters". The fitting results indicate an overall underestimate in GCM aerosol loading. In particular, aerosol absorption has been underestimated by approximately a factor of 2. The low bias might be attributed to insufficient aerosol mass loading, lack of internal mixing of black carbon with other species, etc. After incorporating the optimized sizes and uncertainty parameters into the GCM, estimated global mean DRF is significantly larger than the original aerosol field. Regionally the changes in DRF are more diverse due to the relative fraction of absorbing and non-absorbing aerosols. The method still has limitations. Further improvements are required including examining the fine/coarse aerosol fraction, better identifying the absorbing species, and using advanced observations with global coverage...|$|R

The measurements took place off the coasts of Japan, Korea, and China. All instruments contributing to this study were deployed in a container on the forward deck of the NOAA Research Vessel Ronald H. Brown. Air masses with primarily marine influence and air masses from the Asian continent affected by both anthropogenic sources and by the transport of desert dust aerosol were encountered during the cruise. Two different systems {{were used to determine}} hygroscopic growth of the ambient marine boundary layer aerosol at 90 % relative humidity (RH). An H-TDMA-system (Hygroscopicity-Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer) (Massling et al., 2003) and a newly developed H-DMA-APS-system (Hygroscopicity-Differential Mobility Analyzer-Aerodynamic Particle Sizer) (Leinert and Wiedensohler, 2006) were applied to analyze sub-micrometer and one-micrometer aerosol particles, respectively. Results showed very different hygroscopic behavior in the sub-micrometer size range compared to the one-micrometer size range. In general, for all continentally influenced air masses, the one-micrometer particle population was characterized by two different particle fractions ? a nearly hydrophobic fraction with growth factors around 1. 0 representative of dust particles and a sea salt fraction with hygroscopic growth factors around 2. 0. The number fraction of dust particles was generally about 60 % independent of long-range air mass origin. For sub-micrometer particles, a dominant, more hygroscopic particle fraction with growth factors between 1. 5 and 1. 9 (depending on <b>dry</b> particle <b>size)</b> indicating ammonium sulfate as major component was always found. In marine air masses and for larger sizes within the sub-micrometer range (Dp = 250 and 350 nm), a sea salt fraction with growth factors between 2. 0 and 2. 1 was also observed. For all other air masses, the more hygroscopic particle fraction in the sub-micrometer size range was mostly accompanied by a less hygroscopic particle fraction with growth factors between 1. 20 and 1. 55 depending on both the continental sources and the <b>dry</b> particle <b>size.</b> Number fractions of this particle group varied between 4 and 39 % depending on <b>dry</b> particle <b>size</b> and air mass type. Nearly hydrophobic particles indicating dust particles in the sub-micrometer size regime were only found for particles with Dp = 250 and 350 nm during a time period when the aerosol was significantly influenced by transport from Asian desert regions...|$|R
