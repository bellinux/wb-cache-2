40|$|<b>Housing</b> <b>allowances</b> in Norway {{are meant}} to enable low-income {{households}} to increase, or maintain, their housing consumption. In order to identify low-income households and to ensure a desirable vertical equity, the allowances decrease as income rises. The marginal withdrawal of <b>housing</b> <b>allowances</b> as income increases is quite high. Interacting with the tax system this might potentially produce a dependency culture and a depressing effect on the supply of labour. A dependency culture would yield long spells as recipients of <b>housing</b> <b>allowances.</b> This paper demonstrates {{that this is not}} the case for single parents and families with children. Around 30 per cent of the receivers from these groups drop out of the system every year. Furthermore the hazards (probability of dropping out) seem to be independent of the length of the claim. <b>Housing</b> <b>allowances,</b> dependency culture, Norway,...|$|R

25|$|Canal Zone housing was {{constructed}} {{in the early days}} of construction, as part of Stevens' plans. Housing constructed for couples and families consisted of structures containing four two-story apartments. The units had corrugated-iron roofs, and were uniformly painted gray with white trim. Constructed of pine clapboard, they had long windows and high ceilings, allowing for air movement. Better-paid employees were entitled to more square feet of housing, the unit in which allowances were expressed. Initially, employees received one square foot per dollar of monthly salary. Stevens from the first encouraged gold roll employees to send for their wives and children; to encourage them to do so, wives were granted a <b>housing</b> <b>allowance</b> equal to their husband's, even if they were not employees. Bachelors mostly resided in hotel-like structures. The structures all had screened verandas and up-to-date plumbing. The government furnished power, water, coal for cooking, ice for iceboxes, lawn care, groundskeeping, garbage disposal, and, for bachelors only, maid service.|$|E

Richardson, , which challenged a statute {{making it more difficult}} for a female service member to claim an increased <b>housing</b> <b>allowance</b> for her husband than for a male service member seeking the same allowance for his wife. Ginsburg argued the statute treated women as inferior, and the Supreme Court ruled 8–1 in her favor. The Court again ruled in Ginsburg's favor in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, , where Ginsburg represented a widower denied survivor benefits under Social Security, which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children. She argued it discriminated against female workers denying them the same protection as their male counterparts. Ginsburg filed an amicus brief and sat with counsel at oral argument for the case Craig v. Boren, , in which she challenged an Oklahoma statute which set different minimum drinking ages for men and women. For the first time, the Court imposed what is known as [...] "intermediate scrutiny" [...] on laws discriminating based on gender, a heightened standard of Constitutional review. Her last case as a lawyer before the Court was 1978's Duren v. Missouri, , which challenged the validity of voluntary jury duty for women as she deemed women's participation in government service as vital and that jury duty should not be optional. At the end of Ginsburg's oral presentation, then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist asked Ginsburg, [...] "You won't settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?" [...] Ginsburg said she considered responding, [...] "We won't settle for tokens", but instead opted not to answer the question.|$|E
40|$|The Canadian {{definition}} of housing affordability {{depends on a}} ratio, which states that housing is affordable if it costs less than 30 % of gross household income. This ratio is used to determine both eligibility and benefit levels in many Canadian affordable housing programs, including social <b>housing</b> and <b>housing</b> <b>allowances.</b> However, this ratio is not a methodologically sound or equitable way to define housing affordability. The result is that affordable housing programs underserve large families living in high-rent urban regions. This study searches for an alternative method to define eligibility and allocate benefits within provincial <b>housing</b> <b>allowances.</b> British Columbia’s Rental Assistance Program is used to illustrate the application of concepts and measures. Four eligibility and two benefit allocation methods are evaluated.

30|$|On {{the demand}} side, OECD {{countries}} have used two strategies: rent supplements and <b>housing</b> <b>allowances</b> (Andrews et al. 2011).

It is possible to have minimal condition or size standards to ensure the program is not supporting poor quality housing. The subsidy payment similarly uses a percentage of income, such as 30  %, but adds another element, which is a “percentage of gap” between the 30  % level and actual market rent.

Legislative productivity under the DPJ was particularly low, falling to levels unprecedented in recent Japanese history according to some measures.

[...] The Housing Construction Modification Law (1971) increased the income-limit for access to low rent apartments under the social housing programme from 9,000 DM to 12,000 DM per annum plus 3,000 DM (instead of 2,400) for each family member. The law also introduced special subsidies to reduce the debt burden for builders not surpassing the regular income-limit by more than 40%. Under a 1973 law, the limits were increased to 1,000 DM plus 9,000 DM and 4,200 DM for additional family members. The Rent Improvement Law (1971) strengthened the position of tenants. Under this legislation, notice was to be ruled illegal [...] "where appropriate substitute accommodation not available; landlords obliged to specify reasons for notice," [...] whilst the Eviction Protection Law (1971) established tenant protection against rent rises and notice. The notice was only lawful if in the [...] "justified interest of the landlord." [...] Under this law, higher rents were not recognised as [...] "justified interest." [...] The Second Eviction Protection Law (1972) made the tenant protection introduced under the Eviction Protection Law of 1971 permanent.

In addition, rent increases were only lawful if not above normal comparable rents in the same area.|$|E
