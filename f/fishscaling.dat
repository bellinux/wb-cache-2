40|$|The bubble structures, <b>fishscaling</b> resistance, {{adhesion}} and its {{mechanism of}} vitreous enamel to low carbon steels {{were evaluated by}} microscopic methods. The {{results show that the}} microalloying elements deteriorates the adhesion but suppress the <b>fishscaling</b> tendency, the enamel-steel interface adhesion could be explained as mainly the mechanical interlocking and chemical bonding during the firing process; the lower carbon substrate causes higher proportion of bigger bubbles in the enamel layer and subsequently causes the lower <b>fishscaling</b> susceptibility...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a new hot rolled heavy plate steel suitable for porcelain enamelling, especially for vitreous enamelled vessels. The properties generally required for steel include good weldability, high strength indicated by a yield strength that is greater than 245 MPa after enamelling, high resistance to <b>fishscaling,</b> and an interface between the enamel and steel that is acceptable. The work done by other researchers on hot or cold rolled sheet steels over the last few decades has been reviewed. The hydrogen diffusion coefficients for evaluating the resistance of the enamelling steels to <b>fishscaling,</b> and the effect that the trapping sites have on the coefficient were elucidated, and the testing method for evaluating adherence at the enamel/steel interface has also been introduced...|$|E
40|$|The {{precipitates}} {{and hydrogen}} permeation behavior in {{three kinds of}} hot rolled low carbon heavy plate steels for enameling were analyzed; then, {{both sides of the}} steels were enameled. The experimental results show that a large amount of coarse Ti 4 C 2 S 2 and fine Ti(C, N) particles exist in the optimized Ti-bearing steel, quite a lot of fine Ti(C, N) particles exist in the optimized carbon steel, but only a little bit fine Ti(C, N) particles exist in the carbon steel. The <b>fishscaling</b> resistance of the steels can be correlated to the effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient, and a model of correlation between the effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient and the volume fraction of the precipitates was established and verified. The effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient should be lower than 3. 96 x 10 6 cm 2 /s to avoid <b>fishscaling</b> in heavy plate steels...|$|E

40|$|When {{porcelain}} enamels or vitreous-type ceramic coatings {{are applied}} to ferrous metals, there {{is believed to be}} an evolution of hydrogen gas both during and after the firing operation. At elevated temperatures rapid evolution may result in blistering while if hydrogen becomes trapped in the steel during the rapid cooling following the firing operation gas pressures may be generated at the coating-metal interface and flakes of the coating literally blown off the metal. To determine experimentally the relative importance of the principal sources of the hydrogen causing the defects, a procedure was devised in which heavy hydrogen (deuterium) was substituted in turn for regular hydrogen in each of five possible hydrogen-producing operations in the coating process. The findings of the study were as follows: (1) the principal source of the defect-producing hydrogen was the dissolved water present in the enamel frit that was incorporated into the coating. (2) the acid pickling, the milling water, the chemically combined water in the clay, and the quenching water were all minor sources of defect-producing hydrogen under the test conditions used. Confirming experiments showed that <b>fishscaling</b> could be eliminated by using a water-free coating...|$|E

One of rap's most cinematic and sophisticated storytellers, he fills his pulp narratives with so much novelistic detail that it's impossible to catch everything on the first listen. Thankfully, the kaleidoscopic, soul-drenched production by Doom, Pete Rock, Jay Dee, Just Blaze, and others make repeat listens seem tempting, even downright irresistible.

The redundant title alone-- here ya go, More Fish!-- goes lengths to lower expectations." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "The Wu-Tang Clan’s most reliable warrior extends his string of triumphs with More Fish, the sequel to his March release, <b>Fishscale.</b> Six discs into his solo career, Ghostface Killah handily delivers everything that his fans expect: nostalgic soul samples, richly detailed scenes of street life, and an abundance of inventive wordplay (”A shark’s teeth ain’t sharp enough/I’m like Mount St. Helen when the god erupt”)." [...] Amanda Diva of XXL said, [...] "Sometimes leftovers can be just as good as the original meal. Such is the case with Ghostface’s latest offering, More Fish. At first glance, this follow-up to last year’s <b>Fishscale</b> seems like nothing more than a Theodore Unit compilation, as names like Trife Da God and Sun God (Ghost’s son), as well as Wu-Tang affiliates Cappadonna and Killa Sin, flood the guest list.
