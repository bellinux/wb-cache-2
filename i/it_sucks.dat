[...] Erikson added, [...] "Being expected to go through life to behave a certain way; I think 'Run Baby Run' is a plea to run from that. Run with your life, take it wherever it takes you.

500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé {{continues}} to dismiss her former lover as she sings, [...] "So sad, you're hurt / boo hoo ...", over a tinkling piano riff and bass drums. She then chants the ascendant chorus, which this time features soaring strings and an uplifting aggressive piano accompaniment. Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio noted that though Beyoncé rips through the verses, she sings the chorus and bridge with restraint; on the latter, she affirms {{that she has}} moved on in life. The song ends as Beyoncé repeatedly sings, [...] "What goes around comes back around / I bet <b>it</b> <b>sucks</b> to be you right now".|$|E

500|$|Clarkson {{fought with}} her bosses to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being {{released}} as a single, {{out of respect}} for Knowles. She wanted [...] "Cry" [...] to be released instead, but conceded that, [...] "in the end, they’re releasing it without my consent. <b>It</b> <b>sucks,</b> but it's one of those things I have no control over... At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." [...] Tedder, however, was pleased that the song was released, saying that he likes it more than [...] "Halo". The song was sent to radio airplay on August 11, 2009. In September 2009, Clarkson told MTV that it was unfortunate the two songs sound exactly the same, but noted that they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started out liking this movie, {{while waiting}} for {{something}} really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities {{if there is a}} sequel, and maybe find time to get involved in a story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior; they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions." [...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. <b>It</b> <b>sucks</b> that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opened to}} mixed feedback, and aired {{back-to-back}} with [...] "Good Mourning", as a two-hour season premiere special.

That isn't to say that there shouldn't have been tears, or speeches. George's death, no matter how marginal he had become last season, is and should be a huge event in the lives of these characters. Had the show raced through Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's famous five stages of grief, it would have rang false, as if everyone making the show was in a hurry to move past the events of the wildly uneven fifth season. My problem is, when you put two episodes back-to-back, those rhythms - the pace at which the acts build to emotional crescendos and then briefly recede - start to become too predictable, and <b>it</b> <b>sucks</b> some of the life and emotion away." [...] Sepinwall also praised Wilson's, Ramirez's, and Chamber's performances.|$|E

500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Martin Brundle, Hamilton thanked his team and expressed satisfaction {{about how the}} race went. He pointed {{to the problems of}} driving on the full wet tyres for such a long distance, saying that they were about to [...] "drop off", meaning to lose much of their grip to the race surface, when he came in to change. He complimented Ricciardo on driving [...] "phenomenally all weekend". Ricciardo himself lamented his misfortune in losing the race during his second pit stop. In regard to his team's error and their different strategy at the previous race in Spain, which he felt had cost him a chance at victory there as well, he said: [...] "Two weekends in a row I've been screwed now. <b>It</b> <b>sucks.</b> It hurts." [...] He emphasised that it had not been his decision to pit at that time, but that the team had called him in and criticised them for not being ready when he arrived.

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} {{watching}} it left him [...] "reeling with turmoil and confusion, {{with feelings of}} sadness and despair," [...] and called it a [...] "thoroughly painful and depressing experience - but, it must be said, {{one that has been}} powerfully written, directed and acted." [...] He awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that this [...] "slick, riveting, viscerally scary film about what in other hands would be a decidedly unsalable subject, namely death," [...] is [...] "both quaint and devastating." [...] However, Desson Thomson of The Washington Post felt disappointed with the film that is [...] "ultimately flat on its surrealistic face, the victim of too many fake-art sequences." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jacob's Ladder is so 'dark' <b>it</b> <b>sucks</b> Robbins right down with it. By the time Jacob is being strapped to a bed and wheeled down a hospital corridor strewn with bloody limbs, it's hard to care whether the Orwellian image is a hallucination or not.

500|$|... "Dumpweed" [...] {{kicks off}} the record, and explores sexual frustration. The song is based around the hook [...] "I need a girl that I can train," [...] as in dog training. DeLonge, the song's {{primarily}} lyricist, explains {{the song in}} a 2000 tour booklet: [...] "Girls are so much smarter than guys and can see the future as well as never forget the past. So that leaves the dog as the only thing men are smarter than." [...] The song is a [...] "callow complaint about girls not always doing exactly what you wish they would," [...] and is followed by Hoppus' [...] "Don't Leave Me," [...] a song about a breakup, in irony. Hoppus wrote the song in ten minutes. The guitar swell preceding the second chorus is actually a digital reversal of the delaying guitar preceding it. [...] "Aliens Exist" [...] originates from DeLonge's interest in UFOs and conspiracy theories. [...] "Going Away to College" [...] was written in ten minutes by Hoppus while at home sick on Valentine's Day 1999. While watching the movie Can't Hardly Wait, Hoppus {{began to think about}} [...] "how much <b>it</b> <b>sucks</b> when people are in love in high school" [...] and are forced to be separated after graduation by different colleges in different cities.

500|$|Several years later, Gail Berman, a Fox executive, {{approached}} Whedon {{to develop}} his Buffy concept into a television series. Whedon explained that [...] "They said, 'Do {{you want to do}} a show?' And I thought, 'High school as a horror movie'. And so the metaphor became the central concept behind Buffy, and that's how I sold it." [...] The supernatural elements in the series stood as metaphors for personal anxieties associated with adolescence and young adulthood. Early in its development, the series was going to be simply titled Slayer. Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25-minute non-broadcast pilot that was shown to networks and eventually sold to the WB Network. Buffy the Vampire Slayer first aired on March 10, 1997, as a mid season replacement for the show Savannah on The WB network, and {{played a key role in}} the growth of the Warner Bros. television network in its early years. Whedon has declared in June 2003 that the non-broadcast pilot would not be included with DVDs of the series [...] "while there is strength in these bones," [...] stating that it [...] "sucks on ass."IGNFF: Is the presentation ever going to make it to DVD?WHEDON: Not while there is strength in these bones.IGNFF: Well, I mean, it's one of the most heavily bootlegged things on the Internet.WHEDON: Yeah. <b>It</b> <b>sucks</b> on ass.IGNFF: Yeah, it does, but it's sort of that archival, historical perspective...WHEDON: Yeah, I've got your historical perspective.IGNFF: It would take it off the bootleg market...WHEDON: Ah, I don't – what are you going to do?IGNFF: Put it on the DVD.WHEDON: Not me.}} ...|$|E
