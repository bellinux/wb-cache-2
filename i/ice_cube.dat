5|$|Planned but {{unreleased}} albums during Dr.Dre's {{tenure at}} Aftermath have included a full-length reunion with Snoop Dogg titled Breakup to Makeup, an album with fellow former N.W.A member <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube</b> {{which was to}} be titled Heltah Skeltah, an N.W.A reunion album, and a joint album with fellow producer Timbaland titled Chairmen of the Board.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{arose from}} the film when the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball teams of the late 1980s with Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo {{claimed to be the}} originators of baggy shorts in basketball. All of the Wolverines {{who took part in the}} production of the film described how they felt they originated the baggy shorts as a result of Rose's request. Even rapper <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube</b> described his recollection of them as the originators.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an <b>ice</b> <b>cube</b> tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
50|$|Another superstition is {{flushing}} <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> {{down the}} toilet. Most prefer <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> rather than crushed ice. There {{are many other}} traditions that include <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> such as throwing them into a pond or lake in hopes of the water freezing over, throwing shaved <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> at a tree, and tossing ice into one’s front yard.|$|R
50|$|Dedicated {{ice-maker}} machines {{can be used}} {{to produce}} <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> for laboratories and academic use. <b>Ice</b> <b>cubes</b> are also produced commercially and sold in bulk; these <b>ice</b> <b>cubes,</b> despite their name, are often cylindrical, and may have holes through the center.|$|R
5000|$|The song is {{referenced}} lyrically on <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube's</b> 1994 single [...] "Bop Gun (One Nation)" [...] (featuring George Clinton), {{the fourth}} single from <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube's</b> fifth album, Lethal Injection.|$|R
5|$|Gangsta rap {{is a kind}} of hip hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality, and a dangerous criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta rap {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s style of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country, to rappers from New York, such as Notorious B.I.G and influential hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and to rappers on the West Coast, such as Too Short and N.W.A. A distinctive West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy sound, often from 1970s funk samples; the best-known proponents were the rappers 2Pac, Dr. Dre, <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube,</b> and Snoop Dogg. Gangsta rap continued to exert a major presence in American popular music through the end of the 1990s and early into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the album}} was {{released}} in three variant editions, containing three individual full-length bonus albums. The first variant edition, dubbed the Red Pop edition, contains an album of cover songs entitled Smothered, Covered & Chunked, which features appearances by Psychopathic artists Twiztid, Anybody Killa, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Cold 187um and Boondox, as well as Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst and rapper Lil Wyte. The second variant, the Black Pop edition, contains the album Freaky Tales, consisting of a single, album-length rap, inspired by Too Short's song of the same name. The third variant, the White Pop edition, contains the remix album Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium, which features remixes, outtakes and leftover songs recorded during the Mighty Death Pop sessions; these tracks include appearances by Kottonmouth Kings, Three 6 Mafia, Color Me Badd, <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube,</b> Scarface, Geto Boys, Twiztid, Kreayshawn, Swollen Members and WillieD. ICP said in their December 21, 2012 Hatchet Herald edition {{that they will be}} releasing a sideshow EP for The Mighty Death Pop! in 2013. The EP is titled House Of Wax set to be released on November 25, 2014 packaged inside The First Six.|$|E
5|$|Filming of Big Money Rustlas, a Western spoof, {{began in}} January 2009, and {{concluded}} on February 24, 2009. The tenth Gathering of the Juggalos {{took place at}} Hogrock in Cave-In-Rock, Illinois, from August 6 to 9. The event had the largest attendance in Gathering history with over 20,000 people. Over 120 musical artists performed at the event, including the likes of Tech N9ne, Kottonmouth Kings, <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube,</b> GWAR, Coolio, Vanilla Ice, Onyx, Scarface, The Dayton Family, Bizarre, Esham, and NATAS. At the event, the Big Money Rustlas trailer was screened twice. An infomercial for the event was released online by Psychopathic Records. After the event, a friend of Esham's handed Bruce {{a copy of his}} album I Ain't Cha Homey, which depicted a clown committing suicide with a gun on the front cover. Bruce listened to the album and saw it as a diss towards Insane Clown Posse. While Esham claimed that the album was not a diss in his podcast, the album strained the relationship between Bruce and Esham, and the two have not spoken since its release.|$|E
50|$|For {{small-scale}} ice production, {{many modern}} home refrigerators {{can also make}} ice with a built in icemaker, which will typically make <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> or crushed <b>ice.</b> Stand-alone icemaker units that make <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> are often called ice machines.|$|R
50|$|Another example, {{not based}} on {{concentration}} but on phase, is a glass of liquid water with <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> in it. Above 0 °C, an H2O molecule {{that is in the}} liquid phase (liquid water) has a lower chemical potential than a water molecule that is in the solid phase (ice). When some of the ice melts, H2O molecules convert from solid to liquid where their chemical potential is lower, so the <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> shrink. Below 0 °C, the molecules in the ice phase have the lower chemical potential, so the <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> grow. At the temperature of the melting point, 0 °C, the chemical potentials in water and ice are the same; the <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> neither grow nor shrink, and the system is in equilibrium.|$|R

25|$|By {{this point}} <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube</b> was a {{full-time}} member of N.W.A along with Dr. Dre and MC Ren. <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube</b> wrote Dr. Dre's and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, Straight Outta Compton, released in 1988. However, {{towards the end}} of 1989, <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube</b> found himself at odds with the group's manager, Jerry Heller, after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.|$|E
25|$|An <b>ice</b> <b>cube</b> tray is a tray {{divided into}} compartments. It is {{designed}} to be filled with water, then placed in a freezer until the water freezes to ice, producing ice cubes. The first flexible <b>ice</b> <b>cube</b> tray was invented by Lloyd Groff Copeman in 1928.|$|E

50|$|A typical Bert and Ernie skit has Ernie {{coming up}} with a hare brained idea, and Bert trying {{to talk him out of}} it, ending with Bert losing his temper and Ernie {{remaining}} unaware of the results of his own bad idea. For example, in one sketch, Ernie tells Bert he started to collect <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> the day before, and put them under the electric blanket overnight. When he shows the <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> to Bert, he finds out that they have melted into water. Bert knows what happened, and tries to tell Ernie that his <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> melted because of the electric blanket, but Ernie takes this to mean that a fish from the ocean came into the apartment and melted his <b>ice</b> <b>cubes,</b> and vows to find the (non existent) fish that melted them.|$|R

25|$|In 1989, <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube</b> {{recorded}} his debut solo album, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, in New York with the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy's production team). It {{was released in}} May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to {{the rising tide of}} rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube</b> appointed the female rapper Yo-Yo (who appeared on AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted) to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, Make Way for the Motherlode. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in John Singleton's violent crime drama, Boyz n the Hood.
