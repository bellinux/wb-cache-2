40|$|The thesis {{targeted}} on {{the area}} of modernization of customs clearance in the EU and the Czech Republic {{is focused on the}} specification of the systems and procedures used in the modernization of customs clearance when the electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> is used. Mainly about the status of transition from the paper declaration to the electronic paperless <b>customs</b> <b>declaration,</b> not only in the Czech Republic but throughout the European Union. Assessment data is carried out primarily for the period between the years 2012 to 2014, in some cases, for better assessments, in the period between the years 2009 to 2014. The thesis is focused on the evaluation of the situation with modernisation the customs clearance in the Czech Republic and comparing the results between chosen EU member states and the Czech Republic. The usage of the electronic Entry Summary Declarations and Exit Summary Declarations have increased several times in last two years. Implementation of systems for lodgement and processing of <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> for more effective and efficient control of goods within the EU member states has also very fast growing trend with very low error rate. The rate of electronically lodged <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> is reaching in most of the EU member states almost 100 %. Numbers of <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> lodged within the simplified procedures in chosen EU member states is more or less stable.

40|$|The {{national}} customs {{services of}} the twenty-seven EU Member States are playing a crucial role for {{the preparation of the}} admission of further states to the European Union (EU) by helping to build structures and teach the <b>EU</b> <b>Customs</b> Law in order to enable candidate states to apply the acquis communautaire. The so-called 2 ̆ 018 twinning 2 ̆ 019 is an important and practical approach to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about <b>EU</b> <b>Customs</b> Law to candidate countries.

40|$|Government {{involvement}} {{is the main}} cause for the EDI acceptance in Southeast Asian countries (United Nation of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific - UNESCAP, 1996). This is {{significantly different from the}} EDI developments in the western countries in which private sector involvement in EDI is substantial (UNESCAP, 1996). As an initial step to spur EDI implementation in private sector, the Malaysian Government has imposed all companies that engage in international trade to implement EDI by doing electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> through CIS (<b>Customs</b> Information System) DagangNet. For this, the Government also spent over RM 300 million to fully implement EDI nationwide (Star, 2003 December 3). Nevertheless, such implementation is not successful and it has been claimed that “EDI is not yet fully implemented even though it had been initiated since late 1990 s, besides electronic data is also still not recognized for legal <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> purposes even if it was meant for paperless and electronic customs declarations” (Star, 2003 December 3). To date, there are dual <b>customs</b> <b>declarations,</b> both electronic and manual, in practices where the sole typical electronic transaction is registration of the customs form (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11). This is in contrast with electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> by other countries such as Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore where there is a full electronic declaration including electronic payment for declarations charges (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11; Chau, 2001) ...|$|R

40|$|Customs risk {{analysis}} {{is crucial for}} detecting fraud and contraband goods in the massive flows of internationally traded goods. Most of non-bulk goods are transported in shipping containers and, as customs can control only about 2 % of them, efficient customs {{risk analysis}} is crucial. Recently <b>EU</b> <b>customs</b> got access to massive volumes of shipping containers traffic data which can assist their risk assessment process. In order to support <b>EU</b> <b>customs</b> in this domain the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has developed the ConTraffic visual analytics application which is currently used by <b>EU</b> <b>customs</b> on an experimental basis.
