5|$|I Am... Sasha <b>Fierce</b> is {{the third}} studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was {{released}} on November 12, 2008 through Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment. In its initial release, the album was formatted as a double album, intending to market Beyoncé's contrasting facets of artistry. The first disc, I Am..., contains slow and midtempo pop and R ballads, while the second, Sasha <b>Fierce</b> (named after Beyoncé's on-stage alter ego), focuses on more uptempo beats that blend electropop and Europop genres. In composing the songs' lyrics, Beyoncé worked with writers, with each session accompanied by live orchestration.|$|E
