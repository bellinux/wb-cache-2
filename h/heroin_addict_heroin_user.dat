Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Settings/Location: Drug Rehabilitation Bureau of Shanghai Police, China. Participants: 99 volunteers, including 69 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> and 30 healthy volunteers. Interventions: 69 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> randomly divided into two groups: the Jitai tablet group, which comprised 34 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> given Jitai tablet treatment during abstinence, and the placebo group, which comprised 35 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> given placebo. A control group consisted of 30 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. Outcome Measures: ACTH and cortisol in plasma were measured in all groups at baseline and in the Jitai tablet and placebo groups on the third, seventh, and 14 th days of abstinence. Results: Levels of both ACTH (p <. 01) and cortisol (p <. 001) were significantly higher in <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> at baseline than in the healthy volunteers.

40|$|Abstract: High {{doses of}} {{pharmaceutical}} graded heroin {{in combination with}} methadone are prescribed nowadays in a Dutch trial with methadone treatment refractory <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> <b>Heroin</b> is prescribed either through intravenous injection or inhalation. One of the major risks of using opioids is ventilatory depression. In this study, the effect of heroin on oxygen saturation rate (SpO 2) {{in a group of}} opioid tolerant patients was investigated. SpO 2 was measured in 22 patients on heroin treatment (12 injectors, 10 inhalers) during 4 consecutive days. Heroin dosages were varied double-blindly from 67 % to 150 % of the regular dose. Methadone dosages remained unchanged and took place 120 minutes after heroin intake. SpO 2 assessments took place till 250 minutes after heroin administration. From 20 subjects, heroin plasma concentrations could be obtained. At the first measurement 13 minutes after heroin administration, the average SpO 2 dropped from a pre-dose level of 96. 9 % to 93. 8 % (difference 3. 1 %; 95 % CI: 2. 4 - 3. 8 %; p< 0. 0001). This decline in SpO 2 was not related to heroin dose or plasma concentrations, and {{there were no significant differences}} between intravenous <b>heroin</b> <b>users</b> and <b>heroin</b> inhalers. Co-administration of benzodiazepines in 10 patients, however, caused a significant additive reducing effect on the SpO 2 levels (p< 0. 0001).

5000|$|Two {{fundamental}} {{views in}} welfare economics, welfarism and paternalism, {{differ in their}} conceptual treatment of 'demerit goods'.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare HCV and HIV {{infection}} among <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> in MMT {{and not in}} MMT in {{two large}} cities in central China. METHODS: A total of 541 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> were recruited from MMT clinics and voluntary detoxification centers in Changsha and Wuhan, China. Structured questionnaires collected data on their socio-demographics, clinical status, risk behaviors, and their knowledge of HIV. Their HIV serostatus and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) serostatus were determined by testing antibodies in blood serum. RESULTS: We observed a higher prevalence of HCV infection among MMT <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> (82. 3 %) than that in the non-MMT group (50. 6 %). However, our findings indicated that the <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> in MMT had less drug or sexual HIV/HCV risk behaviors and more knowledge about HIV than non-MMT <b>addicts.</b> The <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> in MMT had a significantly higher percentage of individuals who always used condoms (44. 9 %) compared with patients in the non-MMT group (14. 6 %, p = 0. 039), and they had more knowledge about HIV than non-MMT individuals (p<. 001). The percentage of HIV-positive addicts in the MMT group (0. 7 %) and non-MMT group (0. 8 %) were almost same. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated {{that the rate of}} HCV infection among <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> among MMT or non-MMT settings in central China is very high.

40|$|Abstract Background Heroin is a {{synthetic}} opioid with an extensive illicit market leading to {{large numbers of}} people becoming <b>addicted.</b> <b>Heroin</b> <b>users</b> often present to community treatment services requesting detoxification and in the UK various agents are used to control symptoms of withdrawal. Dissatisfaction with methadone detoxification 8 has lead to the use of clonidine, lofexidine, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine; however, there remains limited evaluative research. In Leeds, a city of 700, 000 people in the North of England, dihydrocodeine is the detoxification agent of choice. Sublingual buprenorphine, however, is being introduced. The comparative value of these two drugs for helping people successfully and comfortably withdraw from heroin has never been compared in a randomised trial. Additionally, there is a paucity of research evaluating interventions among drug users in the primary care setting. This study seeks to address this by randomising drug users presenting in primary care to receive either dihydrocodeine or buprenorphine. Methods/design The Leeds Evaluation of Efficacy of Detoxification Study (LEEDS) project is a pragmatic randomised trial which will compare the open use of buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for illicit opiate detoxification, in the UK primary care setting. The LEEDS project will involve consenting adults and will be run in specialist general practice surgeries throughout Leeds. The primary outcome will be the results of a urine opiate screening {{at the end of the}} detoxification regimen. Adverse effects and limited data to three and six months will be acquired. </p...|$|R

Comparison of cryoglobulin positive (CP), cryoglobulin negative (CN) <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> and the control group (CG) in terms of serum immunoglobulins IgG, IgA and IgM and complement components C 3 and C 4; 2. Comparison of CP and CN <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> in terms of rheumatoid factor (RF) and circulating immune complexes (CIC); 3. Assessment of clinical manifestations in CP <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> Methods. This is a comparative study of cases (outpatients) treated at the University Clinic of Toxicology in Skopje over 3. 5 years, from January 2009 to June 2012. In this study 140 <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> without HbsAg were examined, seronegative for HCV and HIV infections. They were divided into 2 groups: 70 CP and 70 CN <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> A previously designed self-administered questionnaire {{was used as a}} data source on participants. All <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> underwent the following analyses: urea and creatinine in serum; creatinine in urine; proteinuria; 24 -hour proteinuria; IgM, IgG, IgA, C 3, C 4; RF; CIC; creatinine clearance; ECG; toxicological analyses for opioids in a urine sample; cryoglobulins. In addition to these 2 groups, IgG, IgA, IgM, C 3 and C 4 were also examined in 70 healthy subjects (CG). Results. The study showed that there was no statistically significant difference between CP, CN <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts</b> and CG regarding the concentration of IgA, IgG, IgM, C 3 and C 4, and between CP and CN regarding the concentration of CIC. There was significant difference between CP and CN regarding the concentration of RF. The following conditions were significantly more frequently manifested in CP than in CN heroin addicts: arthralgia, Raynaudâs phenomenon, respiratory difficulties, neurological disorders, manifested skin changes, hematuria, 24 -hour proteinuria levels, and decreased renal clearance. Conclusion. There were no differences in concentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM, C 3, C 4 and CIC, while there was a difference in concentration of RF between CP and CN <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts.</b> Clinical manifestations (arthralgias, Raynaudâs phenomenon, respiratory, neurologic, renal disorders and skin changes) were more common in CP <b>heroin</b> <b>addicts...</b>|$|R
