5|$|Starting {{with the}} parish of Olney, Buckinghamshire in 1714 several dozen {{small towns and}} {{individual}} parishes established their own institutions without any specific legal authorization. These were concentrated in the South Midlands and in the county of Essex. From the late 1710s the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge began to promote the idea of parochial workhouses. The Society published several pamphlets on the subject, and supported Sir Edward Knatchbull in his successful efforts to steer the Workhouse Test Act through parliament in 1723. The act gave legislative authority {{for the establishment of}} parochial workhouses, by both single parishes and as joint ventures between two or more parishes. More importantly, the Act helped to publicise the idea of establishing workhouses to a national audience. By 1776 some 1,912 parish and corporation workhouses had been established in England and Wales, housing almost 100,000 paupers. Perhaps one million people were receiving some kind of parish poor relief {{by the end of the}} century. Although many parishes and pamphlet writers expected to earn money from the labour of the poor in workhouses, the vast majority of people obliged to take up residence in workhouses were ill, elderly, or children whose labour proved largely unprofitable. The demands, needs and expectations of the poor also ensured that workhouses came to take on the character of general social policy institutions, combining the functions of creche, and night shelter, geriatric ward and orphanage. In 1782, Thomas Gilbert finally succeeded in passing an Act that established poor houses solely for the aged and infirm and introduced a system of outdoor relief for the able-bodied. This was the basis for the development of the Speenhamland system, which made <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> for low-paid workers. Settlement Laws were altered by the Removal Act 1795 which prevented non-settled persons from being moved on unless they had applied for relief.|$|E

25|$|In 1252, Alfonso X had resurrected another ancestral claim, {{this time}} to the duchy of Gascony, {{in the south of}} Aquitaine, last {{possession}} of the Kings of England in France, which he claimed had formed part of the dowry of Eleanor of England. Henry III of England swiftly countered Alfonso's claims with both diplomatic and military moves. Early in 1254 the two kings began to negotiate; after haggling over the <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> for Eleanor, Henry and Alfonso agreed she would marry Henry's son Edward, and Alfonso would transfer his Gascon claims to Edward. Henry was so anxious for the marriage to take place that he willingly abandoned elaborate preparations already made for Edward's knighting in England, and agreed that Alfonso would knight Edward before the wedding took place.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, General Smuts and his {{government}} wished for the early admission of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa. When the Union was established, Natal and the Free State were given representation in the Union Parliament considerably {{in excess of the}} number of their electors, and Smuts promised that this would apply in the case of Rhodesia, which would receive 12 to 15 seats in the Union Parliament, which then had 134 members. Smuts also promised that South Africa would make the <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> necessary to buy out the commercial rights of the BSAC. If those rights continued under responsible government, they would create a serious financial problem for that government. In 1922, the company entered negotiations with the Union government for the incorporation of Southern Rhodesia. However, as the BSAC charter was due to expire on 1924, a referendum was held in 1922 in which the electorate was given a choice between responsible government and entry into the Union of South Africa. Those in favour of responsible government won a significant, but not overwhelming, majority. In 1923, the British government chose not to renew the Company's charter, and instead accorded self-governing colony status to Southern Rhodesia and protectorate status to Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide range}} of liberal {{measures}} were introduced during Wilson's time in office. The Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 made provision {{for the welfare of}} children whose parents were about to divorce or be judicially separated, with courts (for instance) granted wide powers to order <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> for children in the form of maintenance payments made by either parent. This legislation allowed courts to order provision for either spouse and recognised the contribution to the joint home made during marriage. That same year, spouses were given an equal share of household assets following divorce via the Matrimonial Property Act. The Race Relations Act 1968 was also extended in 1968 and in 1970 the Equal Pay Act 1970 was passed. Another important reform, the 1967 Welsh Language Act, granted 'equal validity' to the declining Welsh language and encouraged its revival. Government expenditure was also increased on both sport and the arts. The Mines and Quarries (Tips) Act 1969, passed in response to the Aberfan tragedy, made provision for preventing disused tips from endangering members of the public. In 1967, corporal punishment in borstals and prisons was abolished. 7 regional associations were established to develop the arts, and government expenditure on cultural activities rose from £7.7 million in 1964/64 to £15.3 million in 1968/69. A Criminal Injuries Compensation Board was also set up, which had paid out over £2 million to victims of criminal violence by 1968.|$|E
500|$|Peerson {{then took}} up musical {{studies at the}} University of Oxford. [...] In order to do so, {{he would have had}} to {{subscribe}} to Protestantism. In 1613, he was conferred a Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.) and was appointed Master of the Boys of Canterbury Cathedral. It is possible that he was the [...] "Martin Pearson" [...] who was sacrist at Westminster Abbey from 1623 to 1630. Between June 1624 and June 1625 he returned to St. Paul's Cathedral as almoner and Master of the Choristers; there is also some evidence suggesting he was later made a petty canon. Although all cathedral services ceased at the end of 1642 following the outbreak of the English Civil War, he retained the title of almoner and, along with the other petty canons and the vicars choral, had special <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> made for him. Peerson is known to have been buried on 16 January 1651 in St. Faith's Chapel under St. Paul's. He therefore died in either December 1650 or, more likely, January 1651.|$|E

2500|$|The {{case was}} {{something}} of a cause célèbre and attracted considerable newspaper coverage {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. [...] Arsenic was then regarded by some men as an aphrodisiac and tonic, and James Maybrick had certainly taken it on a regular basis. A city chemist confirmed that he had supplied Maybrick with quantities of the poison over a lengthy period and a search of Battlecrease House later turned up enough to kill at least fifty people. Although her marriage was clearly over in all but name, Florence had little motive to murder her husband. The <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> Maybrick had made for her and his children in his will was paltry and she might have been far better off with him alive but legally separated from her. Many people held the view that Florence had indeed poisoned her husband because he was about to divorce her which, in Victorian society, would see her ruined. An even more compelling motive might have been the prospect of losing the custody of her beloved children.|$|E

2500|$|On marriage, Florence Conybeare {{became the}} 'beneficial owner' of, among other properties, the Tregullow Offices, a small {{dwelling}} and former mine office [...] in Scorrier in the County of Cornwall, {{as part of}} a marriage settlement which her husband, Charles A.V. Conybeare, arranged with various parties including the wealthy merchant banker Isaac Seligman. The marriage settlement was effected by means of a Deed of Trust signed by three moneylenders, two of whom had attended the same public school as Charles Conybeare: Tonbridge School, in Kent, and one family member (uncle). [...] "In those days, a marriage settlement was settled upon the marriage." [...] Such settlements can be compared to prenuptials and {{should not be confused with}} financial settlements made on the dissolution of a marriage. In those days, it was a convenient way for a husband-to-be to make adequate <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> for his wife-to-be. This prevented a wife from otherwise becoming destitute as a result of the husband deserting his wife, or from having to resort to prostitution in order to support herself.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1857 Cotton was {{appointed}} vicar of Frodsham, a market town in north Cheshire. [...] At the time there were problems in the parish, in particular there was little <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> for the outlying townships and {{the fabric of the}} parish church of St Laurence was in a bad condition. [...] To make matters worse, the church stood in an elevated position above the town, making access difficult. [...] Cotton sank into a state of apathy and despondence, and in the autumn of 1865 he was admitted for several weeks to Manor House Asylum, Chiswick, an asylum, under the care of Dr Seymour Tuke. [...] There was some improvement in his mental condition and by 1870 Cotton was making arrangements for the restoration of the parish church. [...] At this time there was competition from other denominations, particularly the Wesleyan Methodists. [...] Financed by Thomas Hazlehurst, {{a member of the family}} business of Hazlehurst & Sons, soap and alkali manufacturers of nearby Runcorn, one small chapel had already been built near the parish church and another chapel, larger and more splendid, was planned for the centre of town. [...] Cotton organised the building of a temporary chapel of ease in the middle of the town. [...] This was constructed of iron (and known as the Iron Church) and was erected in a very short time on land donated by the Marquess of Cholmondeley. [...] In addition to restoring the parish church, Cotton began to organise the restoration of the vicarage, in autumn 1872 hiring John Douglas to draw up plans. [...] He also employed Douglas to design a house for him to live in while the vicarage was being renovated. [...] Cotton successfully improved the provision of church schools in his parish. [...] During his ministry he took boys from his parish to various events, both locally and to Manchester and Liverpool.|$|E
