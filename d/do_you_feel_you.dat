40|$|Background: Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{usually involves}} homework, {{the completion of}} which is a known predictor of a positive outcome. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the session-by-session relationships between enthusiasm to complete the homework and the improvement of psychological distress in depressed people through the course of therapy. Methods: Working people with subthreshold depression were recruited to participate in the telephone CBT (tCBT) program with demonstrated effectiveness. Their enthusiasm for homework was enhanced with motivational interviewing techniques and was measured by asking two questions: "How strongly <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> want to do this homework?" and "How confident <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> can actually accomplish this homework?" at the end of each session. The outcome was the K 6 score, which was administered at the start of each session. The K 6 is an index of psychological distress including depression and anxiety. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate the relationships between enthusiasm and the K 6 scores from session to session. Results: The best fitting model suggested that, throughout the course of behavior therapy (BT), enthusiasm to complete the homework was negatively correlated with the K 6 scores for the subsequent session, while the K 6 score measured at the beginning of the session did not influence the enthusiasm to complete the homeworks assigned for that session. Conclusions: Empirical data now support the practitioners of BT when they try to enhance their patient's enthusiasm for homework regardless of the participant's distress, which then would lead to a reduction in distress in the subsequent week.
