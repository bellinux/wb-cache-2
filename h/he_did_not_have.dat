5|$|After {{the show}} was {{cancelled}} and Sheridan became unemployed, he began writing for the animated television series Family Guy. Although initially skeptical, he accepted the job as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> other options. Sheridan {{was one of the}} first writers hired, and has continued to write for the show through its eleventh season. For his work on Family Guy, he has been nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, a British Academy Television Award, and has won a DVD Exclusive Award.

5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard {{was one of the}} first people he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard said she would become Frakes' godmother, as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he considered it a coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress. Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like herself out of all the roles she has played.|$|E

5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination.

5|$|Diệm {{used the}} Ministry of Information's electoral {{education}} campaign as a partisan political tool.

After explaining what democracy was, a pamphlet outlined why Deposing a chief-of-state is a vital act. After elaborating on {{the powers of the}} head of state, the pamphlet went on to champion Diệm as an anti-communist who could defend people's freedom, while explaining why Bảo Đại was unfit to lead, saying that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> respect among the international community.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} of the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the younger man took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red light, but was released with a reminder when it was determined that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any outstanding warrants.|$|E
5|$|George R. R. Martin {{was already}} a {{successful}} fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his A Song of Ice and Fire book series. Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977. By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of The Twilight Zone throughout 1986 and on Beauty and the Beast until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to worry about compromising {{the size of his}} imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any specific ideas.|$|E

5|$|In November 1984, Larson {{learned about}} a local radio show {{promotion}} promising a $30,000 prize for matching a $1bill's serial number with a random number read {{out on the}} air. Over several days, he withdrew his remaining winnings in $1bills, examined each dollar, and (upon discovering that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the winning number) re-deposited roughly half of the money. Larson left about $50,000 in his house, which was stolen in a burglary while he was attending a Christmas party. The case remains unsolved to this day.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, three MV-22Bs {{were placed}} on alert at Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait to be ready within 30 minutes to recover downed pilots during the Military {{intervention}} against ISIL. On 29 occasions between 1 November and 24 April 2015, two Ospreys and a KC-130J aerial tanker assigned to this Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP) mission spent 145 flight hours loitering, ready to perform rescue missions if required.

5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> legal representation. He argued {{that he should have}} been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being {{the face of his}} sport. He said it is amazing being a role model to younger skaters.

Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but {{he has been able to}} work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E

Foote said when he wrote the script <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the same isolated and lonely vision for the setting Beresford did, but he felt the atmosphere the director captured served the story well.|$|E
