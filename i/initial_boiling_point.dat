Sample has been tested and analyzed at PT. Pertamina RU V Balikpapan laboratory and Department of Transportation Banjar District. The result shows that this fuel is more alike to diesel fuel type according to its Final <b>Boil</b> <b>Point</b> and density. The smoke result shows that synthetic fuel has 19. 73 % and diesel fuel has 29. 67 %. The gas analyses also showed the carbon monoxide of synthetic fuel is 0 % and the carbon monoxide of diesel fuel is 0. 01 %. Both of smoke and gas analyses test of synthetic fuel are less than diesel fuel. Since the distillation process has been done for four to five hours, and the ratio of plastic bucket waste (PP) and plastic bottle waste (PET) is 3 : 1 (PP:PET) so the pressure vessel capacity is 800 grams. 4000 grams of plastic waste is required to produce 1000 mL of synthetic fuel. The cycle time was approximately 20 hours. The sample testing using ASTM D. 1298 method showed that the fuel condition is good and the density 15 oC of temperature of 0. 8031 g/mL.

The technique was used to obtain 13 heavy petroleum cuts from three atmospheric residues (ARs) at 673. 15 K and above. The cuts present <b>initial</b> and final <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> between (673. 15 and 951. 15) K.

In addition, extended true <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> curves of crude oils by simulated distillation and by molecular distillation were compared. An increase in the viscosity and in the density was observed in all cuts with an increased molecular distillation temperature. Such behavior demonstrates that highly polar components that have a high structural complexity, such as resins and asphaltenes, are concentrated at the higher temperatures of the process. A sensitivity analysis of these two properties, together with the temperature, showed that viscosity and density decreased with increased temperature. On the other hand, the thermal expansion coefficient values obtained were equivalent to those reported in literature for petroleum products. Furthermore, a complete characterization of crude oils was made using the molecular distillation process to extend the true <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (TBP) curves...|$|R

In this study, two combined-bed six and seven-lump kinetic models for the hydrocracking of vacuum gas oil in a real refinery are developed and their accuracies for the prediction of product yields are compared. In the six-lump model, the engaged components are selected according to the actual products of the plant, but the seven-lump one is included of lumps which are partitioned based on the specified <b>initial</b> and final <b>boiling</b> <b>points.</b> For both approaches, a complete kinetic network with the catalyst-decay functions is considered.

Additionally, the sum of residuals for the seven-lump model has been appreciably decreased in comparison to the six-lump one.

40|$|AbstractA {{method has}} been {{developed}} to determine experimental equilibrium distillation curves using a modified ASTM D 86 distillation apparatus. The method determines accurate equilibrium initial boiling points and accounts for the dynamic holdup inherent in distillation curves measured {{in accordance with the}} ASTM D 86 standard. In this work, the ASTM D 86 distillation setup has been modified to simultaneously measure liquid and vapor temperature using two resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) and a data acquisition system has been employed to record temperature data at one-second time intervals for the duration of each distillation. Additionally, the time for each volume recovery point is recorded. The method presented here uses the time-resolved liquid temperature data to identify the true <b>initial</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (IBP) of four fuel mixtures of known composition; the IBPs are within 2 °C of the calculated equilibrium values. The time-resolved volume recovery information and the identified <b>initial</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> time are used to construct a volume evaporated versus time curve. The measured temperatures determined at the corresponding volume evaporated increments provide an experimental equilibrium distillation curve (EEDC). The EEDCs for the four fuel mixtures of known composition match the calculated equilibrium curves within a few degrees Celsius; a maximum mean absolute error of 2. 2 ± 1. 4 °C was observed. The dynamic holdup (volume difference between volume evaporated and volume recovered) associated with a distillation is found to correlate with the <b>initial</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of the fuel being distilled and the temperature of the condenser bath used in the experiment. The method was also applied to measure EEDCs for a gasoline fuel and a diesel fuel, where the compositions were unknown, to investigate the differences between the EEDCs and the ASTM D 86 distillation curves. The results highlight the large errors incurred when using ASTM D 86 results to approximate equilibrium distillation curves...|$|E
