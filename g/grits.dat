40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources, Wildlife, 2007 Arctic geese {{arriving}} at spring stopover areas are under strict time constraints to build-up endogenous fat and nutrient stores before migrating to their northern breeding grounds. Gizzard <b>grit</b> facilitates the mechanical breakdown of ingested food plants, aiding efficient digestion and potentially influencing daily energy budget {{decisions made by}} birds. <b>Grit</b> {{can also be a}} significant source of important minerals such as calcium. I investigated whether black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) in Humboldt Bay, California used a traditional <b>gritting</b> site in a manner that facilitated ???optimal <b>grit???</b> ingestion. Based on past <b>grit</b> studies and my own comparison of <b>grit</b> in brant gizzards to <b>grit</b> available on the traditional <b>gritting</b> site, I defined optimal brant <b>grit</b> as large <b>grit</b> with a potential to provide supplemental calcium. I found that: (1) brant were present at the <b>grit</b> site at lower tides when the best <b>grit</b> became available, despite eelgrass (the birds??? primary food source) also becoming available at that time; (2) brant flocks were positioned over sections of the <b>gritting</b> site with the best grit; and (3) <b>grit</b> ingestion behavior increased when the best <b>grit</b> was available. Data suggest that some brant staging in Humboldt Bay strive to balance trade-offs between departing to feeding areas and selectively ingesting better <b>grit</b> to meet specific physiological needs...|$|R

30|$|Overall, {{this study}} {{examined}} the relationship between personality traits and entrepreneurial intent considering the influence of <b>grit.</b> Our study made a unique contribution in that we introduced <b>grit</b> as a potential mechanism through which personality traits relate to entrepreneurial intent. The results confirmed that there was a strong positive association between <b>grit</b> and entrepreneurial intentions. It was also found that <b>grit</b> shared a significant positive correlation with both agreeableness and conscientiousness. Conversely, there was a significant negative correlation between <b>grit</b> and neuroticism. When the sample was segmented into high and low <b>grit</b> participants, the high <b>grit</b> participants emerged as having significantly higher means scores for entrepreneurial intent than their counterparts in the low <b>grit</b> group. We also found that in comparison with the low <b>grit</b> group, high <b>grit</b> participants had higher means scores for agreeableness and conscientiousness, and lower means scores for neuroticism. Lastly, the data indicated that <b>grit</b> fully mediated the predictive effect of conscientious and neuroticism on entrepreneurial intent.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>grit</b> and student-athlete academic and sport performance. An exploratory study was conducted using a case study methodology, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative research. The <b>Grit</b> Short Scale (Duckworth, 2007) was employed on student-athletes at an NCAA Division II university in the American Southwest Rocky Mountain Region. Results included a positive correlation between student-athlete <b>grit</b> level and informant <b>grit</b> report, indicating that student-athlete consistently rated their <b>grit</b> higher than their coach rated their <b>grit.</b> Also, in this case study, <b>grit</b> does not account for more predictive value of college academic performance than traditional factors of academic success of college student-athletes.

5|$|In July and August 2015 the {{restaurant}} was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and <b>grits.</b> Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the <b>grits,</b> until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
5|$|The stones {{themselves}} are small; on average they measure 0.1 metre (4 inches) in height, 0.3 metre (one foot) in width, and 0.1 metres (4 inches) thick. The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) above the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely {{have been broken}} since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not known}} if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, a sample was taken from one stone and under examination revealed to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down <b>grits.</b> There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E
50|$|Concrete can be {{polished}} with Mechanical grinders {{and diamond}} pads of increasing <b>grit</b> sizes.Diamond pads come in many <b>grit</b> or mesh sizes. Common sizes start with 6 <b>grit</b> and {{can go up}} to 8500 <b>grit</b> although concrete can only maintain a shine of about 800 <b>grit,</b> it can be helped by adding a concrete hardener such as sodium silicate or lithium silicate which will allow concrete to hold a 1800 through 3000 <b>grit</b> shine. The work is accomplished in multiple stages by passing over the concrete with successive <b>grit</b> diamond pads until it has a hard-glassy finish. Both acid stains and concrete dyes can be used during the polishing process.|$|R

5|$|Exmoor is an upland area formed almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, 'Devonian', comes from Devon, as rocks of that age were first studied and described here. With {{the exception of a}} suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly 'Formation') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly 'Group'). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman <b>Grits</b> were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, acid soil.|$|E
5|$|In early 1872, Macdonald {{submitted}} the treaty for ratification, and {{it passed the}} Commons with a majority of 66. The general election was held through late August and early September (future Canadian elections would be conducted, {{for the most part}}, on one day). Redistribution had given Ontario increased representation in the House; Macdonald spent much time campaigning in the province, for the most part outside Kingston. Widespread bribery of voters took place throughout Canada, a practice especially effective in the era when votes were publicly declared; in future elections the secret ballot would be used. Macdonald and the Conservatives saw their majority reduced from 35 to 8. The Liberals (as the <b>Grits</b> were coming to be known) did better than the Conservatives in Ontario, forcing the government to rely on the votes of Western and Maritime MPs who did not fully support the party.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals, or <b>Grits,</b> {{maintained}} {{power in}} the 1851 election, but soon, they were divided by a parliamentary scandal. In September, the government resigned, and a coalition government uniting parties from both parts of the province under Sir Allan MacNab took power. Macdonald did {{much of the work}} of putting the government together and served as Attorney General. The coalition which came to power in 1854 became known as the Liberal-Conservatives (referred to, for short, as the Conservatives). In 1855, George-Étienne Cartier of Canada East (today Quebec) joined the Cabinet. Until Cartier's 1873 death, he would be Macdonald's political partner. In 1856, MacNab was eased out as premier by Macdonald, who became the leader of the Canada West Conservatives. Though {{the most powerful man in}} the government he remained as Attorney General, with Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché as premier.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{ingestion}} of spent Pb shot due to confusion with <b>grit</b> or inadvertently with food particles causes Pb poisoning {{in a large}} number of waterbirds, this being one of the main causes of mortality for some species. Lead ammunition for hunting is being progressively banned in more countries, while <b>grit</b> supplementation has been proposed as a management measure to reduce the {{ingestion of}} deposited Pb shot. Studies of <b>grit</b> selection with waterfowl in semi-captivity and in the wild were undertaken to evaluate preferences in the colour and geochemical composition of <b>grit,</b> whether it was available dry or in water, its position within the wetland and the relationship between <b>grit</b> ingestion and feeding behaviour. <b>Grit</b> ingestion was higher when food was included in the treatments. In the absence of food, red <b>grit</b> was taken in higher amounts than grey in semi-captivity but not in the wild. Siliceous <b>grit</b> was taken in a higher amount than calcareous when offered dry, but not in water. No differences in the amount of ingested <b>grit</b> were found among different positions within the wetland. The number of feeding attempts in plots supplemented with <b>grit</b> was higher than in those without <b>grit,</b> although the highest numbers of feeding birds were found in plots supplemented with food. <b>Grit</b> ingestion in waterfowl is intimately associated with feeding behaviour. To optimize the effectiveness of <b>grit</b> supplementation {{to reduce the risk of}} Pb poisoning in waterfowl, calcareous and siliceous <b>grit</b> may be combined and applied in feeding sites or mixed with bait to attract birds...|$|R

Further, <b>grit</b> contributes unique predictive validity over the Big Five.|$|R
5|$|The Quantock Hills {{are largely}} formed by rocks of the Devonian Period, which consist of sediments {{originally}} laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into solid rock. In the higher north western areas older Early Devonian rocks, known as Hangman <b>Grits,</b> predominate, {{and can be}} seen in the exposed rock at West Quantoxhead quarry, which were worked for road building. Further south there are newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, there is a limestone cave, which is the only one in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger rocks of the Triassic period, these are known as New Red Sandstone rocks which represent the deposits of large river systems that crossed a desert plain, and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was worked on the foreshore at Watchet. The scarp is to the west with a dip slope to the east. The west side is cut by combes with broad valleys on the east. The hill tops are open heathland with woods on the slopes.|$|E
5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as <b>grits.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Historically, {{there are}} three broad grades of Japanese {{sharpening}} stones: the ara-to, or [...] "rough stone", the naka-to or [...] "middle/medium stone" [...] and the shiage-to or [...] "finishing stone". There is a fourth type of stone, the nagura, which is not used directly. Rather, {{it is used to}} form a cutting slurry on the shiage-to, which is often too hard to create the necessary slurry. Converting these names to absolute <b>grit</b> size is difficult as the classes are broad and natural stones have no inherent [...] "grit number". As an indication, ara-to is probably (using a non-Japanese system of grading <b>grit</b> size) 500-1000 <b>grit.</b> The naka-to is probably 3000-5000 <b>grit</b> and the shiage-to is likely 7000-10000 <b>grit.</b> Current synthetic <b>grit</b> values range from extremely coarse, such as 120 <b>grit,</b> through extremely fine, such as 30,000 <b>grit</b> (less than half a micrometer abrasive particle size).|$|R

5000|$|The <b>grit</b> measure {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Big Five personality model, which are a group of broad personality dimensions consisting of openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. [...] In one study by Duckworth and Quinn (2009), the Short <b>Grit</b> Scale (Grit-S) and 12-item self-report measure of <b>grit</b> (Grit-O) measuring <b>grit</b> was strongly correlated with conscientiousness (r = [...]77, p <.001 and r = [...]73, p <.001). A large study of twins measuring both conscientiousness and <b>grit</b> found that they had a genetic correlation of 0.86. A subsequent meta-analysis found that the <b>grit</b> was functionally a measure of conscientiousness. Despite these high correlations with conscientiousness, it is suggested that <b>grit</b> is more strongly associated with longer term and multi-year goals such as education. [...] Large studies suggest only weak links of <b>grit</b> to these long term goals, much smaller than links to IQ and to conscientiousness. <b>Grit</b> is also similar to need for achievement, but is suggested to relate to extremely long-term goals pursued without positive feedback, while need for achievement is suggested to lack this long-term component.|$|R
25|$|<b>Grit</b> {{was highly}} {{correlated}} with the Big Five conscientiousness trait.
