5|$|Mating in {{hartebeest}} {{takes place}} throughout the year, {{with one or}} two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female's genitalia, and follows her if she is in oestrus. Sometimes a female in oestrus holds out her tail slightly to signal her receptivity, and the male tries to block the female's way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.|$|E
5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Paramore holding {{electric}} guitars, heading towards {{the side of}} a bridge. They begin smashing clocks with guitars on a roadside, and a title screen appears, announcing that the band broke the record of smashing 30 clocks with guitars— at a time of 31.33 seconds. The camera shifts to a room where the group attempts to catch flying feathers; Davis breaks the record of catching the most (18) feathers in 30 s. The next scene shows the group wearing eye goggles, in a room with white walls, destroying vinyl records in several ways—such as ripping them, stepping on them or punching them. The band breaks another record, after smashing 58 vinyl records <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> the highest number of broken records for that time. While the band is destroying more records, York makes a record as an individual by spinning a record on his finger for 32.81 s—the least time ever for that accomplishment.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E

25|$|The Lions started strongly, with captain Gareth Thomas {{scoring a}} try under the posts and Jonny Wilkinson {{converting}} two minutes <b>in.</b> <b>A</b> <b>minute</b> later, Wilkinson hit the post with a penalty attempt, but gathering the rebound the Lions {{were in a}} good attacking position when Paul O'Connell was penalised for diving over a ruck. The All Blacks settled down and then scored through two Daniel Carter penalties before he set up their first try, racing 50 metres off a turnover before offloading to captain Tana Umaga to score near the posts. Although {{the rest of the}} half remained close, the All Blacks went into the break with a 21–13 lead.|$|E
25|$|The sundew genus (Drosera) {{consists}} of over 100 species of active flypapers whose mucilage glands are borne {{at the end}} of long tentacles, which frequently grow fast enough in response to prey (thigmotropism) to aid the trapping process. The tentacles of D. burmanii can bend 180° <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so. Sundews are extremely cosmopolitan and are found on all the continents except the Antarctic mainland. They are most diverse in Australia, the home to the large subgroup of pygmy sundews such as D. pygmaea and to a number of tuberous sundews such as D. peltata, which form tubers that aestivate during the dry summer months. These species are so dependent on insect sources of nitrogen that they generally lack the enzyme nitrate reductase, which most plants require to assimilate soil-borne nitrate into organic forms.|$|E
25|$|Blake Sims {{threw his}} second {{interception}} {{of the game}} {{early in the fourth}} quarter, though the Buckeyes were unable to capitalize off of the turnover. An 85-yard touchdown run from Ezekiel Elliott with less than four minutes in the game, gave the Buckeyes 42–28, after the successful two-point conversion. Alabama went 65 yards <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and a half on their next possession, scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass from Sims to Amari Cooper, to cut the game again to one possession. The game ended on a Hail Mary pass from Sims that was intercepted by Tyvis Powell, giving Ohio State the 42–35 victory. For their achievements, running back Ezekiel Elliott was named the offensive MVP of the game, and Darron Lee was named the defensive MVP. With the win, Ohio State improved their record against the Crimson Tide to 1–3.|$|E

25|$|Ekaterina Sknarina is a model, actress, contortionist, aerial {{artist and}} former {{international}} gymnast. She {{was born in}} Russia and competed at world championship level for the Russian rhythmic gymnastics team. She later trained as an aerial artist with Cirque du Soleil. After re-locating to New York she began working as a contortionist in the burgeoning new burlesque scene. She also began working as a model and appeared in magazines including FHM, One World, and GQ. She added the role of target girl to her portfolio after meeting knife thrower The Great Throwdini. In 2005 {{she was one of}} the stars of the off-Broadway show Maximum Risk, during which she helped set two world records for the number of knives thrown around a human target <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> She was Miss Coney Island 2007.

25|$|The {{majority}} of Mesopotamian clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics which include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and {{the calculation of}} regular reciprocal pairs. The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving linear and quadratic equations. The Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of √2 accurate to five decimal places. Babylonian mathematics were written using a sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, {{as well as the}} use of minutes and seconds of arc to denote fractions of a degree. Babylonian advances in mathematics were facilitated by the fact that 60 has many divisors: the reciprocal of any integer which is a multiple of divisors of 60 has a finite expansion in base 60. (In decimal arithmetic, only reciprocals of multiples of 2 and 5 have finite decimal expansions.) Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the decimal system. They lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.|$|E
25|$|Wet-season form: Upperside: from dull {{somewhat}} pale brown to dark brown, some specimens nearly uniform, {{others with}} {{a more or less}} distinct pale discal patch on the forewing. Hindwing: uniform; a slender short filamentous tail at apex of vein 1, very often absent. Underside: white. Forewing: with the following brown markings: a spot in cell, a transverse short line on the discocellulars, a postdiscal curved series of transverse spots or very short bars that cross the wing from costa to dorsum and are in irregular echelon one with the other, followed by a slender transverse broken line, a subterminal series of broader transverse spots and an anticiliary slender line; at apex of wing the markings are diffuse and form a very small brown-shaded patch, while further inwards along the costa veins 10, 11 and 12 terminate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> brown dot. Hindwing: three spots near base in transverse order, a large, conspicuous, rounded, subcostal and a smaller similar spot near the middle of the dorsum, black; between the latter two and also along the discocellulars are some irregular much paler brown transverse spots on the disc, which are followed as on the forewing by an outer postdiscal, very slender brown line, a subterminal series of brown or black spots, and a black anticiliary line. Cilia of forewings and hindwings white, turning to dark brown at apex of forewing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown, the antenna ringed narrowly with white; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen snow-white, the third, slender acicular joint of the palpi conspicuously brown.|$|E

25|$|Babylonian {{mathematics}} {{were written}} using a sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, {{as well as}} the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. It is likely the sexagesimal system was chosen because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30. Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the decimal system. The power of the Babylonian notational system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different than multiplying integers, similar to our modern notation. The notational system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the Renaissance, and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computation accuracy and power; for example, the Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of √2 accurate to five decimal places. The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context. By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however it was only used for intermediate positions. This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions, thus the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.|$|E
