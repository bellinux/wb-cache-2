40|$|Supplier {{relationship}} {{management is}} often {{brought up in}} today’s business environment and organizational re-structuring is occurring all around us. Supplier relations and organizational change can during certain circumstances conflict with each other. Therefore {{the purpose of this}} study is to find out how opportunities and threats in supplier portfolio management as an outcome of supplier responsibility transfer during an organizational re-structuring, in an assembly industry, can be characterized. In order to find opportunities and threats we have looked into supplier relationship management and experiences and expectations on current and future relationships. To gain knowledge about supplier relationships and relationship management a literature overview has been performed. To answer the research problem the theory pointed us towards certain concepts like types of relationships, management of relationships, relationship commitment, trust and power balance which constitute the base for the frame of reference. A qualitative case study has been performed at Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery in Finspång, Sweden (SIT Finspång) and at Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery in Lincoln, England (SIT Lincoln). There is currently an ongoing supplier transfer between SIT Lincoln and SIT Finspång. This means that SIT Finspång is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> doing business <b>with</b> some of SIT Lincolns current suppliers. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted with purchasers at SIT Finspång and SIT Lincoln, as well as with suppliers to both sites, to get the full view of the relationships. Those interviews lead to nine cases. Three of the cases are constituted by the suppliers Camfil, Certex and Finspångs Allmekano and their three purchasers at SIT Finspång. The suppliers Cullum, Rossedale, and Keweld and their three purchasers at SIT Lincoln constitute another three cases. The final three cases are composed of the new relationships between the purchasers at SIT Finspång and the suppliers Cullum, Rossendale and Keweld. Further on the data collected has been analyzed in within case analysis and later on a cross-case analysis has been performed to reveal differences among the supplier relationships. Those differences have been further enlightened in the findings and lead to conclusions about the research problem. It has been concluded that there are differences in how suppliers are managed at SIT Finspång and SIT Lincoln. Furthermore differences in the utilization of strategic and operational purchasers at SIT Finspång and SIT Lincoln were found. It was also concluded that the degree of relationship commitment in the current relationships was not so good, but the expectations regarding trust looked promising for the new relationships. More conclusions were made and even though many of them can be seen as threats in a supplier transfer, the awareness of them means that they can be turned into opportunities.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this talk}} we provide a {{detailed}} account of the formal, functional and semantic changes that be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> underwent in Late Modern English. We know the history of be <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> a classic of grammaticalization studies (see Traugott 2012 for a recent overview), in quite some detail. Specifically for the late modern period, the period of be <b>going</b> <b>to’s</b> maturation, Disney (2009) hypothesises that be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> extended from encoding intention to encoding prediction through increased guessing of other people’s intentions, resulting in its evidential semantics. While invaluable, Disney’s study is based on a limited corpus, and mostly qualitative in nature. We test and refine Disney’s hypothesis, and integrate it into the theory of subjectification (in the sense of Traugott 1989), {{on the basis of a}} large-scale corpus study. Despite be <b>going</b> <b>to’s</b> popularity, such studies remain rare. A recent large-scale study has focused on the initial stages of this process (Petré & Van de Velde 2014), but similar studies are still lacking for the late modern period. Hilpert (2008) provides some insight in the extension to new types of infinitive, but does not really go into details regarding the underlying mechanisms of change. Data are based on an extensive sample from CLMETEV (De Smet, Diller & Tyrkkö 2011) complemented by exhaustive data from PPCMBE (Kroch, Santorini & Diertani 2010). In total, 1257 attestations were analysed on quantifiable, mostly formal features at various levels of the construction, such as contraction of be (substantive level), extension to new subject types (e. g. raised, empty subjects) and types of infinitives (e. g., states rather than actions) (schematic level), and the sentence type and presence of epistemic and evidential marking (level of the host clause). The corpus data reveal that the shift from intention <b>to</b> prediction <b>started</b> <b>to</b> take place in the first half of the eighteenth century, and originated in contexts with third person subjects, often in past tense narratives. Naturally, reporting the intention of others generally involves a certain amount of guesswork. This amount increased by the middle of the eighteenth century, when be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> occur <b>with</b> non-imminent infinitival complements. This naturally resulted in an additional, epistemic layer of prediction that gradually gained strength during the second half of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, allowed the underlying meaning of intention to wither, and the construction to become more and more frequent in the present tense. The shift from intention to prediction is arguably an increase in subjectivity, as the emphasis gradually moved away from the grammatical subject to the speaker: what mattered was no longer the intentions of the subject, but the knowledge of the speaker about them. Traugott (1989) shows that other English epistemic auxiliaries such as will and shall go through a similar stage of subjectification. Interestingly, while there are significant differences between will, shall, and be <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> it appears that each goes through an intermediary stage that involved past tense uses with reference to a future in the past, which was already known to the speaker. From a theoretical point of view, our analysis provides further evidence for recent claims (e. g. De Smet 2012) that grammaticalization follows minimally disruptive pathways, taking the smallest steps possible in the development, and at the same time shows that recurring patterns may be found at this smallest level as well...|$|R

V příspěvku jsou podány informace o specifikách jízdy kolejového vozidla s nezávisle otáčivými koly v kolejové dráze, o očekávaných přínosech synchronizovaného řízení a o konstrukci speciálního vozidla, na kterém je připravován experimentální výzkum v této oblasti. The biggest part of now {{manufactured}} tram-cars {{is realized}} as a low-floor vehicles. It is very pleasant for passengers, but it brings many difficulties for technical construction {{of such a}} this tramcars. The biggest problem is construction of bogies - it is common, that in the height of classical shaft is the floor, {{so it is not}} possible to use classical mounted axle and it is necessary to use free wheels. The characteristics of classical mounted axle in the rail is quite well known for many years, nor the the characteristics of free wheels, so there is lot of space for research, and more - there is lot of space, how to use features of free wheels, that should be better in the curves, than features of mounted axle. This - and the fact, that Skoda Transportation now manufactures tram-cars type 15 T called ForCity, that are using free-wheels driven by low speed gear-less PMSM - let us <b>to</b> <b>start</b> research project <b>with</b> cooperation with Skoda Electric a VUKV. The project is focused on optimization of control algorithms for upper control system for such a this vehicles. The project has three steps. The first step is simulation of free-wheel driven tram-car in the rail and developement of control algorithms on this simulation. The second step is project and construction of special narrow-track experimental rail car, that would be used for experiments and verification of the algorithms. The last step should be implementation of developed algorithms to control systems of real tram. The experimental rail car is projected as a accumulator powered vehicle with four free wheels driven by four gear-less PMSM suplied from four voltage inverters. These inverters are controled in current, velocity and torque loop by DSPs. The upper control system is realized by National Instruments Compact RIO system, which was chosen because of its good mechanical construction and possibility of graphical programming.

40|$|Sisimiut, {{the second}} largest {{settlement}} {{of the country is}} the northernmost town with an ice free harbour. It is very important for the fishing industry of the country. Its harbour consists of two main quays, the Atlantic and the Fisher. These facilities have been outstripped due to the rapidly increase in number of calls and volume of TEU per year mainly during 2004 to 2006. With this reasoning, a need of an extension of the harbour has become real, and this Thesis is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> its study <b>with</b> the analysis in two different fields: on-shore and off-shore. The on-shore is mainly studied to characterize the rock mass structure and its material. The structure of the rock mass is needed for tunnelling operations, which are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> provide a space used as a warehouse, by Royal Greenland. This has been studied on-site and its safest orientation was 172 º clockwise from the North. The material found in the area has been Charnockite (which is similar to granite). The off-shore part of study includes an extraction of sediment samples and a scan of the sea bed. The first operation has been carried out by a mechanic grab and has ended up with an asymmetric distribution of sediments in Sisimiut Bay. In the front coast, very muddy sediments are accumulated, which entailed shallow depths. On the contrary, in the coastline where the current harbour lays nowadays, larger depths have been found as well as a more rocky sea bed. Continuing this first interpretation, a numerical analysis of the wave dynamics, generated by wind, with a fetch of around 400 km is set-up. For its computation, the worst case of water level has been implemented together with the worst wind direction and the worst speed acting constantly during 24 h in the whole domain. The main significant results have been: Significant Wave Height≈ 2. 3 meters and Mean Wave Period≈ 8 seconds. The wave direction tends to lead the wave trains to the innermost part of the Bay. In the last part of this Thesis, the Final Design, the best location for the extension is thought to be in the Atlantic and Fisher quay, distributing the total berth length into two different parts. On one hand, the Atlantic quay is thought to be focused just on container cargo handling. Its extension will increase more than 1. 5 times the area of the current quay. On the other hand, the Fisher quay is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be divided in two different alienations, the first one for the trawlers cargo handling, which will double its actual surface, and the other one, totally new, for passenger ships calls, extending an open berth along the coastline to the left. Finally the anchorage area has not represented a problem due to sufficient space on the Bay, or in unexpected conditions, placed off-shore...|$|R
