5|$|Featuring {{a compact}} bullpup design with an {{integrated}} reflex sight and fully ambidextrous controls, the P90 is an unconventional weapon with a futuristic appearance. Its design incorporates several innovations {{such as a}} unique top-mounted magazine and FN's small-caliber, <b>high-velocity</b> 5.7×28mm ammunition.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} two billion years, the accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc. A galaxy will continue to absorb infalling material from <b>high-velocity</b> clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life. This matter is mostly hydrogen and helium. The cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements, eventually allowing the formation of planets.|$|E
5|$|In Israel, CS gas was {{reported}} to be the cause of death of Jawaher Abu Rahmah on 31 December 2010; other reports suggest that he was killed by the impact of a <b>high-velocity</b> CS gas canister to the chest. In Egypt, CS gas {{was reported}} to be the cause of death of several protesters in Mohamed Mahmoud Street near Tahrir square during the November 2011 protests.|$|E
5|$|The {{main and}} halo rings consist of dust {{ejected from the}} moons Metis, Adrastea, and other unobserved parent bodies {{as the result of}} <b>high-velocity</b> impacts. High-resolution images {{obtained}} in February and March 2007 by the New Horizons spacecraft revealed a rich fine structure in the main ring.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A <b>high-velocity</b> gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E
5|$|Helium must be {{extracted}} from natural gas {{because it is}} present in air at {{only a fraction of}} that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with <b>high-velocity</b> protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A <b>high-velocity</b> gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in the second wave. They were engaged before they hit the beach, {{and three of the}} landing craft that the Commandos were travelling in were hit by <b>high-velocity</b> shells. Casualties were high, with No. 6 Troop suffering at least 20 wounded, but in the end they were lower than had been expected.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30, Egyptian forces {{captured}} Fort Lahtzanit, {{the first}} fortification of the Bar Lev Line to fall, {{and by then}} the infantry had been reinforced with 82mm B-10 and 107mm B-11 rifles. At the same time, engineers began operating their water pumps against the sand wall, opening the first passage {{in less than an}} hour, and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal. By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 men (around 4,700 at each bridgehead). Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. The Egyptians had <b>high-velocity</b> 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the <b>high-velocity</b> members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, <b>high-velocity</b> stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E
5|$|Jamal {{was taken}} {{at first to}} the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had {{received}} multiple wounds from <b>high-velocity</b> bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and {{the lower part of}} both legs; his femoral artery was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{significant}} {{to the design}} of the P90 is the small-caliber, <b>high-velocity</b> bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0g (93grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it produces roughly 30percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber <b>high-velocity</b> gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar is an {{orthodox}} single-seat, swept-wing, twin-engine monoplane design, with tall tricycle-type retractable landing gear. In its original configuration, {{it had a}} maximum take-off weight in the 15 tonne class; and could manage a combat radius on internal fuel alone of , giving the Jaguar a greater operational range than competitor aircraft such as the Mikoyan MiG-27. The aircraft had hardpoints fitted for an external weapons load of up to 10,000lb (4,500kg), typical weapons fitted included the MATRA LR.F2 rocket pod, BAP 100-mm bombs, MATRA AS37 anti-radar missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, and Rockeye cluster bombs. The RAF's Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Gulf War, including CRV7 <b>high-velocity</b> rockets and American CBU-87 cluster bombs. Finally, the Jaguar was equipped with either a pair of French DEFA cannons, or alternatively British Aden cannons.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the North Korean 7th Division troops {{committed}} all {{of their}} effort into attacking the US 35th Infantry line. At 23:30 on August 31, a North Korean SU-76 self-propelled <b>high-velocity</b> gun from across the Nam fired shells into the position of G Company, 35th Infantry, overlooking the river. Within a few minutes, North Korean artillery was attacking all front-line rifle companies of the regiment from the Namji-ri bridge west. Under cover of this fire a reinforced regiment of the NK 7th Division crossed the Nam River and attacked F and G Companies, 35th Infantry. Other North Korean soldiers crossed the Nam on an underwater bridge {{in front of the}} paddy ground north of Komam-ni and near the boundary between the 2nd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins, Jr., holding the river front and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard G. Teeter's 1st Battalion holding the hill line that stretched from the Nam River to Sibidang-san and the Chinju-Masan highway. The 35th Infantry, facing shortages of equipment and reinforcements, was under-equipped but nonetheless prepared for an attack.|$|E

25|$|T-34/57: Fewer than 324 T-34s in 1941 and 1943–44 were {{fitted with}} the ZiS-4 or the ZIS-4M <b>high-velocity</b> 57mm gun {{to be used}} as tank hunters.|$|E
25|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} operation used to cut keyways into shafts. Electron beam machining (EBM) is a machining process where <b>high-velocity</b> electrons are directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. Ultrasonic machining uses ultrasonic vibrations to machine very hard or brittle materials.|$|E
25|$|Project {{drawings}} of the K-8 show a K-series airframe powered by the two-stage DB 605L high altitude engine, a <b>high-velocity</b> 30mm (1.18in) MK 103 Motorkanone, and two 30mm (1.18in) MK 108 cannons in the wings; the cowl 13mm (.51in) MG 131s were dispensed with.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, SpaceX {{announced}} that they had signed a three-year lease for land and facilities at Spaceport America {{in order to support}} high-altitude, <b>high-velocity</b> flight testing of the Grasshopper v1.1 reusable launch vehicle (RLV), the second generation of the SpaceX experimental vertical takeoff, vertical landing suborbital technology-demonstrator.|$|E
25|$|VLA {{observations}} of NH3 in seven regions with <b>high-velocity</b> gaseous outflows revealed condensations {{of less than}} 0.1 pc in L1551, S140, and Cepheus A. Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A, one of them with a highly elongated shape. They may {{play an important role}} in creating the bipolar outflow in the region.|$|E
25|$|Washington D.C.'s The Faith took {{hardcore}} punk to {{new places}} in the early 1980s. Even during their existence, their music hinted at what was to come, softening the standard-issue hardcore approach somewhat with better-developed melodies and a more inward-looking perspective. To be sure, it was high-energy, <b>high-velocity</b> punk, but its subtle deviations from the norm opened up new vistas for the D.C. scene.|$|E
25|$|Brilliant Pebbles was a non-nuclear {{system of}} satellite-based interceptors {{designed}} to use <b>high-velocity,</b> watermelon-sized, teardrop-shaped projectiles made of tungsten as kinetic warheads. It {{was designed to}} operate {{in conjunction with the}} Brilliant Eyes sensor system. The project was conceived in November 1986 by Lowell Wood at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Detailed studies were undertaken by several advisory boards, including the Defense Science Board and JASON, in 1989.|$|E
25|$|All {{nine of the}} {{previously}} known Uranian rings were studied by the instruments of Voyager 2. These measurements showed that the Uranian rings are distinctly different from those at Jupiter and Saturn. The Uranian ring system might be relatively young, {{and it did not}} form {{at the same time that}} Uranus did. The particles that make up the rings might be the remnants of a moon that was broken up by either a <b>high-velocity</b> impact or torn up by tidal effects.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, an Israeli {{delegation}} visited France {{to examine}} the new AMX 13 light tank. The tank was armed with the <b>high-velocity</b> 75mm gun CN 75-50. While the gun was satisfactory, the armor of the French tank was considered too light. Eventually, Israel did purchase the AMX 13, however in a parallel development {{it was decided to}} graft the powerful French gun onto the available, familiar and better-armored hull of the American M4 Sherman, the standard tank of the IDF armored units in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Robotic {{oxy-fuel}} cutters sometimes use {{a high-speed}} divergent nozzle. This uses an oxygen jet that opens slightly along its passage. This allows the compressed oxygen to expand as it leaves, forming a <b>high-velocity</b> jet that spreads {{less than a}} parallel-bore nozzle, allowing a cleaner cut. These are not used for cutting by hand since they need very accurate positioning above the work. Their ability to produce almost any shape from large steel plates gives them a secure future in shipbuilding and in many other industries.|$|E
25|$|The {{adoption}} of the M16, the H, and the 5.56×45mm cartridge inspired an international trend towards relatively small-sized, lightweight, <b>high-velocity</b> military service cartridges that allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to the larger and heavier 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. The 5.56mm cartridge is also much easier to shoot. In 1961 marksmanship testing, the U.S. Army found that 43% of ArmaLite AR-15 shooters achieved Expert, while only 22% of M-14 rifle shooters did so. Also, a lower recoil impulse, allows for more controllable automatic weapons fire.|$|E
25|$|Hope-Jones {{believed}} that higher wind pressures would allow pipes to more accurately imitate orchestral instruments by causing the pipes to produce harmonic overtones which, when mixed with other pipe ranks, produced tones more imitative of actual instruments. The high wind pressures {{also led to}} the development of instruments that are unique in theatre organs (such as the diaphone and tibia clausa), and allowed any rank in the organ to function as a solo instrument. These higher pressures were possible due to the development of <b>high-velocity,</b> motor-driven blowers and wind regulators.|$|E
25|$|HK has {{a history}} of {{innovation}} in firearms, {{such as the use of}} polymers in weapon designs and the use of an integral rail for flashlights on handguns. HK also developed modern polygonal rifling, noted for its high accuracy, increased muzzle velocity and barrel life. Not all of its technologically ambitious designs have translated into commercially successful products (for instance, the advanced but now abandoned G11 military rifle, which fired caseless <b>high-velocity</b> ammunition). In its extensive product range, HK has used the following operating systems for small arms: blowback operation, short-recoil, roller-delayed blowback, gas-delayed blowback, and gas operation (via Short-stroke piston).|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 1990, the IRA {{attempted}} to kill Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Terry at his Staffordshire home. Terry {{had been a}} prime target since his days as Governor of Gibraltar, where he signed the documents allowing the SAS to pursue IRA members. The attack took place at 9pm at the Main Road house. The gunman opened fire through a window hitting Sir Peter at least nine times and injuring his wife near one of her eyes. The couple's daughter {{was found to be}} suffering from shock. Terry's face had to be rebuilt as the shots shattered his face and two <b>high-velocity</b> bullets were within millimetres of his brain.|$|E
25|$|On the Boeing YC-14, the upper-surface-blowing {{design for}} high {{aerodynamic}} lift used two jet engines that blew <b>high-velocity</b> airstreams over the inboard {{section of the}} wing and over special trailing-edge flaps. The large multisection flaps extended rearward and downward from the wing's trailing edge to increase the wing area, thus creating extra lift, which was further augmented by positioning the engines so their jet blast across the upper wing surfaces created still more lift. In addition, {{the placement of the}} engines above the wing prevented the engines from ingesting dirt and debris and shielded some of the engine noise from the ground so that the transport could make a quieter approach.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} stages of {{embryonic}} vascular remodelling, <b>high-velocity</b> flow {{is not present}} solely in large-diameter vessels, but this corrects itself due {{to the effects of}} vascular remodelling over the first two days of blood flow. It is known that embryonic vessels respond to increases in pressure by increasing the diameter of the vessel. Due to the absence of smooth muscle cells and the glycocalyx, which provide elastic support in adult vessels, blood vessels in the developing embryo are much more resistant to flow. This means that increases in flow or pressure can only be answered by rapid, semi-permanent expansion of the vessel diameter, rather than by more gradual stretch and expansion experienced in adult blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|The D-10 is a <b>high-{{velocity}}</b> gun of 100mm bore diameter, with {{a barrel}} length of 53.5 calibres. Muzzle velocity of 895m/s gave it good anti-tank performance by late-war standards. Initially it could penetrate about 164mm of steel armor plate at 1,000m range, {{superior to the}} German 75mm KwK 42 mounted on the Panther tank and the Tiger I's 88mm KwK 36 gun. Testing against Panther tanks at Kubinka showed the D-10T could penetrate the Panther's glacis up to 1500 m. This performance grew when APDS and more modern ammunition types were developed after the war. After the war a more effective high-explosive shell was also developed, {{taking advantage of the}} larger 100mm bore.|$|E
25|$|After {{improved}} German Panzer IVs {{with the}} <b>high-velocity</b> 75mm (2.95in) gun were encountered in combat in 1942, {{a project to}} design an entirely new Soviet tank was begun, {{with the goals of}} increasing armour protection while adding modern features like a torsion-bar suspension and a three-man turret. This new tank, the T-43, was intended to be a universal tank to replace both the T-34 and the KV-1 heavy tank. However, the T-43 prototype's armour, though heavier, was still not proof against German 88mm guns, while its mobility was found to be inferior to the T-34. Finally, although the T-43 shared over 70% of its components with the T-34, manufacturing it would still have required a significant slow-down in production. Consequently, the T-43 was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} the explosion, the UVF unit opened fire on those {{gathered}} outside the wrecked pub, including {{those who had been}} caught in the blast. A British Army spokesman said that the shooting began at about 5:35 PM, when 30 <b>high-velocity</b> shots were heard. Social Democratic and Labour Party Member of Parliament Gerry Fitt said that shots had been fired from the Springmartin estate only minutes after the bombing. William Whitelaw, however, claimed that the shooting did not begin until 40 minutes after the blast. Ambulances braved the gunfire to reach the wounded, which included a number of children. Tommy McIlroy (50), a Catholic civilian who worked at Kelly's Bar, was shot in the chest and killed outright. He was the first to be killed in the violence.|$|E
