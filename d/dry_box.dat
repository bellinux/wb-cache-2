50|$|A simple <b>dry</b> <b>box</b> can {{consist of}} {{nothing more than}} a sealed, {{airtight}} box containing a desiccant, such as silica gel or anhydrous calcium chloride. These can be easily built at relatively low cost. However, the humidity level in such boxes cannot be controlled or regulated, owing to the difficulty of gauging the quantity of desiccant required to achieve a certain humidity level. Repeated opening of such boxes, allowing humid ambient air to enter, can saturate the desiccant, and some desiccants can have corrosive or other harmful effects on the contents of the box if they collect enough water to dissolve.|$|E

A brass vessel is kept over the lamp, leaving a little gap, just enough for the oxygen to aid the burning of the lamp. This is left burning overnight. In the morning, one or two drops of pure ghee (clarified cow's butter) or castor oil are added to the soot which now lines the brass vessel. It is then stored in a clean <b>dry</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is {{a widespread}} pathogen that can lay dormant in healthy individuals and establish lifelong latent infection. This successful co-existence is facilitated {{by a number of}} viral gene products that manipulate host cellular functions and immune responses. Among these immunomodulatory genes are four G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) encoded by HCMV, designated US 27, US 28, UL 33, and UL 78. Studies have shown the US 28 gene product to be a functional chemokine receptor that signals both constitutively and in a ligand-dependent manner, resulting {{in a wide range of}} cellular effects. In previous work, we have found that US 27 expression results in at least two biological effects: enhanced CXCR 4 signaling and increased in cellular proliferation in HEK 293 cells. Here, we examined the involvement of two protein domains, the <b>DRY</b> <b>box</b> and the C-terminal intracellular domain (CTD) of US 27, in mediating both cell proliferation and survival. While both domains were required for a proliferative effect, loss of either domain only moderately impacted cell survival, suggesting that US 27 may interact with cell survival pathways through protein regions other than the <b>DRY</b> <b>box</b> and CTD. Quantitative RT-PCR arrays were used to profile changes in cellular gene expression in the HEK 293 -US 27 cell line, and down-regulation of cell cycle regulators CDKN 1 A/p 21 /CIP 1 (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A) and SESN (Sestrin 2 or Hi 95) was observed. These results indicate that increased cell proliferation due to US 27 may be linked to suppression of negative growth regulators, and that these interactions require the <b>DRY</b> <b>box</b> and CTD...|$|E

25|$|If metal nitrates are {{prepared}} from N2O4 in completely anhydrous conditions, {{a range of}} covalent metal nitrates can be formed with many transition metals. This is {{because there is a}} thermodynamic preference for the nitrate ion to bond covalently with such metals rather than form an ionic structure. Such compounds must be prepared in anhydrous conditions, since the nitrate ion is a much weaker ligand than water, and if water is present the simple hydrated nitrate will form. The anhydrous nitrates concerned are themselves covalent, and many, e.g. anhydrous copper nitrate, are volatile at room temperature. Anhydrous titanium nitrate sublimes in vacuum at only 40°C. Many of the anhydrous transition metal nitrates have striking colours. This branch of chemistry was developed by Clifford Addisson and Noramn Logan at Nottingham University in the UK during the 1960s and 1970s when highly efficient desiccants and <b>dry</b> <b>boxes</b> started to become available.|$|R
