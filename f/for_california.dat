5|$|According to Baley, {{political}} and economic factors prompted two Hedgpeth and two Baley families to leave northwestern Missouri <b>for</b> <b>California</b> in early 1858. One factor was {{the enactment of the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act, which admitted Nebraska into the Union as a free territory and granted Kansas the right to decide on the legality of slavery within the state. The resulting tensions between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups fueled conflict near the Missouri state line, affecting its western counties, including Nodaway, where the Baleys and Hedgpeths lived. In Baley's opinion, the financial Panic of 1857 further contributed to instability in the region, driving many mid-westerners to seek a better life in California. The combined Baley-Hedgpeth outfits were led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley, and comprised eight Murphy wagons, sixty-two oxen, seventy-five head of cattle, and several riding horses. They employed half-a-dozen grubstakers to tend their stock.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut {{departed}} Philadelphia <b>for</b> <b>California</b> on 4 October {{for duty}} with the Pacific Fleet.

5|$|Four {{passenger}} airliners {{operated by}} two major U.S. passenger air carriers (United Airlines and American Airlines) — {{all of which}} departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound <b>for</b> <b>California</b> — were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story towers collapsed, with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex, including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower, as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense) in Arlington County, Virginia, leading to a partial collapse of the building's western side. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was initially steered toward Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. 9/11 was the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers {{in the history of}} the United States, with 343 and 72 killed respectively.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. The date was 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young {{and when he was}} about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have been victims of an influenza pandemic. William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed <b>for</b> <b>California</b> via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E
