25|$|To make it, I prayed by the hour. It was automatic, almost subconscious. I {{did not ask}} God to take me out of it. I prayed {{he would}} give me {{strength}} to endure it. When it would get so bad that I did not think I could stand it, I would ask God to ease it and somehow <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it. He kept me.|$|E
25|$|I didn't {{have much}} time. July was half through, and I {{needed to get}} a new forty-odd-person team assembled, trained, and {{deployed}} prior to Butler's arrival in Iraq on August 2. We would use the same basic inspection concept that had been prepared for July; the intelligence on both sites, I was assured by sources, was still valid but not for much longer. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> use of some twenty-five inspectors resident in Baghdad with the monitoring groups, and I added twelve experts, {{selected on the basis of}} what the team needed for the planned inspection. I had a five-person command element fly to Bahrain with the twelve experts to train them. They were to stay in Bahrain after the training to carry out last-minute preparations and receive intelligence updates until they flew into Iraq on the same plane that would take Butler out on August 5. Somehow it all came together. The inspections would begin on the morning of the 6th.|$|E

Of {{his time in}} the show, Quong Tart told TV Week, [...] "I couldn't have imagined how much fun I would have and the friends <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> on Home and Away.

[...] Rebecca Davies from Digital Spy reported the actor had already filmed his final scenes, while TV Week said the way in which Miles leaves the Bay was being kept secret.

500|$|After a {{thorough}} pre-flight check I would take off and, once at circuit height, I would trim the aircraft {{and try to}} get her to fly straight and level with hands off the stick... Once the trim was satisfactory I would take the Spitfire up in a full-throttle climb at 2,850rpm to the rated altitude of one or both supercharger blowers. Then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a careful check of the power output from the engine, calibrated for height and temperature... If all appeared satisfactory I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3,000rpm, and trim her to fly hands and feet off at [...] IAS (Indicated Air Speed). Personally, I never cleared a Spitfire unless I had carried out a few aerobatic tests to determine how good or bad she was.|$|E
500|$|With Rhodes {{insisting that}} the band not perform live again until they were much tighter, the Clash rehearsed {{intensely}} over the following month. Strummer later described how seriously the band devoted itself to forging a distinct identity: [...] "We were almost Stalinist {{in the way that}} you had to shed all your friends, or everything that you'd known, or every way that you'd played before." [...] Strummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties—"Joe would give me the words and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a song out of them", Jones later said. Sometimes they would meet in the office over their Camden rehearsal studio to collaborate directly. According to a later description of Strummer's, [...] "Bernie [...] would say, 'An issue, an issue. Don't write about love, write about what's affecting you, what's important." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1921, {{after years}} of {{pleading}} for proper schooling, Nancy was allowed a year's boarding at Hatherop Castle, an informal private establishment for young ladies of good family. Laura Thompson, in her biography of Nancy, describes Hatherop as not so much [...] a school, [...] "more a chaste foretaste of debutante life". Here Nancy learned French and other subjects, played organised games and joined a Girl Guide troop. It was her first extended experience of life away from home, and she enjoyed it. The following year she was allowed to accompany four other girls on a cultural trip to Paris, Florence and Venice; her letters home are full of expressions of wonder at the sights and treasures: [...] "I had no idea I was so fond of pictures... if only I had a room of my own <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it a regular picture gallery".|$|E
500|$|O'Ree's {{breakthrough}} came {{several years}} after another black player, Herb Carnegie was denied the same opportunity. [...] In 1938–39, playing junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey Association's Toronto Rangers, during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told [...] "See that man sitting in the blues? [...] That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. [...] He says he'd take you tomorrow if he could turn you white." [...] Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team. [...] "They {{told me that if}} I signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> international headlines. [...] I told them my family couldn't eat headlines. [...] That was probably when the Rangers decided to forget about me." ...|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter Dan Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 {{and worked}} on the film with the filmmakers {{on a daily basis}} for almost two years. He {{considered}} it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, [...] "I would sit with Pete [...] and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." ...|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the group {{starting}} university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that [...] "I felt as though I couldn't write about anything personal, so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> up semi-comical stories that weren't really important to anyone, not even me." [...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...we’d have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco, Jack Brown said that [...] "We just thought that we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs that we felt weren't suitable for the band that we were in and we thought White Lies would be the perfect vehicle for the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Usher held {{multiple}} private listening {{sessions for}} Looking 4 Myself. On April 27, 2012 he debuted the album in the off-broadway show Fuerza Bruta: Look Up, in Daryl Roth Theater in New York City. When speaking to MTV, he explained his reasoning for performing {{in the show}} [...] "It's not often that you're able to give somewhat of a visual or an emotional kind of basis of what your songs mean [...] I felt like, yeah, {{it would be a}} physical challenge, yeah {{it would be a lot}} for me, but [...] at least try it, there are many times I'd seen the show and I'd only hoped that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it happen". Steven Horowitz of Rolling Stone commented that Usher [...] "theatrically sequenced the entirety of the project to strobing lights and choreographed moves". Horowitz also praised the singer's performance, concluding that [...] "the veteran entertainer reasserts himself as a master of rapturous dance fodder, capable of turning a room into a thumping rave with ease". Usher appeared on Saturday Night Live—hosted by Will Ferrell—where he performed the singles [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Climax". He performed both singles again, in the 2012 Today summer concert, being the opening act of the series. Usher performed [...] "Scream" [...] in the 2012 Billboard Music Awards; during the performance he wore a black suit, bowler hat and bow tie while dancing with a masked female, who later disappeared behind a cape and was replaced by a male dancer who mirrored Usher's dance routines.|$|E
500|$|Aurora {{finally left}} Hobart, Tasmania, on 24 December 1914. On 16 January 1915 the shore party landed at McMurdo Sound, where Mackintosh {{established}} a base camp at Captain Scott's old headquarters at Cape Evans. Believing that Shackleton might {{have already begun}} his march from the Weddell Sea, {{he was determined to}} begin depot-laying at once. [...] Joyce, the expedition's most seasoned Antarctic traveller—he had been with Scott's Discovery Expedition in 1901–04, and with the Nimrod Expedition—protested that the party needed time for acclimatisation and training, but was overruled. Joyce was shocked by the rebuff; he had expected that Mackintosh would defer to him on sledging matters: [...] "If I had Shacks here <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> him see my way of arguing", he wrote in his diary. The depot-laying journey which followed began with a series of mishaps. A blizzard delayed their start, a motor sledge broke down after a few miles, and Mackintosh and his group lost their way on the sea ice between Cape Evans and Hut Point. Conditions on the Barrier were harsh for the untrained and inexperienced men. Many of the stores taken on to the Barrier were dumped on the ice to reduce loads and did not reach the depots. After Mackintosh insisted, over Joyce's urgent protests, on taking the dogs all the way to 80°S, all died on the journey. The men, frostbitten and exhausted, returned to the old Discovery expedition hut at Hut Point on 24 March, but were cut off from the ship and from their Cape Evans base by unsafe sea ice [...] and had to wait, idle, for nearly three months. After this experience, confidence in Mackintosh's leadership was low, and bickering rife.|$|E

2500|$|Cho began skating {{at the age}} of 3.

[...] About his chances of making the Olympic team, Cho said, [...] "When I say nobody thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the team, literally nobody thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it...Not even me". [...] However, {{at the age of}} 18, Cho qualified for the 2010 U.S. Olympic team. [...] Apolo Ohno noted that Cho [...] "basically made this team training on his own".
