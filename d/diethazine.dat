Surgeons were sometimes responsible for anesthetics and as a French navy surgeon, Laborit had seen patients die as a result of or after their operations. He became a researcher in anesthesiology. Laborit's ideas on anesthesia included potentiated anaesthesia, lowering basal metabolism and lowering body temperature (so-called artificial hibernation).

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to study the {{possibility}} of employment of cyclic voltammetry as a detection technique in liquid chromatography. The phenothiazine derivatives (chlorpromazine hydrochloride, <b>diethazine</b> hydrochloride, and thioridazine hydrochloride) were used as model compounds. Firstly, the comparison of two potential detectors (tubular detector and bulk "wall-jet" detector) was accomplished. Only bulk "wal-jet" detector satisfied. Next, the conditions for the separation and detection of studied phenothiazines on RP-select B LiChrospher® 60 (250 × 4 mm) column with cyclic voltammetry as the detection techniques were optimized. The best separation is achieved in mobile phase consisted from the solution of 0. 1 mol dm- 3 sodium perchlorate in acetonitrile-water (80 : 20) mixture. The effect of flow rate of mobile phase and scan rate of polarization of the electrode on the symmetry of chromatographic peak was also followed, and optimal values of 0. 5 ml min- 1 for flow rate, and of 0. 5 V s- 1 for scan rate, were found.
