5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens the <b>interval</b> in which the maximum of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite <b>interval,</b> a unimodal function, and the maximum length of the resulting <b>interval,</b> Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the <b>interval</b> is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing the <b>interval,</b> it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} how judgments of perceived duration {{are influenced by}} the properties of the signals that define the <b>intervals.</b> Participants compared two auditory <b>intervals</b> that could be any combination of the following four types: <b>intervals</b> filled with continuous tones (filled <b>intervals),</b> <b>intervals</b> filled with regularly-timed short tones (isochronous <b>intervals),</b> <b>intervals</b> filled with irregularly-timed short tones (anisochronous <b>intervals),</b> and <b>intervals</b> demarcated by two short tones (empty <b>intervals).</b> Results indicate that the type of <b>intervals</b> to be compared affects discrimination performance and induces distortions in perceived duration. In particular, we find that duration judgments are most precise when comparing two isochronous and two continuous <b>intervals,</b> while the comparison of two anisochronous <b>intervals</b> leads to the worst performance. Moreover, we determined that the magnitude of the distortions in perceived duration (an effect akin to the filled duration illusion) is higher for tone sequences (no matter whether isochronous or anisochronous) than for continuous tones. Further analysis of how duration distortions depend on the type of filling suggests that distortions are not only due to the perceived duration of the two individual <b>intervals,</b> but they may also be due to the comparison of two different filling types...|$|R

To test the relationship of stability <b>intervals</b> with speech rhythm we investigated the between-speaker variability of stable and unstable <b>intervals</b> in the TEVOID corpus.
