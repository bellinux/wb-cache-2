25|$|Human {{infection}} is considered rare {{with less than}} one hundred published cases of <b>invasive</b> <b>disease</b> (approximately 46 cases reported by 1990). These figures represent a gross underestimate of the human burden of disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} presentation among <b>invasive</b> <b>disease</b> is also dominated by skin and soft tissue infections, including a small subset of patients presenting with severe necrotizing fasciitis. Moreover, {{it is an}} important cause of bone and joint infections, and this disease manifestation is reported to be increasing. Less commonly it can present as pneumonia, endocarditis, genital or intraabdominal infections. Primary bacteraemia, infection without identifiable focal origin, comprises approximately 20% of the reported cases.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae is a gram positive, beta-haemolytic, coccal {{bacterium}} {{belonging to}} the family Streptococcaceae. It is capable of infecting both humans and animals, but is most frequently encountered as a commensal of the alimentary tract, genital tract, or less commonly, {{as a part of}} the skin flora. The clinical manifestations in human disease range from superficial skin-infections and tonsillitis, to severe necrotising fasciitis and bacteraemia. The incidence of <b>invasive</b> <b>disease</b> has been reported to be rising. Several different animal species are susceptible to infection by S.dysgalactiae, but bovine mastitis and infectious arthritis in lambs (joint ill) have been most frequently reported.|$|E

Pine trees are one of the largest {{families}} spread all over the world, including South Europe, which also has the highest number of <b>invasive</b> <b>diseases.</b> Information about the most important and most widespread <b>invasive</b> <b>diseases</b> and pests of pine trees in South Europe were identified and compared on several internet databases.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 7) in 2007, <b>invasive</b> pneumococcal <b>disease</b> has declined, but the incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19 A has risen worldwide. The present study examined changes in the features of <b>invasive</b> pneumococcal <b>disease</b> since {{the introduction}} of the PCV 7 in Kochi, Japan. Pediatric cases of <b>invasive</b> pneumococcal <b>disease</b> were investigated before and after vaccine introduction (January 2008 to December 2013). Cases of <b>invasive</b> pneumococcal <b>disease</b> tended to decrease after PCV 7 introduction. In addition, before introduction of the vaccine, most serotypes causing <b>invasive</b> pneumococcal <b>disease</b> were those included in the vaccine. However, after the introduction, we found cases infected by serotypes not covered by vaccine. Penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was the predominant serotype causing <b>invasive</b> pneumococcal <b>disease</b> before introduction of the PCV 7, and the susceptibility of this serotype to antibiotics improved after vaccine introduction. Serotype isolates identified after vaccine introduction were also relatively susceptible to antibiotic therapy, but decreased susceptibility is expected...|$|R
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae {{was long}} {{believed}} to be non-pathogenic to humans. However, an increasing incidence of S.dysgalactiae infections has been documented, and in some geographic regions, the rate of invasive infection has even surpassed that of Streptococcus pyogenes. The age distribution of invasive cases among humans is clearly skewed towards the elderly, whereas the healthy carrier state appears to have the inverse relation to age. People with chronic maladies, including cancer and diabetes, are also especially susceptible to infection. These opportunistic traits have been proposed {{as one of the}} mechanisms underlying the observed increasing frequency of <b>invasive</b> <b>disease.</b> Furthermore, a male predominance has been noted, presumably due to a higher burden of comorbidity. The incidence of non-invasive disease in human {{does not appear to be}} increasing.|$|E
25|$|The genus Exserohilum {{comprises}} dematiaceous fungi {{commonly associated}} with foliar plant diseases and rarely with human and animal phaeohyphomycosis. Fungi of this genus are characterized {{by the presence of}} melanin in their cell walls, which is thought to contribute to their virulence. Many Exserohilum species are plant pathogens that affect a wide range of plant species, especially grasses Poaceae, causing distinct leaf spots and blights. However, S. rostrata has also been shown to survive in human as well as animal hosts, indicating pathogenic versatility. Though E. rostratum is a rare cause of infection in people, the species can cause a spectrum of diseases including allergic fungal sinusitis, skin and subcutaneous infections, <b>invasive</b> <b>disease</b> and occasionally keratomycosis an inflammation of the cornea. Invasive and skin infections caused by Exserohilum occur more frequently in those that are immunodeficient or have impaired immunity, these include infections in the sinuses, lungs, lining of the heart, and bone. Whereas, local trauma is a predisposing factor for skin and corneal infections. Meningitis and peripheral arthritides have also been reported pursuant to exposure to contaminated intrathecal drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Urakami et al. {{were able}} to detect cancers cells using {{conventional}} MSP analysis of Wnt-antagonist genes (including SFRP1) in voided urine of patients with bladder tumor. [...] Their results showed {{a high percentage of}} identical methylation with tumor-tissue DNA. [...] Conversely, no aberrant methylation was detected in >90% of urine DNA from normal controls. [...] This demonstrates that methylation detection of SFRP1 is both feasible and reliable and that the urine methylation score (M score) of Wnt antagonist genes could be used as an excellent noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for bladder tumor. [...] Furthermore, the M score of Wnt-antagonist genes may reflect the presence of bladder tumor that progresses to <b>invasive</b> <b>disease</b> that would signal for future aggressive treatment. [...] An optimal hypermethylation panel of Wnt-antagonist genes could contribute significantly to early detection of bladder tumor and predict bladder tumor aggressiveness. [...] In fact, the methylation of SFRP1 genes in fecal DNA isolated from stool samples has been used to screen for colorectal cancer.|$|E

30|$|Lower {{levels of}} {{neutralizing}} antibodies against streptococcal toxins and the M-protein in patients’ plasma are correlated with <b>invasive</b> <b>diseases</b> of GAS [60, 61]. Case {{reports in the}} 1990 s described a lower mortality in patients with STSS who benefited from polyclonal immunoglobulins [62 – 64]. These findings pointed at possible importance of antibodies in the protection against <b>invasive</b> <b>diseases</b> and suggested that addition of IV polyclonal immunoglobulins (IVIG) to the treatment may be useful as an adjunctive therapy. Possible mechanisms of action of immunoglobulins in STSS are: neutralization of toxins, improvement in bacterial opsonization, phagocytosis, and killing, {{as well as a}} possible immunomodulatory effect mediated by the interaction of Fc receptors and immune cells [65, 66].|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the completeness of the epidemiological surveillance system for <b>invasive</b> meningococcal <b>diseases</b> in greater Tunis. A six-year retrospective study (2003 - 2008) identified all cases of <b>invasive</b> meningococcal <b>disease</b> reported on Mandatory Notification records of the Tunis Regional Department of Health and those reported by the Tunis Children's hospital microbiology laboratory, considered to be the main source of diagnoses of <b>invasive</b> meningococcal <b>disease</b> in Greater Tunis. The "capture-recapture" method was applied. Thirty-eight cases of <b>invasive</b> meningococcal <b>disease</b> reported to the Regional Department of Health and 47 cases provided by the children's hospital were analysed during the study period and 25 cases common to both sources were identified. The total number of cases of <b>invasive</b> meningococcal <b>disease</b> was estimated to be 71 (95 % CI = [60 - 82]), using the capture-recapture method. Completeness rates were 53. 5 % (95 % CI = [46. 6 to 62. 9]) for Mandatory Notification to the Regional Department of Health and 66. 2 % (95 % CI = [57. 6 to 77. 8]) for children's hospital. Stratified analyses suggest that the two data sources were probably independent. The capture-recapture method applied to the <b>invasive</b> meningococcal <b>disease</b> surveillance system in Greater Tunis showed a poor sensitivity of the Mandatory Notification.
