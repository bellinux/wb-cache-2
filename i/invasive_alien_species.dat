500|$|Horton Plains {{was a part}} of a large {{system of}} plains and forest cover that {{included}} Agra-Bopats, Moon Plains and Elk Plains. Between 1831 and 1948, it became a Sambar deer hunting ground. Elephants and Wild Boar were also hunted to a lesser extent. During this period lower slopes were cleared initially for coffee and then for tea plantations. As a result, Horton Plains and Peak Wilderness became isolated from other forest and grassland areas. Potatoes were cultivated in the grasslands but planting ceased in 1977. After being declared a National Park, these areas were reinstated as grasslands. Tourism-related issues such as plant removal, littering, fires and noise pollution are major conservation issues. Gem mining, timber logging, the collection of plants for ornamental and medicinal purposes, encroachment, poaching and vehicle traffic are the other threats. The spread of <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> <b>species</b> such as gorse (Ulex europaeus), [...] Mist Flower (Ageratina riparia), Crofton Weed (Ageratina adenophora), [...] (Austroeupatorium), Blue Stars (Aristea ecklonii), brackens, and Pennisetum spp. threaten the native flora.

2500|$|In {{the natural}} course of events, species become extinct {{for a number}} of reasons, {{including}} but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by transporting animals and plants from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. livestock released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. rats escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> <b>species</b> does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. <b>Invasive</b> <b>alien</b> <b>species</b> can affect native species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing pathogens or parasites that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the [...] "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the megafauna in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), North and South America (12,000 years before present), Madagascar, Hawaii (300–1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300–1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.|$|E

40|$|The {{spread of}} <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> plants has {{considerable}} {{environmental and economic}} consequences, {{and is one of}} the most challenging ecological problems. The spread of <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> depends largely on long-distance dispersal, which is typically linked with human activity. The increasing domination of the internet will have impacts upon almost all components of our lives, including potential consequences for the spread of invasive species. To determine whether the rise of Internet commerce has any consequences for the spread of <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> plant <b>species,</b> we studied the sale of thirteen of some of the most harmful Europe <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> sold as decorative plants from twenty-eight large, well known gardening shops in Poland that sold both via the Internet and through traditional customer sales. We also analyzed temporal changes in the number of invasive plants sold in the largest Polish internet auction portal. When sold through the Internet <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> were transported considerably longer distances than for traditional sales. For internet sales, seeds of <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> were transported further than were live plants saplings; this was not the case for traditional sales. Also, with e-commerce the shape of distance distribution were flattened with low skewness comparing with traditional sale where the distributions were peaked and right-skewed. Thus, e-commerce created novel modes of long-distance dispersal, while traditional sale resembled more natural dispersal modes. Moreover, analysis of sale in the biggest Polish internet auction portal showed that the number of alien specimens sold via the internet has increased markedly over recent years. Therefore internet commerce is likely to increase the rate at which ecological communities become homogenized and increase spread of invasive species by increasing the rate of long distance dispersal...|$|R

40|$|Biological invasions {{have become}} a {{significant}} threat to the global environment. Unfortunately, to date {{there is no consensus}} on invasion mechanisms and predictive models. Controversies range from whether we can reliably predict which species may become invasive to which species characteristics (e. g., life history, taxonomic groups, or geographic origin) contribute to the invasion processes. We examined 126 <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> in China to understand the role of clonality and geographical origin in their invasion success. These species were categorized into three groups (I, II, III) based on their invasiveness in terms of current spatial occupation and the degree of damage to invaded habitats. Clonal plants consisted of almost half (44 %) of the 126 invasive species studied, and consisted of 66 % of 32 the most <b>invasive</b> <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> (Group I). There was a significant positive relationship between clonality and species invasiveness. A 68 % of the 126 species studied originated in the continent of America (North and/or South America).
