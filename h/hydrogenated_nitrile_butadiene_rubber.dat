The material {{is found to be}} non-linearly dependent on strain-rate and temperature. The large deformation responses of HNBR are determined to be almost purely viscoelastic. It is observed that, the instantaneous stress drop during the stress relaxation is dependent on the strain-rate.

40|$|In this paper, the {{microstructure}} and tribological performance of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films prepared by plasma {{chemical vapor deposition}} on <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>nitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubbers</b> (HNBR) are studied. Different negative variations of temperature during film growth were selected by proper changes of the bias voltage. Raman measurements show a similar bonding regardless of the voltages used. A columnar growth and a tile-like microstructure of the DLC films were identified by scanning electron microscopy. Patch sizes can be correlated with the deposition conditions. The coefficient of friction (CoF) of DLC film coated HNBR {{was found to be}} much lower than that of the unprotected rubber, and more reduced for the DLC films with smaller patch sizes, which is explained by a better flexibility and conformity of the film during testing. In one of the samples, unexpected low CoF was observed, which was attributed to a modification of the mechanical properties of the rubber during the plasma treatment at high voltage. This issue was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicated a modification of the cross linking in the rubber. ...|$|R

The surface morphology and fracture cross sections of uncoated and coated rubbers have been characterized with high resolution {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). The tribological behavior of uncoated and coated rubbers has been investigated with ball-on-disc tribotest under dry sliding condition against a 100 Cr 6 ball. The coefficient of friction (CoF) of uncoated rubbers is very high (> 1). Equally a relatively high CoF of W-DLC coated FKM (about 0. 6) is observed due to the gradual failure and delamination of the coatings. On the contrary, W-DLC coated HNBR rubber exhibits a superior tribological performance with a very low CoF of 0. 2 - 0. 25. The latter is {{comparable to that of}} Me-DLC coatings deposited on steel substrates. After 10, 000 sliding laps almost no damage of the coatings is observed on the wear tracks. In fact the network of micro-cracks as deposited facilitates the flexibility of the coatings. The different surface roughness and mechanical properties of the rubber substrates explain the differences in the tribological performances of the coated rubbers. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

Uncoated rubbers exhibited a very high coefficient of friction (> 0. 9). W-DLC coated FKM did not considerably reduce the friction because the coating was damaged due to poor adhesion. W-DLC coated HNBR and ACM exhibited excellent tribological performance, and very low coefficients of friction (< 0. 24) were achieved even at high normal load of 5 N.

The deposition rates of coatings on rubber and Si wafer were about the same. Columnar structures resulting from a rough interface were often observed in the coatings deposited on rubbers. Only at a high bias voltage of - 300 V the coating on HNBR rubber became column-free whereas a bias voltage of - 100 V could already restrain the columnar structure and thus produced dense and smooth coatings on Si wafer. A segmented morphology of the coatings on HNBR rubber {{is formed as a}} result of the large difference in thermal expansion between the coating and HNBR rubber. The crack network that separates the patches plays an important role in maintaining the coating flexibility. The size of the patches reduces with increasing bias voltage and thus the variation of deposition temperature. A high bias voltage enhances the hardness of Ti-coating and the rubber-coating adhesion, and guarantees a good tribological performance. When sliding against o 6 mm 100 Cr 6 steel ball counterpart, very low coefficients of friction were achieved (1. 3 for the uncoated). The Ti-DLC coating can be considered as a promising material for the enhancement of tribological performance of rubbers. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Sliding velocities were maintained low to reduce the thermal effects often associated with elastomer friction. In these tests, HNBR resulted in the lowest friction, with NBR the highest. The NBR specimens most often experienced wear, while FKM and HNBR experienced very little wear. The various oils, with some exceptions, had similar friction performance both at the higher and the lower loads.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of vulcanizates based on <b>Hydrogenated</b> <b>Nitrile</b> <b>Butadiene</b> <b>Rubber</b> (HNBR) are extremely attractive for many applications {{in comparison with}} other elastomers. In fact such type of materials exhibits good stability towards thermal ageing and better properties at low temperatures compared with other heat and oil resistant elastomers. This combination of properties is opening up {{a broad range of}} applications, mainly in the automotive industry like belts, seals and hoses. With reference to the in-service life of such components, it clearly appears that the obtainement of good fracture properties of HNBR-based systems is of basic importance. The present work is aimed at investigating the fracture behaviour of vulcanized HNBR systems containing different nanofillers, such as silica and multi wall carbon nanotubes (1). The fracture behavior of the different nanocomposites is studied by a fracture mechanics approach based on J-integral methodology to evaluate the material resistance to crack initiation (JIC) and propagation (J-resistance curve) (2). The fracture tests are carried out using SEN(T) specimens. During each test the deformation and fracture processes are recorded by a camera at different short time intervals, allowing the evaluation of the crack tip opening displacement at different extents of crack propagation. The evaluation of the corresponding J-values, determined by proper integration of load-displacement curve, allows the construction of J(CTOD) resistance curve (2). For the systems investigated the results obtained, with varying the type and content of nanofiller, are analysed and discussed. The results point out that multiwall carbon nanotubes are markedly more efficient than silica in promoting fracture resistance with particular reference to fracture initiation. Further, the comparison of the results with those obtained for other filled elastomeric systems confirms the very high toughening efficiency of carbon nanotubes. References 1. 	D. Felhös, J.

40|$|<b>Hydrogenated</b> <b>nitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubber</b> (HNBR) {{which is}} known for its {{excellent}} elastomeric properties and mechanical retention properties after long time exposure to heat, oil and air is produced by the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR). Hydrogenation of NBR is carried out preferably in solution via homogeneous catalysis. As yet, it is being commercially produced in a semi-batch process where gaseous hydrogen continuously flows into a batch of reactant polymer. Several catalysts have been exploited successfully for the hydrogenation of NBR in organic solvents, which include palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium complexes. Owing to the drawbacks of batch production (such as time taken for charging and discharging the reactants/products, heating and cooling, reactor clean up), and the huge demand for HNBR, a continuous process is proposed where potential time saving is possible in addition to the high turn over of the product. Numerical investigation of the HNBR production in a plug flow reactor and a continuous stirred tank reactor showed that a reactor with plug flow behavior would be economical and efficient. A static mixer (SM) reactor with open-curve blade internal geometry is designed based on the simulation and hydrodynamic results. The SM reactor was designed with 24 mixing elements, 3. 81 cm ID and 90 cm length. The reactor has a jacket in which steam is used to heat the polymer solution. The hydrodynamics in the SM reactor (open-flat blade structure) with air-water system showed that plug flow could be achieved even under laminar flow conditions (Reh < 20). For a constant mean residence time, the Peclet number was varying such that it is 4. 7 times the number of mixing elements (ne) used in the SM reactor. Empirical correlations were developed for gas hold up (εG) and overall mass transfer coefficient (KLa). The mass transfer experiments showed that high KLa, 4 to 6 times compared to that of the conventional reactors could be achieved in the SM reactor at particular operating conditions. Very important information on the Peclet number, liquid hold were obtained from the hydrodynamic experiments conducted with the actual working fluids (hydrogen, polymer solutions) in the SM reactor. The superficial gas velocity had an adverse effect on both Peclet number and liquid hold up. The viscosity of the polymer solution also had a marginal negative effect on the Peclet number while a positive effect on the liquid hold up. The hydrogenation performance with the homogeneous catalyst OsHCl(CO) (O 2) (PCy 3) 2 was performed in the continuous process with SM reactor. Complete hydrogenation of NBR was possible in a single pass. The effect of mean residence time, catalyst and polymer concentration on the final degree of hydrogenation was studied. The minimum catalyst required to achieve degree of hydrogenation over 97 % was empirically found and an empirical correlation was developed for degree of hydrogenation as a function of operating conditions and parameters. Hydrogenation in the SM reactor is modeled by using plug flow with axial dispersion model that is coupled with the concentrations of carbon-carbon double bond, hydrogen and osmium catalyst. The model involves coupled, non-linear partial differential equations with different dimensionless parameters. The proposed model was verified with the experimental results obtained from the hydrogenation and hydrodynamic experiments. The model could satisfactorily predict the degree of hydrogenation obtained from experimental results at various operating conditions. In general, the designed continuous process with SM reactor performed well and was an effective method of manufacturing HNBR on a continuous basis. The designed system is amicable to the industrial operating conditions and promises to be highly efficient and economic process for production of HNBR...|$|E
40|$|The {{recovery}} of organometallic catalysts from polymer matrices {{is of great}} importance in promoting the application of homogeneous catalysts in industry. Such a green recovery technique will not only popularize the techniques of green catalytic hydrogenation of polymers by Rempel’s group, but also consummates the technique of heterogenization of organometallic catalysts. The high value product of <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>nitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubber</b> (HNBR) with dissolution of Wilkinson’s catalyst [RhCl(TPP) 3] {{was selected as the}} model polymer matrix for developing a green separation technique. The supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) soluble fluorous Wilkinson’s catalyst [RhCl(P(p-CF 3 C 6 H 4) 3) 3] was synthesized and shown exhibit a very limited activity in the catalytic hydrogenation of bulk HNBR. Its recovery from a HNBR matrix using scCO 2 however failed. In spite of the assistance of the scCO 2 dissolvable chelating ligand thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA), the weak compatibility of scCO 2 with rhodium complexes failed again as an extraction solvent for the HNBR matrix. Inspired by the merits of CO 2 -expanded liquids (CXLs) and the versatility of CO 2 in changing the physical properties of polymer melts, CXLs were tested as extracting solvents for separation of Wilkinson’s catalyst from bulk HNBR. CO 2 -expanded water (CXW) and CO 2 -expanded alcohols including methanol and ethanol (CXM and CXE) were examined with the assistance of a variety of chelating agents. The investigated chelating agents include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-Na 2), diethylenetriamine (DETA), N,N,N',N',N"-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA), and N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). CXM and PMDETA were recognized as the optimal combination of extracting solvent and chelating agent for {{recovery of}} Wilkinson’s catalyst from HNBR. An extraction system consisting of CXM and PMDETA was carefully investigated with respect to the effects of temperature and pressure on the extraction performance over the temperature range of 40 to 100 °C and the pressure range of 20 to 200 bar. Increasing temperature effectively increased the extraction rate and became less influential when the temperature was above 80 °C. Increasing pressure at a fixed temperature was found to improve the extraction rate followed by suppressing it. Nevertheless, further increasing the pressure to an extreme high value above the respective critical point was able to promote the extraction rate again. The complex effects of pressure were thoroughly investigated by the means of analyzing the dissolution behavior of CO 2 in HNBR and the variation of the extraction phase composition at different operational conditions. 0. 14 g/mL was determined as the CO 2 density by which the optimal pressure at a fixed temperature can be estimated. Based on a careful interpretation of the experimental results, an extraction mechanism was illustrated for interpreting the present extraction system. Additionally, the reactions involved in the extraction process were illustrated to reveal the principal challenges present in the extraction process and pointed out the potential solution for eliminating the obstacles. Two special operations-sequential operation and pressure varying procedure were tested for their effectiveness in enhancing the extraction ratio. A pressure varying procedure was found to be beneficial in further improving the extraction ratio, while sequential operation did not show any promise in enhancing the recovery. At last, the developed technique was shown to be highly efficient in applying it to HNBR particles coagulated from the HNBR latex. A residue of 59 ppm rhodium was obtained after 9 hours of operation. This study establishes a technology platform for separating the expensive catalyst from the polymer matrix, using “green” CO 2 -expanded liquids...|$|E
