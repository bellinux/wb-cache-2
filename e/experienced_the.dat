5000|$|The Other (when {{written with}} a capital [...] "O") is a concept more {{properly}} belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity. However, the concept has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn from it differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. <b>The</b> <b>experience</b> of <b>the</b> Other is <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this <b>experience</b> of <b>the</b> Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person <b>experiences</b> <b>the</b> world (the same world that a person experiences)—only from [...] "over there"—the world itself is constituted as objective {{in that it is}} something that is [...] "there" [...] as identical for both of the subjects; a person <b>experiences</b> <b>the</b> other person as <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> same things.

5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically different from that of other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala.

He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
