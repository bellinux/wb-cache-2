[...] The schemes were simplified as individual vehicles were repainted. [...] With the take over by the Southern and arrival of Lew the livery was slowly changed to Maunsell Green for locos and passenger stock, and umber for the goods wagons. The loco headlamps which had been black under the L were re-painted red.|$|E

It also opposed the influxes of mainland tourists, <b>grey</b> <b>goods</b> traders, Mainland schools children who were seen as taken away the quota of the local students, panic-buying of baby formula and various social issues in related to Hong Kong-Mainland conflict. Despite its localist agenda, the group does not advocate for Hong Kong independence as compared to many other localists. It opposed the government's Individual Visit Scheme {{to limit the number of}} mainland tourists. They co-sponsored a controversial ad which claimed that reducing immigration would help the people of Hong Kong to get to the bottom of the housing problem, while rejecting claims of bias or discrimination against mainlanders, despite condemnation from the Equal Opportunities Commission.

40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the {{importance}} of trademark laws to the resolution of the <b>grey</b> <b>goods</b> controversy is outweighed by the overriding public policy considerations of international free trade. Part I discusses the background of the <b>grey</b> <b>goods</b> controversy by examining the history of the controlling statutory and case law and the recent <b>grey</b> <b>goods</b> cases. Part II demonstrates that trademark owners are not significantly injured by the availability of <b>grey</b> <b>goods,</b> but actually gain windfall profits if there is an absolute bar on <b>grey</b> <b>goods.</b> Part III argues that preventing importation of <b>grey</b> <b>goods</b> injures international free trade. This Note concludes that grey marketing is a natural and healthy economic consequence of restrictions on international free trade and should not be discouraged...|$|E

50|$|<b>Grey</b> market <b>goods</b> are legal, non-counterfeit {{goods sold}} outside normal {{distribution}} channels by entities {{which may have}} no relationship with the producer of the goods. This form of parallel import frequently occurs {{when the price of}} an item is significantly higher in one country than another. This commonly takes place with electronic equipment such as cameras. Entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, and import it legally to the target market. They then sell it at a price high enough to provide a profit but below the normal market price.International efforts to promote free trade, including reduced tariffs and harmonised national standards, facilitate this form of arbitrage whenever manufacturers attempt to preserve highly disparate pricing. Because of the nature of grey markets, it is difficult or impossible to track the precise numbers of grey market sales. <b>Grey</b> market <b>goods</b> are often new, but some <b>grey</b> market <b>goods</b> are used goods. A market in used goods is sometimes nicknamed a green market.|$|R

Chalk outcrops and chalk cliffs, out of which fresh good quality flint (e.g. Lanaye Flint) was being eroded, are situated at not more than 5 km away from Veldwezelt-Hezerwater.

50|$|A blind harp-player {{resolves}} {{to steal}} King Henry of England's brown horse, in some versions, {{as a result}} of a bet for substantial stakes. He tells his wife of his plans and that he needs their <b>good</b> <b>grey</b> mare to achieve them. She agrees, and tells him to leave the foal behind, as the mare will quickly return to her still suckling young. He sets off and, at Carlisle, he meets the king, who asks for a song. The harper replies that he'd rather have a stable for his mare. The king tells his stable boy to house the grey mare next to his own brown horse. Now the harper plays and sings so beautifully that he spellbinds his audience and they all fall asleep. He tiptoes out of the room, makes his way to the stable, tethers the two horses together and releases them. The <b>good</b> <b>grey</b> mare makes her way back home taking the stolen brown horse with her. When the morning comes, the harper falsely mourns the loss of his horse, saying that, as a result, her foal will die. The king tells him not to fret and makes good the harper's losses by paying him for the foal and three times the worth of the <b>good</b> <b>grey</b> mare. Thus the harper not only wins his bet but also gets handsomely remunerated for the animals that he never lost.|$|R

50|$|Re-importation or {{reimportation}} is {{the importation}} of goods into a country which had previously been exported from that country. A number of legal issues arise with the re-importation of goods, particularly where the goods were not designed {{for sale in the}} country from which they were initially exported. Because prices differ from one country to another, a re-importer may purchase goods in another country where they are sold at a low price and re-import them in order to undercut the price at which the goods are being sold in the country to which they are imported. Such re-imported <b>goods</b> may constitute <b>grey</b> market <b>goods.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{practice}} {{known as}} box breaking {{is common in}} the United Kingdom and other markets.
