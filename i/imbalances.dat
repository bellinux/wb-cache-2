40|$|Uneven load {{allocations}} {{and random}} load behaviors {{are two major}} causes for three-phase power <b>imbalance.</b> The former mainly cause systematic <b>imbalance,</b> which can be addressed by low-cost phase swapping; the latter contribute to random <b>imbalance,</b> which requires relatively costly demand-side managements. To reveal the maximum potential of phase swapping and the minimum need for demand-side managements, this paper first proposes a novel a priori judgment to classify any set of three-phase power series into one of four scenarios, depending on {{whether there is a}} definite maximum phase, a definite minimum phase, or both. Then, this paper proposes a new method to decompose three-phase power series into a systematic <b>imbalance</b> component and a random <b>imbalance</b> component as the closed-form solutions of quadratic optimization models that minimize random <b>imbalance.</b> A degree of power <b>imbalance</b> is calculated based on the systematic <b>imbalance</b> component to guide phase swapping. Case studies demonstrate that 72. 8 % of 782 low voltage substations have systematic <b>imbalance</b> components. The degree of power <b>imbalance</b> results reveal the maximum need for phase swapping and the random <b>imbalance</b> components reveal the minimum need for demand side management, if the three phases are to be fully rebalanced...|$|R

In this paper, I decompose total order <b>imbalance</b> in stock transactions into the <b>imbalance</b> induced by option transactions and the <b>imbalance</b> induced by stock transactions independent of option trading activities. I find that the stock exposure <b>imbalance</b> induced by option transactions has strong predictive power of stock returns that does not reverse at long horizons.

5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade <b>imbalances</b> can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account <b>imbalances</b> are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments <b>imbalances.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term money market instruments.

Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global <b>imbalances</b> which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental <b>imbalances</b> within the eurozone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Phase <b>imbalance</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} {{as a source of}} inefficiency in the data center that causes energy loss due to line impedance and increases reactive power. Strategies assume high loss due to phase <b>imbalance</b> and propose sophisticated energy management algorithms including phase balance aware workload scheduling algorithm and dynamic power distribution unit assignment to servers. However, such attempts do not utilize an objective measure of the inefficiencies due to phase <b>imbalance</b> to evaluate the significance of their contributions. Excessive <b>imbalance</b> in a three phase load has various undesirable effects. This paper, first objectively characterizes the inefficiencies due to phase <b>imbalance</b> and then provides numerical measures of the losses in realistic data center deployments. Phase <b>imbalanced</b> load in a delta configuration results in reduced power factor, which is undesirable for several reasons. Also, an <b>imbalanced</b> load (both in delta or star configuration), results in higher line currents, leading to higher line loss. However, this increase in loss is a fraction of a percentage of the energy consumed. The paper also discusses effects of work load scheduling on phase <b>imbalance,</b> and how to minimize the same.

5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte <b>imbalances</b> or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform.

Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E

30|$|Any dataset with unequal {{distribution}} {{between its}} majority and minority classes {{can be considered}} to have class <b>imbalance,</b> and in real-world applications, the severity of class <b>imbalance</b> can vary from minor to severe (high or extreme). A dataset can be considered <b>imbalanced</b> if the classes, e.g., fraud and non-fraud cases, are not equally represented. The majority class makes {{up most of the}} dataset, whereas the minority class, with limited dataset representation, is often considered the class of interest. With real-world datasets, class <b>imbalance</b> should be expected. If the degree of class <b>imbalance</b> for the majority class is extreme, then a classifier may yield high overall prediction accuracy since the model is likely predicting most instances as belonging to the majority class. Such a model is not practically useful, since it is often the prediction performance of the class of interest (i.e., minority class) that is more important for the domain experts [1]. He and Garcia [2] suggest that a popular viewpoint held by academic researchers defines <b>imbalanced</b> data as data with a high-class <b>imbalance</b> between its two classes, stating that high-class <b>imbalance</b> is reflected when the majority-to-minority class ratio ranges from 100 : 1 to 10, 000 : 1. While this range of class <b>imbalance</b> may be observed in big data, it is not a strict definition of high-class <b>imbalance.</b> From the viewpoint of effective problem-solving, any class <b>imbalance</b> (e.g., 50 : 1) level that makes modeling and prediction of the minority class a complex and challenging task can be considered high-class <b>imbalance</b> by the domain experts [3]. It should be noted that we focus our survey investigation of published works on class <b>imbalance</b> in big data in the context of binary classification problems, since typically non-binary (i.e., multi-class) classification problems can be represented using a sequence of multiple binary classification tasks.|$|R
