5|$|The King's Cross fire in 1987 {{started in}} the machine room for a wooden <b>escalator</b> between the main line station and the London Underground station's Piccadilly line platforms. The <b>escalator</b> burnt up {{and much of the}} tube station caught fire with smoke {{spreading}} to the main line station, killing 31 people.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong Island's steep, {{hilly terrain}} was {{initially}} served by sedan chairs. The Peak Tram, {{the first public}} transport system in Hong Kong, has provided vertical rail transport between Central and Victoria Peak since 1888. In Central and Western district, there is an extensive system of escalators and moving pavements, including the longest outdoor covered <b>escalator</b> system in the world, the Mid-Levels <b>escalator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} on the skeleton reveals bite marks matching Tooms' teeth. When the old couple watching Tooms depart and Tooms is visited by Monte, he kills him and consumes the final liver he needs before his thirty-year hibernation. After discovering Monte's body, Mulder and Scully head to Tooms' former residence at 66 Exeter Street, which has been demolished and replaced with a shopping mall. Inside, Mulder crawls below an <b>escalator</b> and finds Tooms' nest. Tooms bursts out, covered in bile, and pursues Mulder, who {{makes it to the}} surface and activates the <b>escalator,</b> trapping and killing Tooms.|$|E
50|$|At each end, {{the tunnels}} are {{connected}} to surface buildings by two <b>escalators</b> and a lift. The Waygood-Otis <b>escalators</b> have 306 wooden steps each, and are the original models from 1951. At the time of construction, they were the highest single-rise <b>escalators</b> in the UK, with a vertical rise of 85 ft and a length of 197 ft. In 1992. <b>escalators</b> with a higher vertical rise of 90 ft and 200 ft in length were constructed at Angel station on the London Underground. The Tyne Tunnel <b>escalators</b> remain the longest wooden <b>escalators</b> in the world.|$|R

5|$|Oxford Circus {{station has}} 14 escalators. Major <b>escalator</b> {{refurbishment}} {{took place in}} 2010–11. Platform humps were also installed at the station to provide step-free access to trains. The Victoria line humps resemble in form the Harrington Hump.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Entrance 2's <b>escalator</b> {{entrance}} was to {{be located}} inside the Yorkshire Towers apartment building at 305 East 86th Street, on {{the northeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 86th Street. In 2009, a Finding Of No Significant Impact by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) found this to be unfeasible, so the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) revised the plan to two separate sidewalk entrances in front of the building. During the planning process, it was determined that building a new entrance within the Yorkshire Towers would be too expensive and logistically unfeasible. The apartments directly above the entrance's location would have had to be structurally underpinned during construction, and the Food Emporium supermarket location would have had to close {{to make way for the}} new entrance. Of the three alternatives presented for moving the entrance, the MTA chose an alternative in which there would be two new <b>escalator</b> entrances on the north side of 86th Street, both flanking the semicircular driveway of Yorkshire Towers and facing away from the driveway. There was also a proposal to move the sidewalk <b>escalator</b> entrances to the south side of the street, as well as another proposal to build a new structure containing five elevators at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 86th Street, in a manner similar to Entrance 3 of the adjacent 72nd Street station.|$|E
5|$|The {{service state}} of {{elevators}} and escalators is of public concern. WMATA posts a webpage that is updated daily to notify users of elevator and <b>escalator</b> outages. The NTSB has criticised {{the ability of}} Metrorail's Series 1000 cars to withstand collisions even at very low speeds. WMATA has ordered new cars to replace its Series 1000 fleet.|$|E
5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short <b>escalators</b> and a stair from the {{northwest}} corner, a staircase from the southwest corner, and a short elevator hidden {{around the corner from}} the <b>escalators.</b> From the fare control, {{there are two}} long <b>escalators</b> and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter <b>escalators</b> and a pair of stairs to a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two <b>escalators</b> and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|R

5|$|Between April and August 2016 the Bakerloo line {{platforms}} {{were closed}} to enable <b>escalator</b> replacements {{and the construction}} of connecting passageways to the new Crossrail platforms due to open in 2018. In December 2016 Westminster City Council approved proposals to construct a new mixed-use development called Paddington Quarter on a site adjacent to the mainline station. The plans include reconstruction of the Bakerloo line station to provide a larger ticket hall and better access between platforms and street level.|$|E
5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on either {{ends of the}} station hall and the two <b>escalator</b> tunnels. On the side {{that leads to the}} exit to the city, a panel was installed depicting the patron saint of Kiev, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, {{at the very end of}} the station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of the mosaic panels at the end of the station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|E

The original <b>escalators</b> entered service when the station opened in 1981. On January 5, 2015, work began to replace the <b>escalators,</b> expected to run through mid-2018.|$|R
5|$|The L'Enfant Plaza Metro station {{opened an}} <b>escalator</b> {{entrance}} in the structure's north arcade on July 1, 1977. The entrance {{was one of}} two which opened that day (Metro Blue Line's opening day). The third entrance (inside the L'Enfant Promenade underground shopping center at L'Enfant Plaza) opened in October 1977. In June 1992, Virginia Railway Express opened the $1.1 million VRE L'Enfant Station on Virginia Avenue SE (about a half block north of Constitution Center).|$|E
5|$|The London Underground {{station is}} on the Bakerloo line between Baker Street and Edgware Road {{stations}} and is, along with the main line station, in Transport for London fare zone 1. Access is via escalators from the main line station concourse which houses the Underground station's ticket office. Until 2004, a wooden <b>escalator</b> led into the station, {{one of the last}} on the London Underground system that had not been replaced {{as a consequence of the}} King's Cross fire in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} built {{as part of}} the sixth and seventh {{sections}} of the IND Concourse Line beginning in the late 1920s. The station was built underneath preexisting private property for most of its length, passing directly under East 205th Street at its eastern end. The station opened on July 1, 1933, {{along with the rest of}} the Concourse subway. On July 1, 1937, an <b>escalator</b> was opened in the station, the first of its kind in the Bronx.|$|E
25|$|In {{shopping}} centres and metro stations {{there may}} be an odd number of <b>escalators,</b> with one or more <b>escalators</b> running in different directions in different time of a day.|$|R

50|$|Thane {{station is}} the first station in Mumbai Suburban network to have <b>escalators</b> {{installed}} on two of its platforms. The <b>escalators</b> were inaugurated by Thane guardian minister Ganesh Naik.|$|R
5|$|The {{subway station}} at Porter is, at 105 feet below ground level, the deepest in the MBTA system. Porter's unusual depth {{is due to}} the MBTA's {{decision}} to build the station in bedrock rather than soft clay, saving time and money in the construction process. Passengers reach Red Line platforms via a series of escalators, stairs totalling 199 steps, or a set of elevators. The longest single span of the escalators is 143feet, the longest in the MBTA system. In 2005, a man was killed when his sweatshirt tangled {{in the bottom of the}} <b>escalator.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{escalators}} and two stairs {{from the main}} entrance to the upper mezzanine. Past the main entrance's fare control, which is split into two banks, there are two parallel shafts down to the lower mezzanine; the northern shaft carries four escalators, while the southern shaft carries one <b>escalator</b> and the two incline elevators. The lowermost five escalators are the system's longest and take about one minute and thirty seconds to traverse.|$|E
5|$|Completion of {{the station}} {{buildings}} was delayed for many years. Designed by the architect Charles Holden, the pre-war plans included a large entrance building {{at the top of}} the hill next to The Woodman public house with a pair of escalators between the entrance and the sub-surface concourse. These were to be enclosed in an inclined structure down the side of the cutting parallel with the surface tracks. Taking inspiration from the local legend, the building would have been topped by a statue of Dick Whittington and his cat. When works were finished in 1957, a single, upwards only, <b>escalator</b> was provided to take passengers from the sub-surface ticket hall up to a simple exit {{at the top of the}} cutting.|$|E
50|$|A {{passageway}} {{connects the}} mezzanine's east {{end to the}} only access to the station. The original entrance pavilion {{was replaced by the}} current more modest structure. It features two parallel <b>escalators,</b> one up and the other down, which are separated by a central unused space that is provisioned to accommodate two additional <b>escalators.</b> The <b>escalators</b> are flanked by two staircases.|$|R
50|$|Stairs, <b>escalators,</b> and {{elevators}} {{lead from}} the bus platform down three levels to the train platform. The upper concourse, one floor below the bus platform, is a corridor running {{the length of the}} bus platform. It collects the landings of all of the terminal's stairs and <b>escalators</b> and leads to another bank of stairs and <b>escalators</b> down to the lower concourse.|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} to add <b>escalators</b> {{was taken in}} mid-2012. Installation {{was scheduled to be}} completed by June 2014. <b>Escalators</b> have been installed at Wadala, Chembur, Mysore Colony and Fertilizer Township.|$|R
5|$|On September 15, 2011, the {{contract}} for building {{the station was}} awarded to the joint venture of Skanska USA and Traylor Bros Inc. , the cavern stretching from 83rd to 87th Streets was 57% excavated. By July 2013, construction of the station was 53% complete. The final blast for the 86th Street station was completed for an <b>escalator</b> cavern on November 22, 2013. Skanska/Traylor were still installing waterproofing and steel reinforcement, as well as putting concrete around the underground cavern, entrances, and ancillaries. , entrances 1 and 2 were being built, and excavation was 100% complete; , the station shell was complete, bringing the total Second Avenue Subway project progress to three-fourths completion.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the <b>escalator</b> at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
5|$|The station, {{originally}} {{part of the}} city's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics and {{the failed}} attempt to build the West Side Stadium, was first {{scheduled to open in}} summer 2012. When London was chosen for the Olympics, the opening date was pushed to December 2013. In 2011, the opening was postponed to June 2014, pending the completion of the escalators and elevators in the station. After a series of delays involving <b>escalator,</b> elevator, and fire and safety systems, the station finally opened on September 13, 2015. The 34th Street station is the first completely new station in the New York City Subway system since 1989, as well as the first such station funded by the government of New York City since 1950.|$|E
25|$|The Anacostia {{station has}} had {{relatively}} few maintenance issues during its lifetime. In 1997, the station's <b>escalators</b> suffered repeated breakdown, as did <b>escalators</b> throughout the Metrorail system, due to poor maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Otis Elevator Company {{installed}} 4 <b>escalators</b> in 1934, {{the first}} in Dayton. They still remain operational along with <b>escalators</b> in Connecticut and at the Smithsonian, the only examples surviving from that era.|$|R
50|$|Access to the Northern line {{platforms}} was indirect, its <b>escalators</b> {{connecting with}} the Piccadilly line. As the traffic {{from all three}} tube lines would have overcrowded the Victoria line <b>escalators,</b> Northern line trains skipped Kings Cross until repairs were complete. The nearly life-expired Northern line <b>escalators</b> were replaced as well and the Northern line station reopened, completing the return to normal operation, on 5 March 1989.|$|R
