40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different loads on the stress-strain state of the freight car bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame,</b> {{as well as to}} {{evaluate the}} distribution of the stress fields {{in the design of the}} freight car bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> supported through the horizontal surface and through the horizontal and inclined surfaces of the pedestal opening. Methodology. A volumetric finite element model of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> of ZK- 1 bogie of the freight car was designed. The forces under the current regulatory documentation for theoretical research were applied to the model, the stress arising in the model elements were determined. The static tests of ZK- 1 bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> were conducted; they allowed determining the stresses in the key points of the frame under the action of forces in accordance with the existing procedure of static tests of the freight car bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame.</b> To check the quality of the finite element model we determined the stress in the model under the action of forces corresponding to the static requirements. The corresponding coefficients were determined to match the stress obtained through theoretical studies and static tests. The results of theoretical and experimental studies of stress for dangerous sections of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> design were compared. Findings. The regulatory documentation for carrying out experimental research of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> strength does not fully take into account the load acting on the frame during its operation and that provided while assessing the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> strength theoretically. The strength evaluation of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> by the results of field tests only does not give a complete picture of the distribution of stress fields, as the provided sensor installation points do not cover most of the design elements with possible stress concentration. Originality. The loads applied to the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> during theoretical and experimental studies were compared to the loads acting during operation. The impact of use of inclined surfaces in the pedestal box opening was evaluated. Practical value. The obtained results allow the more accurate assessment of the three-piece bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> strength, as well as allow you to choose the more preferred method of <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> support in the axle box...|$|R

40|$|The coding {{efficiency}} of Wyner-Ziv frames relies considerably {{on the quality}} of side information and the capability to model the statistical dependency between the original <b>frame</b> and <b>side</b> information. In the field of distributed multi-view video coding (DMVC), {{there are two kinds of}} side information, namely temporal side information (TSI), which is generated by exploiting the temporal correlation, and inter-view side information (IVSI), which is generated by exploiting the inter-view correlation. This paper proposes a new fusion method to get better side information by the region-based combination of TSI and IVSI. Besides, an improved statistical model of “correlation channel ” is proposed to estimate the statistical dependency between the original <b>frame</b> and <b>side</b> information at the decoder. We call it Region-based Correlation Channel Model (RCCM). The RCCM models the “correlation channel ” between original <b>frame</b> and <b>side</b> information at a fine granularity level by detecting the spatial quality variation of side information within each Wyner-Ziv frame. Experimental results demonstrate that the RCCM can more accurately model the “correlation channel ” between the original <b>frame</b> and <b>side</b> information and thus, less bits are required for decoding a Wyner-Ziv frame...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} {{applications}} for cold formed carbon steel ‘C ’ sections is through load carrying structural <b>frame</b> <b>side</b> members in heavy road vehicles. Though {{it is expected that}} forming operations would enhance the mechanical properties of sections as a whole by strain-hardening, it leaves certain amount of residual stresses throughout the sections. It is thus necessary to account for the effect of residual stresses remaining from cold forming operations accurately, while assessing the mechanical behavior of truck side frame rail sections. In this work, an experimental investigation was carried out to assess residual stresses induced by cold forming operation of truck frame rail sections through X-ray diffraction method. Also an attempt was made to study the effect of shot-peening operation employed as a surface enhancement method on frame rail residual stresses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{large numbers}} of bolt holes cut into truck <b>frame</b> <b>side</b> members act as joineries and points of {{attachments}} for various sub systems of the truck. While these bolt holes are unavoidable due to their primary functional importance, the near hole residual stress resulting from the type of hole cutting operation {{plays a significant role}} in deciding the fatigue performance of frame rail structures. If the residual stress is tensile in nature, this along with the surface roughness at the hole surface can lead to early initiation of fatigue cracks around bolt hole surface. In order to assess the extent of plastic deformation and resulting residual stresses in near hole areas of frame bolt holes cut using drilling, punching, laser cutting and water jet cutting processes, experimental investigation was carried out through microstructure analysis and X-ray diffraction measurements. Apart from this, an assessment of shot-peened hole surface was taken up to understand the effect of shot-peening on fatigue behavior of frame rail section with bolt holes. Also the test specimens extracted from frame rail sections were tested for comparing the fatigue life of specimens having bolt holes cut using different hole cutting operations...|$|E
