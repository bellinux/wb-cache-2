However, this assembly strongly relies on particle volume fraction, particle interaction potentials, polydisterity, and shear rate and strain. The large amount of directing factors can cause complications in directing self-assembly by LAOS. <b>Diblock</b> <b>copolymer</b> micells have recently been studied in regard to structuring nanoparticles in bulk.|$|E

The thermal behavior and specific interaction of PHEMA-b-PVP <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> and their corresponding PHEMA/PVP blends were characterized. The result shows that glass transition temperatures of <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are {{higher than those of}} the blends.

Measurement of the proton spinelattice relaxation time in the rotating frame, ðTH 1 rÞ, reveals that all <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> and blends possess one composition-dependent TH 1 r, indicating that both <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> and blends are homogeneous, which is consistent with the DSC analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of arm number of Poly(l-lactide) - b -methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (PLL- b -MPEG) amphiphilic <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> on their characteristics of drug-loaded nanoparticles and in vitro drug release. Linear and star-shaped PLL- b -MPEG <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> were synthesized via the ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide followed by coupling reaction with a monofunctional carboxyl end-group MPEG. These <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> included linear copolymer having one arm and star-shaped copolymers having four and six arms. The crystallinity of MPEG block within <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> was suppressed. The melting point (T m) and degree of crystallinity (X c) of PLL block within <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> decreased as the arm number increased. Drug-loaded nanoparticles of these copolymers were prepared by the emulsification-diffusion method under surfactant-free condition. Indomethacin was used as a poorly water-soluble model drug. The nanoparticles with less than 200 nm in size were nearly spherical shape. Different arm numbers did not affect average size and drug loading efficiency. However, the T m and X c of <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> slightly decreased after drug loading.

50|$|BSM is {{an active}} area of {{research}} for several biomedical engineering applications. Due to its adsorption on solid surfaces, it is useful in vivo to prevent bacterial infections. BSM and bacteria compete for adsorption sites; mucin adhesion blocks bacterial adhesion on surfaces. Consequently, the risk of bacterial attachment and infection is reduced. While bacterial infections are common concerns in the medical, dental, and food industries, they are {{the primary cause of}} device failures in biological implants. To combat this issue, BSM {{has been used as a}} coating for a poly(acrylic acid-b-methyl methacrylate) (PAA-b-PMMA) <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymer.</b> The copolymer provides two mechanisms that contribute to the bacterial resistance of the biomaterial. First, the PAA block assists the adsorption of BSM to the surface. Second, the PMMA block prevents the dissolution of BSM in aqueous environments. This behavior is imperative in the lubrication of cardiovascular stents and urinary catheters as they are inserted within patients. Due to the adsorption of BSM, the hydrophobicity of the surface decreases as well as the incidence of bacterial adhesion.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a functional <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymer</b> in compatibilization of two immiscible homopolymers was investigated. For this study, polystyrene (PS) and poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) were used {{as a pair of}} immiscible homopolymers, and polystyrene-block-poly(2 -vinylpyridine) (S 2 VP <b>diblock)</b> <b>copolymer</b> was used as a functionalized compatibilizer. The rationale behind the choice of the ternary blend system lies in that the hydroxyl groups in PHEMA and the pyridine groups in the poly(2 -vinylpyridine) (P 2 VP) block of S 2 VP <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymer</b> are expected to form hydrogen bonds, enhancing the miscibility between the PS and the PHEMA in the ternary blends. Indeed, the presence of specific interactions (hydrogen bonding) between PHEMA and S 2 VP <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymer</b> was observed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, inducing a diffuse interphase between PS and PHEMA in the ternary blend during melt blending above the order-disorder transition temperature of the <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymer.</b> However, the interphase was not thermally stable. The <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymer</b> in the interphase was driven into the PHEMA-rich phase due to the specific interactions...|$|E

We use double emulsion as {{a template for}} the assembly of amphiphilic <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> into vesicle structures. These polymersomes {{can be used to}} encapsulate small hydrophilic solutes. When triggered by an osmotic shock, the polymersomes break and release the solutes, providing a simple and effective release mechanism. The technique can also be applied to <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> with different hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic block ratios, or mixtures of <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> and hydrophobic homopolymers. The ability to make polymer vesicles with copolymers of different block ratios and to incorporate different homopolymers into the polymersomes will allow the tuning of polymersome properties for specific technological applications. © 2008 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

A similar decoration of the surfactant membrane is possible in the lamellar phase. At high <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymer</b> densities, in the brush regime, a change in the dependence of the bending rigidity on the molecular size and concentration of the <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymer</b> is predicted theoretically. In particular a very strong dependence of the bending rigidity on the radius of gyration of the <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymer</b> (kappa proportional to R- 5) is predicted.

Polyoxometalates (POM), on the other hand, being an interesting class of metal-oxygen nanometer-sized anionic clusters, are regarded highly due to their excellent electron accepting capability.

40|$|Two {{series of}} poly(butadiene-block-(styrene-stat-butadiene) (PB-SBR) <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> were {{synthesized}} to study interrelations between microphase-separated state and relaxation dynamics. Series I consists of six symmetric PB-SBR samples (ΦSBR ∼ 0. 50) with different styrene contents in the random SBR block (21 mol% ≤ xS,SBR ≤ 52 mol%). Series II contains six asymmetric PB-SBR <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> with almost constant styrene {{content in the}} SBR block (xS,SBR = 32 ± 4 mol%) and SBR volume fractions {{in the range of}} 0. 20 ≤ ΦSBR ≤ 0. 69. All PB-SBR <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> have a total molecular weight of about 200 kg/mol with 1, 2 -vinyl content of about 8. 5 and 15. 8 mol% in the soft PB and in the hard SBR block, respectively. A novel synthesis route has been developed so as to maintain low 1, 2 -vinyl contents in both blocks and a random distribution of the styrene units in the SBR block. The softening behavior of non–cross-linked PB-SBR diblocks was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, providing first information about miscibility. The morphology of cross-linked PB-SBR <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers,</b> which have been vulcanized with sulfur at 150 °C using standard procedures, was studied by atomic force microscopy. Dynamic shear measurements aimed at understanding the influence of morphological changes on the segmental dynamics of both phases, αPB and αSBR, were performed on vulcanized samples. Atomic force microscopy results and shear data indicate that symmetric <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> with styrene content higher than 27 mol% in the SBR block are well microphase separated. Strongly segregated states are also observed for asymmetric <b>diblock</b> <b>copolymers</b> with volume fractions 0. 28 ≤ ΦSBR ≤ 0. 60 showing cylindrical and lamellar morphologies.

In contrast to conventional amphiphilic block copolymers, whose self-organization is driven by unspecific hydrophobic interactions and leads to polydisperse aggregates, it was anticipated that this approach could allow precise control over the aggregation number in aqueous solution.
