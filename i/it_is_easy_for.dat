5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E

25|$|Early {{archaeology}} {{was largely}} {{an attempt to}} uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Early archaeology was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This generalization {{laid the foundation for}} the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. This generalization has been with western culture for a long time. Another popular thought that dates back to this era is that archaeology is monetarily lucrative. A large majority of the general public is under the impression that excavations are undertaken for money and not historical data. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the general public to hold this notion for that is what is presented to them through general media, and has been for many decades.|$|E

25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E

[...] Listing the biggest mistakes to avoid in the game, GamesRadar advised Ibuki's players to not oversuse her [...] "kunai air-knives", but to rather use them sparingly in not predictably {{as a tool to}} help get close to the opponent. According to GamesRadar, [...] "Ibuki makes up for her relatively weak damage by having some of the trickiest mobility in the game, letting a skilled player dash circles around their confused opponent." [...] According to Edge, Ultra Street Fighter IVs addition of delayed wakeup, which lets one stay on the floor longer after being knocked down to put an opponent off their rhythm, was [...] "primarily designed to nerf characters like Cammy, Akuma and Ibuki who are at their most effective when an opponent is getting up off the ground." [...] Professional player Sakonoko, whose preferred character in Super Street Fighter IV was Ibuki, said in interview for Famitsu that Ibuki in Street Fighter X Tekken [...] "is ultimately based on her SSFIV Arcade Edition version" [...] and so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> people familiar with this game [...] "to jump right in."

For example, the belief that a sorcerer has [...] "stolen" [...] a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).|$|E

[...] This same imagery is used again in Sonnet 40, when the speaker says, [...] "I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief." [...] Sonnet 41 implies that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the speaker to forgive the fair youth his betrayal, {{since it is the}} mistress that [...] "woos," [...] tempted by the fair youth's beauty just as the speaker admires it.
