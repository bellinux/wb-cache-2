He made his radio debut on ShowTime in 1948, followed by appearances in Ray's a Laugh, Starlight Hour, The Gang Show, Henry Hall's Guest Night and It's Fine To Be Young. Along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, he {{took part in}} the radio series The Goon Show (1951–60).

His stage appearances were few, largely because he had been unhappy with the touring he had done as a child with his family. During his career he also released a number of albums containing sketches and comic songs; the songs were undertaken in a variety of comic characters.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{improved}} as a blocker in {{his second}} season with the Eagles. At the start of training camp in 1992, Davis vowed to refuse all requests <b>for</b> <b>interviews</b> by the media in an attempt to focus on getting better. In the season-opener against the New Orleans Saints, Davis helped the Eagles lead the NFC in rushing for the week with 186yards. Against the Washington Redskins in week seven on October 18, 1992, he suffered a knee sprain after quarterback Randall Cunningham ran into him. He was listed as doubtful before the following game against the Phoenix Cardinals, and did not play in the game. He was listed as doubtful again before the game against the Dallas Cowboys in week nine. Otho Davis, the team's head athletic trainer, said Davis was not working hard enough to rehabilitate his knee. Antone Davis was upgraded to questionable two days before the game, and started against the Cowboys on November 1. In the wild card playoff game against the Saints on January 3, 1993, Davis gave up a sack against Rickey Jackson, which caused a Cunningham fumble. Davis started in all 15 games he played during the regular season, and started in both of the team's playoff games. Pro Football Weekly rated Davis as the 26th-best offensive tackle in the league for the season.|$|E

25|$|Sobhraj {{is widely}} {{believed}} to be a psychopath. He was driven to murder as a means to sustain his adventurous lifestyle. This, as well as his cunning and cultured personality, made him a celebrity long before his release from prison. He enjoyed the attention, charging large amounts of money <b>for</b> <b>interviews</b> and film rights. He {{has been the subject of}} four books and three documentaries. Sobhraj's return to India, where he was still eagerly sought by authorities, is believed to be the result of his yearning for attention and overconfidence in his own intellect.|$|E

Gaines interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word People magazine series in February and March 1987. Chapman told the parole board he regretted the interview. Chapman later gave a series of audio-taped interviews to Jack Jones of the Democrat and Chronicle. In 1992 Jones published a book, Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon.|$|E

She did work on a follow-up novel—The Long Goodbye—but eventually filed it away unfinished. During the mid-1980s, she began a factual book about an Alabama serial murderer, but also put it aside when she was not satisfied. Her withdrawal from public life prompted unfounded speculation that new publications were in the works.|$|E
