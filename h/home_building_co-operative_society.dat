In 1945, Leo Purcell, while {{a patient}} at a {{military}} hospital on the Atherton Tableland, worked out a scheme to provide low-cost homes, that in February 1947 became known as [...] "Peter Lalor Co-operative Family Scheme" [...] and with a group of ex-servicemen formed the Peter Lalor <b>Home</b> <b>Building</b> <b>Co-operative</b> <b>Society.</b> The scheme was sponsored by the ex-servicemen's committee of the central executive of the Victorian Labour Party. They chose two hundred and fifty-eight acres east of today's Lalor railway station to be the site of the new developments and the town planner Saxil Tuxen was hired to design a garden suburb.|$|E

40|$|This thesis uses Hong Kong’s {{empirical}} data to refute “Olson’s conjecture,” which {{stated that it}} is harder for a smaller group than a larger group to disintegrate. It investigates {{the rise and fall}} of the civil servants’ <b>co-operative</b> <b>building</b> <b>society,</b> which was a special form of housing arrangement for civil servants in Hong Kong that began in the 1950 s. The focus is on the voluntary dissolution of civil servants’ <b>co-operative</b> <b>building</b> <b>societies.</b> Members of a society have a choice to maintain the status quo or opt for dissolution to potentially increase the value of their properties. Olson’s group theory (Olson 1965) and neo-classical economics factors were adopted to evaluate the decision time (i. e., from 1985 until the dissolution date) of the <b>co-operative</b> <b>building</b> <b>society.</b> Group size, land value, the real option value of redevelopment, and the overall housing market sentiment were significant factors that affected the timing of the dissolution of each <b>co-operative</b> <b>building</b> <b>society.</b> published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Education appears to stand aloof from using findings from such disciplines for pedagogical design. This chapter explores effects on social and learning experiences of students in university seminars where attention to noticing disadvantaging of others and acting to reduce it (enacting compassion) is supported and required. The locus was a UK university. Student's observable, on the hoof endeavours to challenge and develop others not only themselves, was credit bearing towards their degrees. Development here relates to social inclusion/equitable levels of participation in the task focussed group, and also to academic quality of contributions to the group work, that is, critically evaluative discussions of research...|$|R
50|$|The St.George <b>Co-operative</b> <b>Building</b> <b>Society</b> Ltd. {{was formed}} on 6 May 1937 in the Sydney suburb of Hurstville, with George Cross {{as the first}} Chairman of the Board. The Cronulla & District <b>Co-operative</b> <b>Building</b> <b>Society</b> was formed in June 1937. The two Co-operatives merged in 1945, and with the post-war housing boom, the St.George and Cronulla Building Society {{expanded}} rapidly, with 38 branches established by 1955. In 1955, the Society became a Permanent Building Society, which enabled its loans to be larger and terms shorter. In 1961 the first Sydney branch opened in Miranda, followed by the first Sydney city branch in August 1963. The expansion of the branch network continued through the 1960s. The Society also operated 41 agencies.|$|R
50|$|Rabbi Baruch Ashlag {{spent many}} years formulating the {{fundamentals}} of <b>building</b> a <b>co-operative</b> <b>society</b> that strives to achieve spirituality, the way Kabbalists perceived it throughout the generations: achieving love of the God by means of first attaining love of man. For this reason, the bulk of Rabash's essays are dedicated to explication and simplification {{of the principles of}} the spiritual work of an individual within such a society. The actual spiritual work is revealed through study and a process of internal transformation. Therefore the teaching cannot be understood simply intellectually and is dependent on the inner processes the disciple experiences.|$|R
