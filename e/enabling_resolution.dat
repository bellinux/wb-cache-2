In responding to the question of why the R 2 P has not been implemented by the UN, this thesis finds that the proponents of the General Assembly {{have not been able to}} introduce an <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> on the R 2 P because of the number of indeterminate states within the system. These are states that have either taken a stand that is neither in favour nor against the implementation of the R 2 P, or which have not made statements on the subject, thereby making it difficult to predict which way they would vote on such an <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution.</b> Using a neoclassical realist lens, this thesis focuses on two specific states – Malaysia and India – as case studies of the multilateral negotiations and debates on the R 2 P. It draws upon original elite interviews with the foreign policy makers of both countries and analyses the strategies used by Malaysia and India in the discussions of the R 2 P implementation at the UN General Assembly...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} {{ratio of the}} amino acids alanine and serine in calcite opercula of freshwater gastropods of genus Bithynia has been assessed as an age proxy for British Middle and Late Pleistocene sites. Due to decomposition of peptide-bound serine within intra-crystalline protein molecules, alanine/serine ratios increase with sample age, <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> of the marine oxygen-isotope stage of almost all sites and substage resolution for some sites. However, slight overlaps are evident in alanine/serine ratios between some sites from late in one temperate stage and early in the next; this effect results from the low decomposition rates during cold stages, combined with an evident slight dependence of decomposition rates on site conditions. The technique, which can be extended to the Early Pleistocene without technical refinements, is amenable to quantitative calibration using a first-order rate equation, making it feasible in future to present results as numerical ages, subject to an assumed temperature history. Most Pleistocene sites investigated are shown using this technique {{to have the same}} ages as previously deduced using biostratigraphy. However, the serine–alanine ages obtained preclude glaciation of southeast England during MIS 16 or of central England during MIS 10...|$|E
40|$|Internet domains {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of our lives, so one can easily understand that during their use, conflicts can arise, whose participants will search for rules <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> of conflicts. Since the domain name is a replacement of the computer IP address, in the technical sense of the word, this does not concern for domain names a commercial name or brand, because it primarily does not belong to a person in the legal sense of the word and does not serve for its individualization. The average user regularly affiliates domain names with a person offering goods or services on the relevant Website. Domain names used by entrepreneurs in their business activity are often chosen so that the second-level domain (SLD) would use words that form the trade name of corporations formed of trading companies. This fact brings domain names close to such designations that serve the individualization of persons or products, especially the trademarks and the commercial name. Domains can come into conflict with the rights to designations, especially trademarks and commercial names. Court practice is resolving these conflicts using rules for unfair competition, or rules for protection of commercial names and trademarks, but it is not ruled out that in the future, special legal regulation of domain names could be established...|$|E

The thesis is divided into 9 chapters, which are further divided into subchapters. The thesis is further bounded by introduction and conclusion. The first chapter deals with the definition of arbitration and furthermore here we can find the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and explanations of theoretical concepts of arbitration.

40|$|Referencing Diana Athill’s memoir, Alive, Alive Oh! And Other Things That Matter (2015), {{this article}} organises an {{analysis}} of the BBC television dramas A Cream Cracker under the Settee (1988) and She’s Been Away (1989) through the frame of Robert Butler’s concept of the life review (1975) which, he argues, is a process through which unresolved conflicts and past experiences return to reflective consciousness, thus <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> and recalibration of relationships and past events in the elderly. Viewed in the light of Butler’s ideas, Athill and the 75 -year-old female protagonist of each narrative suggest rarely depicted levels of agency and ongoing identity formation in the elderly. Although very different in tone, aesthetic appeal, narrative structure and class location, each drama similarly explores the inner lives of elderly women and reveals personal truths hitherto unacknowledged by them which also offer a reflection on wider society. In each case, the elderly protagonist {{can be seen as a}} subject in process with an identity formation that does not end in late life, while the life review also works to lift the veil between the dominant culture that largely wants to deny processes of ageing, and therefore death, and the lived experience of those undergoing the process...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} on the {{transposition}} behavior of the mercury(II) resistance transposons Tn 502 and Tn 512, which are members of the Tn 5053 family. These transposons exhibit targeted and oriented insertion in the par region of plasmid RP 1, since par-encoded components, namely, the ParA resolvase and its cognate res region, are essential for such transposition. Tn 502 and, under some circumstances, Tn 512 can transpose when par is absent, providing evidence for an alternative, par-independent pathway of transposition. We show that the alternative pathway proceeds by a two-step replicative process involving random target selection and orientation of insertion, leading to the formation of cointegrates as the predominant product of the first stage of transposition. Cointegrates remain unresolved because the transposon-encoded (TniR) recombination system is relatively inefficient, as is the host-encoded (RecA) system. In the presence of the res-ParA recom-bination system, TniR-mediated (and RecA-mediated) cointegrate resolution is highly efficient, <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> both of cointegrates involving functional transposons (Tn 502 and Tn 512) and of defective elements (In 0 and In 2). These findings implicate the target-encoded accessory functions in the second stage of trans-position {{as well as in the}} first. We also show that the par-independent pathway enables the formation of deletions in the target molecule. It is widely recognized that mobile genetic elements contribut...|$|E

This study was carried out in order to characterize their putative reactions with HIV- 1 and HTLV-I/II proteins and to resolve the retrovirus infection status of these individuals. Results indicated that blood donors sera displaying indeterminate HIV- 1 or HTLV-I/II Wb patterns were not immunoreactive to HTLV-I/II and HIV- 1 on IFA. However, a high rate of indeterminate HIV- 1 and HTLV-I/II Wb samples from high risk individuals had positive HTLV-I/II and HIV- 1 IFA results respectively. Our study supports the growing evidence that HTLV-HIV indeterminate seroreactivity in low risk population is due to a cross reaction against nonviral antigens, and in high risk populations the indeterminate samples show serological cross-recognition between HIV- 1 proteins and HTLV-I/II proteins on Wb. These results point out the necessity to investigate the HTLV-I/II reactivity in indeterminate HIV- 1 samples and viceversa in order to confirm the diagnosis. Finally, this study shows the potential usefulness of IFA in elucidating the status of HIV- 1 and HTLV-I/II infection of individuals with indeterminate Wb profiles, thus <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> of retrovirus infection status...|$|E

The frozen moment viewed in a single discrete time sample requires frequent repetition and updating before any appreciation of the dynamics of component interaction becomes possible. Even then in a sample derived from a cell population, time-averaging of processes and events that occur in out-of-phase individuals blur the detailed complexity of single cell organization. Continuously-grown cultures of yeast can become spontaneously self-synchronized, thereby <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> of far more detailed temporal structure. Continuous on-line monitoring by rapidly responding sensors (O 2 electrode and membrane-inlet mass spectrometry for O 2, CO 2 and H 2 S; direct fluorimetry for NAD(P) H and flavins) gives dynamic information from time-scales of minutes to hours. Supplemented with capillary electophoresis and gas chromatography mass spectrometry and transcriptomics the predominantly oscillatory behaviour of network components becomes evident, with a 40 min cycle between a phase of increased respiration (oxidative phase) and decreased respiration (reductive phase). Highly pervasive, this ultradian clock provides a coordinating function that links mitochondrial energetics and redox balance to transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial structure and organelle remodelling, DNA duplication and cell division events. Ultimately, this leads to a global partitioning of anabolism and catabolism and the enzymes involved, mediated by a relatively simple ATP feedback loop on chromatin architecture...|$|E
40|$|Interaction of the trypanocide {{isometamidium}} chloride with components of Trypanosoma congolense results in characteristic {{shifts in the}} intrinsic fluorescence of the drug. The specificity of this interaction was investigated by analysing the effects of various physicochemical manipulations on its fluorescence properties. The characteristic shifts involved a preferential increase in the intensity of one emission peak over the other, resulting in a systematic increase in the ratio of fluorescence intensities. These effects were apparently due to constraints on fluorophore free rotation in the solution (that is, viscosity). Purified DNA produced similar effects in a saturable manner displaying high affinity for the drug, indicating that the constraint involves binding of the drug to high-affinity binding sites within the DNA. Such binding sites were demonstrated in lysates derived from trypanosomal cells. The binding sites were associated with macromolecular species (M(r) > 12000), and were partly disrupted by thermal denaturation and proteolysis. Treatment with DNase 1 produced high levels of disruption of the binding sites (> 85 %), indicating an involvement of DNA in the binding. BSA demonstrated weak non-specific binding of the drug. Entry of drug into live trypanosomal cells (monitored by 14 C-labelled drug uptake) was paralleled by fluorescence shifts observed under comparable conditions of drug concentration and buffer conditions. Both systems (fluorescence shifts and accumulation of labelled drug) indicated {{the presence of a}} saturable membrane transporter with high affinity for the drug. We conclude that monitoring the fluorescence shifts of isometamidium constitutes a sensitive and highly specific probe for entry of the drug into trypanosomal cells, thereby <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> of the transport events involved...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{scheduling}} {{of production}} lots {{is of great}} importance for manufacturing medium to high-volume products that require significant setup times. Compared to traditional entire-lot production, lot splitting techniques divide a production lot into multiple smaller sublots so that each sublot can be "transferred" from one stage of operation to the next {{as soon as it}} has been completed. "Transfer lots," therefore, significantly reduce lead times and lower work-in-process (WIP) inventory. The mathematical modeling, analysis, and control of transfer lots, however, is extremely difficult. This paper presents a novel integer programming formulation with separable structure for scheduling job shops with fixed-size transfer lots. A solution methodology based on a synergistic combination of Lagrangian relaxation, backward dynamic programming (BDP), and heuristics is developed. Through explicit modeling of lot dynamics, transfer lots are handled on standard machines, machines with setups, and machines requiring all transfer lots within a production lot to be processed simultaneously. With "substates" and the derivation of DP functional equations considering transfer lot dynamics, the standard BDP is extended to solve the lot-level subproblems. The recently developed "time step reduction technique" is also used for increased efficiency. It implicitly establishes two time scales to reduce computational requirements without much loss of modeling accuracy and scheduling performance, thus <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> of long-horizon problems within controllable computational requirements. The method has been implemented using object-oriented programming language C++, and numerical tests show that high-quality schedules involving transfer lots are efficiently generated to achieve on-time delivery of products with low WIP inventory...|$|E

40|$|The {{induction}} of {{a broadly}} neutralizing antibody (BNAb) response against HIV- 1 {{would be a}} desirable feature of a protective vaccine. Vaccine strategies thus far have failed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses; however a minority of HIV-infected patients do develop circulating BNAbs, from which several potent broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been isolated. The findings that several BNmAbs exhibit autoreactivity and that autoreactive serum antibodies are observed in some HIV patients have advanced the possibility that enforcement of self-tolerance {{may contribute to the}} rarity of BNAbs. To examine the possible breakdown of tolerance in HIV patients, we utilized the 9 G 4 anti-idiotype antibody system, <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> of both autoreactive VH 4 - 34 gene-expressing B cells and serum antibodies. Compared with healthy controls, HIV patients had significantly elevated 9 G 4 + serum IgG antibody concentrations and frequencies of 9 G 4 + B cells, a finding characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, both of which positively correlated with HIV viral load. Compared to the global 9 G 4 −IgD− memory B cell population, the 9 G 4 +IgD− memory fraction in HIV patients was dominated by isotype switched IgG+ B cells, but had a more prominent bias toward “IgM only" memory. HIV envelope reactivity was observed both in the 9 G 4 + serum antibody and 9 G 4 + B cell population. 9 G 4 + IgG serum antibody levels positively correlated (r =  0. 403, p =  0. 0019) with the serum HIV BNAbs. Interestingly, other serum autoantibodies commonly found in SLE (anti-dsDNA, ANA, anti-CL) did not correlate with serum HIV BNAbs. 9 G 4 -associated autoreactivity is preferentially expanded in chronic HIV infection as compared to other SLE autoreactivities. Therefore, the 9 G 4 system provides an effective tool to examine autoreactivity in HIV patients. Our results suggest that the development of HIV BNAbs is not merely a consequence of a general breakdown in tolerance, but rather a more intricate expansion of selective autoreactive B cells and antibodies...|$|E
40|$|Near-band-gap circularly {{polarized}} excitation in III-V semiconductors provides spin-polarized electrons that transfer spin order to lattice nuclei via {{fluctuations in the}} contact hyperfine interaction. This process of optical nuclear polarization and the complementary technique of optical detection of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provide extreme sensitivity enhancement and spatial selectivity in structured samples, enabling collection of NMR spectra from samples such as single quantum wells or dots containing as few as 10 ^ 5 nuclei. Combining these advances with novel techniques for high spectral resolution, we have probed quantum-confined electronic states near the interface of a single epitaxially grown Al(1 -x) Ga(x) As/GaAs (x = 0. 36) heterojunction. Using a novel strategy that we refer to as POWER (perturbations observed with enhanced resolution) NMR, multiple-pulse time suspension is synchronized with bandgap optical irradiation to reveal spectra of effective spin Hamiltonians that are differences between those of the occupied and unoccupied photoexcited electronic state. The underlying NMR linewidth is reduced by three orders of magnitude in these experiments, <b>enabling</b> <b>resolution</b> of an asymmetric line shape due to light-induced hyperfine interactions. The results are successfully fit with the coherent nuclear spin evolution and relaxation theoretically expected for sites distributed over the volume of an electronic excitation weakly localized at a point defect. This analysis establishes a one-to-one relationship, {{which can be used}} to follow nuclear spin diffusion, between optical Knight shift and the radial position of lattice nuclei. We have also introduced POWER NMR techniques to characterize the change in electric field associated with cycling from light-on to light-off states via a linear quadrupole Stark effect (LQSE) of the nuclear spins. Simulations of these NMR spectra in terms of the radial electric fields of either donor-bound electrons or excitons indicate differences, where the bound-exciton model provides a significantly better fit to the data. The same spin physics enabled our measurement of the heterojunction interfacial field, which we find to be less than 1. 3 kV/cm at the sites responsible for optical NMR. Other simulations show the promise of optical NMR as a tool in future studies aimed at atomic-level characterization of quantum-confined systems such as quantum dots and well...|$|E
