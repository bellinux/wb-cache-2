5|$|Ecotourism setups {{are being}} used to {{generate}} public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, {{while at the same time}} generating revenue that can be used <b>in</b> <b>conservation</b> efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rasmussen {{was part}} of a large multi-institutional {{collaboration}} investigating biodiversity hotspots, which have a prominent role <b>in</b> <b>conservation.</b> The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity – species richness, the level of threat, and the number of endemism species. The results demonstrated that hotspots did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of hotspots registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% of the variation in the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.|$|E

5|$|In October 2008, the IMA {{announced}} a $2.6 million {{grant from the}} Lilly Endowment to be used toward {{the creation of a}} state-of-the-art conservation science lab. Through a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Dr. Gregory Dale Smith, was hired in October 2009 to lead the lab as its senior conservation scientist. A main focus of the lab is researching the IMA's collection, including couture fashion in the textile collection and objects made of synthetic materials in the design collection. Another focus is scientific research on materials found in the collections, such as resins and dyes on African art pieces and glazes on Asian ceramics. Through the addition of the lab, the IMA aims to establish itself as an internationally recognized conservation center and to increase its potential as a training and professional development resource <b>in</b> <b>conservation</b> science.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the central British state began to reacquire {{control of the}} sites. Caernarfon had never left the direct control of the Crown, but Harlech was {{transferred}} to the control of the Office of Works in 1914, Beaumaris followed in 1925 and Conwy was finally leased to the Ministry of Works in 1953. The state invested heavily <b>in</b> <b>conservation</b> of the sites. The 1920s saw large-scale conservation programmes at both Beaumaris and Harlech, stripping back the vegetation, digging out the moat and repairing the stonework, but otherwise leaving the sites intact and avoiding outright restoration. Major work was undertaken at Conwy in the 1950s and 1960s, including the clearing away of newer buildings encroaching on the 13th-century walls.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas. Hand-raised birds {{can be bought}} for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture. Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate, although males may become imprinted and unlikely to breed. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly seen of the black cockatoos in captivity, and can be hardy and long-lived if given plenty of space. Until now, most birds in captivity have been of subspecies C. b. banksii and C. b. samueli. Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. However, {{with an increase in}} interest <b>in</b> <b>conservation,</b> more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the time}} of its {{discovery}} in 1905, there have been many attempts to estimate the population size of this species. Results varied greatly, but the more recent ones suggest a very reduced number of individuals. This coupled with a very restricted distribution have led to the listing of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as an endangered or threatened species. Humans frequently invade its habitat, though such disturbances have been greatly reduced by preventive measures. Recent efforts <b>in</b> <b>conservation</b> include perpetuating the extant population at a baseline size as well as maintaining captive populations.|$|E
5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved <b>in</b> <b>conservation</b> of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E

5|$|Interest in {{the town}} walls grew and in the 19th century one of the towers was {{restored}} {{and part of the}} wall-walk opened up for tourists. The walls were architecturally surveyed for the first time between 1928 and 1930, with the results published in 1938. The town walls were leased from Conwy's local authority by the Ministry of Works in 1953, and a concerted effort began to conserve and protect the fortifications. Many of the houses and buildings which had grown up against the walls since the 14th century were removed in an effort to improve the appearance of the walled circuit and to assist <b>in</b> <b>conservation</b> and archaeological work, and one of the 19th-century gateways inserted by Telford was demolished in 1958. Arnold J. Taylor, a prominent historian of the Edwardian castles, conducted extensive academic work on the history and architecture of Conwy's walls during the 1950s and 1960s, adding to their prominence.|$|E
