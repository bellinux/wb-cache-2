5000|$|One {{composer}} who was {{influential in}} spreading {{the more serious}} style that Mozart and Haydn had formed is Muzio Clementi, a gifted virtuoso pianist who tied with Mozart in a musical [...] "duel" [...] before the emperor in which they each improvised on the piano and performed their compositions. Clementi's sonatas for the piano circulated widely, and he became the most successful composer in London during the 1780s. Also in London at this time was Jan Ladislav Dussek, who, like Clementi, encouraged piano makers to extend the range and other features of their instruments, and then fully exploited the newly opened up possibilities. The importance of London in the Classical period is often overlooked, but it served as the home to the Broadwood's factory for piano manufacturing and as the base for composers who, while less notable than the [...] "Vienna School", had a decisive influence on what came later. They were composers of many fine works, notable in their own right. London's taste for virtuosity may well have encouraged the complex passage work and <b>extended</b> <b>statements</b> on tonic and dominant.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to develop and test an {{algorithm}} of disaggregating the strategy plan for restructuring industrial enterprises within the concept of optimal planning based on the mathematical formulation {{of the problem of}} coordinating the strategy plan and strategic plan as well as statistical methods for solving complex in terms of their structure optimization problems of a combinatorial type. It is shown that in contrast to hierarchical systems of production and calendar planning characterized by a high level of certainty of procedures for aggregation and disaggregation of plan components of various hierarchical levels, the problem of disaggregating the strategy into more detailed strategic plans should be viewed as a problem of making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. There have been implemented a mathematical formulation of the problem of developing an optimal strategic plan based on the known strategy in an <b>extended</b> <b>statement</b> providing a possibility to correct the strategy parameters and other conditions of the strategic plan implementation to ensure the problem solvability.

40|$|Unconditional {{sentence}} of imprisonment from perspective {{of theory and}} practice Dissertation JUDr. Jiří Pleva Abstract Author tried to express his opinions to contemporary theory and practice concerning the unconditional {{sentence of}} imprisonment and provide some impulses to an appropriate change in his thesis. The basic motto of the introduced discourse was the statement that the prime sign of the imposed sentence is the loss (evil) caused to the criminal. Author wanted to prove the ineffectiveness of the imposed sentences in the cases when the subsequent execution of the punishments will not be for the criminal appreciable enough, whereas the factual appreciability of the punishment is only ad hoc to be stated regarding to {{the situation of the}} particular offender. Generally <b>extended</b> <b>statement</b> was disproved, that the unconditional sentence of imprisonment was always the strictest form of punishment, by the chosen cases from the court room and also from the prison practice. In thesis author tried to emphasize the importance of all basic purposes of the punishment, until now modified in § 23 of the Criminal code (1961) which cannot be left out at considerations either about imposing sentence or after the coming into force of the new Criminal code (2009). In spirit of the mixed theory of punishment he expressed [...] ...|$|R

First, instead of considering meromorphic functions on C we consider holomorphic maps on an affine curve over the field C or C_p. This <b>extends</b> a <b>statement</b> of D.

40|$|We {{prove that}} all {{stationary}} and spherical symmetric black hole solutions to theories with symmetric target spaces are integrable and we provide an explicit integration method. This exact integration {{is based on}} the description of black hole solutions as geodesic curves on the moduli space of the theory when reduced over the time-like direction. These geodesic equations of motion can be rewritten as a specific Lax pair equation for which mathematicians have provided the integration algorithms when the initial conditions are described by a diagonalizable Lax matrix. On the other hand, solutions described by nilpotent Lax matrices, which originate from extremal regular (small) D = 4 black holes can be obtained as suitable limits of solutions obtained in the diagonalizable case, as we show on the generating geodesic (i. e. most general geodesic modulo global symmetries of the D = 3 model) corresponding to regular (and small) D = 4 black holes. As a byproduct of our analysis we give the explicit form of the Wick rotation connecting the orbits of BPS and non-BPS solutions in maximally supersymmetric supergravity and its STU truncation.
