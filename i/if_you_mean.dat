But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> something to someone, if you help someone, or love someone. If even a single person remembers you then maybe you never really die at all." [...] This phrase is then repeated {{at the very end}} of the show to add emphasis to the finale.|$|E
60|$|DE LEVIS. [Taken aback] I don't know. I never thought. I didn't {{look under}} the bed, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that.|$|E
60|$|Ships do want humouring. They want humouring in handling; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{to handle}} them well, {{they must have been}} humoured in the {{distribution}} of the weight which you ask them to carry through the good and evil fortune of a passage. Your ship is a tender creature, whose idiosyncrasies must be attended to <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> her to come with credit to herself and you through the rough-and-tumble of her life.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who said? Come, come. A foreign boat, my friend, {{an early}} hour, a figure wrapped up for disguise! Who said? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>mean</b> to jilt me, why were <b>you</b> there? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>mean</b> to jilt me, {{why did you}} come back?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{say that}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>mean</b> something. What is it?-- what has happened?--what have I done?--what has changed you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said thoughtfully, [...] "the {{suggestion}} seems a good one; though it's rather hard on <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really <b>mean</b> to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Mariner," [...] said Mr. Pilkington icily, [...] "is a most charming, refined, cultured, and vivacious girl, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Budd. You {{must learn}} to say, `my Aunt Budd,' Mr. Henry Mulford, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{to live in peace}} with her unworthy niece." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} {{seemed to be getting}} on well with the swells, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> the Merrifields, {{especially}} Wilfred, if that is his name." ...|$|E
60|$|BILL. Mother's {{particularly}} generous, <b>if</b> that's what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> here I am," [...] he answered, [...] "it's unmistakeable. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> also <b>mean</b> {{that her}} believing in you is all I {{have to do}} with you're so far right as that she {{certainly}} does believe in you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{sleep for}} me! sleep <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can--I <b>mean</b> {{to sit up}} with a decanter!--let me see"--looking at the ormolu clock on the mantel--"it's only two hours to morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I've {{heard of}} him; {{his name is}} in my ledger--at least <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> Pierre Labonte, who came down last fall with the brigade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} very kind to me, and I like him very much. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that he'll propose for me I think you're mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} that two hundred acres of land {{will give you a}} good deal to do;--that is <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to make money by it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>mean</b> to take {{advantage}} of this lady's kind offer I may just as well take you home at once. I want to begin my day--I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] she said, {{drawing a}} little closer to him, [...] "that you must not {{hesitate}} any longer, <b>if</b> ever <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to strike that blow. You saw Peter Littleson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why don't you, then? It's {{lovely to}} see people so happy. Now's {{a good time to}} do it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>mean</b> to. She will be going away for ever soon.' ...|$|R
60|$|LARRY. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{that you}} will be a {{treasure}} to him, he thinks so now; and you can keep him thinking so if you like.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is to say,' she explained, 'they {{have told}} me they mean to portion me as their adopted child, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that. But don't mention it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not {{say that}} from your heart, Mary. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to refuse me again, it is not because you doubt the reality of my love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really <b>mean</b> it, couldn't <b>you</b> {{use these}} books, Uncle Ben?" [...] said the master cheerfully. [...] "I dare say there's little difference--the {{principle}} is the same, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are both}} of us young as yet, Fred, and need not think of that. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do <b>mean</b> to marry Miss O'Hara you should lose not a day;--not a day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe I like that, either," [...] he replied. [...] "You are now too flippant. However, I'll {{hold you}} to the word. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>mean</b> it now <b>you</b> will by-and-by." ...|$|R
60|$|GUY. I quite {{understand}} that, sir. But, {{as a man}} of the world, I hope you'll take a pull before she comes, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to stay.|$|E
60|$|JOHN. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{how long}} has that lady been {{the apple of my}} eye, I'm not sure; but I never told her of it until today.|$|E
6000|$|... "Therefore {{you will}} own that I am right in {{asking you to}} sit down. The story may be very long,--that is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to tell it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall work down to Ipswich the day arter to-morrow, Sir,' said Mr. Weller the elder, 'from the Bull in Whitechapel; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really <b>mean</b> to go, you'd {{better go}} with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Lister {{gazed at}} him almost incredulously. [...] "Of course, I'll have to go <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really <b>mean</b> it. Still, I {{would like to point}} out that in some respects you're not exactly a model yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really <b>mean</b> it," [...] said Miss Sally bitterly. [...] "Oh, I {{dare say}} {{you think you}} do. But do you? Perhaps you do. Perhaps you are the {{exception}} that proves the rule." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nick {{looked up}} at him a moment. [...] "You've hit it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by that that I haven't {{resigned}} my seat and that I don't intend to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not particularly. He is {{a friend}} of a cousin of mine; and the women know him at home. He isn't a pal of mine <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am too old? I'm not a cripple, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that. I don't see why I shouldn't {{go to the}} diamond-fields as well as {{a younger}} man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How lovely of <b>you,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>mean</b> it," [...] she sighed. [...] "If {{girls could}} {{have more of}} those things said to them, they would be better, don't you think? Or at least feel better." ...|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS [impatiently] But {{she knew}} all about that. We didn't make speeches to her, <b>if</b> that's what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Marston {{got up and}} {{his face}} was red. [...] "Looks as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>mean</b> to let me help much. It's {{senseless}} exaggeration; things aren't as bad as you make out. However, I've had enough. I'll get angry if I stay." ...|$|R
