5000|$|The first German man-portable {{flamethrower}} {{was called}} the Kleinflammenwerfer (small flamethrower) or [...] "Kleif". Fuel was stored in a large vertical, cylindrical backpack container. High-pressure propellant was stored in another, smaller container attached to the fuel tank. A long hose connected the fuel tank to a lance tube with an <b>igniting</b> <b>device</b> at the nozzle. The propellant forced the fuel through the hose {{and out of the}} nozzle at high speed when a valve was opened. The <b>igniting</b> <b>device</b> at the nozzle set fire to the fuel as it sprayed out. The flamethrower was operated by two soldiers, one carrying the fuel and propellant tanks, another wielding the lance (though it was 70lbs it could be operated by one soldier). Wex, a replacement for the Kleif, was introduced in 1917 after the third battle of Ypres.|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} of mechanochemical activation of combustion and gasification of coals is of unquestionable {{scientific and technical}} interest; an increase in chemical activity of coals at their mechanically activated grinding is associated {{with an increase in}} the rate of reaction of the coal substance. To study the combustion and gasification process, the reactor model with tangential scroll input of coal-air suspension and cylindrical reaction chamber was used at the 5 -MW thermal power plant. The experiments were carried out with coals of G and SS grades of the Kuznetsk deposit. Coal, ground after the boiler’s standard mill, is fed by a feeder to the disintegrator; then, it enters the scroll inlet of the reactor burner with transport air. The suspension is ignited by a gas <b>igniting</b> <b>device</b> with the power of 50 kW. In experiments on combustion and gasification of fine coal performed at the temperature in the reaction chamber of 1000 - 1300 °C and air excess α = 0. 5 - 0. 7, the data on concentrations of CO and H 2 were obtained: for coal of grade G, concentration of H 2 was 6. 3 % and concentration of CO was 15. 3 %; for coal of SS grade, concentration of H 2 was 9. 5 % and concentration of CO was 15. 6 %...|$|E

50|$|The English word '{{flamethrower}}' is a loan-translation of , {{since the}} modern flamethrower was first invented in Germany. The first flamethrower, {{in the modern}} sense, is usually credited to Richard Fiedler. He submitted evaluation models of his Flammenwerfer to the German Army in 1901. The most significant model submitted was a man-portable device, consisting of a vertical single cylinder 4 ft long, horizontally divided in two, with pressurized gas in the lower section and flammable oil in the upper section. On depressing a lever the propellant gas forced the flammable oil into and through a rubber tube and over a simple <b>igniting</b> wick <b>device</b> in a steel nozzle. The weapon projected a jet of fire and enormous clouds of smoke some 20 yd. It was a single-shot weapon—for burst firing, a new igniter section was attached each time.|$|R

50|$|Richard Fiedler was a German {{scientist}} {{who invented the}} modern flamethrower. This is a weapon that projects a stream of ignited liquid, usually oil. He submitted evaluation models of his Flammenwerfer to the German Army in 1901. The most significant model submitted was a man-portable device, consisting of a vertical single cylinder 4 feet (1.2 m) long, horizontally divided in two, with pressurized gas in the lower section and flammable oil in the upper section. On depressing a lever the propellant gas forced the flammable oil into and through a rubber tube and over a simple <b>igniting</b> wick <b>device</b> in a steel nozzle. The weapon projected a jet of fire and enormous clouds of smoke some 20 yards (18 m). It was a single-shot weapon - for burst firing, a new igniter section was attached each time it was used for battle or other uses of any sorts. It was first used in the western front.|$|R
5000|$|Witnesses {{have said}} either a flare or {{fireworks}} lit by band members {{may have started}} the fire.

The flare then ignited flammable acoustic foam in the ceiling. [...] According to the authorities, other reasons for the high death toll include the lack of emergency exits (the only access {{in and out of}} the building was the front door) and the fact that the number of people inside exceeded the maximum capacity by hundreds.|$|R

The illumination was instantaneous and gorgeous. Henry, the two sail-makers, and the steward--at least three of them awakened from sound sleep, I am sure--ran to join us along the break of the poop. All the advantage lay with us, for we were in the dark, while our foes were outlined against the light behind them.|$|R

Prior to plasma characterisation on human body, simple materials such as aluminium (flat and spike), buffer solution (PBS) and glass are used as grounded electrodes for plasma characterisation. A single-filamentary discharge with spike, a stochastic-filamentary discharge with aluminium and PBS, and a homogeneous discharge with glass are observed. 2 minute DBD treatment of mouse skin shows no inflammation or any carcinogenic effects...|$|R
40|$|Electric matches {{are used}} in {{pyrotechnics}} to initiate devices electrically rather than by burning fuses. Fuses have the disadvantage of burning with a long delay before <b>igniting</b> a pyrotechnic <b>device,</b> while electric matches can instantaneously fire a device at a user's command. In addition, electric matches can be fired remotely at a safe distance. Unfortunately, most current commercial electric match compositions contain lead as thiocyanate, nitroresorcinate or tetroxide, which when burned, produces lead-containing smoke. This lead pollutant presents environmental exposure problems to cast, crew, and audience. The reason that these lead containing compounds are used as electric match compositions is that these mixtures have the required thermal stability, yet are simultaneously able to be initiated reliably by a very small thermal stimulus. A possible alternative to lead-containing compounds is nanoscale thermite materials (metastable intermolecular composites or MIC). These superthermite materials can be formulated to be extremely spark sensitive with tunable reaction rate and yield high temperature products. We have formulated and manufactured lead-free electric matches based on nanoscale Al/MoO{sub 3 } mixtures. We have determined that these matches fire reliably and to consistently ignite a sample of black powder. Initial safety, ageing and performance results are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{innovation}} {{consists of}} a pyrotechnic initiator and piezoelectric initiation system. The device will be capable of being initiated mechanically; resisting initiation by EMF, RF, and EMI (electromagnetic field, radio frequency, and electromagnetic interference, respectively); and initiating in water environments and space environments. Current devices of this nature are initiated by the mechanical action of a firing pin against a primer. Primers historically are prone to failure. These failures {{are commonly known as}} misfires or hang-fires. In many cases, the primer shows the dent where the firing pin struck the primer, but the primer failed to fire. In devices such as "T" handles, which are commonly used to initiate the blowout of canopies, loss of function of the device may result in loss of crew. In devices such as flares or smoke generators, failure can result in failure to spot a downed pilot. The piezoelectrically initiated ignition system {{consists of a}} pyrotechnic device that plugs into a mechanical system (activator), which on activation, generates a high-voltage spark. The activator, when released, will strike a stack of electrically linked piezo crystals, generating a high-voltage, low-amperage current that is then conducted to the pyro-initiator. Within the initiator, an electrode releases a spark that passes through a pyrotechnic first-fire mixture, causing it to combust. The combustion of the first-fire initiates a primary pyrotechnic or explosive powder. If used in a "T" handle, the primary would ramp the speed of burn up to the speed of sound, generating a shock wave that would cause a high explosive to go "high order. " In a flare or smoke generator, the secondary would produce the heat necessary to ignite the pyrotechnic mixture. The piezo activator subsystem is redundant in that a second stack of crystals would be struck at the same time with the same activation force, doubling the probability of a first strike spark generation. If the first activation fails to <b>ignite,</b> the <b>device</b> is capable of multiple attempts. Another unique aspect is {{in the design of the}} pyrotechnic device. There is an electrode that aids the generation of a directed spark and the use of a conductive matrix to support the first-fire material so that the spark will penetrate to the second electrode...|$|R
5000|$|A {{few days}} later, Di Mambro and twelve {{followers}} performed a ritual Last Supper.

It is believed that the plastic bags were a symbol of the ecological disaster that would befall the human race after the OTS members moved on to Sirius. It is also believed that these bags were used as part of the OTS rituals, and that members would have voluntarily worn them without being placed under duress. There was also evidence that many of the victims in Switzerland were drugged before they were shot. Other victims were found in three ski chalets; several dead children were lying together.

40|$|Many {{energetic}} {{systems can}} be activated via mechanical means. Percussion primers in small caliber ammunition and stab detonators used in medium caliber ammunition are just two examples. Current medium caliber (20 - 60 mm) munitions are detonated {{through the use of}} impact sensitive stab detonators. Stab detonators are very sensitive and must be small, as to meet weight and size limitations. A mix of energetic powders, sensitive to mechanical stimulus, is typically used to <b>ignite</b> such <b>devices.</b> Stab detonators are mechanically activated by forcing a firing pin through the closure disc of the device and into the stab initiating mix. Rapid heating caused by mechanically driven compression and friction of the mixture results in its ignition. The rapid decomposition of these materials generates a pressure/temperature pulse that is sufficient to initiate a transfer charge, which has enough output energy to detonate the main charge. This general type of ignition mix is used in a large variety of primers, igniters, and detonators. [1] Common primer mixes, such as NOL- 130, are made up of lead styphnate (basic) 40 %, lead azide (dextrinated) 20 %, barium nitrate 20 %, antimony sulfide 15 %, and tetrazene 5 %. [1] These materials pose acute and chronic toxicity hazards during mixing of the composition and later in the item life cycle after the item has been field functioned. There is an established need to replace these mixes on toxicity, health, and environmental hazard grounds. This effort attempts to demonstrate that environmentally acceptable energetic solgel coated flash metal multilayer nanocomposites can be used to replace current impact initiated devices (IIDs), which have hazardous and toxic components. Successful completion of this project will result in IIDs that include innocuous compounds, have sufficient output energy for initiation, meet current military specifications, are small, cost competitive, and perform as well as or better than current devices. We expect flash metal multilayer and sol-gel to be generic technologies applicable {{to a wide range of}} devices, especially in small caliber ammunition and sub-munitions. We will replace the NOL- 130 mixture with a nanocomposite that consists of a mechanically robust energetic multilayer foil that has been coated with a sol-gel energetic material. The exothermic reactions are activated in this nanocomposite are the transformation of the multilayer material to its respective intermetallic alloy and the thermite reaction, which is characterized by very high temperatures, a small pressure pulse, and hot particle ejection. The proposed materials and their reaction products consist of, but are not limited to aluminum, nickel, iron, aluminum oxide, titanium, iron oxide and boron. These materials have much more desirable environmental and health characteristics than the NOL- 130 composition...|$|R

Para a produção dos dispositivos foi utilizado um sistema de alto vácuo composto por duas diferentes câmaras de deposição: #câmara de orgânicos# e #câmara de metais#, sendo que elas estão interligadas e os dispositivos passam de uma para outra sem contato com o ar. Possui também duas glove boxes de ambiente controlado. A síntese dos compostos orgânicos, bem como alguns estudos adicionais puderam ser {{realizadas}} através da colaboração com o grupo do Prof. Hugo Gallardo do Departamento de Química da UFSC. Os compostos orgânicos estudados foram classificados em dois grupos: o primeiro grupo estudado foi ([1, 2, 5]tiadiazol[3, 4 - f][1, 10]fenantrolina) Tb (acetilaacetona-ACAC) 3 ou (TDPHEN) Tb (ACAC) 3. Os OLEDs baseados neste complexo apresentaram uma intensa fotoluminescência com alta pureza de cor das finas transições características do íon Tb, na região do verde. No entanto, observou-se na eletroluminescência a emissão da cor laranja, sendo este resultado uma combinação de duas bandas largas. Este efeito se deve a eletrofosforescência do(s) ligante(s) e às transferências de energias ineficientes nos dispositivos. Através de dispositivos em que o complexo de Tb atuou como dopante em uma matriz na camada ativa pode-se melhorar este mecanismo de transferência de energia, resultando no aparecimento das bandas de emissões características do íon de Tb 3 +; o segundo grupo estudado foi ([1, 2, 5]tiadiazol[3, 4 f][1, 10]fenantrolina) Eu (tenoiltrifluoracetona-TTA) 3 ou (TDPHEN) Eu (TTA) 3, onde os ligantes desempenham o papel de agentes absorvedores e transmissores de energia para o íon central Eu 3 +. Os OLEDs baseados neste complexo apresentaram uma notável fotoluminescência e eletroluminescência com linhas de transições características do íon Eu 3 +, na região do vermelho. Enfim, através de caracterizações elétricas foi possível perceber a baixa voltagem necessária para acender os dispositivos, tornando-os fortes candidatos a dispositivos de baixo consumo de energia. In {{this work}} we {{present the results}} of a study that involves the manufacture and the characterization of organic electroluminescent devices (OLEDs) based on â-diketonates Rare-Earth complexes. For the production of the devices we used a high-vacuum system composed of two different deposition chambers: #organic chamber" and " metal chamber. " Since they are interconnected, the devices could be moved from the first to the other without contact with air. It also has two glove boxes with controlled environment. The synthesis of organic compounds, as well as some additional studies could be conducted through the collaboration with the group of Prof. Hugo Gallardo, Department of Chemistry, UFSC. The compounds studied were classified into two groups: the first study group ([1, 2, 5] thiadiazole [3, 4 -f] [1, 10] phenanthroline) Tb (acetyl-laacetona ACAC) 3 or (TDPHEN) Tb (ACAC) 3. OLEDs based on this complex showed an intense photoluminescence with high color purity of the fine haracteristics of the ion transitions of Tb, in the green region. However, the electroluminescence showed orange emission, and this result is a combination of two broad bands. This effect is due to electrophosphorescence (s) of the ligand (s) and inefficient transfer of energy in the devices. Through devices in which the Tb complex acted as dopant in a matrix on the active layer, we could improve this mechanism of energy transfer, resulting in the appearance of the emission bands characteristic of theTb 3 + ion; the second studied group was ([1, 2, 5] thiadiazole [3, 4 f] [1, 10] phenanthroline) Eu (Thenoyltrifluoroacetone-TTA) 3 or (TDPHEN) Eu (TTA) 3, where the ligands act as absorber agents and transmitters of energy to the ion central Eu 3 +. The OLEDs based on this complex presented intense photo- and electroluminescence with high pure color emission due to the almost atomic transitions characteristic of the Eu 3 + ion, in red. Finally, through electrical characterizations it was possible to realize the low voltage needed to <b>ignite</b> the <b>devices,</b> making them strong candidates for devices of low power consumption...|$|R

Angered that his dad is trying to take his uncle's place, he roots through the files, where he discovers an unnerving number of suspected arsons, all in the general area that station 55 is responsible for. Upset that Shane felt he was being neglected, Connor makes an effort to reconcile with his son, and is shocked when Shane reveals that he feels like a bad person for being relieved when he discovered it was his uncle who died instead of his father. The next day, at a firefighter's gala, Dewey is awarded a medal for his bravery, but the moment is ruined when Dewey spots Trey in the audience, and abandons Shane for his former owner. Although Shane is heartbroken, Connor reluctantly allows an ecstatic Trey to keep the dog. A few hours later, however, Dewey escapes Trey's hotel room to chase after Engine 55, which was recently called out to another fire. The team is {{only too happy to}} allow him to climb on board. Meanwhile, Shane returns to the station to discover that the fire Engine 55 was called out to was simply a decoy, so that the suspected arsonist could burn the [...] "Dogpatch" [...] station to the ground. Panicking, he calls Jessie Presley's daughter, Jasmine 'JJ' Presley to work out what to do, then becoming alerted of footsteps upstairs, which {{turn out to be the}} arsonist. Ignoring JJ's warnings, he heads upstairs to confront the arsonist. To his horror, he realizes that the arsonist is in fact city manager Zach Hayden, who wanted to burn buildings in order to build a football stadium for Corbin Sellars (Matt Cooke), killing Shane's uncle in the process. After Engine 55's closure was denied, he had no choice but to burn the station down himself, but didn't realize that Shane was still in the building. As the two become trapped inside the burning building when Zachary's incendiary <b>device</b> <b>ignites</b> a gas line, Zachary quickly gives up his search for Shane, who is unconscious, and then leaves. [...] Meanwhile, Dewey, sensing that Shane is in danger, races back to the station as Connor follows behind, having been alerted to the fire by Jessie, who was also at the harbor fire and called by her daughter JJ. Dewey finds Zachary trying to escape, and traps him in a phone booth (which he also escapes from) before finding Shane. Connor arrives on the scene, only to find the station completely inaccessible. Hearing Dewey's barking, he eventually manages to break down the garage door and finds Shane terrified on the other side of a locked door inside the burning station. Shane manages to convince him to pass him his axe through some broken glass so he can try to break the hinges himself, despite the risks of letting the fire get fresh oxygen and flashover; Dewey then leads them out. Shane manages to tell Connor about Zachary's arson attacks before he is sent to the hospital. Furious, Connor confronts Zachary for endangering his family, and Pep gets her own payback on him before the other Dogpatch firefighters hand Zachary over to the police to be arrested.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The {{conventional}} wisdom is that {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001, prompted a substantive change in U. S. immigration policy on visa issuances and the grounds for excluding foreign nationals from the United States. A series of laws enacted in the 1990 s, however, may have done as much or more to set current U. S. visa policy and the legal grounds for exclusion. This report’s review of the legislative developments in visa policy over the past 20 years and analysis of the statistical trends in visa issuances and denials provide a nuanced study of U. S. visa policy and the grounds for exclusion. Foreign nationals not already legally residing in the United States who wish to come to the United States generally must obtain a visa to be admitted. Those admitted on a permanent basis are known as immigrants or legal permanent residents (LPRs), while those admitted on a temporary basis are known as nonimmigrants (such as tourists, foreign students, diplomats, temporary agricultural workers, and exchange visitors). They must first meet a set of criteria specified in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that determine whether they are eligible for admission. The burden of proof is on the foreign national to establish eligibility for a visa. Conversely, foreign nationals also must not be deemed inadmissible according to other specified grounds in § 212 (a) of the INA. These § 212 (a) inadmissibility criteria are health-related grounds; criminal history; security and terrorist concerns; public charge (e. g., indigence); seeking to work without proper labor certification; illegal entrants and immigration law violations; ineligible for citizenship; and aliens illegally present or previously removed. The number of aliens excluded on the basis of § 212 (a) of the INA has fluctuated over the years. In FY 2008, § 212 (a) exclusions of prospective nonimmigrants hit 35, 403 and surpassed the prior high point of 34, 750 in FY 1998. For prospective LPRs, § 212 (a) exclusions peaked in FY 1998 and FY 1999, reaching over 89, 000 in both years. The § 212 (a) exclusions of prospective LPRs fell from FY 2000 through FY 2003, then began climbing to reach 77, 080 in FY 2008. Most LPR petitioners who were excluded on § 212 (a) grounds from FY 1994 through FY 2004 were rejected because the Department of State (DOS) determined that the aliens were inadmissible as likely public charges. By FY 2004, the proportion of public charge exclusions had fallen but remained the top basis for denial. The lack of proper labor certification was another leading ground for exclusion from FY 1994 through FY 2004. By FY 2008, however, illegal presence and previous orders of removal from the United States was the leading ground. Exclusions of nonimmigrant petitions have a somewhat different pattern than that of immigrant petitions. Violations of immigration law were the leading category from FY 1994 through FY 2006, but fell to the second ranking by FY 2008. Illegal presence and prior removal became the leading ground in FY 2008. Over time, criminal activity has become a more common ground for refusal, and has represented a larger portion of exclusions among nonimmigrant petitioners than it was for immigrant petitioners. Legislation aimed at comprehensive immigration reform may take a fresh look at the grounds for excluding foreign nationals enacted over the past two decades. Expanding the grounds for inadmissibility, conversely, might be part of the legislative agenda among those who support more restrictive immigration reform policies. More specifically, the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who allegedly attempted to <b>ignite</b> an explosive <b>device</b> on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, has heightened scrutiny of the visa process and grounds for exclusion.
