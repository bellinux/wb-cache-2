25|$|The olefin feed to an {{alkylation}} unit generally originates from a FCCU {{and contains}} butene, <b>isobutene,</b> and possibly propene and/or amylenes. The olefin feed {{is also likely}} to contain diluents (such as propane, n-butane, and n-pentane), noncondensables (such as ethane and hydrogen) and contaminants. Diluants in principle have no effect on the reaction of alkylation but occupy a portion of the reactor and can influence the yield of secondary reactions of polymerisation and of undesired organofluorine side products. Incondensable are from a chemical perspective similar to diluents but they do not condense at the pressure and temperature of the process, and therefore they concentrate to a point that must be vented. Contaminants are compounds that react with and/or dilute the sulfuric acid catalyst.

50|$|The two isomers are {{extremely}} difficult to separate by distillation because of the proximity of their boiling points (~4 °C for cis and ~1 °C for trans). However, separation is unnecessary in most industrial settings, as both isomers behave similarly {{in most of the}} desired reactions. A typical industrial 2-butene mixture is 70% (Z)-2-butene (cis-isomer) and 30% (E)-2-butene (trans-isomer). Butane and 1-butene are common impurities, present at 1% or more in industrial mixtures, which also contain smaller amounts of <b>isobutene,</b> butadiene and butyne.|$|E

40|$|<b>Isobutene</b> is an {{important}} commercial chemical used for the synthesis of butyl rubber, terephthalic acid, specialty chemicals, and a gasoline performance additive known as alkylate. Currently, <b>isobutene</b> is produced from petroleum and hence is nonrenewable. Here, we report that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (ScMDD) can convert 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylbutyrate (3 -HMB) to <b>isobutene.</b> Whole cells of Escherichia coli producing ScMDD with an N-terminal 6 ×His tag (His 6 -ScMDD) formed <b>isobutene</b> from 3 -HMB {{at a rate of}} 154 pmol h− 1 g cells− 1. In contrast, no <b>isobutene</b> was detected from control cells lacking ScMDD. His 6 -ScMDD was purified by nickel affinity chromatography and shown to produce <b>isobutene</b> from 3 -HMB at a rate of 1. 33 pmol min− 1 mg− 1 protein. Controls showed that both His 6 -ScMDD and 3 -HMB were required for detectable <b>isobutene</b> formation. <b>Isobutene</b> was identified by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection as well as by GC-mass spectrometry (MS). ScMDD was subjected to error-prone PCR, and two improved variants were characterized, ScMDD 1 (I 145 F) and ScMDD 2 (R 74 H). Whole cells of E. coli producing ScMDD 1 and ScMDD 2 produced <b>isobutene</b> from 3 -HMB at rates of 3, 000 and 5, 888 pmol h− 1 g cells− 1, which are 19 - and 38 -fold increases compared to rates for cells producing His 6 -ScMDD. This showed that genetic modifications can be used to increase the rate at which ScMDD converts 3 -HMB to <b>isobutene.</b> Because 3 -HMB can be produced from l-leucine, ScMDD has a potential application for the production of renewable <b>isobutene.</b> Moreover, <b>isobutene</b> is a gas, which might simplify its purification from a fermentation medium, substantially reducing production costs...|$|E
