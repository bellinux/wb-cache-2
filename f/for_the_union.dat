5|$|After {{resting on}} their arms through the night, the 21st awoke to light {{fighting}} in their front. Over {{the course of}} the morning, Union forces gradually shifted to the left, including the 21st, and it became apparent that the Union right flank had collapsed. Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing the Union left flank with a massive and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover the Union retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying critical time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> army. Finally, under the cover of darkness, the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run. During this defeat <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.|$|E

5|$|As Union forces {{advanced}} south, {{the infrastructure}} {{near the town}} of Marionlocated in Southwest Virginia on the Middle Fork of the Holston River, between Saltville and Wythevillebecame a major objective of Union forces.

In November 1864, George Stonemandeputy commander of the Department of the Ohio and in charge of all Union cavalry units in eastern Tennesseeproposed an expedition into southwest Virginia to disrupt the production of supplies and facilities beneficial to the Confederacy.

5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis, {{the state}} capital of Indiana, was a major base of support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union.</b> Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major {{supporter}} of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a gathering place to organize and train troops <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> army. The city became a major railroad hub for troop transport to Confederate lands, and therefore had military importance. Twenty-four military camps were established {{in the vicinity of}} Indianapolis. Camp Morton, the initial mustering ground to organize and train the state's Union volunteers in 1861, was designated as a major prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers in 1862. In addition to military camps, a state-owned arsenal was established in the city in 1861, and a federal arsenal in 1862. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis to house and feed Union soldiers and their families as they passed through the city. Indianapolis residents also supported the Union cause by providing soldiers with food, clothing, equipment, and supplies, despite rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. Local doctors aided the sick, some area women provided nursing care, and Indianapolis City Hospital tended to wounded soldiers. Indianapolis sent an estimated 4,000 men into military service; an estimated 700 died during the war. Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was established as one of two national military cemeteries established in Indiana in 1866.|$|E

He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union,</b> though Lee's army avoided capture.
