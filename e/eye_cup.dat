50|$|Swedish goggles are {{notable for}} a lack of a gasket or seal around the <b>eye</b> <b>cup,</b> as found on most other goggles.

50|$|The small ring {{near the}} {{eyepiece}} also usually needs two hands to operate {{and in some}} designs can interfere with the twist-up <b>eye</b> <b>cup.</b> Being small, {{it can also be}} less convenient to operate, especially wearing gloves. The degree of twist from closest focus to infinity varies between manufacturers. Some use a very small twist (about a quarter of a turn) whereas others use a full turn or more. The small degree of twist gives a very fast focus but can be overly sensitive and in some designs too stiff to use single handed. A full turn is a practical compromise.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} vases {{are mostly}} Attic, from the 5th and 6th centuries, {{and follow the}} Beazley naming convention. Many shapes derive from metal vessels, especially in silver, which survive in far smaller numbers. Some pottery vases were probably intended as cheaper substitutes for these, either for use or to be placed as grave goods. Some terms, especially among the types of kylix or drinking cup, combine a shape and a type or location of decoration, as in the band cup, <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> and others. Some terms are defined by function as much as shape, such as the aryballos, which later potters turned into all sorts of fancy novelty shapes.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{popularity}} of Swedish goggles is due to their customizable fit. The goggles are sold unassembled, with each goggle set including a pair of <b>eye</b> <b>cups,</b> one long (around 36") latex rubber strip, and a nose piece consisting of string that fits inside a plastic or rubber tube. Swimmers may choose a single or double head strap, and some choose to cut {{a small piece of}} latex from the head strap for use as a nose piece.Malmsten's official assembly instructions can be found here.|$|R
50|$|Preserved {{specimens}} {{are up to}} 14 mm {{in length}} and 2 mm in width. They have a constant light yellow-brown dorsal color with a variable density of dark specks. That makes the dorsal pigmentation ranges from dark brown to light yellow-brown. The color lightens at the body margins and over the pharyngeal region. The ventral surface is paler. The number of pigment granules observed in the histological sections are variable among individuals. They have two <b>eye</b> <b>cups</b> where head narrows. The pharynx is located posteriorly in the body. The mouth opening is at the posterior end of the pharyngeal pocket.|$|R
50|$|Platynereis dumerilii nectochate larvae {{can switch}} between {{positive}} and negative phototaxis. Phototaxis there is mediated by two pairs of more complex pigment <b>cup</b> <b>eyes.</b> These eyes contain more photoreceptor cells that are shaded by pigment cells forming a cup. The photoreceptor cells do not synapse directly onto ciliated cells or muscle cells but onto inter-neurons of a processing center. This way the information of all four <b>eye</b> <b>cups</b> can be compared and a low resolution image of four pixels can be created telling the larvae where the light is coming from. This way the larva {{does not need to}} scan its environment by rotating. This is an adaption for living {{on the bottom of the}} sea the life style of the nectochaete larva while scanning rotation is more suited for living in the open water column, the life style of the trochophore larva. Phototaxis in the Platynereis dumerilii nectochate larva has a broad spectral range which is at least covered by three opsins that are expressed by the cup eyes: Two rhabdomeric opsins and a Go-opsin.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the regeneration of visual pigment, {{the changes in}} composition and quantity of retinoids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Eye cups or <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> sections of dark-adapted frogs were exposed to light (> 500 nm) and incubated {{in the dark for}} several hours (pH 7 - 4, 27 ± 1 °C). Retinoids extracted by the oxime method before and after illumination were analysed by HPLC. In the dark, every <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> or <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> section contained 1 l-cis and all-trans isomers of retinyl palmitate (the proportion of ll-cis was nearly 40 %). The amount of retinyl palmitate was 1 — 1 - 5 molequiv of visual pigment. After 80 % of the visual pigment had been bleached by illumination, eye cups or <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> sections were incubated in the dark for 10 h. During the incubation, 70 % of the bleached pigment was regenerated, and the proportion of ll-cis retinyl ester decreased from 40 % to 13 %. These results indicate that stored ll-cis retinyl ester is used for the regeneration. The regeneration rate of A 2 -pigment (half time = 75 min) was faster than that of Arpigment (half time = 90 min), consistent with the result of Tsin & Flores ' (1986) in vivo experiment with goldfish...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{keratitis}} was induced in rabbits {{to study}} the effects of corneal infection on the delivery of tobramycin by iontophoresis. Some rabbits were treated by use of an <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> with no current as a control for iontophoresis, and others were treated with fortified drops (1. 36 %) delivered topically for comparison with results of earlier studies. One hour after treatment with tobramycin, the concentration of drug in the infected corneas was compared with that achieved in mock-infected and uninfected eyes. Iontophoresis of 25 mg of tobramycin per ml at 0. 8 mA for 10 min delivered significantly more drug (P = 0. 0001) to corneal tissue than did drops or use of an <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> without current in P. aeruginosa-infected eyes mock-infected eyes, or uninfected eyes. Tobramycin concentrations in the infected corneas (605. 9 micrograms/g) were not significantly different (P = 0. 815) from the concentrations in mock-infected eyes (641. 4 micrograms/g), but were lower (P = 0. 007) than those obtained by iontophoresis in uninfected corneas (853. 6 micrograms/g). Use of an <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> without current delivered tobramycin equally to infected, mock-infected, and normal eyes, i. e., 176. 5, 171. 0, and 163. 1 micrograms/g, respectively (P greater than 0. 709). Tobramycin delivered by use of fortified drops delivered topically was detectable in mock-infected corneas (20 micrograms/g) and P. aeruginosa-infected corneas (6. 0 micrograms/g). These results suggest that iontophoresis has value as an ocular drug delivery system and that an <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> could also be useful in a therapeutic regimen for ocular infections...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} use of Confocal Laser Tomographic images for {{detecting}} glaucoma. From the clinical aspect, the optic nerve head's (ONH) area contains all the relevant information on glaucoma. The shape of ONH is approximately a skewed cup. We summarize its shape by three biological landmarks on the neural-rim and the fourth landmark as {{the point of the}} maximum depth, which is approximately the point where the optic nerve enters this <b>eye</b> <b>cup.</b> These four landmarks are extracted from the images related to some Rhesus monkeys before and after inducing glaucoma. Previous analysis on Bookstein shape coordinates of these four landmarks revealed only marginally significant findings. From clinical experience, it is believed that the ratio depth to diameter of the <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> provides a useful measure of the shape change. We consider the bootstrap distribution of this normalized 'depth' (G) and give evidence that it provides an appropriate measure of the shape change. This measure G is labelled as the glaucoma index.

25|$|Particularly cup {{painters}} like Oltos, Epiktetos, Pheidippos and Skythes painted vases in both red- and black-figure styles (Bilingual Pottery), primarily <b>eye</b> <b>cups.</b> The {{interior was}} {{usually in the}} black-figure style, the exterior in the red-figure style. There are several cases of amphoras whose front and back sides are decorated in the two different styles.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the morphogenesis of the zebrafish eye, from the flat optic vesicle at 16 hours post fertilization (hpf) to the functional hemispheric eye at 72 hpf. We have produced three-dimensional reconstructions from semithin sections, measured volumes and areas, and produced a fate map by labeling clusters of cells at 14 – 15 hpf and finding them in the 24 hpf <b>eye</b> <b>cup.</b> Both volume and area increased sevenfold, with different schedules. Initially (16 – 33 hpf), area increased but volume remained constant; later (33 – 72 hpf) both increased. When the volume remained constant, the presumptive pigmented epithelium (PE) shrank and the presumptive neural retina (NR) enlarged. The fate map revealed that during 14 – 24 hpf cells changed layers, moving from the PE into the NR, probably through involution around {{the margin of the}} eye. The transformation of the flat epithelial layers of the vesicle into their cup-shaped counterparts in the eye was also accompanied by cellular rearrangements; most cells in a cluster labeled in the vesicle remained neighbors in the <b>eye</b> <b>cup,</b> but occasionally they were separated widely.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{describe}} light-microscopi-cally {{the development}} of the embryonic zebrafish eye with particular attention to cell number, cell proliferation, and cell death. The period from 16 to 36 hr post fertilization (hpf) comprises two phases; during the first (16 – 27 hpf) the optic ves-icle becomes the <b>eye</b> <b>cup,</b> and during the second (27 – 36 hpf) the <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> begins to differentiate into the neural retina and pigmented epithelium. All cells in the eye primordium are proliferative prior to 28 hpf, and the length of the cell cycle has been estimated to be 10 hr at 24 – 28 hpf (Nawrocki, 1985). Our cell counts are consistent with that estimate at that age, but not at earlier ages. A 10 -hr cell cycle predicts that the cell num-ber should increase by 7 % per hr, but during 16 – 24 hpf the cell number increased by only 1. 5 % per hr. Despite the low rate of increase, all cells labeled with bromo-deoxyuridine, so all were proliferative. We considered three possible ex-planations for the nearly-constant cell number in the first phase: proliferation balanced by cell em-igration from the eye, proliferation balanced by cell death, and low proliferation caused by a transient prolongation of the cell cycle. We ex-cluded the first two, and found direct support for the third. Previous examinations of the cell cycle length in vertebrate central nervous system have concluded that it increases monotonically, in contrast to the modulation that we have shown. Modulation of the cell cycle length is well-known in flies, but it is generally effected by a prolonged arrest at one phase, in contrast to the general deceleration that we have shown. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|Cubomedusae (box jellyfish) {{possess a}} {{remarkable}} visual system with 24 eyes distributed in four sensory structures termed rhopalia. Each rhopalium {{is equipped with}} six eyes: two pairs of pigment <b>cup</b> <b>eyes</b> and two unpaired lens eyes. Each eye type probably captures specific features of the visual environment. To investigate whether multiple types of photoreceptor cells {{are present in the}} rhopalium, and whether the different eye types possess different types of photoreceptors, we have used immunohistochemistry with a range of vertebrate opsin antibodies to label the photoreceptors, and electroretinograms (ERG) to determine their spectral sensitivity. All photoreceptor cells of the two lens eyes of the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora and Carybdea marsupialis displayed immunoreactivity for an antibody directed against the zebrafish ultraviolet (UV) opsin, but not against any of eight other rhodopsin or cone opsin antibodies tested. In neither of the two species were the pigment <b>cup</b> <b>eyes</b> immunoreactive for any of the opsin antibodies. ERG analysis of the Carybdea lower lens eyes demonstrated a single spectral sensitivity maximum at 485 nm suggesting the presence of a single opsin type.

40|$|EGFL 7 is a {{secreted}} angiogenic factor, {{which in}} contrast to the well-known secreted angiogenic molecules VEGF and FGF- 2, is almost exclusively expressed by endothelial cells and may act in an autocrine fashion. Prior studies have shown EGFL 7 to mediate its angiogenic effects by interfering with the Notch pathway and/or via the intronic miR 126. Less is known about its effects on VEGF signaling. We wanted to investigate the role of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL 7) in VEGF-driven angiogenesis using an ex vivo Matrigel-embedded mouse <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> assay and siRNA mediated knockdown of EGFL 7 by siRNA. Our results suggested that VEGF-induced vascular tube formation was significantly impaired after siRNA downregulation of EGFL 7.

40|$|We {{explore and}} review the taxonomic {{distribution}} of morphological features {{that may be}} used as supporting apomorphies for the monophyletic status of various taxa in future, more comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the dendrocoelid freshwater planarians and their close relatives. Characters examined are: (i) musculature of the pharynx; (ii) anatomy of the eye; (iii) distribution of testis follicles along the longitudinal axis of the body; (iv) epidermis of the body wall; (v) musculature of the ventral body wall; (vi) presence or absence of a penis papilla; (vii) position of the mouth opening; and (viii) anterior adhesive organ. A phylogenetic hypothesis, {{in the form of a}} character state tree, is developed. This hypothesis suggests that the Kenkiidae should be resurrected as a separate family, sharing a sistergroup relationship with the Dendrocoelidae. This sistergroup relationship is supported by the shared presence of an apomorphic anterior adhesive organ. Although the shape of the anterior adhesive organ, both within and between kenkiids and dendrocoelids, may differ considerably between species, they are all constructed according to the same principles. The monophyly of the Kenkiidae is supported by the presence of an apomorphic thickening of the marginal zone of the epidermis and presumably also by the presence of prepharyngeal testes. Within the Kenkiidae, the genus Macrocotyla should be considered as a junior synonym of Kenkia, which is characterized by the presence of an apomorphic ‘planariid pharynx-type 2 ’. The monophyly of the Dendrocoelidae is suggested by the presence of a dendrocoelid type of pharynx. It is shown that multicellular eye cups with numerous photoreceptor cells are not restricted to the Dugesiidae and the Terricola but are also characteristic for the Dendrocoelidae; the phylogenetic implications of this character state distribution are discussed. It is pointed out that in planarians there may be a relationship between: (i) body size, the size of an <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> and the number of its constituent pigment cells; and (ii) the size of an <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> and the number of photoreceptor cells that it contains. Some tentative phylogenetic groups are suggested on the basis of the following presumed apomorphic characters: presence of transverse fibres in the ventral subepidermal musculature, presence of an extra longitudinal muscle layer in the outer pharynx musculature, a mouth opening that has shifted anteriad. It is suggested that the presumed monophyly of the genus Bdellocephala is supported by the apomorphic absence of a penis papilla, combined with a penial lumen provided with many plicae...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we report}} the {{expression}} {{pattern of the}} homeobox Ol-Rx 3 gene, a medaka gene homologous to the mouse, Xenopus, zebrafish and Drosophila Rx genes. Ol-Rx 3 starts to be expressed, at late gastrula stages, in the presumptive territories of the anterior brain. Subsequently, transcripts are localised in an antero-ventral region of the prosencephalon and in the primordia of the optic vesicles. During organogenesis, distribution of Ol-Rx 3 transcripts are gradually restricted {{to the floor of}} the diencephalon, the prospective territory of the hypothalamus and the neurohypophysis. During late development and in adult, Ol-Rx 3 expression is maintained in hypothalamic nuclei bordering the third ventricle. In the optic vesicles, Ol-Rx 3 expression is temporarily switched off when the <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> morphogenesis is complete, but it is turned on again in the inner nuclear layer of the retina. Thus, the early expression pattern of Ol-Rx 3 is in agreement with a conserved role in the specification of the ventral forebrain and eye field.

25|$|But in the meantime, a few {{innovative}} craftsmen {{could still}} give new impulses {{to the production}} of black-figure vases. The most imaginative potter of the time, also a talented businessman, was Nikosthenes. Over 120 vases bear his signature, indicating that they were made by him or in his workshop. He seems to have particularly specialized in producing vases for export to Etruria. In his workshop the usual neck amphoras, Little Masters, Droop and <b>eye</b> <b>cups</b> were produced, but also a type of amphora reminiscent of Etruscan bucchero pottery, named the Nikosthenic amphora after its creator. These pieces were found particularly in Caere, the other vase types usually in Cerveteri and Vulci. The many inventions in his workshop were not limited to forms. In Nikosthenes’ workshop {{what is known as the}} Six’s technique was developed, in which figures were painted in reddish brown or white atop a black glossy slip. It is not clear whether Nikosthenes also painted vases, in which case he is usually presumed to be identical with Painter N. The BMN Painter and the red-figure Nikosthenes Painter are also named after Nikosthenes. In his workshop he employed many famous vase painters, including the elderly Lydos, Oltos and Epiktetos.

40|$|The pecten oculi of {{the black}} kite (Milvus migrans), a diurnally active bird of prey, has been {{examined}} by scanning electron microscopy.

Overlying and within the vascular network, a close association between blood vessels and melanocytes is evident. It is conjectured that such an association may have evolved to augment the structural reinforcement of this nutritive organ in order to keep it firmly erectile within the gel-like vitreous. Such erectility may be an essential prerequisite for its optimal functioning, as well as in its overt use as a protective shield against the effects of ultraviolet light, which otherwise might lead to damage of the pectineal vessels...|$|E
40|$|Summary Development of {{epithelial}} cell polarity {{is a highly}} dynamic process, and often established by the sequential recruitment of conserved protein complexes, such as the Par or the Crumbs (Crb) complex. However, detailed insights into the refinement of polarity {{and the formation of}} the complexes are still lacking. Here, we established fluorescently tagged Lin 7 c, a core member of the Crb complex, as an ideal tool to follow development of polarity in zebrafish epithelia. We find that in gastrula stages, RFP-Lin 7 c is found in the cytosol of the enveloping layer, while Pard 3 -GFP is already polarized at this stage. During development of the retinal epithelium, RFP-Lin 7 c localization is refined from being cytosolic at 14 hours post fertilization (hpf) to almost entirely apical in cells of the <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> at 28 hpf. This apical Lin 7 c localization depends on the Crb complex members Oko meduzy and Nagie oko.

In this study we have determined the Tau level in the IPM, separating it from other soluble amino compounds. Bovine eyes were obtained from local slaughterhouses and were bisected in darkness. After removal of the vitreos body, the <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> was washed with 0. 14 M NaCl- 5 mM sodium phosphates, pH 7. 4. Preparation of the IPM {{was carried out by}} detaching the retina from <b>eye</b> <b>cup</b> using the method of Pfeffer, 1983. PE were collected using the method of Feeney-Burns, 1982. Retinas deprived of IPM were homogenized using 0. 32 M sucrose- 50 mM phosphates, pH 7. 2. Free amino compounds in the various preparations were separated using the procedure described by Borum, 1985. Levels of Tau in bovine IPM; PE (homogenate and sonicated); retina (homogenate and sonicated) were (804. 10 ± 79. 22; 83. 91 ± 7. 90 and 85. 30 ± 8. 20; 5, 170. 50 ± 314. 82 and 5, 209. 00 ± 498. 00 nmoles/eye), respectively. The chromatographic profile of a. a. in the IPM was qualitatively more similar to that of retina than to that of PE. As expected, GABA was absent in the PE preparations. It was not surprising to find Tau and amino compounds in the IP space because of the transit role of this retinal area. We believe that three sites could be considered for the origin of Tau in the IPM. One is the PE, which takes up Tau from the blood and accumulates it avidly, to send it via the membrane apical process to photoreceptor cells. The other possible sources are Mùller cells and photoreceptor cells, which have the largest Tau pool. In conclusion, the great similarity between the amino acid profile in the IPM and in the retina suggests that a pool of amino compounds and Tau might be present in the subretinal space. Among the roles suggested for the IPM is that of a route by which nutrients and other small molecules reach the retinal photoreceptor from the apical process of the PE cells. 46 ° SIBIOC ROMA 13 - 15 Ottobre 201...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{extension}} of axons, critical neuronal interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) and other cells {{are thought to}} be mediated in part by heterodimeric β 1 integrin receptors. In this report, we examine the expression and function of β 1 integrins in the developing chick retina. Expression of the β 1 subunit, assayed byin situhybridization and antibody staining of dissociated cells, was widespread in undifferentiated neuroepithelial cells, before the initiation of axons. Expression persisted in most retinal cell layers throughout embryonic development, during and after axon extension. The repertoire of β 1 -associated α subunits was examined using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. In addition to the α 6 and α 8 subunits previously reported, chick homologues of the α 2 and α 4 subunits were detected. Developmental Northern blots revealed varying patterns of integrin subunit expression and showed that expression of β 1 and the mRNAs of its associated α subunits are not always coregulated during retinal development. The timing and distribution of expression suggested that β 1 integrins may be involved in other developmental events in addition to axon extension. To address functions carried out by β 1 integrins in the early retina, explanted <b>eye</b> <b>cups</b> were incubated in the presence of function blocking anti-β 1 antibody and migration of newly born retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was assessed. RGC migration from the ventricular zone to the vitreal border was significantly inhibited, suggesting that β 1 integrins play a role in neuroblast migration in the retina...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Although {{ischemia}} {{has previously}} been suggested {{to contribute to the}} pathogenesis of glaucoma, neovascularization is not implicated in glaucoma. Because vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is a key mediator in neovascularization response, we investigated the levels of the major pro-angiogenic (VEGF-A 164) and antiangiogenic VEGF-A subtypes (VEGF-A 165 b) in the retina during experimental glaucoma. Methods: Glaucoma was induced unilaterally in rats by injecting 1. 9 M hypertonic saline solution in the episcleral veins. The contralateral eye served as the control. The intraocular pressure (IOP) of each eye was measured via Tonopen in conscious rats. Eyes were enucleated either on the 5 th or the 10 th day of elevated IOP. Whole retinal lysates were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Levels of VEGF-A 164 and VEGF-A 165 b were analyzed by western blotting using specific antibodies. In a different group of rats, retinal ganglion cells were retrogradely labeled by injecting Fluorogold in the superior colliculus a week before the induction of glaucoma. After the eyes were enucleated on the fifth day of elevated IOP, posterior <b>eye</b> <b>cups</b> were sectioned using a cryostat. Levels and localization of VEGF-A 164 and VEGF-A 165 b were examined in retinal sections by immunohistochemistry. Results: VEGF-A 164 levels remained unchanged between the control and glaucomatous retinas after five days (p= 0. 341) and 10 days of elevated IOP (p= 0. 117). The presence of the anti-angiogenic VEGF-A isoform has not been previously reported in the rat. An antibody specific to VEGF-A 165 b detected the anti-angiogenic protein in the rat retina.
