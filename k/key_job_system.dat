40|$|This {{research}} paper investigated {{the role of}} the modern CIO in terms of their <b>key</b> <b>job</b> functions and critical capabilities and competencies which are required in order for the CIO to achieve superior organizational performance for the current and future business environment. Six CIO interviews conducted by the CIO Executive Council were analysed in terms of previous literature which had identified a number of <b>key</b> <b>job</b> functions and critical capabilities and competencies for {{the role of the}} modern CIO. The findings of this research lends support to five <b>key</b> <b>job</b> functions and eighteen critical competencies which we believe are essential for the role of the CIO in current and future business environment. The findings also indicate that the CIO role is becoming increasingly strategic in driving innovation and organizational transformation and change. Hence the modern CIO needs to be a visionary strategic leader with superb communication skills and business acumen and the ability to collaborate horizontally across the core business functions and with key business partners...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent superintendents in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming relied on (a) prior administrative experiences, (b) network of colleagues, (c) professional and governmental organizations, (d) academic preparation, and (e) research to effectively complete <b>key</b> <b>job</b> responsibilities. For this study, the <b>key</b> <b>job</b> responsibilities were the eight standards identified by the American Association of School Administrators Commission on Standards for the Superintendency, chaired by John Hoyle, completed in 1993. The eight standards identified were: leadership and district culture, policy and governance, communications and community relations, organizational management, curriculum planning and development, instructional management, human resources management, and values and ethics of leadership. A total of 207 superintendents with at least three but not more than five years of experience were included in the study. ^ The findings associated with the research questions revealed that superintendents relied on prior administrative experiences significantly more than any of the other four variables to complete each <b>key</b> <b>job</b> responsibility. When all eight <b>key</b> <b>job</b> responsibilities were considered as a whole, prior administrative experiences were relied on significantly more than any other variable. Network of colleagues were relied on significantly more than professional and governmental organizations, research, and academic preparation. Research and academic preparation were relied on equally, but less so than any of the other variables. ...|$|R

Using a terrestrial vehicle as a case study, an approach is developed that links component modularity to system design variables which are likely to change levels. The approach utilitizes Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration, Multi-Epoch Analysis, and network measures of component modularity to identify components which are most likely to need to change as well as the components ability to make a modularity change. It is found that the tools utilized can be successfully linked to provide early development phase information about value-centric system modularizations; the approach does require a network representation of the system earlier in the design cycle than it may be typically available. Using explicit knowledge, the approach developed can focus designers modularization efforts on the elements of the system that may need to change to accommodate changes in decision makers preferences, use contexts, or epoch contexts. The approach developed can aid the system architect modularizing a system so as to create a high amount of leverage for a systems stakeholders. by Henry H. Roark, III. Thesis (S.

A key finding is that allocated fixed job costs are significant in explaining variations in short run prices even after controlling for job volume and quality requirements. The results also indicate that pricing behavior changed following the change in the <b>job</b> costing <b>system.</b> After the change, prices depend more on the full costs calculated based on the new system than on the full costs based on the old system, although neither cost estimate was reported to marketing managers when bidding for <b>jobs.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: Printing, <b>Job</b> order costing, Product costing, Pricing, Cost distortions Data Availability: The confidentiality agreement with the firm that provided data for this study precludes disseminating detailed data without its consent. 1 Job Costing and Pricing: Empirical Evidence from a Printing Company 1...|$|R

25|$|Final Fantasy III saw the {{introduction}} of the Job Change System: through special crystals, the four player characters were granted a variety of jobs or character classes that could be switched at any point by the player. The <b>Job</b> Change <b>system</b> was initially proposed by Sakaguchi as he wanted to give players freedom to customize the party members: with five characters with eight jobs each, the team needed to create forty different pixel portraits. The <b>Job</b> <b>System</b> has continued to have a strong role in the series, being most prominent in Final Fantasy V with twenty-two available jobs. Jobs have recurring functions throughout the series. Some of the more traditional classes include the Warrior/Fighter, the Dragoon, the Thief and variations on magical classes such as White and Black Mages. More original classes have appeared throughout the series, such as Bards, Scholars, and Summoners. Due to the series' popularity, they have become staples of RPGs since their debut. The complexity and scope of the class system varies from game to game. The original Final Fantasy XIV did away with the <b>Job</b> <b>System</b> in favour of a character class-driven system where equipment determined skills and growth. For the later stages of Final Fantasy XIV and later A Realm Reborn, the <b>Job</b> <b>System</b> was reintroduced as a second level to the current class <b>system.</b> Many <b>Jobs,</b> such as the Dragoon, the Summoner, and the Red Mage have become closely identified with the series.|$|R

Brenda Lockheart provides aerial bombardment as a sniper-type unit, whereas Emil Szynsky's repairman wanzer acts as a mechanic-type unit. Each character has a specific purpose on the battlefield, and the game encourages the player to make the most out of them to complete missions. Remodeling is a feature that allows the player to upgrade their parts. For example, a shotgun can be outfitted with a larger barrel to fire more rounds or a bigger storage clip to hold more ammunition.|$|R
