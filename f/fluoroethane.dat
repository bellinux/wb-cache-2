40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{derivatization}} chemistry for determination of fluoride {{based on the}} batch reaction of fluoride ions with triethyloxonium tetrachloroferrate(III) in a closed vessel to yield <b>fluoroethane.</b> Gaseous <b>fluoroethane</b> was readily separated from the matrix, sampled from the headspace, and determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The method was validated using rainwater certified reference material (IRMM CA 408) and subsequently applied to the determination of fluoride in various matrixes, including tap water, seawater, and urine. An instrumental limit of detection of 3. 2 3 ̆bcg/L with a linear range up to 50 mg/L was achieved. The proposed derivatization is a one-step reaction, requires no organic solvents, and is safe, as the derivatizing agent is nonvolatile. Determination of fluoride is affected by common fluoride-complexing agents, such as Al(III) and Fe(III). The effect of large amounts of these interferences was studied, and the adverse effect of these ions was eliminated by use of the method of standard additions.

40|$|Product {{branching}} {{ratios and}} rate constants for the O(3 P) atom and OH radical formation {{processes in the}} reaction of electronically excited oxygen O(1 D) atoms with fluoroethanes were measured at room temperature. The reactions of CHF 2 -CF 3 (HFC- 125), CH 2 F-CF 3 (HFC- 134 a), CHF 2 -CHF 2 (HFC- 134), CH 3 -CF 3 (HFC- 143 a), CH 2 F-CHF 2 (HFC- 143), and CH 3 -CHF 2 (HFC- 152 a) were studied. Laser-induced fluorescence techniques using vacuum and near-ultraviolet lasers are applied to the detection of O(1 D, 3 P 2) atoms and OH radicals, respectively. The results are compared with previous investigations, and reaction mechanisms are discussed {{on the basis of}} the present results. The rate constants for the OH radical production were proportional to the total number of H atoms included in the <b>fluoroethane</b> reactants, and those for the reaction processes are interpreted with the molecular structures of <b>fluoroethane</b> reactants. 1...|$|E
40|$|Several {{investigations}} have shown, {{by a variety}} of spectral techniques, that 2 -fluoroethanol (1) exists both in the liquid and vapor state, predominantly (> 95 %) in the conformation. with hydroxyl and fluorine gauche to one another. Notable is the recent electron-diffraction study in which 1 was shown to be greater than 90 % gauche in the vapor phase at 156 °. In every instance, this marked conformational preference for the gauche form has been attributed to the formation of a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond between the electronegative fluorine atom and the hydroxyl proton which are in close proximity in this configuration. That this is the case is presumably also supported by the observation that the CCF bond angle of 107. 7 ° is compressed relative to <b>fluoroethane...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} l-(di) halo- 2 -fluoroethanes {{reported}} in the literature to be nontoxic or of low toxicity were found to be highly toxic by the inhalation route. Experiments were performed that showed the compounds, 1, 2 -difluoroethane, l-chloro- 2 -fluoroethane, 1 -chloro- 1, 2 -difluoroethane, and l-bromo- 2 -fluoroethane to be highly toxic to rats upon inhalation for 4 hr. All four compounds had 4 -hr approximate lethal concentrations of =£ 100 ppm in rats. In contrast, 1, 1 -difluoroethane (commonly referred to as HFC- 152 a) has very low acute toxicity with a 4 -hr LC 50 of> 400, 000 ppm in rats. Rats exposed to the selected toxic <b>fluoroethanes</b> showed clinical signs of fluoroacetate toxicity (lethargy, hunched posture, convulsions). 1, 2 -Difluoroethane, l-chloro- 2 -fluoroethane, l-chloro- 1, 2 difluoroethane, and l-bromo- 2 -fluoroethane were shown to increase concentrations of citrate in serum and heart tissue, a hallmark of fluoroacetate intoxication.

40|$|A {{report is}} given on the ionization/dissociation {{behavior}} of the title compounds within air plasmas produced by electrical corona discharges at atmospheric pressure: {{both positive and negative}} ions were investigated at different temperatures using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). CHF 2 CH 3 (HFC- 152 a) undergoes efficient ionic oxidation to C 2 H 5 O+, in which the oxygen comes from water present in the plasma. In contrast, CF 3 CH 2 F (HFC- 134 a) does not produce any characteristic positive ion under APCI conditions, its presence within the plasma being revealed only as a neutral ligand in ion–molecule complexes with ions of the background (H 3 O+ and NO+). Analogously, the perfluorocarbon FC- 72 (n-C 6 F 14) does not produce significant positive ions at 30 °C: at high temperature, however, it undergoes dissociative ionization to form many product ions including C 3 F 6 +, C 2 F 4 +, CnF 2 n+ 1 + and a few families of oxygen containing cations (CnF 2 n+ 1 OH 2 +, CnF 2 nOH+, CnF 2 n− 1 O+, CnF 2 n− 1 O 2 H 2 +, CnF 2 n− 2 O 2 H+) which are suggested to derive from CnF 2 n+ 1 + in a cascade of steps initiated by condensation with water followed by steps of HF elimination and H 2 O addition. Negative ions formed from the <b>fluoroethanes</b> CHF 2 CH 3 and CF 3 CH 2 F (M) include complexes with ions of the background, O 2 −(M), O 3 −(M) and some higher complexes involving also water, and complexes of the fluoride ion, F−(H 2 O), F−(M) and higher complexes with both M and H 2 O also together. The interesting product O 2 −(HF) is also formed from 1, 1 -difluoroethane. In contrast to the HFCs, perfluoro-n-hexane gives stable molecular anions, M−, which at low source temperature or in humidified air are also detected as hydrates, M−(H 2 O). In addition, in humidified air F−(H 2 O) n complexes are also formed. The reactions leading to all major positive and negative product ions are discussed also with reference to available thermochemical data and relevant literature reports. The effects on both positive and negative APCI spectra due to ion activation via increasing Vcone are also reported and discussed: several interesting endothermic processes are observed under these conditions.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the substrate specificity of ammonia monooxygenase in whole cells of the nitrifying bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea {{for a number of}} aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons. To determine the effect of the halogen substituent and carbon chain length on substrate reactivity, we measured the rates of oxidation of the monohalogenated ethanes (<b>fluoroethane,</b> chloroethane, bromoethane, and iodoethane) and n-chlorinated C 1 to C 4 alkanes by whole cells of N. europaea. For monohalogenated ethanes, acetaldehyde was the major organic product and little or none of any of the alternate predicted products (2 -halogenated alcohols) were detected. The maximum rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight from iodoethane to chloroethane (19 to 221 nmol/min per mg of protein). In addition, the amount of substrate required for the highest rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight. For the n-chlorinated alkanes, the rate of dechlorination, as measured by the appearance of the corresponding aldehyde product, was greatest for chloroethane and decreased dramatically for chloropropane and chlorobutane (118, 4, and 8 nmol of aldehyde formed per min per mg of protein, respectively). The concentration profiles for halocarbon oxidation by ammonia monooxygenase showed apparent substrate inhibition when ammonia was used as the reductant source. When hydrazine was used as the electron donor, no substrate inhibition was observed, suggesting that the inhibition resulted from reductant limitation...|$|E
40|$|Chiu, Pei C. Chang, Shu-ChiThe {{prevalence}} of legacy and emerging contaminants has increasingly stressed our limited water resources, and caused impaired water quality {{in many parts}} of the world. To meet our growing demand for clean water in this century, it is of the utmost importance to develop more effective means to remove/degrade pollutants in water. In this research, three novel materials/processes were investigated for the adsorption or degradation of three important contaminants: arsenic, fluorinated alkenes, and nitrate. Arsenic is a common groundwater contaminant that poses a serious health threat to populations in the U. S. and other countries. Fluorinated organics are widespread in consumer and industrial products, and many of them are persistent due to the high stability of the carbon-fluorine bond. Nitrate is the most ubiquitous pollutant in U. S. groundwater. Nitrate is not only toxic at high concentrations, but is also a leading cause of water quality impairment. We have developed a new nano-magnetite-based sorbent to remove arsenic, investigated an effective catalyst for the reduction of fluorinated alkenes, and determined the capacity of a biochar to promote microbial nitrate reduction. Magnetite nanoparticle composite (MNPC) was synthesized for the removal of arsenic from water. We have shown that magnetite nanoparticles (MNP) possess high capacities and superior kinetics for adsorption of arsenic. In addition, to enable treatment applications, a new method was developed to embed MNPs into a silica network (MNPC). MNPC exhibited high adsorption capacities for arsenite and arsenate, 159. 7 and 165. 1 mg g- 1, respectively, comparable to the adsorption capacity of MNPs under anaerobic conditions. MNPC could retain over 99. 99 % of the MNPs in its structure. Moreover, the embedment prevented exposure of MNPC to oxygen and thereby extended its service life. Our results suggest that MNPC may represent a viable technology for arsenic removal from groundwater and drinking water. Rhodium on alumina was used as a catalyst to activate hydrogen gas for the reduction of vinyl fluoride (VF) as a model compound for fluorinated alkenes. VF is the monomer of fluoropolymer, a high production volume compound, and a probable (group 2 A) carcinogen. We studied the kinetics of VF reduction in the presence of water. The rate-limiting step for the reduction was determined to be the mass transfer of VF from bulk water to the catalyst surface. Based on the product distribution, the reaction paths were found to consist of reductive defluorination, followed by hydrogenation, and hydrogenation only, producing ethane and <b>fluoroethane,</b> respectively, as final product. When water was absent, the kinetics was too fast to be measured producing mainly <b>fluoroethane</b> as the final product. The experiment with humidified hydrogen gas showed that even layers of adsorbed water molecules on the surface of the catalyst would dramatically shift the reaction rate and product distribution. By revealing the crucial role of water in controlling both the reaction kinetics and pathway, this study could be an important step toward the development of effectively catalytic treatment for fluorocarbons. We demonstrated for the first time that biochar could serve as an electron donor to support microbial nitrate reduction. This new discovery could be a basis of novel engineered treatment/remediation systems to degrade nitrate, the most prevalent pollutant in the U. S. groundwater. Geobacter metallireducens (GS- 15) was used to investigate the role of redox active functional groups in biochar to nitrate reduction by exoelectrogenic bacteria. We showed that both biologically and chemically reduced biochar could support nitrate reduction. Results of this study suggest that biochar could be a bioaccessible electron storage medium in bioretention cells and other engineered systems, and this finding may also be applied to other black carbon. Each approach in this dissertation represents a breakthrough in contaminant treatment. Results of each investigation either form a basis for new and improved treatment methods or have implications, for the fate of contaminants in natural systems. Both are discussed in Chapter 5.

40|$|The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{observed}} during explosion tests {{that at a}} low concentration of agent, some candidate halon replacement agents increased the explosion severity instead of mitigating the event. At UTC Aerospace Systems a test program was developed to assess the behaviour of alternative agents at values below inerting concentration. Two agents were selected, C 2 HF 5 (Penta- <b>fluoroethane,</b> HFC- 125) and C 6 F 12 O (FK- 5 - 1 - 12, Novec™ 1230). Baseline tests were performed with unsuppressed C 3 H 8 (propane) /air mixtures and C 3 H 8 /air mixtures with CF 3 Br (Halon 1301) and N 2 (nitrogen). Using CF 3 Br or N 2 at below inerting concentrations mitigated the explosion. C 2 HF 5 was tested against C 3 H 8 at stoichiometric (4 vol%) and lower explosion limit (LEL) (2 vol%). Against 4 vol% C 3 H 8 the combustion was mitigated, proportional to agent concentration; however, low concentrations of C 2 HF 5 with 2 vol% C 3 H 8 enhanced the explosion. Tests with N 2 against a volatile mixture of C 3 H 8 with C 2 HF 5 showed that N 2 mitigated the events. Final tests were performed with low concentrations of C 6 F 12 O against C 3 H 8 /air mixtures. This showed similar behaviour to that observed with the C 2 HF 5 tests. Normally during qualification tests for new agents the stoichiometric concentration of a fuel is deemed {{to be the worst}} case scenario and the baseline against which agents are tested. The above described test results show that this assumption may need to be reconsidered. This work shows that contrary to common assumption the agents investigated are unlikely to have acted chemically at the flame front, but most likely, mainly cooled the flame and changed the stoichiometry, i. e. the ratio of components of the flammable mixture...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneous {{catalysis}} is {{an important}} branch in catalysis, in which the catalyst and reactants are in different physical phases. In this thesis, we have carried out extensive first-principles calculations to explore the selected heterogeneous reactions catalyzed by the noble-metal nanoparticles. The major results of the thesis fall into two categories: (1) {{the discovery of the}} scaling relations for predicting the catalytic activity of nanoparticles; (2) the computational characterization of the catalytic activity and mechanism for specific catalytic reactions. For the first category, we have made efforts to develop the scaling relations for binary noble-metal nanoparticles. The obtained results show that the scaling relation not only holds at the nanoscale, but can also be unified with those obtained for the extended surfaces. Our findings shed new light for the efficient screening of nanoparticles with superior catalytic properties. The second part of the thesis summarizes our studies on different catalytic systems. One of the focuses is to study the catalytic properties of the single Pd-doped Cu 55 nanoparticle toward H 2 dissociation and propane dehydrogenation. The possible reaction mechanisms and effects of the single and multiple Pd doping on the catalytic activity have been extensively examined. Our calculations reveal that single-Pd-doped Cu 55 cluster bears good balance between the maximum use of the noble metal and the high activity, and it may serve as a promising single-atom catalyst. We have also systematically studied the reduction process of graphene fluoride catalyzed by the Pt-coated metallic tip under different atmospheres, aiming to provide a feasible strategy for scanning probe lithography to fabricate electronic circuits at the nanoscale on graphene fluoride. It is found that the tip-induced reduction of graphene fluoride with assistance of pure hydrogen atmosphere is facile despite the release of hazard hydride fluoride. The ethylene molecule is predicted to be an excellent acceptor for fluoride abstraction from graphene fluoride, but the corresponding defluorination cycle can not be recycled. Our calculations have finally revealed that under the mixture hydrogen and ethylene atmosphere, the Pt-coated tip can effectively and sequentially reduce graphene fluoride with the release of relatively harmless reduction product, <b>fluoroethane.</b> The proposed cyclic reduction strategy is energetically highly favorable and is ready to be employed in experiments. Our theoretical studies provide yet another convincing example to demonstrate the power of the density functional theory for studying the nano-catalysis. It should also been mentioned that the present calculations are restricted to relatively small-sized clusters due to the limited computational resources. It is highly desirable to further study complicated interfacial systems and to provide a full picture of heterogeneous catalysis with the aid of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in the future.
