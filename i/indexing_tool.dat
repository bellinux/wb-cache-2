User-specified television programmes are captured in MPEG- 1 format and analysed using {{a number of}} video <b>indexing</b> <b>tools</b> such as shot boundary detection, keyframe extraction, shot clustering and news story segmentation. A number of different interfaces have been developed which allow a user to browse the visual index created by these analysis tools.

40|$|Literature <b>indexing</b> <b>tools</b> provide re-searchers with a {{means to}} {{navigate}} through the network of scholarly scientific articles in a subject domain. We propose that more effective <b>indexing</b> <b>tools</b> may be designed using the links between articles provided by citations. With the explosion {{in the amount of}} sci-entific literature and with the advent of ar-tifacts requiring more sophisticated index-ing, {{a means to}} provide more information about the citation relation in order to give more intelligent control to the navigation process is warranted. In order to navigate a citation index in this more sophisticated manner, the citation index must provide not only the citation-link information, but also must indicate the function of the cita-tion. The design methodology of an in-dexing tool for scholarly biomedical lit-erature which uses the rhetorical context surrounding the citation to provide the ci-tation function is presented. In particular, we discuss how the scientific method is re-flected in scientific writing and how this knowledge can be used to decide the pur-pose of a citation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Structured {{semantic}} metadata about unstructured web documents can {{be created}} using automatic subject indexing methods, avoiding laborious manual indexing. A succesful automatic subject <b>indexing</b> <b>tool</b> for the web should work with texts in multiple languages and be independent of the domain of discourse of the documents and controlled vocabularies. However, analyzing text written in a highly in ected language requires word form normalization that goes beyond rule-based stemming algorithms. We have tested the state-of-the art automatic <b>indexing</b> <b>tool</b> Maui on Finnish texts using three stemming and lemmatization algorithms and tested it with documents and vocabularies of di erent domains. Both of the lemmatization algorithms we tested performed signi cantly better than a rule-based stemmer, and the subject indexing quality {{was found to be}} comparable to that of human indexers. ...|$|E

NP-C diagnosis can be delayed for years due to heterogeneous presentation; adult-onset NP-C {{can be particularly}} difficult to diagnose. We developed a Suspicion <b>Index</b> <b>tool,</b> ranking specific symptoms within and across domains, including family members who have NP-C, to provide a risk prediction score to identify patients who should undergo testing for NP-C. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed in 5 centers in Europe and 2 in Australia (n = 216). Three patient types were selected: classic or variant filipin staining NP-C cases (n = 71), NP-C noncases (confirmed negative by filipin staining; n = 64), or controls with at least 1 characteristic symptom of NP-C (n = 81). NP-C signs and symptoms were categorized into visceral, neurologic, or psychiatric domains. Logistic regression was performed on individual signs and symptoms within and across domains, and regression coefficients were used to develop prediction scores for NP-C. Internal validation was performed with the bootstrap resampling method. Results: The Suspicion <b>Index</b> <b>tool</b> has good discriminatory performance with cutpoints for grading suspicion of NP-C. Neonatal jaundice/cholestasis, splenomegaly, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, cataplexy, and cognitive decline/dementia were strong predictors of NP-C, as well as symptoms occurring in multiple domains in individual patients, and also parents/siblings or cousins with NP-C. Conclusions: The Suspicion <b>Index</b> <b>tool</b> is a screening tool that can help identify patients who may warrant further investigation for NP-C. A score >= 70 indicates that patients should be referred for testing for NP-C. Neurology (R) 2012; 78 : 1560 - 156...|$|R
