30|$|The clear {{majority}} of contests that were cancelled were done so {{for reasons that}} did not require interpretation, i.e. failure to obtain required neuroimaging, neuroimaging abnormalities, <b>incomplete</b> <b>routine</b> screening investigations, exceeding the maximum weight differential between the two athletes, and ECG abnormalities. However, there was subjectivity {{when it came to}} physician interpretation of the degree of pre-existing athlete injury, the presence of dehydration, or the level of dehydration that lead to the bout being cancelled. It was not possible to quantify how clinical gestalt may have affected the number of bouts that were cancelled or allowed to continue when injury or dehydration was present. Future work could consider implementing a priori definitions for degree of injury or dehydration to create more consistency when determining if a bout is to be cancelled.|$|E

Official SENSEV AL- 2 results were generated using WordNet, and separately using the New Oxford Dictionary of English (NODE). The disambiguation functionality exploits whatever information is made available by the lexical database. Special routines examined multiword units and contextual clues (both collocations, definition and example content words, and subject matter analyses); syntactic constraints have not yet been employed. The official coarsegrained precision was 0. 367 for the lexical sample task and 0. 460 for the all-words task (these are actually recall, with actual precision of 0. 390 and 0. 506 for the two tasks). NODE definitions were automatically mapped into WordNet, with precision of 0. 405 and 0. 418 on 75 % and 70 % mapping for the lexical sample and all-words tasks, respectively, comparable to WordNet.

40|$|Back pain is {{the most}} common {{complaint}} in the modern life. Sacralisation of lumbar vertebra seems to be the most common cause under debate. Addition of sacral elements by the incorporation of fifth lumbar vertebra is known as sacralisation. Sacralisation could be unilateral or bilateral, complete or <b>incomplete.</b> During <b>routine</b> study of vertebral column, we noticed sacralisation of fifth lumbar vertebra with non fusion of lamina of first sacral vertebra in one of the sacrum, in the Department of Anatomy, DM WIMS College, Meppadi, Waynad. This sacrum had six vertebrae instead of five vertebrae as in the normal sacrum. There were five sacral foramina on right side due to complete fusion of abnormal transverse process of fifth lumbar vertebra. But, there were only four sacral foramina on the left side due to incomplete fusion i. e Unilateral Sacralisation. Well defined sacral promontory was absent. So we identified this variation as sacralisation of fifth lumbar vertebra and S 1 vertebra was less developed as like S 2. These variations may be found in patients during radiological investigations complaining of low back pain. Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae are due to its embryological origin. These variations may affect normal function because of compression of nerves, soft tissue and ligamentous strain between joints. Knowledge of this variation is important to diagnose lower back pain, sciatica, disc prolapse and is helpful in procedures like spinal anaesthesia and lumbar puncture...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{issues is}} now taking a growing {{place in society}} {{and to ensure that}} {{companies}} meet public expectations and do their part in working towards a sustainable development, environmental management system is said to be an effective tool (Almgren & Brorson, 2009). This case study has examined a company's environmental management system in order to find strengths and weaknesses within the ISO 14001 system. The work was carried out using interviews, document reviews and analyzes in which the three main concepts control the report; "daily work", "audit" and "environmental aspects". The results shows that the daily work looks different depending on where you are; in the production or at the office. The audit examined all documents related to the environmental management system and the study showed that the biggest strengths was the commitment and waste handling while areas such as environmental goals and management review needed improvement. As a result of the deficiencies identified, suggestions for improvements was proposed. The investigation of the routine of the environmental aspects showed an <b>incomplete</b> <b>routine</b> where the red wire from identification to evaluation was missing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of {{congenital rubella syndrome}} (CRS) is unknown in South Africa. There is evidence {{that it may be}} significant and largely undetected, particularly in the upper socio-economic group. This may be due to <b>incomplete</b> <b>routine</b> administration of MMR vaccine in infancy and a build-up of susceptible females reaching the childbearing age group who could be exposed to the extensive reservoir of virus in the unimmunised public sector of the population. OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of the immunity gap to rubella by testing for protective IgG antibodies and the {{incidence of}} rubella infection by testing for IgM antibodies in sera. The data obtained would also be used to model the extent of CRS. DESIGN: Residual laboratory serum specimens from public and private laboratories were serologically tested for rubella IgG antibodies to investigate the immunity gap in the population and IgM antibodies in sera collected from the measles rashlike illness surveillance programme. Modelling exercises calculated the force of infection and the predicted incidence of CRS in South Africa. RESULTS: The serological immunity gap was significantly greater in the private sector specimens compared with the public sector - 10. 7 % versus 5. 4 %, respectively. In most years rubella caused much more rash-like illness than measles, with a significant number (5. 1 - 9. 6 %) of rubella-positive IgM specimens occurring in women of childbearing age. CONCLUSION: Modelling of the data suggests that the extent of CRS may be grossly underestimated in South Africa. Approximately 654 cases are calculated to occur every year. It is suggested that selective immunisation of girls before puberty should be instituted together with a routine rubella immunisation programme of infants to forestall a possible future outbreak of CRS, as occurred in Greece in 1993...|$|E
40|$|The program {{described}} {{creates the}} first derivative functions of given function of limited complexity, namely generalized polynomials, but involving possibly many variables. Neither nested functions nor general rational forms are handled. However, partials to such functions {{can usually be}} readily programmed utilizing those forms produced automatically. Similarly, if a function of many variables is nonlinear in only a few, only derivatives of nonlinear terms need to be created; the constant derivatives can be added with ordinary DO-loops or similar standard programming techniques. Three main files are used, indicated by integer variables IN, IFIN and IFOUT. Using these symbols to denote these files, IN contains the FORTRAN source code representing one or more functions f(X) to be differetiated, where X is a vector. The code must contain special comment lines delimiting and identifying each function. File IFIN contains additional comment lines which are really statements in a stylized language which specifies differ entiation, referring to the functions defined in IN.

40|$|Organizational {{failure is}} an <b>incomplete</b> process because <b>routines</b> and norms persist through {{employee}} careers. Qualitative interviews with former employees from four newspapers and two investment banks, {{all of which}} are bankrupt or disbanded, demonstrate ongoing utilization of routines and ongoing compliance to norms despite severed connections to the failed firm. Routines are most likely to persist when they relate to low-volatility processes that do not require maintenance to ensure ongoing accessibility. Characteristics that make norms transferable are also identified. Adherence to aesthetic and pragmatic norms depends on how well they fit into new occupational contexts: uptake varies in proportion to the similarity between the failed firm and the new occupational setting of a failure survivor. Justice-oriented norms are not context-dependent; they persist regardless of post-failure employment outcomes. In fact, justice-oriented norms are found to drive the selection of new occupations as journalists seek normative consistency in their careers and some investment bankers change careers to reclaim a sense of purpose lost in banking. These observations hold whether survivors find employment in incumbent firms, entrepreneurial projects, or as freelancers. As survivors adapt work practices, their efforts constitute a form of inter-organizational innovation that generates organizational heterogeneity within unstable industries. Post-failure continuity provides an important and largely undocumented mechanism for the preservation of organizational attributes and the diversification of organizational form amidst crisis, an adaptive process that reconsiders the normative environment of a business and selectively discards assumptions about how firms ought to be. Survivors of failure often face a dilemma in deciding whether to attempt to re-create an occupational setting similar to the firm that failed or to go a different direction. This work takes up this dilemma, asking what insight business ethics research can provide for those who might wonder about the purpose of their firms. A theory of property is used to articulate a normative argument: firms should fail when they are unable to cover their debts and externalities, and firms should survive when they generate surplus value. The dissertation contributes to organizational theories of evolution, to the study of career trajectories, and to a life-cycle approach to business ethics. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{clinical}} and epidemiological features of pertussis in children at incomplete coverage of the population with routine immunization. Materials and Methods. To achieve this goal, we have evaluated the epidemiological situation of pertussis and studied {{the features of the}} clinical course of the disease in 296 children aged from 1 month to 14 years (data from the annual reports for the period of 1987 – 2012). Additional research methods included: complete blood count, chest X-ray examination, enzyme immunoassay, polymerase chain reaction and bacteriological method. Evaluation of immune status was based on a comprehensive study of indicators of the overall reactive potential of the body by studying the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of hemograms. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis software package Microsoft Excel 2003. Results. In the Donetsk region, as in whole in Ukraine, there was a tendency to reduce the incidence of pertussis (12. 4 – 1. 5 per 100 thousand population), with periodic ups and downs every 2 – 3 years. In 2011, there was another rise in the incidence of pertussis infection: incidence exceeded the previous year level by 3 times and national figure — by 1. 5 times (2. 9 per 100 thousand population). Increased incidence was observed in every second administrative territory; in some of them it increased by 10 – 18 times compared to last year. Epidemic worsening was determined on a background of <b>incomplete</b> coverage with <b>routine</b> immunization of the population due to the insufficient supply of vaccines in Donetsk region in the last 3 years — 77 % (2009), 51 % (2010) and 56 % (2011). Age groups which are most at-risk for pertussis, as before, are infants (132. 1 per 100 thousand population) who were not subject to vaccination by age or have not received the full course of vaccination, as well as at-risk children aged 5 – 9 years (46. 8 per 100 thousand population), adolescents (1. 42 per 100 thousand population). Change in the epidemic situation has {{had an impact on the}} nature of the clinical course of pertussis: the number of severe forms increased — unvaccinated children accounted for 84. 0 %, and symptomatic forms of the disease were registered (in the foci of infection 85 – 92 %). Conclusions. Stabilization of the epidemic situation with pertussis has been promoted by a number of preventive measures: a) the development of legislative documents to improve the surveillance system; b) monitoring of changes in serotypes of the pathogen; c)  improvement of laboratory diagnosis of diseases by introducing modern methods of research; d) annual sufficient supply of regions with pertussis vaccines in accordance with the requests; e) timely and complete vaccination coverage according to the annual plan of immunization; f) professional training of primary health care practitioners. Prevention of involvement in the epidemic process of young children and schoolchildren is possible by maintaining stable high immunization coverage of children in decreed terms by using an effective vaccine, availability of affordable and informative methods of immunity evaluation, as well as a reliable bacteriological diagnosis of pertussis. Currently, along with increased coverage of routine vaccination, surveillance of this infection is particularly important, which enables to carry out antiepidemic measures in the form of early diagnosis of pertussis in exposed children. In modern conditions, the classic symptoms of the disease still remain in vaccinated and unvaccinated children, but there are differences in the severity of pertussis in children with poor premorbid background. Diagnosis of pertussis, especially among infants, remains a challenge for practical public health...|$|R
