As part of these postexplosion investigations, the condition of underground stoppings, including the debris from damaged stoppings, is documented as evidence of the approximate strength and the direction of the explosion forces.

The influence of initial temperature of the mixture (changing in the range of 293 – 473 K) on the fundamental explosion parameters was also investigated. The ignition source was an induction electrical spark. It was stated, that the increase of initial temperature of the LPG-air mixture causes a significant increase of the explosion range.
