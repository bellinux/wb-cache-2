5|$|Calcium carbimide {{works in}} the same way as disulfiram; it has an {{advantage}} in that the occasional adverse effects of disulfiram, hepatotoxicity and <b>drowsiness,</b> do not occur with calcium carbimide.|$|E
5|$|Elderly {{individuals}} {{should be}} cautious {{in the use}} of alprazolam due to the possibility of increased susceptibility to side-effects, especially loss of coordination and <b>drowsiness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like all {{central nervous}} system depressants, {{alprazolam}} in larger-than-normal doses can cause significant deterioration in alertness and increase <b>drowsiness,</b> especially in those unaccustomed to the drug's effects.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including <b>drowsiness,</b> amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|Fly agarics {{are known}} for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount {{ingested}} per body weight, effects can range from nausea and twitching to <b>drowsiness,</b> cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Born to a large, impoverished {{family of}} farm workers, Ellen {{was sent to}} work as a nursemaid at the age of eleven. Soon afterwards, she began {{suffering}} periods of <b>drowsiness</b> and was referred to a local hospital. After four months her condition was declared incurable, and she was sent home. Two days later, Ellen had a series of seizures and—her mother claimed—fell into a deep sleep from which she could not be roused.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including <b>drowsiness,</b> hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as <b>drowsiness.</b> Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{problems}} are {{a feature of}} the disease and can be worsened by medications. Symptoms can manifest as daytime <b>drowsiness</b> (including sudden sleep attacks resembling narcolepsy), disturbances in REM sleep, or insomnia. REM behavior disorder (RBD), in which patients act out dreams, sometimes injuring themselves or their bed partner, may begin many years before the development of motor or cognitive features of PD or DLB.|$|E
5|$|Meningitis is {{an acute}} {{inflammation}} of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The most common symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, <b>drowsiness,</b> or poor feeding. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may {{be accompanied by a}} characteristic rash.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes <b>drowsiness</b> ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action. They include <b>drowsiness,</b> dizziness, and decreased alertness and concentration. Lack of coordination may result in falls and injuries, in particular, in the elderly. Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents. Decreased libido and erection problems are a common side effect. Depression and disinhibition may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing (hypoventilation) may be encountered with intravenous use. Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite, blurred vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares. Cases of liver toxicity have been described but are very rare.|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; <b>drowsiness,</b> slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and <b>drowsiness.</b> A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes <b>drowsiness,</b> slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E
5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have <b>drowsiness,</b> decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E
5|$|Plants figure {{prominently}} in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, {{and may be}} more or less magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant <b>drowsiness,</b> while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms.|$|E

Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E
25|$|Very common (>10% of patients): dizziness, <b>drowsiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inactivating effects – sedating effects such as <b>drowsiness,</b> {{somnolence}} and sedation.|$|E
25|$|Overdose {{symptoms}} {{may include}} extreme <b>drowsiness,</b> confusion, muscle weakness, and fainting.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} Drinking alcohol increases urine production, inhibits anti-diuretic hormone production, decreases awareness, increases <b>drowsiness</b> {{and causes}} impulsive decisions.|$|E
25|$|CNS {{depression}} with increasingly heavier exposure: <b>drowsiness,</b> lethargy, slurred speech, hypoesthesia, confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, {{respiratory depression}} and apnoea.|$|E
25|$|Trinitroaniline is dangerously explosive. Symptoms of {{exposure}} to this compound may include skin and eye irritation, headache, <b>drowsiness,</b> weakness, cyanosis, and respiratory distress.|$|E
25|$|People exposed for a {{long time}} to low amounts of {{diborane}} have experienced respiratory irritation, seizures, fatigue, <b>drowsiness,</b> confusion, and occasional transient tremors.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine can {{delay or}} prevent sleep, and {{improves}} task performance during sleep deprivation. Shift workers who use caffeine make fewer mistakes due to <b>drowsiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Histamine H1 receptors: {{effects on}} these receptors account for its {{sedation}} and reduction in vigilance. This may {{also lead to}} <b>drowsiness</b> and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|All of the opioids {{can cause}} side effects. Common adverse {{reactions}} in patients taking opioids for pain relief include nausea and vomiting, <b>drowsiness,</b> itching, dry mouth, dizziness, and constipation.|$|E
25|$|Mental calm: With {{mindfulness}} and alertness (see sampajanna), a monk cleanses {{his mind}} of covetousness, ill will and anger, sloth and <b>drowsiness,</b> restlessness and anxiety, and doubt (see the Five Hindrances).|$|E
25|$|Sexual climax, from {{masturbation}} or otherwise, leaves one in {{a relaxed}} and contented state. This is frequently followed closely by <b>drowsiness</b> and sleep – particularly when one masturbates in bed.|$|E
25|$|Frequently {{encountered}} {{side effects}} are: dry mouth, paradoxically increased appetite, nausea, strange taste in the mouth, upset stomach, constipation, trouble sleeping, dizziness, <b>drowsiness,</b> menstrual cramps/pain, headache, flushing, or joint/muscle pain.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{formulations}} of diphenhydramine are available, including creams, lotions, gels, and sprays. These {{are used to}} relieve itching, and {{have the advantage of}} causing fewer systemic effects (e.g., <b>drowsiness)</b> than oral forms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{caffeine}} and {{when a person is}} awake and alert, little adenosine is present in (CNS) neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time it accumulates in the neuronal synapse, in turn binding to and activating adenosine receptors found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases <b>drowsiness.</b> When caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves <b>drowsiness,</b> and thus maintains or restores alertness.|$|E
25|$|Memantine is, in general, well-tolerated. Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of people) include confusion, dizziness, <b>drowsiness,</b> headache, insomnia, agitation, and/or hallucinations. Less common {{adverse effects}} include vomiting, anxiety, hypertonia, cystitis, and increased libido.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{appears to}} be {{relatively}} benign in cases of single-drug overdose, although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available. In one clinical trial, buspirone was administered to healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375mg/day, and produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, <b>drowsiness,</b> miosis, and gastric distress. In early clinical trials, buspirone was given at dosages even as high as 2,400mg/day, with akathisia, tremor, and muscle rigidity observed. Deliberate overdoses with 250mg and up to 300mg buspirone have resulted in <b>drowsiness</b> in about 50% of individuals. One death {{has been reported in}} association with 450mg buspirone together with alprazolam, diltiazem, alcohol, cocaine.|$|E
25|$|Corticosteroids, usually {{dexamethasone}} given 4 to 8mg every 4 to 6 h, {{can reduce}} peritumoral edema (through rearrangement of the blood–brain barrier), diminishing mass effect and lowering intracranial pressure, with {{a decrease in}} headache or <b>drowsiness.</b>|$|E
