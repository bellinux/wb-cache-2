The desire for having rich and expensive <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> is in tension with producing a regular and energy-efficient computing fabric. This paper explores the design trade-off between complex, universal <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> and simpler, limited <b>functional</b> <b>units.</b> We show that a modest amount of specialization reduces the area-delay-energy product of an optimized architecture to 0. 86 × a baseline architecture.

5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single <b>functional</b> <b>unit</b> are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E

40|$|Abstract-‐Unavailability of <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> {{and their}} unequal {{activity}} makes performance bottlenecks and thermal hot spot units in general-purpose processors. We propose to use reconfigurable <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> {{to overcome these}} challenges. A selected set of complex <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> that might be under-utilized, such as a multiplier and divider, are realized in a time-multiplexed fashion using a shared programmable Look Up Table (LUT) based fabric. This allows for run-time reconfiguration and migration of their activity. LUT based implementation also allows under-utilized <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> to be dynamically reconfigured to the <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> that have a performance bottleneck and hence improving performance. The programmable LUTs are realized using Spin Transfer Torque (STT) Magnetic technology (also called STT-NV) due to its zero leakage and CMOS compatibility. The results show significant performance improvement of 16 % on average across standard benchmarks, when replacing CMOS multiplier and divider with reconfigurable STT-NV LUT counterpart. In addition, reconfiguration reduces the maximum temperature of <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> by up to 27 oC and almost eliminates the thermal variation across them. This comes with small power overhead and no area impact. Keywords [...] STT-NV logic; reconfigurable architecture; low power; functional units; low temperature; multiplier; divider I...|$|R
40|$|Revealing <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> in protein-protein {{interaction}} (PPI) {{networks are}} important for understanding cellular functional organization. Current algorithms for identifying <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> mainly focus on cohesive protein complexes which have more internal interactions than external interactions. Most of these approaches do not handle overlaps among complexes since they usually allow a protein to belong to only one complex. Moreover, {{recent studies have shown}} that other non-cohesive structural <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> beyond complexes also exist in PPI networks. Thus previous algorithms that just focus on non-overlapping cohesive complexes are not able to present the biological reality fully. Here, we develop a new regularized sparse random graph model (RSRGM) to explore overlapping and various structural <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> in PPI networks. RSRGM is principally dominated by two model parameters. One is used to define the <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> as groups of proteins that have similar patterns of connections to others, which allows RSRGM to detect non-cohesive structural <b>functional</b> <b>units.</b> The other one is used to represent the degree of proteins belonging to the units, which supports a protein belonging to more than one revealed unit. We also propose a regularizer to control the smoothness between the estimators of these two parameters. Experimental results on four S. cerevisiae PPI networks show that the performance of RSRGM on detecting cohesive complexes and overlapping complexes is superior to that of previous competing algorithms. Moreover, RSRGM has the ability to discover biological significant <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> besides complexes...|$|R

Panikkar wrote that Karnavan loved his sister's son more than his own and he believes it was due mainly to the instability of Nair marriages. Divorce rate was very high as both man and woman had equal right to terminate the marriage. Enangar was another family with which a tharavad remained closely related; a few such related families formed a social group whose members participated in all social activities.

25|$|The BtuCD and HI1470/1 are {{classified}} as large ABC importers. The transmembrane subunit of the vitamin B12 importer, BtuCD, contains 10 TM helices and the <b>functional</b> <b>unit</b> consists of two copies each of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and transmembrane domain (TMD). The TMD and NBD {{interact with one another}} via the cytoplasmic loop between two TM helices and the Q loop in the ABC. In the absence of nucleotide, the two ABC domains are folded and the dimer interface is open. A comparison of the structures with (BtuCDF) and without (BtuCD) binding protein reveals that BtuCD has an opening that faces the periplasm whereas in BtuCDF, the outward-facing conformation is closed to both sides of the membrane. The structures of BtuCD and the BtuCD homolog, HI1470/1, represent two different conformational states of an ABC transporter. The predicted translocation pathway in BtuCD is open to the periplasm and closed at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane while that of HI1470/1 faces the opposite direction and open only to the cytoplasm. The difference in the structures is a 9° twist of one TM subunit relative to the other.|$|E
25|$|Satellite glial {{cells in}} sensory ganglia are laminar cells that most often an {{envelope}} of multiple SGCs completely surrounds each sensory neuron. The number of SGCs {{that make up}} the sheath increases proportionately with the volume of the neuron which it surrounds. Additionally, the volume of the sheath itself increases proportionately with the volume and surface area of the neuron’s somata. The distance of extracellular space between the sheath and the neuronal plasma membrane measures , allowing the neuron and its SGC sheath to form a single anatomical and <b>functional</b> <b>unit.</b> These individual units are separated by areas of connective tissue. However, there are some sensory neurons that occupy the same space within connective tissue and are therefore grouped together in a “cluster” of two or three neurons. Most often each individual neuron in a cluster is still surrounded by its own SGC sheath, but in some cases it is missing. Some sensory neurons have small projections called microvilli that extend outward from their cell surfaces. Due to their close proximity to the SGC sheath, these microvilli of the neuronal plasma membrane reach into the grooves of the sheath, allowing for possible exchange of materials between the cells.|$|E

While Luigi Galvani's pioneering work in the late 1700s had set the stage for studying the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons, it was in the late 19th century that Emil du Bois-Reymond, Johannes Peter Müller, and Hermann von Helmholtz demonstrated that the electrical excitation of neurons predictably affected the electrical states of adjacent neurons, and Richard Caton found electrical phenomena in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys.|$|E
40|$|FPGAs make it {{practical}} {{to speed up}} a program by defining hardware <b>functional</b> <b>units</b> that perform calculations faster than can be achieved in software.
