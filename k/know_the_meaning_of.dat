They replied {{that they did}} not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the word and would hold the Godesburg to the last man. A report dated 23 December 1583 relates that, having given Ferdinand a rude reply, the defenders went back to lunch.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the birth of Cyc, the first attempt to attack the commonsense {{knowledge}} problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat, who started and led the project, argued {{that there is no}} shortcut ― the only way for machines to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. The project was not expected to be completed for many decades.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} must {{fit their}} context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education {{contributed to their}} calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would always know what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with {{the rhythm of the}} phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. One who does not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy.|$|E
25|$|At trial {{the village}} {{attorney}} had given testimony {{suggesting that he}} did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> some of the terms in the guidelines, and the village president had testified that she did not know what, exactly, was being regulated. The Flipside had argued that these pointed to the statute's vagueness, but Leighton dismissed those concerns. Both passages had been taken out of context, he wrote. The attorney had been describing how he relied on a report from the police on how such items were displayed in a store, and the village president had similarly explained how she had relied on expertise from the police that she did not herself possess to inform her vote in favor of the ordinance. The judge also noted that the village had enacted an administrative review process to resolve questions over potentially vague terms in the ordinance at the time of any application for a license.|$|E

500|$|Nicholas Shakespeare {{stated that}} part of Chatwin's impact was that his work was {{difficult}} to categorise and it helped [...] "set free other writers... conventional boundaries. Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify as one nor did he consider himself a novelist. ("I don't quite <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the word novel," [...] he said). He preferred to call his writing stories or searches. He was interested in asking big questions about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources. His friend and fellow writer Robyn Davidson said, [...] "He posed questions we all want answered and perhaps gave the illusion they were answerable." ...|$|E
500|$|Bård Owe as Odd Horten: The [...] "O" [...] in O' Horten {{stands for}} [...] "Odd". The name [...] "Odd" [...] is a quite common boys' name in Norway, {{and does not}} carry the same meaning as the English word [...] "", though the film and the character's bizarre qualities have been pointed out by some. Though not {{intentionally}} meant as a pun, Hamer himself has said: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the word in English, and that doesn't hurt." [...] Born in Norway, Owe {{has spent most of}} his professional career in Denmark, where he is known to a contemporary audience primarily from Lars von Trier's The Kingdom. His career, however, goes all the way back to Carl Theodor Dreyer's classic Gertrude from 1964. Owe has also done much theatre and television work, yet after acting in over thirty films, this was his first leading role.|$|E
500|$|Social context {{involves}} {{pointing out}} social norms and violations of these norms. This form of context is most {{commonly found in}} conversation, as opposed to reading or other word learning environments. A child's understanding of social norms can help them to infer the meaning of words that occur in conversation. In an English-speaking tradition, [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you" [...] are taught to children {{at a very early}} age, so they are very familiar to the child by school-age. For example, if a group of people is eating a meal with the child present and one person says, [...] "give me the bread" [...] and another responds with, [...] "that was rude. What do you say?", and the person responds with [...] "please", the child may not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> [...] "rude", but can infer its meaning through social context and understanding the necessity of saying [...] "please".|$|E

500|$|Recent {{assessments}} of the album have been mostly positive, with AllMusic and Blender giving the album five stars, their highest ratings. AllMusic's Steve Huey compared the album to Here Come the Warm Jets, writing [...] "not quite as enthusiastic as Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain is made accessible through Eno's mastery of pop song structure". Douglas Wolk of Blender had rated it more highly than Here Come the Warm Jets, calling it [...] "more immediately likeable". Select gave the album a {{four out of five}} rating, calling it [...] "excellent" [...] and described the songs [...] "Mother Whale Eyeless", [...] "Put A Straw Under Baby" [...] and [...] "Third Uncle" [...] as highlights. Chris Jones of BBC Music called Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) [...] "a work of genius because it didn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> repetition" [...] and [...] "merely took Warm Jets and refined it into a smoother lump of oddness." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] was a {{favorite}} of Selena's younger fan base. Posthumous reviews have cited the song as being [...] "catchy". Ramiro Burr of Billboard magazine believed that the song could have easily been successful in European clubs thanks to its striking resemblance to Euro-pop and Eurodance songs that were popular in Europe at the time. Tom Whitehurst Jr. of the Corpus Christi Caller Times wrote {{that he did not know}} what [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] meant but, after a friend played him a tape of the recording, he became a fan of the singer. Andrew Mitchell, also from the Corpus Christi Caller Times, called the song [...] "happy" [...] and said that it was [...] "only natural to want to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> , not just memorize [...] lyrics to sing along. Music can teach. It can remove barriers of the mind and soul." [...] Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, called the song [...] "bouncy". Musicologists Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum called [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", [...] "No Me Queda Más", and [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] the [...] "key hits of [...] ". Peter Watrous of The New York Times called the song [...] "lightweight" [...] but found it to be: [...] "better than [...] ". Sue Anne Pressley of the Washington Post wrote that [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] was [...] "sprightly carefree", and [...] "infectious". Writing for the San Antonio Express-News, Michael Clark complimented A.B.'s addition of [...] "world-music flourishes" [...] to the song. Katherine Seligman, also from the San Antonio Express News, described the recording as an: [...] "infectiously happy song". Sun Sentinel contributor, Steve Bennett also called the recording [...] "infectious".|$|E

5000|$|This {{realization}} focused {{within him}} in a sudden sparkflash computation, and in the clear brilliance of that illumination, the boy Pall understood a profoundness. His life, hitherto a child's plaything, devoid of direction-seemingly! Or had there in fact always been a plan-a plan within a plan within a plan (whatever that meant (whatever that meant (whatever that meant)))?-was now encompassed by a terrible purpose. He <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word terrible, and he <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word purpose. And therefore he understood deeply <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> [...] "terrible purpose".

[...] Chandler's statements were called [...] "bitter and resentful" [...] by MacKay, whom Chandler criticized for supporting of the passage of Bill C-250, which amended the Criminal Code by adding sexual orientation as a protected category under the Code offences prohibiting advocating genocide and publicly inciting hatred. Chandler suggested that the amendment {{would lead to the}} banning of the Bible and other religious texts in schools and public libraries.|$|E

2500|$|The writer R.V. Cassill has {{suggested}} that of all crime fiction, Thompson's was the rawest and most harrowing; that neither Dashiell Hammett nor Raymond Chandler nor even Horace McCoy, author of the bleak They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, ever [...] "wrote a book within miles of Thompson". Similarly, {{in the introduction to}} Now and on Earth, Stephen King says he most admires Thompson's work because [...] "The guy was over the top. The guy was absolutely over the top.

[...] The Michigan players receiving first-team honors from Eckersall were Benbrook, Allerdice, Magidsohn (who he called [...] "a demon on the offense"), and center Andrew W. Smith. [...] In announcing his selection of Smith, Eckersall wrote: [...] "Smith {{is by far}} the best center in this section. [...] Yost experimented with this player until the Pennsylvania game ... Finally, as a last resort the coach tried him at center, where he proved {{to be one of the}} finds of the season.

2500|$|By December, {{the idea}} of a new lead character, 'The Captain', was mooted. The Captain, envisaged as being aged between 35 and 55, would be veteran of the Intergalactic War that began in Series Two. 'The Captain' would become the Liberator crew's new leader and would {{ultimately}} betray the crew to the Federation for personal profit. Maloney was concerned that casting an older, well-known actor for the final series of an established series would be difficult. He persuaded Nation to change 'The Captain' – now named Del Tarrant – into a younger character. Tarrant is a corruption of Nation's name that appears frequently in his work. Nation imagined this new, younger Tarrant as [...] "...someone like the Spitfire pilots of World War II, who were young and didn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> fear".|$|E
