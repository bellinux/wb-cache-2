60|$|Then in sullen {{silence the}} priests and priestesses {{reformed}} their ranks, and {{departed from the}} sanctuary, whence they were followed by the spectators, the most of them <b>in</b> <b>no</b> good <b>mood,</b> <b>for</b> they had been baulked of the promised spectacle.|$|R
60|$|These {{sanguine}} anticipations, however, were shortlived. The French fleet was in {{a shattered}} and forlorn condition. After sailing from before Newport on the 20th, it had manoeuvred for two days with the British fleet, each unwilling to enter into action without having the weathergage. While thus manoeuvring, the same furious storm which had raged on shore separated and dispersed them with fearful ravage. Some single encounters of scattered ships subsequently took place, but without definite result. All were too much tempest-tossed and disabled to make good fight. Lord Howe with such of his ships as he could collect bore away to New York to refit, and the French admiral was now before Newport, but <b>in</b> <b>no</b> plight or <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> fighting.|$|R
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{the entry}} of James I into London in 1604 was the last until the Restoration of his {{grandson}} in 1660, after the English Civil War. [...] The court of Charles I intensified the scale of private masques and other entertainments, but the cities, increasingly {{at odds with the}} monarchy, would no longer play along. [...] The Duchy of Lorraine, a great centre of all festivities, was swallowed up in the Thirty Years War, which left much of Northern and Central Europe <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> or condition <b>for</b> celebrations on the old scale. [...] In France the concentration of power in royal hands, begun by Richelieu, left city elites distrustful of the monarchy, and once Louis XIV succeeded to the throne, royal progresses stopped completely for over fifty years; in their place Louis staged his elaborate court fêtes, redolent of cultural propaganda, which were memorialised in sumptupously illustrated volumes that the Cabinet du Roi placed in all the right hands.|$|R

60|$|After this {{conversation}} Cummings was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> sleep, and he refrained from awakening Jake.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} him but did not answer, for {{to tell the truth}} I felt <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> argument.|$|E

The assassinations of both Henry III and Henry IV of France, of William the Silent and other prominent figures, and the spread of guns, made rulers more cautious about appearing in slow-moving processions planned and publicised long in advance; at grand occasions for fireworks and illuminations, rulers now characteristically did no more than show themselves at a ceremonial window or balcony. The visit of Louis XVI to inspect the naval harbour works at Cherbourg in 1786 seems, amazingly, to have been the first French entry of a King designed as a public event since the early years of Louis XIV well over a century before. Though considered a great success, this was certainly too little and too late to avoid the catastrophe awaiting the French monarchy.|$|R
60|$|McCay was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to {{subscribe}} to this stony-hearted view.|$|R
60|$|John was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> {{to supply}} them. His {{patience}} was exhausted.|$|R
60|$|Alan, who was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> long explanations, {{answered}} {{that he had}} kept him with them because he might be useful.|$|E
60|$|The Frenchman grew {{pale and}} {{something}} like a shiver passed over him. He saw that James Morris was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> trifling.|$|E
60|$|Being <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> {{companionship}} Clement stood {{aside from}} it all, thinking how far above all this life his beautiful bride was.|$|E
60|$|Spennie was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> {{to listen}} to the love affairs of other men.|$|R
60|$|But Maraquita was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to {{be driven}} out of her humour, even by her lover.|$|R
60|$|Weston was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> {{to discuss}} {{questions}} of that kind, though the curious sensation was not altogether unfamiliar to him.|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> laughter, but {{his eyes}} twinkled faintly. [...] "Two of them? You have been getting on tolerably fast down there, Harry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now it's nearly dinner-time, you say? All right. I am <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> dinner, but I {{suppose you}} had better lay out the clothes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, we'll see. Just for {{the present}} I'm <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to quarrel with you, and you'd better not quarrel with me, Jason Jones. Good-bye." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{followed}} another growl {{which the}} Colonel tried to beat down. The mess was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> just then to weigh insults to Russian colonels.|$|R
50|$|The {{offensive}} ends {{in failure}} for the Axis, but the Partisans are <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to celebrate — they have suffered devastating losses. Still, on they march.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] said Benita, who was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> {{philosophical}} argument. [...] "Perhaps {{also one}} day {{you will see a}} spirit, Mr. Meyer, and think otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I'll come. Wait {{for me in}} the garden, Jean." [...] And Coventry hurried away, <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> the {{interview}} but anxious to have it over.|$|E
60|$|But it {{was clear}} she was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> Teddys. He {{realized}} that he was committed to the path across the fields, an uninteresting walk at the best of times.|$|E
60|$|But Her Grace was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to pander to girlish sentimentality just now. Her {{small round}} eyes, usually alive with good-nature and kindliness, were looking {{positively}} stern.|$|R
60|$|Rosebud, (for {{thus was}} it misnamed), seemed to be, however, <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to receive attentions that morning. It was evidently ill at ease, without {{apparently}} knowing why.|$|R
25|$|During this interview, Talaat {{maintained}} {{on several}} occasions that the CUP had always sought British friendship and advice; but Britain was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to offer any assistance whatsoever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, your highness. The more ignorant the better. The {{multitude}} of images distracts them not. But I am <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> serious discourse; {{let me tell}} you a story." ...|$|E
60|$|Although Jethro was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> mirth, {{he laughed}} {{in spite of}} himself, for he was an American. His lifelong habit would have made him defend Heth to any one but Cynthia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you {{had better}} stop that talk, and come to business. I am <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> this sort of thing, Edith," [...] and he turned round, shut the window, and drew the blind.|$|E
6000|$|Now Christopher made {{as though}} he would push on, <b>for</b> he was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to chat with cattle-reeves. But Emlyn, who had been eyeing the man, called out-- ...|$|R
60|$|They {{were not}} {{properly}} taken. Harold was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> of repentance, and the consciousness {{that he had}} been behaving most unkindly, only made him more rough and self-justifying.|$|R
