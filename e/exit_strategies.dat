40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are to use a birandom {{variable}} to denote the stock return selected by some recurring technical patterns and to study the effect of <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> on optimal portfolio selection with birandom returns. Firstly, we propose a new method to estimate the stock return and use birandom distribution to denote the final stock return which can reflect the features of technical patterns and investors' heterogeneity simultaneously; secondly, we build a birandom safety-first model and design a hybrid intelligent algorithm to help investors make decisions; finally, we innovatively study the effect of <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> on the given birandom safety-first model. The results indicate that (1) the <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> affects the proportion of portfolio, (2) the performance of taking the <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> is better than when the <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> is not taken, if the stop-loss point and the stop-profit point are appropriately set, and (3) the investor using the <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> become conservative...|$|R
