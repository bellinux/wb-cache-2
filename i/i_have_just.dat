5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.|$|E
25|$|Eureka, Eureka. Never have I {{had so much}} {{satisfaction}} as at this moment, when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> explained rigorously, by {{the simple}} law of rectilinear motion, those of universal gravitation, which decreases in the same proportion as the squares of the distance increase.|$|E

25|$|I am {{very fond}} of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band {{is in full swing}} at the time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> mentioned. If {{everyone}} has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. One thing is certain and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E
500|$|... and Mohammed {{arranged}} {{to empty the}} flat and when my brother asked where his mother's furniture had gone to, {{she said it was}} on a boat to Tunisia where {{it was going to be}} sold. My brother was distraught. This was cruel emotional blackmail. In fact, the furniture was in storage in Cannes, but my brother never knew that. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> managed to get hold of the key.|$|E

6000|$|... "Listen, commandant," [...] I said, and, {{speaking}} in a low voice, {{so as not to}} be overheard, I told him every word that had passed in the interviews <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> with Dingaan, with Thomas Halstead, and with Pereira.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{did not do}} {{well the}} last time because then I was young {{and did not have}} the experience. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> made it to the senior level and {{qualified}} for the Olympics. Now I have the experience. I have won medals at major tournaments like the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. Recently, I also beat the 2004 Olympic Games gold medallist [...] Artayev , so I have done quite well at the international level. So, definitely, everyone can expect a good showing from me in Beijing." ...|$|E
500|$|A fifth {{movie was}} written, {{and may have}} been produced, but it was never released. Frankie Thomas {{believes}} that he and Granville made five films, not four, and in August 1939 Harriet Adams wrote to Mildred Benson, [...] "three have been shown in this area, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> heard that a fifth is in production." [...] The cancellation of the series was a result of Bonita Granville and Glenda Farrell both leaving the studio (Granville going to MGM and Farrell returning to the stage), Warner Bros. deciding to discontinue both series after the final Torchy Blane film (with Jane Wyman replacing Farrell) flopped, and the onset of World War II.|$|E
500|$|Wee and Morse {{replicated}} [...] "people juggling" [...] for the semi-finals on August 2, 2006, {{winning over}} {{the audience and}} Hasselhoff ("I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> gotten out of 'I Hate Jugglers Anonymous'. I thought that was fantastic!"). One of ten acts to return for the finals two weeks later, The Passing Zone brought Hasselhoff to the stage and, as all three men wore torches atop construction helmets (and with Hasselhoff holding four spinning plates), Wee and Morse passed sickles back and forth around him. Though Morgan thought they had done well, the act finished in the bottom five when {{the results of the}} viewers' vote were announced on August 17, 2006.|$|E

500|$|Copland began {{sketching}} {{the work}} early in 1961. To gain composing time, he cancelled his 1962 trip to Tanglewood {{and determined to}} stay at home the entire year. Even so, he accepted an invitation to revisit Japan early in 1962 for a United States State Department conference and combined the trip with conducting engagements in Seattle and Vancouver. By June 25, Copland wrote to Mexican composer Cesar Chavez, [...] "I am working day and night on my symphony for the Philharmonic commission. It is in three movements and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> finished the last, the first being more than half done." [...] Copland then went to Mexico at Chavez's invitation, partly to conduct but mainly to compose. From there, he wrote American composer Leo Smit on July 4 that he was not yet finished and was having trouble finding a title for the new work. He completed the piece in September 1962, just in time for orchestra rehearsals.|$|E
500|$|At 10:37, CNN {{correspondent}} Aaron Brown, {{covering the}} collapse of the World Trade Center, announced, [...] "We are getting reports and we are getting lots of reports and we want to be careful to tell you when we have confirmed them and not, but we have a report that a 747 is down in Pennsylvania, and that remains unconfirmed at this point." [...] He followed that up at 10:49 by reporting that, [...] "We have a report now that a large plane crashed this morning, north of the Somerset County Airport, which is in western Pennsylvania, not too terribly far from Pittsburgh, about 80 miles or so, a Boeing 767 jet. Don't know whose airline it was, whose airplane it was, and we don't have any details beyond that which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> given you." [...] In the confusion, he also erroneously reported a second hijacked plane heading for the Pentagon after the crash of the first.|$|E
500|$|The {{passage of}} the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, {{made it clear that}} the UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States' atomic research. This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. On 8 January 1947, Attlee formed a secret Gen 163 Cabinet committee, consisting of six cabinet ministers, which decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its position in world politics. In the words of the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, [...] "That won't do at all... we've got to have this... I don't mind for myself, but I don't want any other Foreign Secretary of this country to be talked to or at by a Secretary of State in the United States as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> had in my discussions with Mr Byrnes. We've got to have this thing over here whatever it costs... We've got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Kouao {{was arrested}} {{on the day that}} Climbié died, and Manning the {{following}} day. Kouao told police, [...] "It is terrible, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> lost my child". On 20 November 2000, at the Old Bailey, the trial into her death opened, where Kouao and Manning were charged with child cruelty and murder. Kouao denied all charges, and Manning pleaded guilty to charges of cruelty and manslaughter. The judge described the people in Climbié's case as [...] "blindingly incompetent". In his diary, Manning described Climbié as Satan, and said that no matter how hard he hit her, she did not cry or show signs that she was hurt. On 12 January 2001, both were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The judge said to them, [...] "what Victoria endured was truly unimaginable. She died at both your hands, a lonely drawn out death". Kouao went to Durham prison and Manning went to Wakefield prison.|$|E
500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can go with this role. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E
2500|$|... "To {{those still}} holding a clenched fist <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> one word to say: Enough. Enough war. Enough destruction. Enough hatred. Now {{is the time}} for change," [...] said Peres. Israel is {{prepared}} today to bring peace closer. Today." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you tell}} me what there is in the letter?" [...] he asked--passing, as you see, entirely over what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> said to him.|$|R

2500|$|To Whom It May Concern: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> {{taken my}} mother's life. I am very upset over having done it. However, I {{feel that if}} there is a heaven she is {{definitely}} there now [...] I am truly sorry [...] Let there be no doubt in your mind that I loved this woman with all my heart.|$|E
2500|$|This urn is hollow, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> said, usually full of soft, clear water, {{and then}} closed. It opens {{during the day}} and more than half the liquid disappears, but this loss is {{repaired}} during the night, and the next day the urn is full again and closed by its lid. This is its sustenance, and enough for more than one day because it is always about half-full at the approach of night.|$|E
