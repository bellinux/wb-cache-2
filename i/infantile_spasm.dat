40|$|<b>Infantile</b> <b>spasm</b> is an age-related {{refractory}} epilepsy. Topira-mate {{is a new}} anticonvulsant {{with multiple}} mechanisms of action, {{and it may be}} effective for treating pediatric epilepsies. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of first-line topiramate treatment for <b>infantile</b> <b>spasm,</b> 20 patients received topiramate monotherapy during this study. They were treated with an initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day, with a progressive titration of 1 mg/kg a week until their spasms were controlled and a maxi-mum dose of 12 mg/kg/day was achieved. The evaluation of the treatment efficacy was based on the spasm frequency data that was obtained by the scalp and video-EEG, and by the parental count of spasm. Thirty percent of the subjects became spasm-free during the study. Six of 20 subjects (30 %) had cessation of spasm and disappearance of hypsarrhythmia as seen via the video EEG; four (50 %) of eight idiopathic patients had a response, whereas two (17 %) of 12 patients with symp-tomatic <b>infantile</b> <b>spasm</b> responded.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a cohort of Chinese children with tuberous sclerosis complex to determine the relationship between age, sex, mental retardation, autism, epilepsy, <b>infantile</b> <b>spasm,</b> and early age at onset of seizures and the numbers and locations of tubers detected. We searched our tuberous sclerosis registry, established in 1985 (N = 44), and performed an analysis of children who had MRIs of the brain performed (n = 22). A neuroradiologist blinded to the clinical findings scored the MRIs according to the total number and site of the tubers. The following factors were analyzed: age, sex, presence of autism (n = 7), presence (n = 19) and severity of mental retardation (mild [n = 12], moderate to severe [n = 7]), presence of epilepsy (n = 21) or <b>infantile</b> <b>spasm</b> (n = 8), and age at onset of seizures less than 1 year (n = 10). There was no significant relationship between the number and site of tubers and the following factors: sex, autism, mental retardation, degree of mental retardation, epilepsy, history of <b>infantile</b> <b>spasm,</b> or age at onset of seizures less than 1 year. Only the presence of cortical tubers in the parietal regions had a significant relationship {{with the history of}} <b>infantile</b> <b>spasm</b> (P =. 012). Using multiple regression analysis of all of the risk factors, only age is related to the number of tubers in the MRI (P =. 047), and a history of <b>infantile</b> <b>spasm</b> is related to the presence of tubers in the parietal (P =. 009) and occipital (P =. 031) lobes. The associated comorbidities in tuberous sclerosis complex might be explained by more complex underlying genetic or pathologic issues rather than purely by the site of the cortical tubers. We suggest that a developmental approach, by analyzing the age at the appearance of tubers in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases with the development of other neuropsychiatric comorbidities, should be undertaken to assess the causal relationship. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Infantile spasms is an {{age-specific}} epileptic syndrome {{associated with}} poor developmental outcomes and poor response to nearly all traditional antiepileptic drugs except adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). We investigated the protective mechanism of ACTH against brain damage. An <b>infantile</b> <b>spasm</b> rat model induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in neonate rats was used. Pregnant rats were randomly divided into the stress-exposed and the non-stress exposed groups, and their offspring were randomly divided into ACTH-treated spasm model, untreated spasm model, and control groups. A proteomics-based approach {{was used to}} detect the proteome differences between ACTH-treated and untreated groups. Gel image analysis was followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric protein identification and bioinformatics analysis. Prenatal stress exposure resulted in more severe seizures, and ACTH treatment reduced and delayed the onset of seizures. The most significantly up-regulated proteins included isoform 1 of tubulin b- 5 chain, cofilin- 1 (CFL 1), synaptosomal-associated protein 25, malate dehydrogenase, N(G),N(G) -dimethylarginine dimethy-laminohydrolase 1, annexin A 3 (ANXA 3), and rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1 (ARHGDIA).

Foram estudados 120 pacientes, 71 do sexo masculino e 49 do sexo feminino, que apresentaram eletrencefalograma com as características de hipsarritmia. A maioria (39 %) teve o seu eletrencefalograma realizado com a idade de 10 meses 3 anos e a primeira crise convusiva foi registrada predominantemente nos 4 primeiros meses de vida (54 %). Em 56 % dos pacientes foi assinalada, pela anamnese, mais de um tipo de crise convulsiva, sendo a associação mais freqüente a de espasmo infantil e crise convulsiva motora generalizada. Em 44 % dos pacientes foi registrado apenas um tipo de crise convulsiva, sendo o espasmo infantil o mais freqüente. Dezoito pacientes (16 %) não apresentaram espasmo infantil. As alterações eletrencefalográficas foram as mais diversas. O aspecto de hipsarritmia assimétrica foi assinalado em 22 % e a fragmentação em 11 % dos casos.

40|$|Background To {{evaluate}} the predominant pattern of brain injury and the anatomic areas of injury {{in children with}} <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Methods A nested case-control study of <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> in children with term neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was performed. All patients had T 1 /T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging performed {{on the third day}} of life. Using a validated scoring system, the magnetic resonance imaging was classified as: normal, watershed, basal ganglia/thalamus, total, or focal-multifocal. Two study investigators scored additional anatomic areas of injury (cortical extent, levels of the brainstem, hypothalamus) on T 1 /T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging blinded to the outcome. The predominant pattern of brain injury and anatomic areas of injury were compared between patients who developed <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> and randomly selected controls. Results Eight patients who developed <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> were identified among a cohort of 176 term newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (4. 5 %). There {{were no significant differences in}} the perinatal and neonatal course between newborns who developed <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> and controls who did not. The development of <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> aft er neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was significantly associated with basal ganglia/thalamus and total brain injury (P = 0. 001), extent of cortical injury greater than 50 % (odds ratio = 11. 7, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 1 - 158. 5, P = 0. 01), injury to the midbrain (odds ratio = 13, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 3 - 172, P = 0. 007) and hypothalamic abnormalities (P = 0. 01). Conclusions The development of <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> after hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is associated with injury to the basal ganglia and thalami on neonatal magnetic resonance imaging, particularly when extensive cortical injury and/or injury to the midbrain is present. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Tuberous {{sclerosis}} {{complex is}} a genetic disorder resulting in epilepsy and mental retardation. Vigabatrin has shown efficacy {{in the treatment}} of <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> caused by tuberous sclerosis complex, but its effects on focal seizures caused by tuberous sclerosis complex have not been determined. We compared the efficacy of vigabatrin in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex–induced focal seizures and <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> and assessed the mental outcomes in both groups. We retrospectively evaluated 31 children with tuberous sclerosis complex and epilepsy, who were treated with vigabatrin in a single tertiary center in Seoul, Korea. Vigabatrin treatment resulted in spasms cessation in 16 of 18 (88. 9 %) patients with <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms,</b> whereas 6 of 13 (46. 2 %) patients with focal seizures became seizure free. Initial response to vigabatrin had no effect on intellectual disability. Vigabatrin was highly effective in eliminating <b>infantile</b> <b>spasms</b> caused by tuberous sclerosis complex but was less effective in patients with focal seizures...|$|R
