5|$|However, slaves did {{belong to}} their master's household. A newly-bought slave {{was welcomed with}} nuts and fruits, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> a newly-wed wife. Slaves took part {{in most of the}} civic and family cults; they were {{expressly}} invited to join the banquet of the Choes, second day of the Anthesteria, and were allowed initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries. A slave could claim asylum in a temple or at an altar, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> a free man. The slaves shared the gods of their masters and could keep their own religious customs if any.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space).

5|$|In August 2014, the Conservation Authority of Borobudur {{reported}} some severe abrasion of {{the stone}} stairs caused by the scraping of visitors' footwear.

5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that Japanese people do indeed have warm feelings towards themselves, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Americans and Europeans, but that these feelings are masked when explicitly asked for.

5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms or groups, resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the civil}} {{conflict}} came a small lull in fighting between the expanding Ottomans and Byzantines. In 1361 Didymoteichon fell to the Turks. Orhan's successor, Murad I was more concerned with his Anatolian positions. However, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Alp Arslan of the Seljuk Turks, Murad I left the taking of Byzantine territory to his vassals with Philippopolis falling after major campaigning between 1363–4 and Adrianople succumbing to the Ottomans in 1369.|$|E
5|$|Gideon the Cat, Honest John's mute, crafty, and {{anthropomorphic}} feline sidekick.

5|$|In another work of Shakespeare, Othello (1603), it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that he has made another reference.

The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> his previously written poem, Venus and Adonis, did.|$|E
