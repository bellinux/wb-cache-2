5|$|Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several {{variants}} of the Panzer I were designed, <b>especially</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> later {{years of its}} combat history.

One of the best-known variants was the kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen ("small armoured command vehicle"), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B chassis was also used to build the German Army's first tracked tank destroyer, the Panzerjäger I. This vehicle was armed with a Czech 47-millimeter (1.85in) anti-tank gun.|$|E
