50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>weights</b> are {{recommended}} over machine weights {{for almost all}} athletes. When one uses <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> (barbells, dumbbells, medicine balls, rubber tubing, etc.), the resistance can be moved in a manner more suited to the sports skill’s intramuscular pattern. With <b>free</b> <b>weights,</b> the athlete must guide and control the movement throughout the execution. In the process, balance and stability are developed because the entire body participates in every exercise, especially when relatively heavy weights are used.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} importance of the ideal female body and gender stereotypes amongst a group of female <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> users in a fitness facility in Scotland. Utilising principles of ethnography, information was initially gathered through working as a participant-as-observer to identify different female <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> users within the facility. From this, as well as using a gatekeeper and snowball sampling, twenty women took part in one-to-one interviews. Different groups of women were interviewed including: those training in the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas to aid their sporting performance, for health or aesthetic reasons and those preparing for physique competitions. Interviews focused on the women’s use of the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas, perceptions of their own bodies and their opinions on the ideal female body as well as their interpretations of the concepts femininity, masculinity and muscularity. The unique narrative of each woman was critically analysed with reference to social construction feminism. Whilst interviews were the main data collection technique for this research, participant observation and informal conversations within the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas also informed the findings of this study. The motivations behind women taking part in weight training are presented. Interviewees’ definitions of the ideal female body are explored and the significance of this body is discussed. Factors influencing the women’s definitions of the ideal body are also examined. The impact of social media on participants’ use of the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas is analysed. The women’s perceptions of the terms masculinity, femininity and muscularity are considered alongside how these perceptions affected their training within the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas...|$|R

40|$|Weightlifting {{machines}} {{are designed to}} reduce the risk of injury to their users; however, they are less effective at developing strength gains than <b>free</b> <b>weights.</b> <b>Free</b> <b>weights</b> allow the user to incorporate more muscle groups than machine weights, which results in faster muscle growth. However, the risk of injury due to the use of <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> is greater than that of machine weights. Fig. 1 shows the operation of the Automatic Bench Press Spotter (ABPS). Bench pressing is one of the most popular free-weight exercises, but this exercise often requires a spotter to be present to ensure the safety of the weightlifter...|$|R

50|$|An {{isolation}} {{exercise is}} one where the movement is restricted to one joint only. For example, the leg extension is an isolation exercise for the quadriceps. Specialized types of equipment are used to ensure that other muscle groups are only minimally involved—they just help the individual maintain a stable posture—and movement occurs only around the knee joint. Most isolation exercises involve machines rather than dumbbells and barbells (<b>free</b> <b>weights),</b> though <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> can be used when combined with special positions and joint bracing.|$|R
30|$|To {{the best}} of the authors’ knowledge, though some {{frequency}} domain methods, such as the spectral decomposition theory and semi-group theory, are applied to investigate the stability of neutral systems, they are not as popular as Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF). Through LKF approach, many stability criteria have been proposed (see [11 – 13]). Recently, LMIs and <b>free</b> <b>weighting</b> matrices have been widely used in LKF for the stability of neutral systems (see [14 – 16]). For example, by constructing a new LKF with <b>free</b> <b>weighting</b> matrices, stability criteria for uncertain neutral systems were investigated in [11]. Moreover, <b>free</b> <b>weighting</b> matrices and model transformations were both employed in [14] for cross terms. Then a less conservative stability criterion based on LMIs was derived for stochastic neutral systems. However, control design based on these stability criteria is usually the state feedback, which is delay-independent or delay-dependent.|$|R
