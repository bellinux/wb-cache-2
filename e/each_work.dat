5|$|In an 1878 {{article that}} Ohly called ‘epoch-making,’ Charles Graux {{proved that the}} numerals {{at the end of}} the medieval manuscripts were {{proportional}} to the length of <b>each</b> <b>work</b> and in fact gave the total number of a fixed unit equal to a Homeric line. This discovery established the concept of the standard line.|$|E
5|$|Stichometry {{existed for}} several reasons. Scribes were {{paid by the}} line and their fee per line was {{sometimes}} fixed by legal decree. Authors occasionally cited passages {{in the works of}} other authors by giving their approximate line number. Book buyers used total line counts to check that copied texts were complete. Library catalogs listed the total number of lines in <b>each</b> <b>work</b> along with the title and author.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in <b>each</b> <b>work,</b> color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E

5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of <b>each</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|None of Monteverdi's {{music for}} Andromeda has survived. The {{libretto}} was also {{thought to have}} been lost, until its rediscovery in 1984. As was customary in Monteverdi's time, the manuscript makes no mention of the composer's name—librettos were often the subject of numerous settings by different composers. The libretto's frontispiece confirms that Andromeda was performed during Mantua's Carnival, 1–3 March 1620. An analysis of its contents reveals some influence from Rinuccini's libretto for Arianna, such as use of identical metre and length in the prologues of <b>each</b> <b>work,</b> and several common characters in the respective cast lists. The document remains in private hands and has not been published.|$|E

5|$|Segments {{are further}} divided into work areas, {{indicated}} by brackets {{in the list}} above. Work {{is scheduled to begin}} in Segments 2 and 4 and proceed from north to south within each segment before moving on to Segments 1 and 3. The first work area will be in the cities of South San Francisco and San Bruno. Within <b>each</b> <b>work</b> area, the first activity will be tree pruning and removal (scheduled duration, two months) followed by construction of the foundations for the overhead contact system poles (scheduled duration, three to five months). Once the foundations are complete, construction of the traction power substation (estimated at twelve months in duration) and pole and wire installation (estimated at three months) will work in parallel. Schedules have been announced for Segment 2, Work Areas 5 (South City/San Bruno), 4 (Millbrae/Burlingame), and 3 (San Mateo). Traction power substations have been confirmed for South San Francisco and Burlingame, with another traction power substation in the city of San Mateo at a site yet to be named.|$|E

5000|$|In the CONA database, <b>each</b> <b>work's</b> record (also {{called a}} {{subject in the}} database, not to be {{confused}} with iconographical depicted subjects of art works) is identified by a unique numeric ID.

25|$|While the Gregorian {{calendar}} {{was implemented}} in Soviet Russia in February 1918 by dropping the Julian dates of 1–13 February 1918 pursuant to a Sovnarkom decree, the Soviet calendar added five- and six-day work weeks between 1929 and 1940. Although the traditional seven-day week was still recognized, {{a day of}} rest on Sunday was replaced by one day of rest in <b>each</b> <b>work</b> week.

25|$|The {{two main}} commentaries on the Mishnah are the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud.
