Severe exercise increased cardiac output from 101 to 478 ml/kg per min, heart rate from 95 to 297 beats/min, stroke volume from 31 to 44 ml, left ventricular isolength (iso) systolic pressure from 120 to 186 mm Hg, left ventricular end diastolic pressure from 6 to 18 mm Hg, and left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>diameter</b> from 58. 9 to 60. 1 mm, while <b>end</b> systolic <b>diameter</b> decreased from 53. 0 to 52. 2 mm. Two indices of myocardial contractility, (dP/dt) /P increased from 37 to 92 sec− 1, while dD/dt, the velocity of myocardial fiber shortening at isolength, rose from 54 to 119 mm/sec. All of these changes were statistically significant.

The size and shape of the PDAs were evaluated by performing angiograms, and the PDA size and the AVP devices size were compared. &# 38;amp&# 59;lt&# 59;br&# 38;amp&# 59;gt&# 59;Results: The mean age of the patients was 54. 9 ± 45. 7 months old. The PDAs were of type C (n&# 61; 5), type D (n&# 61; 12) and type E (n&# 61; 3). The mean pulmonary <b>end</b> <b>diameter</b> of the PDA was 1. 7 ± 0. 6 mm, and the aortic <b>end</b> <b>diameter</b> was 3. 6 ± 1. 4 mm. The mean length was 7. 3 ± 1. 8 mm.

Micro nozzles whose exit diameter d= 3 μm are {{mounted on a}} thin metal film. The number of the micro nozzles is from 2. 0 × 10 ^ 4 to 1. 2 × 10 ^ 5. Using an ultrasonic oscillator, gasoline is periodically pushed out from the micro nozzles at a frequency from 62 to 65 kHz.

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were; firstly, to obtain {{economic}} values for radiata pine traits to produce appearance and structural lumber, and secondly {{to analyze the}} selection of efficient logs and profitable trees to substantiate the development of breeding objectives for solid wood quality. The thesis included three approaches to value wood attributes: hedonic models, partial regressions and stochastic frontiers. Hedonic models generated economic values for pruned and unpruned log traits to produce appearance grades. Values for small <b>end</b> <b>diameter</b> were 0. 33, 0. 19 and 0. 10 US $/mm, and for form 2. 6, 1. 4 and 0. 63 US $ for the first, second and third log respectively. The value of mean internode length was 0. 19 US $/cm. Branch size traits were non-significant to explain the log conversion return (p> 0. 05). The economic value of log traits to produce structural lumber with stiffness of 8, 10 and 12 GPa was estimated with a partial regression. The values were 1. 1, 29. 7, 0. 3 and - 0. 4 NZ $/m 3 for small <b>end</b> <b>diameter</b> (cm), stiffness (GPa), basic density (kg/m 3) and largest branch (mm) respectively. Small <b>end</b> <b>diameter</b> and stiffness explained 73 % of the variation of log conversion return. The economic values for structural attributes were also derived from a Cobb Douglas stochastic frontier, resulting in 2. 1 NZ $/cm for small <b>end</b> <b>diameter</b> and 15. 8 NZ $/GPa for stiffness. The change of values between approaches {{can be attributed to}} differences of model formulation. The stochastic frontier used aggregate volume of lumber with stiffness of 8 GPa or higher. The partial regression used the economic value of every lumber product derived from the logs, making it more sensitive to changes in wood quality. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) used structural traits and their economic values to assess the technical and economic efficiency of logs to produce lumber with stiffness of 8, 10 and 12 GPa. The most efficient logs had 1 : 4 ratios between stiffness and small <b>end</b> <b>diameter,</b> whereas logs that did not generate structural lumber had ratios closer to 1 : 8. Trait economic values from the partial regression analysis were used as attribute prices to estimate cost efficiency. Efficiency measures were significantly correlated with stiffness and log conversion return; however, they were non-significantly correlated with small <b>end</b> <b>diameter</b> and log prices. The technical efficiency of logs to produce structural lumber was also determined using a Cobb Douglas stochastic frontier which determined that the most efficient logs were characterized by a 1 : 5 ratio between stiffness and small <b>end</b> <b>diameter.</b> Selection of trees for deployment was analyzed with a portfolio model, where risk was represented as the mean absolute deviation of tree returns due to the variability of volume, stiffness and resin defects. Under high variability (risk), the model selected structural trees with large stiffness and high return. These results suggest an opportunity for narrowing genetic variability (via clonal or family forestry) to make the returns from radiata pine structural grades lumber less risky. As variability decreased the portfolio model opted for trees that produced appearance and structural lumber. These trees had a stabilizing effect on their returns, as there were phenotypic tradeoffs between stiffness and volume under optimistic and pessimistic growing scenarios. These results showed the benefits of product diversification at the tree level...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{model for}} the study of left {{ventricular}} (LV) contractility in a small species was developed using conscious rabbits previously instrumented with a LV catheter and ultrasonic crystals measuring LV internal diameter. Afterload increase produced by methoxamine infusion was associated with a reduction in heart rate from 272 (SEM 18) to 214 (20) beats-mid, p<O.

For matched end systolic pressure and heart rate, the increase in inotropic state produced by noradrenaline infusion significantly shifted the pressure-diameter relation to the left. Similarly, end systolic pressure and diameter were significantly lowered by sodium nitroprusside infusion, with a reflex increase of heart rate; and a decrease in inotropic state produced by verapamil infusion was demonstrated by a significantly larger <b>end</b> systolic <b>diameter</b> for matched <b>end</b> systolic pressure and heart rate.

Based on those tests, {{it was found that the}} geometry of the end of the striker has an effect on the form of the loading wave and the spectral width of the signal of that wave. Reduction of the striker <b>end</b> <b>diameter</b> reduces unwanted oscillations, however, adversely affects the time of strain rate stabilization. It was determined for the assumed test bench configuration that a tensometric measurement system with a bandwidth equal to 50 kHz is sufficient...|$|E

30|$|Measurements {{for both}} {{installations}} {{were taken in}} November and December, after the growing season <b>ended.</b> <b>Diameter</b> at breast height (dbh) was recorded at each measurement. Mensuration data for the plots in Compartments 3 and 12 are provided in Additional files 1 & 2, respectively. Trees that died were identified by having a dbh at one measurement {{but not at the}} subsequent measurement. Trees that were removed by thinning were identified in the dataset so that they could be differentiated from the trees that died. The variable STATUS was created to give a continuous measure of the social status of each tree in the plot. Social status is the relative position of a tree in the height distribution (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe International Co-operative Programme Co-ordinating Centre 2016). Lacking consistent height measurements, STATUS was calculated by dividing the dbh of a tree by the average dbh of all trees in the plot. The variable DENSITY (sph) was calculated as the number of trees in a plot divided by the plot size in hectares.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between cardiac autonomic tone, assessed by baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability, and left ventricular function, arrhythmias on Holter monitoring, and clinical variables in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  DESIGN—A prospective observational study.  PATIENTS— 160 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and preserved sinus rhythm {{in the absence of}} antiarrhythmic drug treatment. Measures of heart rate variability obtained by digital 24  hour Holter recordings included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of the mean of normal RR intervals (SDNN), and the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD). Baroreflex sensitivity testing was performed using the phenylephrine method.  RESULTS—Mean SDNN (SEM) was 112  (46)  ms, and baroreflex sensitivity was 7. 5  (5. 0) ms/mm Hg. SDNN showed a weak correlation with baroreflex sensitivity (r =  0. 19, p <  0. 05) and with left ventricular ejection fraction (r =  0. 29, p <  0. 05). SDNN showed no significant correlation with age (r = − 0. 07), the presence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (r = − 0. 13), or left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>diameter</b> (r = − 0. 07). In addition, baroreflex sensitivity showed no significant correlation with age (r = − 0. 13), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (r = − 0. 08), left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>diameter</b> (r =  0. 09), or ejection fraction (r =  0. 14).  CONCLUSIONS—The weak correlation between baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability suggests that these two indices explore different aspects of cardiac autonomic control in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The weak or absent correlation between baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, and other potential non-invasive risk predictors, including left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular <b>end</b> diastolic <b>diameter,</b> and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring, indicate that these variables may have independent prognostic value in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.    Keywords: cardiomyopathy; baroreflex sensitivity; heart rate variabilit...|$|R
