40|$|Forest {{trees are}} {{commonly}} used for ornamental purposes and are thus frequently encountered in non-forest landscapes where they represent {{an important component of}} the so-called trees outside forests (TOF). Little is known about the role of these trees in the connectivity between forest patches and their potential impact upon forest organisms’ dispersal. We focused on the tree species belonging to genera Pinus, Cedrus and Pseudotsuga, the potential hosts of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa, a common defoliator in the western Mediterranean basin. We carried out an exhaustive inventory of trees in a 22 × 22 km sampling window located in the Beauce region (France) an agricultural territory where landscapes consist of intensively managed open-fields (mainly dedicated to cereal crops). The results showed that host trees suitable for the PPM are much more numerous than expected, and form small patches scattered across the study area. They are mostly ornamental trees planted in populated places such as villages. We conclude that hosts suitable for the PPM are available throughout agricultural landscapes. Various forest pests may benefit from TOF coverage that forms consistent <b>ecological</b> <b>continuities</b> linking forest areas.

40|$|One {{important}} question concerning {{the sustainability of}} local or native populations refers to their interaction with local and global institutions.

The level of ecological and social interaction of local populations, following concepts from ecology, occurs on different scales: for example, from the territories of individual fishermen on the Atlantic Forest coast to organizations of community Extractive Reserves in the Amazon. The scale of organization (individual/family/community) may influence the capacity to deal with institutions. This study analyses how Brazilian native populations, especially caiçaras of the Atlantic Forest coast, and caboclos from the Amazon, have interacted with regional, national and global institutions, concerning environmental demands.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ecological}} {{integrity is}} widely discussed {{as a new}} concept by several ecologists and environmentalists.

Human intervention for its developmental activities results in several environmental changes that enhance some species, ecosystem and ecological processes {{while at the same time}} brings irrecoverable damage to the Planet Earth. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The focus of this paper is to emphasize the organized urban planning at a macro level and the architectural design interventions at the micro level in Vijayawada where eco – sensitivity exists with due consideration to ecological integrity and environmental protection. The <b>ecological</b> dynamics of <b>continuity</b> indicated that hillocks of Vijayawada region are a part of Eastern Ghats. The study is to elaborate that the landscape, eco-patches and its connectivity establishes a unique corridor to strengthen ecological system and as a green corridor to Vijayawada city to fulfill the demands of the city and also to create the ecological patch connectivity to scattered Eastern Ghats especially in the Krishna-Guntur region which connects the Nallamala hills through Kondapalli hill toward Sothern side and to the Papikondalu at the northern side of Eastern Ghats. These corridors may even support environmental conservation and provides rural edge in urban context and functions as lung spaces to ease the heat island effect of urban settlement.

40|$|Ecosystem {{function}} and resilience are compromised when habitats become fragmented due to land-use change. This {{has led to}} national and international conservation strategies aimed at restoring habitat extent and improving functional connectivity (i. e. maintaining dispersal processes). However, biodiversity responses to landscape-scale habitat creation and {{the relative importance of}} spatial and temporal scales is poorly understood, and there is disagreement over which conservation strategies should be prioritised. Addressing these knowledge gaps has been challenging because (1) there can be a significant time lag between habitat creation and biodiversity responses, and (2) many taxa respond to landscape characteristics over large spatial scales. These conditions can be difficult to replicate in a controlled setting but can be simulated using ‘natural’ experiments. Here, we used 160 years of historic post-agricultural woodland creation as a natural experiment to evaluate biodiversity responses to landscape-scale habitat creation. Specifically, we disentangle the direct and indirect relationships between bird abundance and diversity, <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity,</b> patch characteristics and landscape structure, and quantify the relative importance of local and landscape scales. Results suggest that <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> has an indirect effect on total bird species richness through its direct effects on stand structure. However, for functional groups most closely associated with woodland habitats, <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> had little influence. This was probably because woodlands were rapidly colonised by woodland generalists in < 10 years (the minimum patch age), but were on average too young (median 50 years) to be colonised by woodland specialists. Local, patch characteristics were relatively more important than landscape characteristics. We conclude that biodiversity responses to habitat creation are dependent on local and landscape-scale factors that interact across time and space. We also suggest that knowledge gained from studies of habitat fragmentation/loss should be used to inform habitat creation with caution, since the two are not necessarily reciprocal.

40|$|The {{fragmentation}} of habitats has been acknowledged for 30 years {{as one of}} the five main factors of biodiversity loss, in conjunction with pollution, overuse of natural resources, invasive species and climate change. Since then, public environmental policies have strived to restore the connectivity of natural habitats. That is particularly the case for water policy, which has made the <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> of rivers a central element in policy planning, a quality element for monitoring programmes and one of the basic guidelines for river-basin management plans (RBMP). The time has thus come for decisions, with the resulting controversy given that any attempt to modify existing discontinuities impacts our perception of landscapes and various uses of aquatic environments. Given that there is, on average, at least one obstacle for every five kilometres of river in continental France, this issue concerns the entire country, its population and all water managers. That explains why it was necessary to have a single set of standardised procedures for selecting the work to be done on the basis of objective and comparable data. For the <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> of fish, we now have the ICE method presented in this book, which describes obstacles in rivers and assesses the capacity of fish to overcome those obstacles during their upstream migration. The design, development and national deployment of this method required five years of intense, collective {{effort on the part of}} numerous scientists and the Onema local and regional offices. The method is the result of an outstanding multi-disciplinary approach involving both hydraulics and ecology, two disciplines that some people might see as irreconcilable, but that must work together synergistically in the effort to restore environments.

40|$|Scheduled {{to begin}} in 2015, the removal of two dams on the Selune River, Manche (France) {{will be one of}} the largest dam removal and river {{restoration}} projects undertaken in Europe. Dam removal decisions involve a tradeoff of multiple socioeconomic and ecological costs and benefits. Environmental consequences of dam removal may include benefits from restoring more natural flow and sediment regimes but also impacts on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services due to changes in landscape and agricultural dynamics. The aspect of dam removal examined here is the trajectories of vegetation response on lands exposed by dam removal but also on agricultural lands on each side of the valley, from the river up to the plateaus. One challenge associated with this project is to understand how dam removal will influence the logics of farmers’ decisions and the allocation rules of land covers at the landscape level. Indeed, riparian zones are known to serve as conduits for substantial fluxes of materials, species and energy. In addition, riparian zones are connected to semi-natural habitats such as hedgerows, field margins, permanent grasslands facilitating vegetation proliferation and spread overall the landscape. We hypothesized that dam removal by modifying farmer management practices and land use allocation, could influence <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> and thus, vegetation communities in agricultural landscapes. Our methodological design consists in vegetation surveys along transects that run perpendicular to the river and extended to the plateaus, following structural elements constitutive of the <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity.</b> Transects belong to 1 km * 1 km agricultural landscapes centered on the Selune river, from upstream to downstream. The landscapes are selected to represent gradients in landscape heterogeneity and <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity.</b> Vegetation long-term monitoring appears as an innovative and pragmatic way of understanding direct and indirect consequences of dam removal at a range of spatial scales in riparian environments.

40|$|In {{integrated}} {{river basin}} management, measures for reaching the environmental objectives can be evaluated at different scales, {{and according to}} multiple criteria of different nature (e. g. ecological, economic, social). Decision makers, including responsible authorities and stakeholders, follow different interests regarding criteria and scales.

The first assigns more power to the local community, which is a common principle of IWRM. On the other hand, {{the development of an}} overall catchment strategy could potentially make use of synergetic effects of the measures, which fulfils the cost efficiency requirement at the basin scale but compromises local interests.

Furthermore, benefit criteria are partially computed for the whole basin only. Both <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> and nutrient load show upstream-downstream effects in opposite direction.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{aspects of}} the palaeolimnological and palaeomagnetic records from Loch Morar, Highland Region, Scotland. The palaeoecological interpretation of these records is augmented by {{a review of the}} floristic character of the current vegetation. Palaeomagnetic data from a long core display secular variations of declination and inclination for an unknown time interval. The top metre has been compared with records from northwest Europe covering the last 10, 000 years and has been tentatively assigned to that time interval. A preliminary pollen analysis appears to confirm this interpretation. Stabilization of terrain is indicated by declining magnetic susceptibility, coupled with constant sediment accumulation rates during the period represented by the top metre of the sediment core. The fossil diatom record from the same provides an insight into the tophic status of the lake and catchment areas, suggesting significant acidification during the Holocene Period. Iron Oxide deposition suggests a widespread development of waterlogged soils during the same period. A qualitative examination of woodland sites within the catchment area indicates that relict native oak (Quercus petraea x robur) and birch (Betula pubescens ssp. odorata) woodland, referable to the Betuletum Oxaleto-Vaccinetum and Betula-herb noda, survives at several sites around Loch Morar, and that native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. scotica) woodland, referable to a combination of the Pinetum Hylocomieto-Vaccinetum and Pinetum Vaccineto-Callunetum association, occurs on an archipelago in the loch. The presence of Pinus sylvestris var. scotica at this site suggests that the geographical distribution range of this taxon extends farther westwards in mainland Scotland than previously recorded.

A combination of modelling procedures were applied, one derived from the maximum-entropy principle (MaxEnt), the other form graph theory (Conefor Sensinode 2. 2). Results suggest that the use of MaxEnt in combination with the Conefor Sensinode 2. 2, not only overcomes the need to make subjective expert judgments about habitat suitability, but also improves the conceptual performance of the Conefor Sensinode 2. 2 algorithm itself when “least-cost distance” algorithms are not applicable.

In this context, the issue {{is to find out}} solutions allowing hydropower energy to be as “green” and sustainable as possible. Hydropower is obviously not the only source of disturbance in environmental/ecological processes, but it may have an impact by various ways: i) the transport of sediment toward downstream sections is reduced, which may subsequently produce morphological alterations, ii) small and large dams induce physical barriers for upstream and downstream fish migrations, iii) these barriers create upstream reservoirs that can swamp habitats such as spawning grounds, iv) the passage through turbines can injure fish or induce mortality, v) modifications of river discharges and regimes may alter the availability and quality of downstream habitats, vi) chemical and thermal qualities of water can be altered, especially in huge reservoirs, vii) cumulative impacts are observed.

In spite of this context of multiple stressors, physical effects are often solely considered in the ecological assessment of the dam impacts. 2. We studied four reservoir/downstream reach systems differing in levels of sediment contamination in reservoirs. Using assemblages and biotrait (i. e. ecological or biological attribute) responses of macroinvertebrate communities and leaf litter breakdown, we examined the individual effects and potential interactions between sediment contamination and dam presence along the gradient of ecotoxic pressure. 3. Leaf breakdown rates ranged from 0. 0044 degrees per day in the most contaminated reservoir to 0. 0120 degrees per day in the reference reservoir. Comparisons of community trait profiles among reservoirs highlighted a gradient of trait responses to sediment contamination. 4. In the absence of toxic contamination, the dam-induced modifications in biotraits of invertebrate assemblages were not related to a reduction of leaf litter breakdown. Conversely, contaminated sediment in reservoir induced strong functional disturbances (i. e. bioecological shifts and reduction of leaf litter breakdown) downstream of dams. 5. Key biotrait categories positively related to leaf litter breakdown rate have been identified.

40|$|Scheduled {{to begin}} in 2016, the removal of two dams on the Sélune River, Manche (France) {{will be one of}} the largest dam removal and river {{restoration}} projects undertaken in Europe. Expected environmental consequences of dam removal include benefits from restoring more natural flow and sediment regimes but also impacts on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services due to changes in landscape and agricultural dynamics. This can be challenging to discern such shifts while natural ecological and physical processes have been suppressed or altered since the installation of dams in the 1920 s. Long-term analysis is therefore a valuable tool to provide knowledge on how present conditions came about. Here, we focus on the vegetation response to agricultural landscape trajectories over 30 years, at the watershed scale. Because the Sélune river has influenced agricultural land use patterns for decades, we hypothesize that dam removal will modify these patterns through changes in farmers’ decisions. In turn, it will influence <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> and thus, vegetation communities in agricultural landscapes. Our methodological design consists in vegetation surveys in both crops and semi-natural elements (i. e. field margins). Vegetation surveys belong to 10 1 km² landscape samples, contiguous to the Sélune river. Landscapes, distributed from upstream to downstream, are selected to represent a gradient in landscape heterogeneity. Vegetation communities are then compared according to their location from and along the Sélune river. Our approach, combining ecological and agricultural data, provides an innovative way of investigating direct and indirect consequences of dam removal...|$|E
40|$|In the diffuse Adriatic city, {{care for}} {{territorial}} bio-permeability conditions {{needs to be}} rediscovered by looking for planning instruments suitable for reading the evolutionary dynamics of open spaces, and interpreting the urban and territorial transformations that currently seem to occur in random and unpredictable ways. The contemporary city pushes away new localizations, and agricultural/natural areas often become the preferred place not only for production and commerce, but also for new housing and public works. In the chipping away of responsibility, interests, and controls, a similarly fractured landscape is established, in which full and empty, finished and incomplete, used and decommissioned coexist chaotically. Contemporary research asks us to manage the integral complexity of the territory starting from {{the structure of the}} landscape and environmental continuity, without arbitrarily separating things from their growth. In the conclusions of the research, PRIN 2006 - 2008 "Opere pubbliche e città adriatica. Indirizzi per la qualificazione dei progetti urbani e territoriali" (coordinated by Barbieri at the University of Chieti-Pescara), new horizons of sense for environmental networks can be seen, along with ever more directing/ordering axes in the continuous Adriatic city, connective bridges within the system of urban voids that the world of decommissioned industrial areas belongs to, and the grand <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> of the inland areas. Old farms, ex-industrial areas, abandoned agricultural areas, green spaces and paths cut from the urban debris are inserted into a wider "renaturalization" project for the city, outlining new human ecological tracks between territory and society and presenting a new, original proposal for sustainability and new forms of spatiality...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of ecological networks could help reverse {{the effects of}} habitat fragmentation on woodland biodiversity in temperate agricultural landscapes. However, efforts to create networks need to be underpinned by clear evidence of the relative efficacy of local (e. g. improving or expanding existing habitat patches) versus landscape-scale actions (e. g. creating new habitat or corridors in the landscape matrix). Using cluster analyses we synthesised the findings of 104 studies, published between 1990 and 2013 focusing on the responses of woodland vascular plant, vertebrate, cryptogam and invertebrate species to local and landscape variables. Species responses (richness, diversity, occurrence) were strongly influenced by patch area, patch characteristics (e. g. stand structure) and isolation (e. g. distance between habitat patches). Patch characteristics were of overriding importance for all species groups, especially cryptogams. Many studies recording significant species responses to patch characteristics did not record significant responses to patch area and vice versa, suggesting that patch area may sometimes act as a surrogate for patch characteristics (i. e. larger patches being of ‘better quality’). <b>Ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> was important for vascular plants, but assessed {{in only a few}} vertebrate and invertebrate studies. Matrix structure (e. g. presence of corridors) was important for vertebrates, but rarely assessed for other species groups. Actions to develop ecological networks should focus on enhancing the quality and/or size of existing habitat patches and reducing isolation between patches. However, given that very few studies have assessed all local and landscape variables together, further information on the relative impacts of different attributes of ecological networks in temperate agricultural landscapes is urgently needed...|$|E
40|$|Fishways are {{installed}} worldwide to facilitate accessibility to functional habitats {{and to increase}} the <b>ecological</b> <b>continuity</b> of rivers. Their evaluations are increasing, but complete studies in the field with wild individuals are still scarce. In the lower Bocq River (Belgium), a pool type fishway was installed in 2011. A combined passive‐integrated‐transponder‐tag and radio‐telemetry system was designed and installed downstream of the dam and in the fishway to analyse fine‐scale individual fish behaviour. Three fish species (brown trout, European grayling, and barbel) were captured in the river; n = 125 fish were tagged and released downstream of the fishway. Behavioural metrics were proposed and used in order to attain a comprehensive view on {{the efficiency of the}} fishway, including attraction and entrance efficiency, searching and passage delays, and overall and adjusted passage efficiency. The results indicate a major problem in terms of attraction efficiency (48. 9 % for the trout, 20. 5 % for the grayling, and 41. 2 % for the barbel) and time to find the entrance of the fishway (mean 65. 1 hr for the trout and 538. 9 r for the grayling). For fish that succeed to approach the entrance of the fishway, the passage efficiency was 86. 9 % for the trout, 55. 5 % for the grayling, and 7. 1 % for the barbel. The time taken to cross the structure was reasonable for the salmonids (mean < 1. 5 hr for trout and grayling) but very long (21 hr) for the barbel. Our results underline the necessity of a holistic approach to evaluate fishway efficiency using precise comprehensive metrics and hydraulic characterization. Peer reviewe...|$|E
