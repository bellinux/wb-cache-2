A predilection site of infection in all ponies was the tongue. Anti-Trichinella antibodies were detected in all ponies by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a T. spiralis spiralis excretory-secretory antigen. The ponies given 5000 and 25000 infective larvae reacted positively on days 26 and 24 postinfection, respectively, using a criterion of {{greater than or equal}} to 5 X mean optical density readings of preinfection sera as positive. The pony given 1000 larvae did not react positively although antibodies were present as indicated by 3 X to 4 X mean optical density readings of preinfection sera.

40|$|Trichinella, {{formerly}} called trichinae, are nematodes {{that are}} to be found in the meat of domestic and wild animals like domestic pigs, wild boar, foxes and martens. They can cause serious illnesses in humans. Humans become infected through the consumption of raw or inadequately prepared trichinous meat or products produced from it like raw sausage or raw ham. According to the German Meat Hygiene Act (FIHG) all slaughtered animals must, therefore, be tested for Trichinella before they are approved for consumption. In line with a new EU Regulation the Member States may, however, specify regions in which Trichinella tests are not necessary in domestic pigs when the Trichinella risk for the area concerned has been officially recognised as negligible. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has examined from the scientific angle whether Germany or individual federal Laender could qualify for this classification. Over the last forty years there were a few larger outbreaks of trichinosis in Germany. Aside from “imported diseases” these cases exclusively involved pigs that had become infected in free-range farms through eating wild animals carrying Trichinella. The fattening pig stocks are all <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella.</b> However, there are reports of Trichinella being detected in martens, foxes and wild boar. Hence it cannot be ruled out that domestic pigs could become infected with the parasite on free-range farms. This means they could be a source of infection for consumers. According to BfR no “region with negligible Trichinella risks in domestic pigs” should be recognised in Germany. However, from the scientific angle exemptions for fattening pig farms with closed intensive farming could be justifiable...|$|E

40|$|Trichinellosis is an {{important}} parasitic zoonosis that {{is caused by the}} intracellular nematode Trichinella spp [...] Infection of humans occurs through consumption of raw (or undercooked) meat containing infectious larvae. In Europe, meat from pork, horse, and wild boar have been identified as most important sources of Trichinella infections in humans. In Switzerland, both the domestic pig and wild boar population are considered <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella.</b> Conversely, Swiss foxes, lynxs and recently a wolf were found to be infected, the species identified in these animals was always referred to as Trichinella britovi. Although this species rarely infects pork and, compared to Trichinella spiralis, only causes reduced pathogenic effects in humans, the basic presence of Trichinella in Switzerland cannot be neglegted. This fact has gained increasing importance since the responsible authorities in the European Union (EU) are preparing regulations for the official Trichinella-control in meat in order to improve food safety for consumers. These regulations will be implemented {{as a consequence of the}} recent association of east European countries with the EU. This new legislation particularly takes into account, that in the past by far most cases of human trichinellosis in the EU were due to consumption of imported east European meat. Within the framework of the bilateral agreements of Switzerland with the EU, the Swiss veterinary public health authorities will have to comply with the foreseen EU regulations. Although diagnostic methods for the direct demonstation of Trichinella in pork meat are already routine practice in several Swiss abattoirs, the implementation of a meat control program for Trichinella for the entire slaughter pig population of the country would lead to an enormous increase in costs for the administration and will require an increased infrastructure in veterinary services. In order to find a reduced testing format for monitoring Trichinella infections in Swiss pork, an infection risk-oriented survey strategy is currently evaluated. In the present article, this minimized survey strategy is discussed regarding its compatibility with the EU regulations laying down rules for the official control of meat for Trichinella...|$|E
40|$|The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is {{considered}} one of the main reservoir of Trichinella spp. in Europe. As limited information on Trichinella infection in wildlife of Hungary is available, 2116 red foxes, representing more than 3 % of the estimated fox population of the country, were screened to detect Trichinella larvae by a digestion method. Trichinella larvae from the 35 positive foxes were identified by a multiplex PCR as Trichinella britovi (30 isolates, 85. 7 %), Trichinella spiralis (4 isolates, 11. 4 %), and Trichinella pseudospiralis (1 isolate, 2. 9 %). The true mean intensity of T. britovi, T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis larvae in lower forelimb muscles was 23. 6, 3. 5 and 13. 5 larvae/g, respectively. T. spiralis was detected only in the southern and eastern regions. The nonencapsulated T. pseudospiralis was recorded for the first time in Hungary. Although the overall true prevalence of Trichinella infection in foxes was only 1. 8 % (95 % confidence interval, CI = 1. 5 – 2. 1 %), the spatial analysis reveals different risk regions. In the north-eastern counties bordering Slovakia and Ukraine (21 % of the Hungarian territory), the true prevalence of Trichinella infection is significantly higher than that observed in other regions (6. 0 %, CI = 4. 8 – 7. 1 %). In the southern counties bordering Croatia, Serbia and Romania (41 % of the Hungarian territory), the true prevalence of Trichinella infection is moderate (1. 4 %, CI = 1. 0 – 1. 8 %). In the north-western and central counties (38 % of Hungarian territory), the prevalence of Trichinella infection is significantly lower (0. 2 %, CI = 0. 1 – 0. 4 %) than that of the other regions. Based on the statistical analysis and the evaluation of epidemiological data, none of the counties can be considered <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> infection.

40|$|Comparison of parasitological and {{serological}} {{diagnosis of}} trichinosis in swine {{was carried out}} on 36 pigs given 15, 400 infective larvae each by gavage. Circulating eosinophil levels were determined and sera were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-Trichinella antibodies. Two pigs were killed per day from days 15 to 29 postinfection. Muscle was examined by pepsin-digestion and comparable tissue was fed to a rat. Eosinophil counts increased at about day 6 and reached peak levels about day 25 postinfection and returned to approximate preinfection levels about two months postinfection in those pigs still in the study. Infective larvae were recovered from all pigs killed at {{greater than or equal}} to 18 days postinfection. Using the criterion of 5 x mean optical density readings of negative sera as positive, seroconversion occurred between days 19 and 26 postinfection. Use of a lower criterion of 3 x mean optical density readings of negative sera resulted in only three of 30 pigs killed {{greater than or equal to}} 18 days postinfection seroconverting less than or equal to 18 days postinfection, when infective larvae were first recovered in the musculature. In pigs, even in those heavily infected, there is a lag between the period that trichinae in musculature become infective and development of antibodies as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which results in false negative reactions in many animals.

40|$|Historically, pork was {{the most}} {{prominent}} food source which contributed towards the transmission <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> spp. and T. gondii infections. To prevent Trichinella transmission via pork an EU regulation specifies that 1) every pig carcass is systematically sampled and examined for Trichinella and infected carcasses are considered {{unfit for human consumption}} or alternatively, 2) pigs are kept according the specifications of a controlled housing system (CHS). For T. gondii, no regulation exists which prevents transmission via the consumption of pork. Based on historical information in several pig populations, the T. gondii infection prevalence is higher than that <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella.</b> Trichinella spp. and T. gondii transmission towards pigs run partly via a concurrent route, namely, the consumption of (parts of) an infected animal. Due to the partial mutual infection route <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> and T. gondii to pigs a correlation between the two parasitic infestations in these hosts may be expected. In case a correlation is present and T. gondii prevalence is higher as compared to Trichinella spp., the presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> spp. may be correlated to {{the presence or absence of}} T. gondii, respectively. As a consequence, given that the T. gondii prevalence is higher than that <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> spp., the absence of T. gondii may predict the absence <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> spp. The subject of this thesis is to test the applicability of a system which predicts Trichinella absence from the absence of T. gondii. The method is intended as an alternative and/or addition to the present EU Trichinella monitoring and control program. Information from our studies indicate that serological tests can be used to indicate the Trichinella and T. gondii infection status of pigs. However, due to their imperfect test accuracy, use of these serological tests will lead to false interpretation of infection status of the individual animal. Alternatively, the infection status can be qualified on population level. In this approach, the level of confidence that an infected population is qualified as infected increases with each additional tested animal. The correlation between the two parasitic infections in pigs was tested in animals from an endemic area. The results show that there is an association between the two parasitic infections in the studied pigs. Because the samples of animals used within this study were preselected from farms with Trichinella cases, the sampling method may have been biased. From the study it remains unclear whether the infections are always correlated. Assuming that in CHS populations the transmission of both parasites are not correlated, the probability <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> absence is equal in T. gondii infected and non‑infected animals. Assuming that the transmission of both parasites are correlated, the probability <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> absence is higher in the T. gondii uninfected animals.

F) Is nitric oxide a component in parasite killing and are there differences in nitric oxide production in host mice when the two species <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> are compared? My research has shown that there are significant differences in the parasitic strategies and pathological consequences in mice infected with one or the other of the two species <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella.</b> The two species appear to generate different immune and inflammatory responses from the host. Trichinella pseudospiralis is much less damaging to the host, generates a very different peripheral blood response, stimulates the production of substantially greater levels of serum cortisol, generates a significantly different profile in cytokine production presents a very different cell surface antigen profile and does not produce a collagen nurse cell or generate an angiogenic response when compared to T spiralis. In addition, I have shown a role for nitric oxide in parasite killing and a role for serum cortisol in larval survival. I have also shown that cortisol has no role in either collagen deposition or the angiogenic response in Balb/c mice under the experimental conditions detailed here...|$|R
40|$|Parasitic worms <b>of</b> {{the genus}} <b>Trichinella</b> (phylum Nematoda; class Enoplea) {{represent}} {{a complex of}} at least twelve taxa that infect a range of different host animals, including humans, around the world. They are foodborne, intracellular nematodes, and their life cycles differ substantially from those of other nematodes. The recent characterization of the genomes and transcriptomes of all twelve recognized taxa <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> now allows, for the first time, detailed studies of their molecular biology. In the present study, we defined, curated, and compared the protein kinase complements (kinomes) <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> spiralis and T. pseudospiralis using an integrated bioinformatic workflow employing transcriptomic and genomic data sets. We examined how variation in the kinome might link to unique aspects <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> morphology, biology, and evolution. Furthermore, we utilized in silico structural modeling to discover and characterize a novel, MOS-like kinase with an unusual, previously undescribed N-terminal domain. Taken together, the present findings {{provide a basis for}} comparative investigations of nematode kinomes, and might facilitate the identification of Enoplea-specific intervention and diagnostic targets. Importantly, the in silico modeling approach assessed here provides an exciting prospect of being able to identify and classify currently unknown (orphan) kinases, as a foundation for their subsequent structural and functional investigation.

40|$|Abstract. Trichinellosis is a food-borne {{parasitic}} zoonosis with {{a yearly}} incidence of about 10, 000 clinical cases worldwide. It {{is one of}} the most serious zoonotic diseases in Romania with more than 28, 000 human cases reported over the last 25 years. Trichinella species and genotypes are present on all continents, from the tropical regions to the cold ones. Up to date, there have been identified four Trichinella species in Europe: T. spiralis, T. nativa, T. britovi and T. pseudospiralis. In order to identify a genetic variability in ecologically distinct species <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella,</b> which may lead to a potential geographical disposition <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> isolates, we test the variability of nine nuclear microsatellite loci, in a small population <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> isolates <b>of</b> Romania. As a result, we obtained a positive amplification for most of the microsatellites studied for Trichinella strains belonging to different species (T. spiralis, T. britovi). We noticed a size-difference between the amplicons generated by the DNA <b>of</b> various <b>Trichinella</b> species (T. spiralis vs T. britovi). We identify a genetic variability inside the same Trichinella population (T. spiralis), differentiating 3 strains (7. 97, 7. 42, 7. 29) by 2 microsatellites (TP 43, TP 32). For a more detailed analysis of the differences obtained in this study, we plan to use the fluorescently (6 -FAM) marked primers, for sequencing and genotyping of the amplification products...|$|R
40|$|Trichinellosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease {{caused by a}} nematode belonging to the genus Trichinella. Numerous mammal species as well as birds and crocodiles can harbour the parasite worldwide, but the wild cycle is mainly maintained by wild carnivores. Human represents only a possible host and the parasite is exclusively transmitted through consumption of undercooked or raw meat. In Italy, pork, wild boar meat and horse meat are the main sources for human infection. This article describe a presence <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> britovi in wild boar in the Marche region regularly slaughtered.

40|$|Parasitic {{nematodes}} <b>of</b> {{the genus}} <b>Trichinella</b> cause significant food-borne illness and occupy a unique evolutionary {{position at the}} base of the phylum Nematoda, unlike the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Although the forthcoming genome sequence <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> spiralis can provide invaluable comparative information about nematode biology, a basic framework for understanding the history <b>of</b> the genus <b>Trichinella</b> is needed to maximize its utility. We therefore developed the first robust and comprehensive analysis of the phylogeny and biogeographic history <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> using the variation in three genes (nuclear small-subunit rDNA, and second internal transcribed spacer, mitochondrial large-subunit rDNA, and cytochrome oxidase I DNA) from all 11 recognized taxa. We conclude that (i) although Trichinellidae may have diverged from their closest extant relatives during the Paleozoic, all contemporary species <b>of</b> <b>Trichinella</b> diversified within the last 20 million years through geographic colonization and pervasive host switching among foraging guilds of obligate carnivores; (ii) mammalian carnivores disseminated encapsulated forms from Eurasia to Africa during the late Miocene and Pliocene, and to the Nearctic across the Bering Land Bridge during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, when crown species ultimately diversified; (iii) the greatest risk to human health is posed by those species retaining an ancestral capacity to parasitize a wide range of hosts; and (iv) early hominids may have first acquired Trichinella on the African savannah several million years before swine domestication as their diets shifted from herbivory to facultative carnivory...|$|R
