40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the role of {{improvisation}} within the screen production process. There is nothing new about improvised acting in film. It has a significant but relatively minor position {{in the history of}} screen drama. The prevalence of improvisation is arguably increasing in an era where the costs of filming are reducing, which previously was a strong disincentive to take the looser, less controlled approach of shooting unscripted dialogue and action. Through looking at the recent production of a film drama where unscripted dialogue was used, it will be argued that approaches that more explicitly engage with concepts of improvisation offer both risks and possibilities for the creative process of screen production. The relevance of the theories of M. M. Bakhtin around the concept of the dialogic will be considered in relation to developing {{a better understanding of the}} qualities that distinguish improvised performances from scripted ones. In this discussion, reference will be made to performance theory and discussions about <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> <b>theatre</b> (Schechner, 1988) and in jazz music (Soules, 2004). The paper will highlight tensions in the screen production process between improvised performances and accepted modes of production, which are often premised on concepts of control developed in the early years of the Hollywood film industry and widely applied throughout the screen production field. The paper will also discuss attempts to more broadly structure a production around the concept of improvisation, which has significant implications for both the way a film is shot and the nature of the story being told...|$|E

The study adopts a qualitative approach using hidden observations to categorize different types of <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> the service encounter.  The improvisation themes discovered within the service encounter were experience, impulsiveness, theatrical, personality and emotionality. All of these are factors that influence improvisation. This study offers original contributions by explaining the fundamentals of <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> the service encounter.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{creative}} process of <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> music with a specific emphasis on investigating its potential for learning. The widespread practice of <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> music is relatively absent from education {{and there is an}} urgent need to more fully understand improvisation's processes. A broad body of knowledge of <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> music has developed within the international community of musicians whose practice is centred on improvisation and an understanding of this knowledge could become highly relevant for a variety of educational contexts. Ten highly experienced, world leading improvisers from Europe and North America took part in semi-structured interviews and were asked the over-arching question: What is the place of <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> your practice? Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was the chosen method for the enquiry. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Since the mid 1990 s <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> {{organizations}} {{has attracted}} increasingly more attention from scholars of organizations, but in Management Learning, articles investigating learning and <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> organizations are absent, even if {{reviews of the}} literature on organizational improvisation suggest close links between the two concepts. Hence, there appears to be room for scholars to pursue empirical studies of connections between <b>improvisation</b> and learning <b>in</b> organizations, and thus, {{the purpose of this article}} is to provide inspiration for production and publication of such studies in Management Learning. First, the article presents a commonly accepted defi nition of improvisation. Thereafter, it looks at connections between <b>improvisation</b> and learning <b>in</b> organizations, and it describes recent empirical research investigating relationships between learning and <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> organizations. It then addresses challenges facing scholars of <b>improvisation</b> and learning <b>in</b> organization, and fi nally, it identifi es interesting organizational contexts for empirical studies of <b>improvisation</b> and learning <b>in</b> organizations.

Drawing from dancers’ own views about the place of <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> their making and performance practice, the discussion will reference work that deliberately incorporates improvisation as a device to blur the boundaries between the ‘fixed’ and the fluid. Moreover, examining the writing about <b>improvisation</b> <b>in</b> relation to the writing through improvisation offers another way of recognising the labile nature of the practice that can never be fully captured in writing alone. In tracing, and recounting these different journeys and artist recollections, I hope to demonstrate that improvisation can be a means to be able to transcend the borders between ‘disabled’ and ‘non-disabled’ in dance...|$|R
