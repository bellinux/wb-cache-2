40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative {{study on the}} starting performance of three phase wound-rotor induction motors under different methods of starting. These methods are on line direct starting, variable rotor resistance starting and <b>double</b> <b>feed</b> starting. In the <b>double</b> <b>feed</b> starting, the rotor winding {{is connected in parallel}} with the stator winding across the supply for a predetermined short period. By this connection, the motor produces an extremely high starting torque. For carrying out the investigations sought, a rigorous state space mathematical model has been developed and simulated.

50|$|A <b>double</b> <b>feed</b> {{occurs when}} an {{expended}} round {{is in the}} chamber AND the slide picks up a second round from the magazine mashing it into the first.

50|$|When {{engaged in}} combat shooting, {{sometimes}} cartridges do not feed {{into the chamber}} properly. These malfunctions must be corrected quickly so that firing can be resumed. There are variations of malfunction drills, including the two most often required in competition: clearing a cartridge that fails to fire, and clearing a <b>double</b> <b>feed</b> malfunction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} a new {{perspective}} on the feeding physiology of whiting, Merlangius merlangus euxinus, N. 1840 was investigated. The effects of the skin of the prey, <b>double</b> <b>feeding</b> and prey type on the gastric emptying rate (GER) of whiting fed on natural prey, namely anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), were investigated. Return of appetite was also studied. It was found that in laboratory conditions, whiting (48. 0 ± 8. 30 g, n= 12) had consumed about 10. 2 % of its body weight in mussels and return of appetite was found to be approximately 30 h. The effect of the skin of the anchovy on the gastric emptying rate (GER) in whiting was found to be significant. Skinned anchovy was emptied from the stomach in 30 h whilst unskinned anchory was emptied in 34 h. It was observed that the effect of the prey type, namely anchovy and mussels, was significant such that the gastric emptying rate of anchovy was 0. 063 g/h whilst that of mussels was found to be 0. 075 g/h. The reason was thought to be due to the different biochemical composition of the prey items used. In the <b>double</b> <b>feeding</b> experiments, {{it was found that the}} mussels given 4 h after the first meal of anchovy, slowed down the emptying process of the first meal. On the other hand, the emptying of the prey items used in <b>double</b> <b>feeding</b> experiments was slower than those used in the single feeding...|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} has {{a simple and}} modest vernacular architecture, with slit windows, that function as ventilators, and waterspouts. It has no inscriptions or symbols to shed further information about its use apart from some roman numbers (i.e. I, II, III) that were inscribed when it was converted to a farmhouse. These are found {{on the walls and}} woods, and record the sale of products (different types of vegetables) of farmers with lack of education. The features of the building are good examples of Maltese traditional architecture that include, roofs built with limestone slabs and animal <b>feeding</b> <b>mangers.</b> Despite the conversion to a farmhouse the building clearly does not resemble to be originally built to be used as such as it is not a traditional Maltese farm building. This and the position of the mangers (feed-trough) prove that the building was built for horses. These characteristics may suggest that the building may have been a cow farm. The high roof of one of the buildings still prove that it was unlikely to be built originally as a cow farm, but it may be speculative to say that at one point it had been so.|$|R

It also has a two finger trigger (or double trigger) for faster firing and less fatigue. It has two stock colors, matte black or matte olive and retails with a detachable stock.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cartridge}} and {{elastic rubber}} protrusion type detents are primarily used for open bolt markers, or on closed bolt markers to prevent <b>double</b> <b>feeding</b> (feeding {{more than one}} ball when the bolt is open for loading). Closed bolt markers generally use the constriction method to prevent [...] "roll outs". A roll out is a frustrating malfunction where the ball completely rolls out of the barrel, causing no paintball to be fired when the trigger is pulled. A partial roll out is when the ball rolls partially through the barrel, causing reduced velocity.|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} {{an electric}} field symmetry in a coupler cavity, {{a very simple}} structure of two-iris coupler cavity was proposed by H. Matsumoto in 1994. MAFIA 3 D code is useful to simulate Slater’s tuning curve method, {{which is used to}} determine the dimensions of the coupler cavity such as iris aperture and cavity diameter. It was find that MAFIA simulation results show that two-iris method will realize a good symmetrical electric field with very simple structure as well as no difficulties for fabrication.

50|$|Mauser went {{two steps}} further in 1892 when he again {{improved}} the bolt design by adding an extractor that prevented <b>double</b> <b>feeding</b> from {{the magazine and}} changed the single column box magazine to a staggered five cartridge box design. The magazine now fit in the rifle without {{any part of it}} protruding in front of the trigger making it less apt to be damaged while still easily and quickly loaded from the five round stripper clips. These improvements were embodied in the Model 1893 (adopted by Spain) and then slight improvements resulted in the 1895/96 model (adopted by Sweden, Mexico, Persia, and the Orange Free State).|$|R

50|$|Additional {{problems}} {{stemmed from}} the Sten's magazine, which was a direct copy of the one used in the German MP-38, originally {{in order to facilitate}} the use of German 9 mm magazines. Unfortunately, this decision necessarily incorporated the Erma magazine's faults in the process. The magazine had two columns of 9 mm cartridges in a staggered arrangement, merging at the top to form a single column. While other staggered magazines, such as the Thompson, fed from both the left and right side alternately (double-column, <b>double</b> <b>feed),</b> the Sten magazine, like the MP38, required the cartridges to gradually merge {{at the top of the}} magazine to form a single column (<b>double</b> column, single <b>feed).</b> As a consequence, any dirt or foreign matter in this taper area could cause feed malfunctions. Additionally, the walls of the magazine lip had to endure the full stresses of the rounds being pushed in by the spring. This, along with rough handling could result in deformation of the magazine lips (which required a precise 8° feed angle to operate), resulting in misfeeding and a failure to fire.|$|R

An experiment {{study of a}} semi-batch reaction crystallization is presented. In a single feed operation, magnesium chloride solution {{is fed to a}} stirred methanol solution mixed with ammonia to crystallize magnesium chloride hexammoniate. The median crystal size of product increases with increasing stirring rate, reaches a maximum, and then decreases again. Decreasing feed rate or decreasing stirring time increases the crystal size significantly. The reaction temperature and concentration of magnesium ion can also influence the crystal size distribution (CSD). A <b>double</b> <b>feed</b> operation can create larger crystal size than that of single feed operation.

There are conflicting reports on whether adding excessive separation stages degrade the column performance. A comparison is made of several designs of single and <b>double</b> <b>feed</b> reactive distillation columns for ETBE production to investigate the effects of separation and reaction stages on the overall performance. The explanations are presented using simulation results, whose mathematical models are written in the Aspen Plus environment. The results confirm that a conservative approach by adding extra separation and reaction stages {{can be applied to}} reactive distillation design. However, output multiplicity may be observed for longer column and should be considered in the early design phase...|$|R

50|$|On 2 February 2013, an XM25 {{exploded}} {{during a}} live-fire training event. The primer and propellant ignited {{as the result}} of a <b>double</b> <b>feed,</b> although safety mechanisms prevented the round’s warhead from detonating. The gun was inoperable after the explosion and the soldier received minor injuries. In response, the Army removed the XM25 from service in Afghanistan. ATK noted that there were nearly 5,900 rounds fired between failures. The misfiring caused the Army to delay the decision to move the XM25 into full-rate production, pending changes to the design of the weapon and ammunition, operating procedures, and training techniques. Testing continued at Aberdeen Proving Ground, where developers incorporated 130 design improvements. Despite the incident, Pentagon budget proposals included $69 million for 1,400 XM25 systems. The Army planned on a total of 10,876 units, two per infantry squad and one per special forces team.|$|R
