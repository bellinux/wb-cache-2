5|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics; many felt {{that while the}} episode <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> theme and {{that much of the}} drama was successful, the humor was too broad or forced. The episode was viewed by 3.44 million viewers and received a 1.8/5 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night, though it was lowest rated episode of The Office at the time of airing.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Archer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British ITV soap opera, Coronation Street, played by Nigel Havers. The character was created and introduced as a love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). Executive producer Kim Crowther revealed the team wanted {{an actor who}} was slightly younger than Audrey and who was very charming. Various actors were considered for the part, but the casting director suggested Havers as {{she knew he was}} a big fan of the show. The actor said he could not turn down a chance to appear in Coronation Street as his character <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> story arc. Havers was contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut as Lewis in the episode broadcast on 18 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|Morton {{interviewed about}} 70 {{people who had}} known Madonna since her youth. He had {{to spend a lot}} of evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to people—including artists, musicians, and directors—who <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> {{perspective}} on Madonna and the world. After its release, Madonna received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who pointed out Morton's poor writing skills and felt that the book did not present anything new about the singer. The book was a commercial disappointment. In the United States, the book reached eight on The New York Times Best Seller list, and sold half of its initial print.|$|E

25|$|The 350-16 <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> bug where, occasionally, {{the machine}} would just freeze entirely {{and not even}} boot up if turned off and on at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS just didn't start. The {{solution}} was {{to turn on the}} machine at the mains and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different PSU.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} {{required}} {{to create a new}} name to sign up to Spinefarm Records. The contract with Shiver records had already been signed under the name of Inearthed. The answer to that problem came as the members looked for good names in their local phone book. When they stumbled upon Lake Bodom, they realized that it was a name with impact and one which <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> story behind it. A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with Children of Bodom. The band's name is derived from the Lake Bodom murders.|$|E
25|$|The show {{also has}} a number of less {{frequently}} appearing characters. Damian's bodyguard, Fyb3roptik, <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> habit of shooting at Damian every time he appeared. This running gag is a fan favorite, hence its continued appearances, but has not happened recently as of Episode 5. Also included is Gunnery Sergeant Spillane, voiced by John Keith, who also writes the show. He has only appeared once, to run the bodyguard competition. Peaches and Sherry, the camera operators, occasionally comment on what is going on, but otherwise have a small role in the show. Clarence, Damian's Guardian Arbiter, appeared in Episode 4, but it was later seen that he was killed by a plasma grenade.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier showed {{at the end}} of the 18th {{century that}} organic {{substances}} consisted of a limited number of elements: primarily carbon and hydrogen and supplemented by oxygen and nitrogen. He went quickly focus on the isolation of these substances, often because they <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> pharmacological activity. Plants were the main source of such compounds, especially alkaloids and glycosides. It was long been known that opium, a sticky mixture of alkaloids (including codeine, morphine, noscapine, thebaine, and papaverine) from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), possessed a narcotic and at the same time mind-altering properties. Already in 1805 was morphine isolated by the German chemist Friedrich Sertürner and in the 1870s it was discovered that boiling morphine with acetic anhydride produced a substance with a strong pain suppressive effect: heroin. In 1815, Eugène Chevreul isolated from animal tissue cholesterol, a crystalline substance that belongs to the class of steroids, and in 1820 was strychnine, an alkaloid was isolated.|$|E

[...] "Not only is she an interesting character, but all her friends and those who've known her are interesting characters too," [...] he said. Morton had {{to spend a lot}} of evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to people — including artists, musicians, directors — who <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> perspective on Madonna and the world. He interviewed about 70 people who had known Madonna since her youth.

500|$|Talking about {{bringing}} {{the character of}} Franklin Hall from the comics to the series, executive producer Jeffrey Bell said that the writers had looked through the comics for a character to fill the episode's role, and felt that Hall <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> history. Subsequently, changes were made to fit the comics character into the existing role for the series, and he ultimately appears in an origin story-type role rather than as the fully formed supervillain from the comics. As a hint at his potential to become the villain [...] "Graviton" [...] in the future, the series changed his original scientific interests from matter transportation {{to the study of}} [...] "gravitonium", a substance created for the episode. The episode's ending, which sees Hall fall into some gravitonium, indicates that this is how he gains his Graviton abilities in the series.|$|E

500|$|Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbán {{was cast}} as the genetic superman Khan Noonian Singh, having been the first choice for the role. He had been {{suggested}} by casting director Joseph D'Agosta, who was not looking to cast an actor of a particular ethnic background due to Roddenberry's vision for the series; Roddenberry wanted to show his perceived 23rd century values by not requiring any specific ethnicities when casting actors in guest roles. Montalbán had previously appeared in a television movie created by Roddenberry, The Secret Weapon of 117 (also referred to as The Secret Defense of 117), which was the writer's first attempt to create science fiction on television and aired {{more than ten years}} before Star Trek. Montalbán called his role as Khan [...] "wonderful", saying that [...] "it was well-written, it <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> concept and I was delighted it was offered to me".

Link commented, [...] "The film is, however, refreshingly different. What makes it better is, what it does not have. It has, for instance, no [...] "star value."

500|$|On 14 October 2009, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{announced}} Havers {{had joined}} the cast of Coronation Street as Lewis, a potential love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). A writer for What's on TV said Havers {{was to make a}} one-off appearance in December before continuing in the role throughout 2010. The show's executive producer, Kim Crowther, told Gareth McLean of the Radio Times that while the team was planning the Audrey and Lewis storyline, they decided they wanted to introduce someone who was very charming, and slightly younger than Audrey. Casting director June West considered various actors for the part, including Anthony Head, but she suggested Havers for the role as she knew he was a big fan of the show. Crowther quipped, [...] "When you think of Nigel, you think of someone suave enough to charm you out of your high heels. Half the work is done." [...] Havers said he could not refuse the part because his character was fascinating and <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> story arc, and that being on the show had always been his ambition. Havers was initially contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut screen appearance as Lewis on 18 December 2009. In March 2010, Havers stated that he was keen to renew his contract, as he was enjoying his time with the soap.|$|E

500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
