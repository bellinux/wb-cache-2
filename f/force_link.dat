50|$|Muskat refined the {{original}} version of Darcy's equation for single-phase fluid (or homogenous fluid in Muskat terminology) flow by introducing fluid viscosity in the equation, as pointed out earlier by Charles Sumner Slichter, and replacing the hydraulic head by pressure and gravity force. The proportionality constant of the porous medium (which were both unconsolidated sand and consolidated sandstone in the laboratory experiments), using the new refined equation, is called single-phase permeability or absolute permeability, {{and is now a}} pure rock property as the fluid viscosity is explicit in the new flow equation. The pressure and gravity <b>force</b> <b>link</b> the refined equation to basic properties in physics, which makes the connection to capillary pressure, and thus Leverett J-function, direct and makes the connection to fluid density visible in the new equation. By these refinements Muskat established a refined flow equation for single phase fluid flow that is valid for water, oil and gas, and thus is suitable for use in the petroleum industry. Muskat and his colleagues verified the new equation by experiments.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Due to the {{projectile}} {{nature of}} the hammer after release the most important release parameter with respect to distance thrown is the release speed. As result {{it is vital that}} athletes ensure the acceleration to the release speed is optimal. Currently the most accurate way to determine speed data is via hammer head positional data and the fastest way to determine positional data is via automatic tracking. This will usually require post-processing and as such does not allow immediate feedback in the training environment. For athletes to improve technique it is important to provide accurate information about their performance as soon as possible after the event; delays in providing such information reduce the effectiveness of feedback[1]. This study's purpose was to determine and validate a model that predicts hammer speed from cable force in order to provide feedback on speed development in the training environment. Methodology: Five males and five females participated in this study and each was required to perform 10 throws with a hammer that had a strain gauge mounted on its wire. Retro-reflective markers were also positioned on each wire at known distances from the hammer's head. Each strain gauge was calibrated by applying forces to the wire that were measured by a <b>force</b> <b>link</b> (Kistler, Amherst USA). These data were later used to determine the relationship between strain gauge A-D units and force by performing a linear regression. The resultant regression was then used to convert the strain gauge throw A-D data into force. Positions of the markers were tracked with an infra-red camera system (Oxford Metrics, Oxford UK) and these positional data were used in conjunction with direction cosines to determine the hammer head's position. From this, linear hammer speed and cable force were calculated[2]. This speed and force data were used to determine two linear regression models that predict speed from force data: one where the data sets were shifted so that the peaks in force and speed lined up and one where neither data set was altered. These two models were used to predict speed from cable force data that were measured using the strain gauge device. Results: Using the models and strain gauge data allowed prediction of speeds that were nearly identical to the speeds calculated from positional data (R = 0. 98 for both). The average difference between the calculated speeds and speeds predicted via the non-shifted model was 0. 89 ± 0. 68 m. s- 1. The difference when using the shifted model was 0. 46 ± 0. 70 m. s- 1. Conclusion: The results {{of this study indicate that}} use of the models and the measured cable force data allowed prediction of highly accurate speed data however; the shifted regression model predicted data that were slightly more accurate.

40|$|In a weight-and-pulley circuit, torque is {{the product}} of the lever arm by the force (R) applied to the {{fastening}} point of the rope. Rocher [7] defined this force R as the sum of the load and the frictional forces (100 g per pulley). By this fact, he omitted the <b>forces</b> <b>linked</b> to inertia and elastic properties of the circuit. We measured R during an ab-adduction movement at the hip in order to evaluate quantitatively the relevance of these two phenomenons. R varies greatly during a movement (from 0 to 300 % of the weight attached to the rope). The dynamic frictional forces depend on the number of pulleys but increase also with the load. By changing the components of the circuit (rope and cage), one can reduce the frictional forces and the oscillations resulting from the lack of rigidity. However, the <b>forces</b> <b>linked</b> to inertia are inherent to a weight-and-pulley circuit since the 'resistance' opposed on the movement is linked to a mass.
