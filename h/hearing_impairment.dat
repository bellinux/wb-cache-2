The most common exercises among the respondents were walking, weight training and cycling/spinning. The respondents with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments</b> did appreciate group activities with instructors rather than the deaf respondents that did appreciate weigth training and walking. Among the deaf respondents, factor of feeling good were the best motivation. Among the respondents with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments,</b> to get in shape, were the best motivational factor. The results also showed that the respondents experienced a positive approach to exercising if people around promoted and supported them. If not, the approach to exercising became negative. The terms stigmatization, normalization and identity impregnate the study to explain the difficulties of the respondents exercising. In contrast with the exercising, the majority of the respondents aimed for a body image that were thinner than themselves. At the same time, the results showed that it was important to feel good within.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explain the ways in which parents of {{children}} with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments</b> access counseling services. In order to focus attention on these issues, a research question and objectives were formulated: In what ways did parents of children with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments</b> in Zimbabwe access counseling services during the period 1999 to 2000 ? Five distinct but related major issues, in relation to parents of children with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments</b> accessing counseling services in Zimbabwe during the period 1999 to 2000 emerged. This came from observation of practice, personal experiences, and discussions with parents. The objectives of the study were thus formulated as follows: · to find out who counseled parents of children with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments.</b> · to investigate whether parents who received or did not receive counseling were aware of organizations that offered guidance and counseling. · to find out parents’ perceptions on whether or not counseling helped them to accept and cope with their children. · to establish the qualifications of the counselors who counseled parents of children with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments.</b> · to explore recommendations by parents on ways in which counseling can be made more accessible in Zimbabwe. A pilot study was conducted in which two questionnaires that covered the research question and the five objectives were constructed and refined. Subsequently a survey was carried out on a sample of 300 parents of children with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments</b> and 28 counseling service organizations. The questionnaires sought to find out: who counseled parents of children with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments,</b> their views about the counseling they received, whether they were able to accept and cope with their children after counseling and their views on how counseling could be made more accessible. The questionnaire to service organizations sought to establish the qualifications of their counselors, the needs of parents of children with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments</b> and their views on what they thought could be done to help parents access counseling services. Female and male parents were compared in terms of their sources of counseling, acceptance and coping with children of different genders and different age groups. Quantitative data on organizations and parents’ responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative analysis was used to analyze data from open-ended questions collected from parents of children with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments.</b> Results from the study indicate that the majority of the parents received counseling from special schools, followed by individuals, then hospitals, churches, registered counseling organizations and friends. Slightly more than half of the parents were aware of registered organizations that offer counseling services. Most parents believed that counseling helped them and were able to cope with their children after counseling. The majority of the counselors who counseled parents of children with <b>hearing</b> <b>impairments</b> were not qualified. Most parents indicated that they faced difficulties in communication, financial constraints, societal attitude, lack of transport and lack of skills to teach children basic living skills. Parents suggested the use of parent support groups, workshops and advertisements as means of making counseling services more accessible.

25|$|Edison {{developed}} hearing {{problems at}} an early age. The cause of his deafness {{has been attributed to}} a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the middle of his career, Edison attributed the <b>hearing</b> <b>impairment</b> to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in Smiths Creek, Michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.|$|E

He was a good student, placing fifth out of five hundred students in 1865, but his parents could not keep him at school after he was 16, so he continued studying for a year by himself and had no further formal education.|$|E
25|$|Neuroplasticity is {{involved}} in the development of sensory function. The brain is born immature and it adapts to sensory inputs after birth. In the auditory system, congenital <b>hearing</b> <b>impairment,</b> a rather frequent inborn condition affecting 1 of 1000 newborns, has been shown to affect auditory development, and implantation of a sensory prostheses activating the auditory system has prevented the deficits and induced functional maturation of the auditory system. Due to a sensitive period for plasticity, there is also a sensitive period for such intervention within the first 2–4 years of life. Consequently, in prelingually deaf children, early cochlear implantation, as a rule, allows the children to learn the mother language and acquire acoustic communication.|$|E
