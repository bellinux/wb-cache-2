5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals {{parasitised}} include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. <b>Flies</b> are {{the second largest}} group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments <b>flies</b> are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food as {{they do not need}} to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on <b>flies.</b> It is thought that some of the earliest pollinators of plants may have been <b>flies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. <b>Flies</b> are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. <b>Flies</b> may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit <b>flies</b> are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. <b>Flies</b> can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger <b>flies</b> such as tsetse <b>flies</b> and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E
5|$|Dipterans are an {{important}} group of insects and have a considerable impact on the environment. Some leaf-miner <b>flies</b> (Agromyzidae), fruit <b>flies</b> (Tephritidae and Drosophilidae) and gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) are pests of agricultural crops; others such as tsetse <b>flies,</b> screwworm and botflies (Oestridae) attack livestock, causing wounds, spreading disease, and creating significant economic harm. See article: Parasitic <b>flies</b> of domestic animals. A few can even cause myiasis in humans. Still others such as mosquitoes (Culicidae), blackflies (Simuliidae) and drain <b>flies</b> (Psychodidae) impact human health, acting as vectors of major tropical diseases.|$|E

5|$|<b>Flies</b> are {{eaten by}} other animals at {{all stages of}} their development. The eggs and larvae are {{parasitised}} by other insects and are eaten by many creatures, some of which specialise in feeding on <b>flies</b> but most of which consume {{them as part of}} a mixed diet. Birds, bats, frogs, lizards, dragonflies and spiders are among the predators of <b>flies.</b> Many <b>flies</b> have evolved mimetic resemblances that aid their protection. Batesian mimicry is widespread with many hoverflies resembling bees and wasps, ants and some species of tephritid fruit fly resembling spiders. Some species of hoverfly are myrmecophilous, their young live and grow within the nests of ants. They are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members. Bombyliid bee <b>flies</b> such as Bombylius major are short-bodied, round, furry, and distinctly bee-like as they visit flowers for nectar, and are likely also Batesian mimics of bees.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flies</b> have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black <b>flies</b> and robber <b>flies),</b> or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. <b>Flies</b> undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; <b>flies</b> mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, <b>flies</b> have chemoreceptors that detect {{smell and}} taste, and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch. The third {{segments}} of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors, while the gustatory receptors are in the labium, pharynx, feet, wing margins and female genitalia, enabling <b>flies</b> to taste their food by walking on it. The taste receptors in females {{at the tip of}} the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing. <b>Flies</b> that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts, and many blood-sucking <b>flies</b> can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals. Some tachinid <b>flies</b> (Ormiinae) which are parasitoids of bush crickets, have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Fly</b> Captain, <b>Fly</b> Man (US & Canda) or <b>Fly</b> Chief, in the UK, is {{in charge}} of the flymen who operate a <b>fly</b> system in a {{theatrical}} production. Ordinarily a <b>fly</b> man will coordinate with the set designer to get flying scenery safely into the <b>fly</b> loft (or <b>fly</b> gallery) and to plan and delegate flyrail cues. The <b>fly</b> man can also be a stage manager in a small theater. The flyman is usually responsible for all matters of safety involving the <b>fly</b> system and also for making sure rail cues are executed quickly and properly. The <b>fly</b> man supervises the loading and unloading of counterweights in a <b>fly</b> system.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>fly</b> fishing rod casting dynamics was developed comprising of a nonlinear finite element {{representation of the}} composite <b>fly</b> rod and a lumped parameter model for the <b>fly</b> line. A nonlinear finite element model was {{used to analyze the}} transient response of the <b>fly</b> rod, in which <b>fly</b> rod responses were simulated for a forward casting stroke. The lumped parameter method was used to discretize the <b>fly</b> line system. <b>Fly</b> line motions were simulated during a cast based on <b>fly</b> rod tip response, which was used as the initial boundary condition for the <b>fly</b> line. <b>Fly</b> line loop generation, propagation, and line turn-over were simulated numerically. Flexible rod results were compared to the rigid rod case, in which the <b>fly</b> tip path was prescribed by a given <b>fly</b> rod butt input. Our numerical results strongly suggest that nonlinear flexibility effects on the <b>fly</b> rod must be included in order to accurately simulate casting dynamics and associated <b>fly</b> line motion...|$|R
5|$|Males of fly {{species such}} as Cuterebra, many hover <b>flies,</b> bee <b>flies</b> (Bombyliidae) and fruit <b>flies</b> (Tephritidae) {{maintain}} territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding males and other species. While these territories may be held by individual males, some species form leks with many males aggregating in displays. Some <b>flies</b> maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks. Many <b>flies</b> mate in flight while swarming.|$|E
5|$|Many dipterans serve {{roles that}} are useful to humans. Houseflies, blowflies and fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae) are {{scavengers}} and aid in decomposition. Robber <b>flies</b> (Asilidae), tachinids (Tachinidae) and dagger <b>flies</b> and balloon <b>flies</b> (Empididae) are predators and parasitoids of other insects, helping {{to control a}} variety of pests. Many dipterans such as bee <b>flies</b> (Bombyliidae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) are pollinators of crop plants.|$|E
5|$|Records {{of visits}} by pollinators exist {{for only a}} few species, but most of these suggest that the species are pollinated by insects. Flowers of A.chiribogensis produce small {{quantities}} of nectar, but lack a scent. Fruit <b>flies</b> (Drosophilidae), fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae, Sciaridae), midges (Cecidomyiidae, Ceratopogonidae) and micromoths (Lepidoptera) were recorded visiting these flowers, but bees and hover <b>flies</b> were not. Aiphanes eggersii was thought to be pollinated by bees and possibly by wind. Fruit <b>flies</b> (Drosophilidae), hover <b>flies</b> (Syrphidae), biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) and leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) were recorded visiting the flowers of A.erinacea, but bees were not. Aiphanes horrida was reportedly pollinated by wind, bees (Meliponidae), weevils (Curculionidae) and bugs (Hemiptera). <b>Flies</b> and weevils were observed on the flowers of A.simplex.|$|E

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the ruff’s diet consists almost exclusively {{of the adults}} and larva of terrestrial and aquatic insects such as beetles and <b>flies.</b> On migration and during the winter, the ruff eats insects (including caddis <b>flies,</b> water-beetles, mayflies and grasshoppers), crustaceans, spiders, molluscs, worms, frogs, small fish, and also the seeds of rice and other cereals, sedges, grasses and aquatic plants. Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site. Green aquatic plant material, spilt rice and maize, <b>flies</b> and beetles were found, along with varying amounts of grit. On the main wintering grounds in West Africa, rice is a favoured food during the later part of the season as the ricefields dry out.|$|E
