40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain a better {{understanding}} of the feasibility of partial replacement of dichromate, Cr(VI), with phosphate buffer, focusing on the cathode reaction selectivity for hydrogen evolution on mild steel and Fe-Mo cathodes in undivided cell for chlorate production. To evaluate the ability of phosphate and Cr(VI) additions to hinder <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorate</b> reduction, overall current efficiency (CE) measurements in laboratory cell for chlorate production on stationary electrodes were performed. The concentration of hypochlorite was determined by a conventional potentiometric titration method using 0. 01 mol dm- 3 As 2 O 3 solution as a titrant. The chlorate concentration was determined by excess of 1. 0 mol dm- 3 As 2 O 3 solution and excess of arsenic oxide was titrated with 0. 1 mol dm- 3 KBrO 3 solution in a strong acidic solution. Cathodic <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorate</b> reduction were suppressed efficiently by addition of 3 g dm- 3 dichromate at both cathodes, except that Fe-Mo cathode exhibited higher catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The overvoltage for the HER was around 0. 17 V lower on Fe-Mo cathode than on mild steel at the current density of 3 kA m- 2. It was found that a dichromate content as low as 0. 1 g dm- 3 is sufficient for complete suppression of cathodic <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorate</b> reduction onto Fe-Mo catalyst in phosphate buffering system (3 g dm- 3 Na 2 HPO 4 + NaH 2 PO 4). The overall current efficiency was practically the same as in the case of the presence of 3 g dm- 3 dichromate buffer (98 %). However, for the mild steel cathode, the overall current efficiency for the chlorate production was somewhat lower in the above mentioned mixed phosphate + dichromate buffering system (95 %) than in the pure dichromate buffering solution (97. 5 %) ...|$|R

The DFT simulations included reactions with hydrogen terminated surfaces, and with surface sites produced by anodic polarization, namely: ≡C•, =C•H, ≡C–O • and =C•HO. Oxychlorine radicals (ClO•, ClO 2 •) were found to chemically adsorb to both secondary and tertiary carbon atoms on the BDD surface. These chemisorbed intermediates could react with hydroxyl radicals to regenerate the original chlorine oxyanion (ClO − or ClO 2 −), and produce ≡C–O • and =C•HO sites on the BDD surface. The ≡C–O • and =C•HO sites also reacted with oxychlorine radicals to form chemisorbed intermediates, which could then be converted to higher oxidation states (ClO 2 −, ClO 3 −) via reaction with hydroxyl radicals. The predominant pathway for chlorite <b>and</b> <b>chlorate</b> production appears to involve oxidation of HOCl or HClO 2 via direct electron transfer, followed by reaction of ClO • or ClO 2 • with a hydroxyl radical...|$|R

At the moment chlorine dioxide treatment is widely used in Italy: a multicentric study was carried out in Italy, aimed to evaluate the association, if any, between chlorite <b>and</b> <b>chlorate</b> in drinking water and both preterm delivery and term-SGA. Methods: A case control study with incident cases was performed in 9 Italian towns between October 1999 -September 2000. Preterm deliveries and term-SGA newborns in the areas were cases, and singleton births, at term and weight > 10 th percentile were controls; n. 1194 subjects were enrolled and n. 893 water samples were collected from subjects' homes (433 cases and 460 controls) where drinking water was treated with chlorine dioxide or both with chlorine and chlorine dioxide.

This aspect is very important taking into account that current WHO Drinking water Guidelines suggest a limit of 700 µg/L for chlorate ion.
