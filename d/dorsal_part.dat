5|$|The <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of {{the body}} wall is a mantle (or pallium) which secretes {{calcareous}} s, plates or shells. It overlaps the body with enough spare room to form a mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the body above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend {{to the front and}} back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E

50|$|Three of its <b>dorsal</b> <b>parts</b> can be shed {{in case of}} danger, a form of autotomy. This {{species has}} another means of defense by {{secreting}} a repellent acid fluid.|$|R
25|$|After the {{separation}} of the rectum from the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the cloaca, the ventral part becomes the primary urogenital sinus. The urogenital sinus, in turn, divides into the superficial definitive urogenital sinus and the deeper anterior vesico-urethral portion.|$|E
25|$|There is {{initially}} a cloacal membrane, composed of ectoderm and endoderm, reaching from {{the umbilical cord}} to the tail, separating the cloaca from the exterior. After {{the separation of the}} rectum from the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the cloaca, the ventral part of the cloacal membrane becomes the urogenital membrane.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} radioles, called an operculum, {{is a highly}} {{specialized}} structure located on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the head. The operculum consists of a long, thick stalk with a cartilaginous, cone-shaped plug at the distal end. This plug {{can be used to}} seal the opening of the tube after the animal has retreated inside. The operculum, which is usually red in color, secretes a mucus which seems to possess antibiotic properties. It is not unusual for the animal to have two opercula. Both serpulid and sabellid worms have radioles, but sabellids (such as Sabella pavonina) lack an operculum.|$|E
5|$|Blackbuck bear a close {{resemblance}} to gazelles, and are distinguished mainly {{by the fact}} that while gazelles are brown in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>parts,</b> blackbuck develop a dark brown or black colour in these parts.|$|R
5000|$|Fibers {{that cover}} the {{temporal}} parts of hippocampus make a fiber bundle that is called fimbria. Going from temporal to septal (<b>dorsal)</b> <b>parts</b> of hippocampus fimbria collects more and more hippocampal and subicular outputs and becomes thicker.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 18 mm. The proximal {{half of the}} forewings is cream {{suffused with}} ferruginous in the basal and <b>dorsal</b> <b>parts</b> of the wing. The hindwings are cream in the costal area and brownish grey in the remaining parts.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to having ordinary radioles, some Canalipalpata possess one or more highly modified radioles located on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the head. This specialized structure is called an operculum. The operculum is a cone-shaped cartilaginous structure located at the distal {{end of a long}} cartilaginous stalk. When threatened or disturbed, the animal withdraws rapidly into its protective calcareous tube and employs the operculum as a plug to occlude the entrance to the tube. The operculum, which is usually similar in color to the other radioles, secretes a mucus which seems to possess antibiotic properties. It is not unusual for the animal to have two crowns, and hence two opercula.|$|E
25|$|The {{central part}} of {{cardiogenic}} area {{is in front of}} the oropharyngeal membrane and the neural plate. The growth of the brain and the cephalic folds push the oropharyngeal membrane forward, while the heart and the pericardial cavity move first to the cervical region and then into the chest. The curved portion of the horseshoe-shaped area expands to form the future ventricular infundibulum and the ventricular regions, as the heart tube continues to expand. The tube starts receiving venous drainage in its caudal pole and will pump blood out of the first aortic arch and into the dorsal aorta through its polar head. Initially the tube remains attached to the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the pericardial cavity by a mesodermal tissue fold called the dorsal mesoderm. This mesoderm disappears to form the two pericardial sinuses the transverse and the oblique pericardial sinuses, which connect both sides of the pericardial cavity.|$|E
500|$|Breed {{specific}} markings include large, symmetrical dark patches {{incorporating the}} ears, eyes and cheeks, {{and a dark}} cape over the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the neck and shoulders. The face should have a white blaze extending from the poll to the muzzle. The muzzle itself should be dark. The classic Jacob face {{is often referred to}} as [...] "badger-faced", consisting of black cheeks and muzzle with a white blaze running down the front of the face. In addition to these markings, random spots may occur on the rest of the body and legs (including the carpi, hocks, and pasterns). Certain markings are common in particular lines: large muzzle markings, lack of leg markings, lack of muzzle markings, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13-14 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is cream, {{consisting of}} numerous dots situated mainly in median and <b>dorsal</b> <b>parts</b> of the wing. The hindwings are orange yellow {{with a dark}} brown apical area with a few proximal paler spots.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study aims {{to analyze}} the effects of {{electrolytic}} lesion, restricted to either the ventral or the <b>dorsal</b> <b>parts</b> of the vertical lobe (VL), {{on the behavior of}} cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis). Two behavioral tests were performed on sham-operated and lesioned cuttlefish: assessment of locomotor activity in an open field and determination of spatial learning abilities in a T maze. The results showed that ventral lesions of the VL led to marked impairment in the acquisition of spatial learning, whereas dorsal lesions of the VL increased locomotor activity in the open field and impaired long-term retention of spatial learning. This study establishes {{for the first time the}} existence of distinct functions in the ventral and the <b>dorsal</b> <b>parts</b> of the VL in cephalopods...|$|R

500|$|The hippocampus, {{including}} the dentate gyrus, has {{the shape of}} a curved tube, which has been compared to a seahorse, and a ram's horn (Cornu Ammonis). Its abbreviation CA is used in naming the hippocampal subfields: CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4. It can be distinguished as an area where the cortex narrows into a single layer of densely packed pyramidal neurons, which curl into a tight U shape. One edge of the [...] "U," [...] â€“ CA4, is embedded into the backward-facing, flexed dentate gyrus. The hippocampus is described as having an anterior and posterior part (in primates) or a ventral and <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> in other animals. Both parts are of similar composition but belong to different neural circuits. In the rat, the two hippocampi resemble a pair of bananas, joined at the stems by the commissure of fornix (also called the hippocampal commissure). In primates, the part of the hippocampus at the bottom, near the base of the temporal lobe, is much broader than the part at the top. This means that in cross-section the hippocampus can show a number of different shapes, depending on the angle and location of the cut.|$|E
500|$|Like all penguin species, emperor {{penguins}} have streamlined {{bodies to}} minimize drag while swimming, and wings {{that are more}} like stiff, flat flippers. The tongue is equipped with rear-facing barbs to prevent prey from escaping when caught. Males and females are similar in size and colouration. The adult has deep black dorsal feathers, covering the head, chin, throat, back, <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the flippers, and tail. The black plumage is sharply delineated from the light-coloured plumage elsewhere. The underparts of the wings and belly are white, becoming pale yellow in the upper breast, while the ear patches are bright yellow. The upper mandible of the [...] long bill is black, and the lower mandible can be pink, orange or lilac. In juveniles, the auricular patches, chin and throat are white, while its bill is black. Emperor penguin chicks are typically covered with silver-grey down and have black heads and white masks. A chick with all-white plumage was found in 2001, but was {{not considered to be}} an albino as it did not have pink eyes. Chicks weigh around [...] after hatching, and fledge when they reach about 50% of adult weight.|$|E
2500|$|All mammals have a urinary bladder. [...] This {{structure}} {{begins as}} an embryonic cloaca. In the vast majority, this eventually becomes differentiated into a <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> {{connected to the}} intestine and a ventral part which becomes associated with the urinogenital passage and urinary bladder. [...] The only mammals in which this does not take place are the platypus and the spiny anteater both of which retain the cloaca into adulthood.|$|E

5000|$|BMP7 {{has been}} {{discovered}} to be crucial in the determination of ventral-dorsal organization in zebrafish. BMP7 causes the expression of ventral phenotypes while its complete inhibition creates a dorsal phenotype. Moreover, BMP7 is eventually partially [...] "turned off" [...] in embryonic development {{in order to create}} the <b>dorsal</b> <b>parts</b> of the organism.|$|R
2500|$|Nociceptors develop from neural-crest stem cells. The {{neural crest}} is {{responsible}} for {{a large part of}} early development in vertebrates. [...] It is specifically responsible for development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The neural-crest stem cells split from the neural tube as it closes, and nociceptors grow from the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of this neural-crest tissue. They form late during neurogenesis. Earlier forming cells from this region can become non-pain sensing receptors, either proprioceptors or low-threshold mechanoreceptors. All neurons derived from the neural crest, including embryonic nociceptors, express the TrkA, which is a receptor to nerve-growth factor (NGF). However, transcription factors that determine the type of nociceptor remain unclear.|$|E
2500|$|The ARAS is {{composed}} of several neuronal circuits connecting the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the posterior midbrain and anterior pons to the cerebral cortex via distinct pathways that project through the thalamus and hypothalamus. The ARAS {{is a collection of}} different nuclei â€“ more than 20 on each side in the upper brainstem, the pons, medulla, and posterior hypothalamus. The nuclei have their own cytoarchitecture and neurochemical identity and act as neuromodulators. The neurotransmitters that these neurons release include acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine, and glutamate. They exert cortical influence through direct axonal projections and indirect projections through thalamic relays. The thalamic pathway consists primarily of cholinergic neurons in the pontine tegmentum, whereas the hypothalamic pathway {{is composed}} primarily of neurons that release monoamine neurotransmitters, namely dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine. The orexin neurons of the lateral hypothalamus innervate every component of the ascending reticular activating system and coordinate activity within the entire system. The most significant components of the ARAS include: ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{embryonic}} development these {{inner cell mass}} cells continuously {{divide and}} become more specialized. [...] For example, {{a portion of the}} ectoderm in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>part</b> of the embryo specializes as 'neurectoderm', which will become the future central nervous system. [...] Later in development, neurulation causes the neurectoderm to form the neural tube. [...] At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes encephalization to generate or 'pattern' the basic form of the brain. [...] At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a neural stem cell. [...] These neural stem cells are pluripotent, as they can generate a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and functional characteristics. [...] The process of generating neurons from stem cells is called neurogenesis. [...] One prominent example of a neural stem cell is the radial glial cell, so named because it has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall, and because historically it shared some glial characteristics, most notably the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). [...] The radial glial cell is the primary neural stem cell of the developing vertebrate CNS, and its cell body resides in the ventricular zone, adjacent to the developing ventricular system. [...] Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), and thus their potency is restricted.|$|E
