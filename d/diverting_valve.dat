50|$|Parallel {{arrangements}} typically {{require the}} use of a bypass or <b>diverted</b> <b>valve</b> to allow one or both compressors to feed the engine. If no valve were employed and both compressors were merely routed directly to the intake manifold, the supercharger would blow backwards through the turbocharger compressor rather than pressurize the intake manifold, as that would be the path of least resistance. Thus a diverter valve must be employed to vent turbocharger air until it has reached the pressure in the intake manifold. Complex or expensive electronic controls are usually necessary to ensure smooth power delivery.|$|R

30|$|LC-MS {{analyses}} were performed on an Agilent 1290 Infinity LC coupled to an Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with an electrospray ionization source. Chromatographic separation {{was carried out in}} a Poroshell 120 SB-C 18 column (2.1 × 100  mm, 2.7  μm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with 99.9 % water, 0.05 % formic acid, and 0.05 % ammonium formate as mobile phase A, and 99.95 % acetonitrile and 0.05 % formic acid as mobile phase B. The autosampler and the column temperature were maintained at 6 °C and 50 °C respectively. Gradient elution with mobile phase A and mobile phase B at a flow rate of 0.7  mL/min was as follows: 5 % to 50 % B over 3  min, 50 % to 95 % B over 0.5  min, isocratic at 95 % B for 0.6  min, 5 % to 95 % B over 0.1  min, and isocratic at 5 % B over 0.7  min. Prior to the next injection, the column was re-equilibrated at 5 % B over 1  min. A <b>divert</b> <b>valve</b> switched the LC flow initially to waste for 0.3  min, subsequently to the mass spectrometer for 4.5  min, and then back to the waste for the remaining chromatographic run.|$|R

50|$|On 29 March 2001, the X-32B STOVL version {{made its}} first flight. The flight lasted 50 minutes as the {{aircraft}} flew from Palmdale to Edwards AFB. The flight had originally been scheduled {{for the third quarter}} of 2000. A modified version of the -614C engine, known as the F119-PW-614S powered the STOVL aircraft. In normal flight, the -614S was configured as a conventional reheated turbofan. However, in the STOVL mode a butterfly <b>valve</b> <b>diverted</b> the core stream exhaust gases to a pair of thrust vectoring nozzles located close to the aircraft's centre-of-gravity. Forward of these nozzles, a jet screen nozzle provided a sheet of cool bypass air to minimise hot gas recirculation. There was also a pair of ducts leading to roll nozzles near the wing tips. Two pairs of ducts fed the Aft-pitch yaw nozzles and the Forward pitch nozzles. The reheat was unlit, with no gas flow during Lift. The X-32B achieved STOVL flight {{in much the same way}} as the AV-8B Harrier II with thrust vectoring of the jet exhaust. A smooth Transition (between STOVL and Normal modes) was obtained by maintaining a constant engine match, facilitated by the control system algorithm maintaining a fixed total nozzle effective area. Thus the engine was unaware of various nozzles being opened up and closed off to complete the Transition.|$|R
2500|$|In 1971, {{a member}} of a feminist {{reproductive}} health self-help group, Lorraine Rothman, modified equipment found in an underground abortion clinic that was developed for a new non-traumatic, manually-operated-suction abortion technique. Rothman took the thin, flexible plastic Karman cannula (about the size of a soda straw), and the syringe (50 or 60ml), and added a one-way bypass valve, to fix two main problems. The contraption could prevent air from being pumped into the uterus, and also suctioned uterine contents directly into the syringe, thus limiting the amount that could be removed. Rothman's and Downer's group dubbed the new invention the [...] "Del Em." [...] Rothman added two lengths of clear plastic tubing, one from the cannula to the collection jar and another to go from the collection jar to the syringe. With this new set-up, the contents of the uterus went directly into the jar, allowing for the extraction of more material, and the two-way bypass <b>valve</b> <b>diverted</b> any air that may have been inadvertently pushed back toward the body to exit harmlessly into the air; this would prevent air from entering the uterus. By making it possible for more than one person to operate the device, the skill level of the operators was greatly reduced. One person could concentrate on guiding the sterile cannula through the vaginal cavity into the cervical os while another could pump the syringe to develop the vacuum. The Del Em made the procedure more comfortable, with personal control of the suction.|$|R
40|$|As {{discussed}} in chapter 1, phosphorylation {{is a very}} important post-translational modification in signal transduction and plays very important roles in the whole cellular life. Phosphorylation is mediated by PKs in cells. Mutations in PKs can be a cause or consequence of some diseases. In the recent decades, PKs have been an enzyme target for discovering disease mechanisms and the related therapeutic products to cure these diseases. Till the end of 2013, there have been more than 20 kinase inhibitory molecules approved by USFDA for the treatment of some kinase induced diseases, like IM for CML. However, this success is a small step in drug discovery for kinase induced diseases. Efforts still need to be put in to discover more potential small inhibitory molecules to protect humans against variable diseases caused by deregulation of PKs. Abl 1 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and its hybrid Bcr-Abl fusion gene is found in most patients with CML and in some patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The constitutively high TK activity of Bcr-Abl results in unregulated cell division. So efforts have not been stopped to find new effective TK inhibitors since the first TK inhibitor drug IM was approved by USFDA in 2001. Here, Abl 1 is chosen as a model enzyme to establish different instrumental methods for discovering new TK inhibitors. Abltide is the substrate used in this project. To maintain the catalytic reaction of Abl 1 in vitro, the enzyme incubation conditions mimicked the in vivo conditions in the beginning and were optimized as much as possible to simplify the product readout procedure. Finally, the phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by Abl 1 was conducted in 15 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7. 5) containing DTT (1 mM) and MgCl 2 (5 mM) in the presence of ATP and Abltide at 30 &# 176;C. For inhibitor study, test molecules are added into this reaction system to prevent substrate from converting to product. In this thesis, several discontinuous enzyme assays were aimed at, so the enzymatic reaction should be stopped before the readout of the product. In this study, the stop solutions were mainly composed of ACN, but the amount was slightly changed according to the composition of the mobile phase in consideration of the peak shapes of target analytes. Chapter 2 describes a LC-ESI-MS method for kinetic study of Abl 1. As we all know, Tris-HCl is non-volatile, which is not compatible with the ESI mode. So an online desalting system, with the assistance of a <b>divert</b> <b>valve,</b> was introduced to remove non-volatile salts before determination of the analyte by ESI-MS positive mode. This analytical method was validated according to FDA guidance. The LOQ was 10 nM for p-Abltide and 25 nM for Abltide. The linear regression equation of the calibration curve was y = 0. 8895 x + 0. 0443; r 2 = 0. 9997. The %RSDs across all data points were less than 10. 0 % in the precision test and assay accuracy ranged from - 1. 6 to + 5. 3 %. A stability test indicated that both p-Abltide and Abltide were stable during the process of the enzymatic reaction in vitro. In the Abl 1 assay, when the ratio of ACN/reaction mixture (v/v) was 1 / 3, the enzymatic reaction was stopped completely and the peak shape of p-Abltide was acceptable. The study in this chapter indicated that the reaction of Abl 1 and two substrates (Abltide and ATP) behaves according to a ternary-complex mechanism. The Km of Abltide was calculated by nonlinear regression as 34. 78 µM and the Vmax value was 5. 563 µmol/mg/min. The Km and Vmax of ATP were 43. 61 µM and 5. 906 µmol/mg/min, respectively. A substrate concentration around or below the Km is suggested in tests to identify competitive inhibitors in an inhibition assay. Therefore, 35 µM of Abltide and the same amount of ATP were used to study Abl 1 potential inhibitors in chapter 3. A LC-ESI-MS method using a gradient mobile phase system was developed to test the inhibitory activity of potential Abl 1 inhibitors. The LOQ was 40. 8 nM for p-Abltide and 26. 7 nM for Abltide. Due to the difference in mobile phase used in chapter 2 and 3, the quenching solutions were different. In this study, the ratio of ACN/reaction mixture (v/v) was decreased to 1 / 4 to maintain a good peak shape of p-Abltide. The linear regression equation was y = 0. 9151 x + 0. 0883, r 2 > 0. 995. The RSDs for precision were less than 10. 0 %. Assay accuracy ranged from - 6. 93 to + 0. 15 %. The robustness test for the gradient mobile phase system suggested that the LC system was robust. Moreover, there was no matrix effect on the analytes ionization. Using this method, the IC 50 values were determined as 201. 1 nM for IM, 925. 1 pM for dasatinib, 64. 03 nM for EGCG, 1. 915 µM for MPB. The inhibitory activity fluctuated from 26 % to 55 % for caffeic acid at concentrations from 1 nM to 1 mM. So, the inhibition potency ranking is dasatinib > EGCG > IM > MPB > caffeic acid. Importantly, a concentration range should be applied to screen NPs in order to avoid false negative results and not to miss the compounds with high effect at low dosage. Considering the important regional influence on NPs, it is convenient to study NPs locally. LC-UV is a worldwide technique as it is cheap. So a LC-UV method was developed to perform an inhibitor study of Abl 1, which is described in chapter 4. The LOQ was 0. 2 µM for p-Abltide using UV detection, which all other parameters tested during the validation have met the criteria in the FDA guidelines. The validated method was applied to study potential inhibitors of Abl 1, and the results suggested that the inhibition potency ranking for NPs is dependent on their concentrations. In this test, the inhibition potency ranking was nilotinib > IM > quercetin > chrysophanol > resveratrol when their concentrations were set at 1 µM and 10 µM. However, the ranking for the three NPs reversed and was quercetin nilotinib > IM. The IC 50 values estimated herein were in good agreement with those reported in literature and the inhibition potency ranking was also consistent with the reported data. Therefore, the LC-InPED method described in this chapter is applicable to the inhibition study of Abl 1. Unfortunately, an unexpected failure of the enzymatic reaction happened in the process of this project. A lot of time was consumed to dig out the reason. Finally, the Abl 1 inhibitory activity of compounds from leaching plastic tubes might be the cause. Chapter 6 portrays this unpredicted finding. The leaching compounds were extracted from the plastic tubes and the inhibitory activity of the tube extract was confirmed by Abl 1 assays described in chapter 2 and 3. Additionally, MS spectra and UV chromatograms of the tube extract solution verified the existence of unknown compounds in the tube extract solution. It was tried to identify these compounds by high resolution MS, but unfortunately, no conclusion could be made till now. Hence, in the future more effort would be done to identify and isolate those active compounds in the extract solution. nrpages: 140 status: publishe...|$|R
