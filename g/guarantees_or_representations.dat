The original meaning seems to have been more akin to <b>guarantee</b> (q.v.), warranty <b>or</b> security; and to some extent the term implies something in the nature of a <b>guarantee</b> <b>or</b> <b>representation</b> by the person issuing the warrant that the person who acts on it can do so without incurring any legal penalty.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{reviews the}} wealth of {{research}} on the behavior, experiences, and accomplishments of women in elective office in the United States to assess what we have learned, and to identify some of the most promising avenues for future research. Motivated in large part by questions and concerns about women’s political representation, this research has established a clear, empirical link between women’s descriptive and substantive representation. Throughout the policymaking process—and beyond—female officeholders are often more likely than their male colleagues to act for women or women’s interests. A closer look at this research also reveals that these links are by no means <b>guaranteed</b> <b>or</b> absolute; descriptive <b>representation</b> is neither absolutely necessary nor entirely sufficient for substantive representation to occur. Some female officeholders are more likely than others to act for women; some male politicians are more likely than others to do so; some governing institutions are more likely than others to do so. Researchers are just beginning to ask why. Future research, I argue, needs to recognize and explore the complex and contingent processes by which the linkages between the descriptive and substantive representation of women are strengthened or weakened. More specifically, this essay recommends that researchers pay more attention to numerous factors besides the gender identit...|$|R
