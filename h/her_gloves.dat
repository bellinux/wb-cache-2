5|$|The {{dancing is}} {{restrained}} {{with a single}} prop: that of a solitary chair. At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles. There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off <b>her</b> <b>gloves</b> like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E
25|$|Marie Angélique {{died during}} the Affaire des Poisons scandal in France. Poisoning was {{suspected}} to be her cause of death. During the interrogation of the accused witches and wizards, some of them mentioned the name of Mademoiselle de Fontanges, referring to a plot they planned on the duchess. The first witness who testified was Marguerite Monvoisin, {{the daughter of the}} sorceress La Voisin. She accused accomplices of her late mother for poisoning the Duchess of Fontanges. Marguerite Monvoisin's lovers, Bertrand and Romani, were arrested in 1681 as suspects. Bertrand was accused of selling poisonous stuffs to Fontanges; while Romani was accused of delivering <b>her</b> <b>gloves</b> contaminated with poison. Defendants pronounced the name of Miss Carnation, a maid to the Marquise de Montespan, however there were no statements to back their claim.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. ALLONBY. Either marry you, or {{strike you}} {{across the face}} with <b>her</b> <b>glove.</b> What {{would you do if}} she struck you across the face with <b>her</b> <b>glove?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Her fingers {{tightened}} {{about his}} thumb as she perceived the hot low room, {{the pounding of}} pressing-irons, the reek of scorched cloth, and Erik among giggling gnomes. His fingertip crept through the opening of <b>her</b> <b>glove</b> and smoothed <b>her</b> palm. She snatched her hand away, stripped off <b>her</b> <b>glove,</b> tucked <b>her</b> hand back into his.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes lifted {{suddenly}} from <b>her</b> <b>glove,</b> {{and looked}} straight into his.|$|R
25|$|The {{prisoner}} Emma rescued {{is revealed}} to be none other than Maid Marian, who eagerly runs to embrace Robin Hood and Roland. A distraught Regina notes that Emma has done exactly what her mother did: unintentionally ruin her chance for happiness by naively trying to make things better. Reduced to tears, Regina ominously warns Emma that Marian had better {{be the only thing}} she brought back. Back at the barn, a container from Rumplestiltskin's vault (which Hook accidentally disturbed in the vault) is revealed to have fallen through the portal. The lid pops off and releases a blue liquid, which after a moment coalesces into none other than Elsa. She removes <b>her</b> <b>gloves</b> and unleashes an icy blast that destroys her former prison, before heading out of the barn, leaving a trail of frozen ground behind her.|$|E
25|$|Action {{takes place}} at Fehrbellin and in Berlin, 1675. The Prince of Homburg, a young officer of the Great Elector (Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg), is {{exhausted}} after a long campaign. Walking in his sleep, he puts on a laurel wreath. Several noblemen notice this, and the Great Elector plays a trick on the Prince, which leads him to declare his love for the Elector's niece, Natalie. He is able {{to take one of}} <b>her</b> <b>gloves.</b> After waking from his dream the Prince is puzzled by the glove in his hand. When at the next council of war the plans for the next battle are being discussed, and duties are being handed out, the Prince is thrown into confusion by the appearance of Princess Natalie, who reveals herself as the owner of the glove, and he is distracted {{to the extent that he}} fails to take on board his orders, which are not to engage the enemy without a direct order to do so. Contrary to his instructions he attacks the enemy at the Battle of Fehrbellin – and wins.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle [...] {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as early as 1886, {{it was not until}} 1901 Potter began elaborating it while on holiday at Lingholm west of Derwentwater where she met young Kathleen and Lucie Carr, daughters of the local vicar. In 1902, it was put to paper. The Carr family lived at Skelghyl, but Potter took some artistic liberty and moved the house's location to Little Town in the text. The family came to tea at Lingholm often with Potter delighted by the one-year-child's behaviour. On one occasion, Lucie left <b>her</b> <b>gloves</b> behind at Lingholm, and Potter transformed the incident into the fictional Lucie's propensity for losing her pocket handkerchiefs. A small copy book contains what {{is believed to be the}} earliest manuscript of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Its title page is inscribed: [...] "Made at Lingholm, Sept. 01 told to cousin Stephanie at Melford Nov. 01—written down Nov. 02. There are no pictures, it is a good one to tell—" ...|$|E
60|$|The other {{pulled off}} <b>her</b> <b>glove</b> {{and touched the}} girl's cheek with her fingers.|$|R
60|$|He gripped <b>her</b> <b>gloved</b> fingers, {{brushed past}} her, {{and she saw}} that she was alone.|$|R
60|$|Miss De Ormond {{picked up}} the cheek carelessly, folded it indifferently, and stuffed it into <b>her</b> <b>glove.</b>|$|R
500|$|When {{producing}} Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, co-director Takeshi Nozue {{had difficulty}} developing {{a framework for}} Tifa's body that was [...] "balanced, yet showed off her feminine qualities." [...] Her outfit too was redesigned at this point, with emphasis on expressing those qualities, while still being pleasing to the eye. A white tank top with black zipped up vest covers her front, a pink ribbon wraps around her left biceps, and boots cover her feet. A black buttoned-up skirt covers her thighs, and she wears shorts beneath, {{with a piece of}} cloth similar to a coattail extending {{from the back of the}} skirt's waistband and ending at her ankles. While <b>her</b> <b>gloves</b> remain, they are worn only during the film's fight scenes. Her hairstyle was changed to end at the middle of her back, with the removal of the dolphin tail from her original design. This alteration was because of the difficulty of animating her original length of hair, as well as problems that arose due to its black color and lighting.|$|E
500|$|Solo {{attracted}} more {{controversy in the}} United States' quarter-final defeat by Sweden. During the penalty shootout she caused an interruption of several minutes when changing <b>her</b> <b>gloves</b> before Sweden's final kick, in an apparent act of gamesmanship. Lisa Dahlkvist was seen to laugh at Solo's antics, before calmly converting the penalty to eliminate the United States. Following the match Solo called her opponents [...] "a bunch of cowards" [...] in reference to their ultra-defensive tactics. The remark was made to Grant Wahl in the raw aftermath of the defeat. [...] The International Olympic Committee called Solo's comments [...] "disappointing" [...] but said she was unlikely to face formal disciplinary action adding [...] "People are free to say those things. We wouldn’t stop their right to express themselves, within boundaries, obviously." [...] Swedish coach Pia Sundhage was more blunt in her assessment: [...] "I don't give a crap. I'm going to Rio, she's going home" [...] and later said, [...] "I think she was just stressed, and {{that she did not}} really mean it." [...] Swedish players, Lotta Schelin, Lisa Dahlkvist and Kosovare Asllani voiced their empathy for Solo chalking her comment up to being caught up {{in the heat of the}} moment.|$|E
2500|$|Young girls wore {{dresses with}} round collars and sashes. Fashionable dresses had dropped waists. [...] Pinafores were worn {{for work and}} play. When going out, {{especially}} in the winter, girls wore lots of layers to keep warm. A warm coat was worn with kid leather gloves. Gloves were worn under a muff hand warmer, so when the girl removed her hands from the muff, <b>her</b> <b>gloves</b> would keep them warm. Just like ladies, all upper-class Victorian girls wore gloves when going out. A hat or bonnet was worn as well, along with long, knee-length button-up boots or shorter boots with gaitors to {{give the appearance of}} wearing long boots.|$|E

60|$|But Irene had not moved; in <b>her</b> <b>gloved</b> hands she ceaselessly {{turned and}} twisted the little bunch of violets.|$|R
2500|$|Gilda (1946), showcases one of {{the most}} famous stripteases in {{cinematic}} history, performed by Rita Hayworth to [...] "Put the Blame on Mame"), though in the event she removes just <b>her</b> <b>gloves,</b> before the act is terminated by a jealous admirer. Murder at the Windmill (1949), (known in the U.S.A. as [...] "Mystery at the Burlesque") directed by Val Guest is set at the Windmill Theatre, London and features Diana Decker, Jon Pertwee and Jimmy Edwards. Salome (1953) once again features Rita Hayworth doing a striptease act; this time as the famous biblical stripper Salome, performing the Dance of the Seven Veils. According to Hayworth's biographers this erotic dance routine was [...] "the most demanding of her entire career", necessitating [...] "endless takes and retakes". Expresso Bongo (1959) is a British film which features striptease at a club in Soho, London.|$|E
