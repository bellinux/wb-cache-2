40|$|Amongst 186 farmers {{interviewed in}} 1986 in central Mali 95 percent {{declared}} having used oxen {{for at least}} some part of their crop production activities. Most of the users (98 percent) had exploited oxen for soil preparation, but only 66 percent had used animal-drawn equipment for weeding. Only 21 percent of respondents attributed problems with field operations to deficiency in oxen work-capacity. On average oxen undertook 22 days of primary cultivation and 11 days of weeding in 1989. All the work observed was carried out using oxen <b>harnessed</b> in <b>pairs.</b> Soil preparation consisted principally of ridging with a single-furrow plough (16 days work) and this was carried out at an average working speed of 0. 75 m. s. - 1 with an average draft force of 778 N. Inter-row weeding was generally made with a duck-foot harrow working at 0. 77 m. s. - 1 at an average draft force of 610 N. The average work load in primary cultivations was 138 N. 100 kg- 1 liveweight and for weeding 120 N. 100 kg- 1 liveweight. Liveweight and size of oxen had no evident effect on working performance. Energy consumption in work was estimated at 144 percent and 136 percent of maintenance requirement for primary cultivation and weeding respectively...|$|R
40|$|In {{debates about}} {{executive}} branch authority and policy innovation, scholars {{have focused on}} two overarching relationships—horizontal tension {{between the president and}} Congress and the vertical interplay of federal and state authority. However, these debates have overlooked the role of frontline bureaucratic officials in advancing the laws they administer. This Article looks to immigration law—in which lower-level federal officers exercise discretion delegated down throughout federal agencies—to identify how bottom-up agency influences can inform categorical, across-the-board executive branch policy. In this Article, I argue that decisions by frontline officers can and should be better <b>harnessed</b> to <b>pair</b> local laboratories of executive experimentation with opportunities for interchange throughout various levels of the administrative bureaucracy. Notwithstanding the predominant (and often accurate) view that on-the-ground enforcers resist innovation, many frontline immigration officers have demonstrated willingness, and an ability, to put their discretion toward creative ends. By exploring the interplay between bottom-up and top-down policymaking, this Article provides a useful counterweight to a number of conventional theories regarding presidential administration, offering insights into debates about agency design and administrative constitutionalism. The relationship between on-theground enforcement and across-the-board executive action can also lend greater legitimacy to the Obama administration’s deferred action programs—both in the federal courts and the court of public opinion...|$|R

5000|$|A {{common form}} of armbinder {{consists}} of a sheath, roughly conical, that encloses both of the wearer's arms from fingertips to above the elbow, holding them together behind the back, combined with one of various harness (straps) arrangements {{to hold it in}} place. The sheath is commonly of latex or leather which itself typically covers the arms from the fingertips to above the elbows, and is closed and tightened with a zipper, lacing, or sometimes both; the sheath is frequently supplemented with straps around the wrists and the elbows or upper arms. The sheath alone is ineffective without a harness to keep it from slipping down the arms; the most common <b>harness</b> is a <b>pair</b> of straps that join to the outer top of the sheath, run over the shoulders and under the armpits, and join again at the inner top of the sheath. The straps are usually crossed, behind the neck or across the upper chest, to prevent the straps from slipping off the shoulders. The latter position can cause problems if the straps tend to ride up and press on the wearer's throat. Left strap is brought from under left armpit, brought over right shoulder and then buckled up behind the neck [...] same is done with right strap and then both right and left strap are buckled together to prevent falling of armbinder. Due to this armbinder, elbows are kept in touch with {{each other for a long}} time which can cause injury if kept for a very long time.|$|R
40|$|The {{time has}} come for donkeys to change their {{international}} image, so that the world can acknowledge their true worth. Unlike horses, animals of high status, donkeys have been associated with poverty and second-best, yet in many African and some Caribbean countries they have an important, though often underestimated, role in rural development. There are about 40 million donkeys (or asses) in the world, of which 12 million (30 %) {{are to be found in}} Africa. They are well adapted to semi-arid ecosytems, and in Africa most donkeys are found in the countries bordering the Sahara desert, with smaller numbers in eastern and southern. Africa. The country with the largest population of donkeys is Ethiopia. Donkeys are traditionally transport animals, used for riding, packing and pulling carts. They have great patience, and are willing to wait for long periods for loads. They are also highly dependable, and this allows them to travel with minimal supervision between places they know well. In comparison to oxen, donkeys can walk or trot quite quickly, and this is a distinct advantage when travelling to and from market. The maximum loads a donkey can carry are surprisingly great for their size' although their ability to draw agricultural implements is more limited due to their light weight. Nevertheless, they are increasingly being used to work with cultivators, seeders and small ploughs in light soils, and there are many development projects currently working on this, including some in The Gambia, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. For heavier work donkeys can be <b>harnessed</b> in <b>pairs</b> or in larger teams. In Botswana, for instance, up to eight donkeys may be hitched to one large plough. Where more power is needed than a donkey can supply, horses or mules may be appropriate. These tend to be specialist transport animals, of high cost and status, but they may be employed for agricultural operations at certain times of the year. For example, in Senegal and Lesotho, transport horses are widely used for rapidly pulling seeders and light cultivators. Mules, formed by crossing a female horse with a male donkey, are excellent work animals that are mainly found in the Americas, North Africa, and northern China. In Ethiopia over one million mules are used for riding and packing while in Swaziland a small number of mules have been used for timber extraction. As mules are high-value, specialized work animals they are rarely used in agriculture in ACP countries since small farmers generally prefer multipurpose work animals (oxen and draft cows) or low-cost, specialized work animals, notably donkeys. Donkey power on the increase In West Africa, the geographical range of donkeys is expanding southwards as the climate changes and the tsetse challenge is reduced. Thirty years ago, donkeys were not common in The Gambia, but now they have replaced oxen as the major draft animals and are used for tillage, seeding and weeding as well as transport. In many societies cattle and horses have social roles relating to wealth and status, and men traditionally control them. In such circumstances, donkeys may prove ideal work animals for use by women and children, since they are easily managed and few rules inhibit their ownership or use. Farmers also argue that donkeys are more appropriate than oxen, being affordable and very easy to train and look after. Moreover, as they are not eaten, donkeys are not stolen for meat, and so can be allowed to roam freely in areas where oxen would need to be guarded. Agricultural production, as well as product marketing can be greatly stimulated through the use of donkey transport. When only human power is available, animal manures and crop residues are often poorly utilized. With the use of carts or donkey panniers, manure can be easily transported to the field, and residues collected for storage. This cycle has the potential for positive feedback: manure application may raise yields, and the stored residues improve draft animal nutrition, facilitating more timely or more extensive land preparation and further yield increases. Perhaps the {{time has come}} for the donkey's true worth to be recognized and for it to be accorded a more important role in agricultural development As an indication that donkeys are now being taken more seriously, a workshop on the role of donkeys, horses and mules in agricultural development was hosted by the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine in Edinburgh in September 1990. About 80 people from 17 countries participated. They included animal scientists and veterinarians, agricultural engineers, staff of development projects and people concerned with animal welfare. Their common interest to increase knowledge and understanding of the neglected donkey. The workshop highlighted the fact that although donkeys are known to provide valuable work and seem capable of thriving with minimal grazing and water, little scientific research has been carried out on them. So, workshop participants resolved to work, in the coming years, for increased understanding, enhanced and improved systems of utilization and greater attention to the care and health of working donkeys.
