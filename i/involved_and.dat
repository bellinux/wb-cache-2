Accordingly, several Japanese units stationed in north-east Borneo were ordered to march to the western side of Borneo.

As Katz later recalled, Corzine offered her a job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the offer. Corzine and the still married Katz were soon dating, and they began appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine's unofficial separation from his wife, Joanne.
