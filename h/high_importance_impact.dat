30|$|Whereas in {{the second}} – micro {{perspective}} - approach, the authors followed a more intuitive logic, which {{is assumed to be}} a standard method in the building of scenarios [48]. In the literature it is described (synonymously) as two-dimensional matrix, scenario-axes technique, four-quadrant scenarios [34, 49]. The technique seeks to identify two key driving forces of the <b>highest</b> <b>importance</b> and <b>impact</b> {{on the development of the}} issue, region, or organisation under research. The two key factors are then plotted on two axes, constructing four scenario quadrants – each representing a different perspective on how the future may unfold. The authors have chosen to introduce company representatives to STEEPVL analysis to help them identify and elicit key driving forces around which individual companies’ scenarios were built. This part was carried out during the practical scenario workshop.|$|R

In fact, this problem {{has become a major}} challenge for all public and private recruitment agencies around the world as well as for employers and job seekers. It is widely agreed that smart algorithms for automatically matching, learning, and querying job offers and candidate profiles will provide a key technology of <b>high</b> <b>importance</b> and <b>impact</b> and will help to counter the lack of skilled labor and/or appropriate job positions for unemployed people. Additionally, such a framework can support global matching aiming at finding an optimal allocation of job seekers to available jobs, which is relevant for independent employment agencies, e. g. in order to reduce unemployment...|$|R
30|$|Insecure {{authentication}} protocols between Fog {{platforms and}} end-user devices {{have been identified}} as a main security concern of Fog computing by [19]. The author’s claim that the IoT devices, especially in smart grids, are prone to data tampering and spoofing attacks and can be prevented {{with the help of a}} Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Intrusion detection techniques and monitoring for modified input values. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate the <b>high</b> <b>importance</b> and <b>impact</b> of MITM attack on Fog computing by launching a Stealth attack on video call between 3 G and the WLAN users within a Fog network. Results show that the attack did not cause any visible change in memory and CPU consumption of Fog node, hence it is quite difficult to detect and mitigate. The authors recommend that the risk of such attacks can be prevented by securing communication channels between the Fog platform and the user through implementing authentication schemes.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the effects of {{technological}} opportunities on the innovation activities of firms, depending on their absorptive capacities. The <b>importance</b> and <b>impacts</b> of the ability of firms to use external knowledge sources were inquired especially for external knowledge stemming from scientific research. Using a simple theoretic model, different innovation effects were empirically outlined for the German manufacturing industry for the first time. On the innovation input side, the effects of science-related technological opportunities in combination with absorptive capacities variables are stronger on the intensities as in the estimations without such proxies. Further, the innovation output of firms is positively influenced by the ability to adapt external knowledge efficiently. Firms in the German manufacturing industry with inhouse absorptive capacities and a <b>high</b> <b>importance</b> of scientific knowledge are characterized by higher sales shares of new and improved products and higher probabilities of patent registrations than other firms. ...|$|R

Various accounting ratios related to liquidity, financial stability and profitability of the company are considered very important and regularly used in credit analysis.

All loan officers gave <b>high</b> <b>importance</b> to the information found in existent auditor’s report format regardless of the form of expressed opinion.
