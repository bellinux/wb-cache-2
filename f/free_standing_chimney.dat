2500|$|The Holocaust {{furnaces}} were {{supplied by}} a number of manufacturers, with the best known and most common being Topf and Sons as well as Kori Company of Berlin, whose ovens were elongated to accommodate two bodies, slid inside from the back side. The ashes were taken out from the front side. The furnaces were also unique, in that they were of a [...] "stand alone" [...] type, meaning that there was no visible duct work for the exhaust gases. These furnaces, based around a design commonly used for hospital incinerators, instead vented the gasses down through a series of ducts embedded in the floor, {{with the help of a}} draft fan located at the far end of the structure. Once outside, the gasses then rose through a <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> <b>chimney,</b> most notable for the fact that it was not directly attached to the structure of the building itself, nor had a visible duct leading into it.|$|E
