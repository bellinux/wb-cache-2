40|$|For years, library {{instruction}} {{has taken place}} in 50 -minute class periods in the library. Librarians have traditionally demonstrated various research tools, occasionally provided students with the opportunity for hands-on practice, and then sent them back to their regular classrooms. Due to these time constraints, this method does not always allow for one-on-one instruction or interaction among students in the class. By following the underlying principles advocated in contemporary learning theories, such as connectivism, librarians can work with teaching <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> students with a collaborative learning experience that extends well beyond the library classroom...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{traditional}} prehospital {{management of}} trauma victims with potential spinal injury {{has become increasingly}} questioned as authors and clinicians have raised concerns about over-triage and harm. In order to address these concerns, the Norwegian National Competence Service for Traumatology commissioned a <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a national guideline for pre-hospital spinal stabilisation. This work {{is based on a}} systematic review of available literature and a standardised consensus process. The faculty recommends a selective approach to spinal stabilisation as well as the implementation of triaging tools based on clinical findings. A strategy of minimal handling should be observed...|$|E

40|$|The power {{industry}} is currently going through many changes due to deregulation. In addition, ABET 2000 has encouraged changes in engineering education. This paper describes efforts by power <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> students more hands-on active learning experience with power systems and power electronics. The courses affected include the energy conversion course required of all electrical engineering students, {{and the power}} laboratory course required of students taking the electric power option. The paper describes work done and in progress to convert the traditional power laboratory into a "power learning environment," in which instruction can flow from lecture to laboratory to computer demonstration formats with ease.

40|$|Many {{challenges}} {{arise when}} managing a library 2 ̆ 7 s social media presence, though the biggest is often generating engaging and interesting content.

I’ll share how {{we have been able}} to work with other campus departments, students, alumni, and <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> concrete examples of what the library can do for our patrons- and how we have been using social media to share these stories. Of course, we don’t ask others to do all of our work, so there will also be discussion of other campaigns, displays, and ideas that we have tried. Attendees will be highly encouraged to share their own social media stories...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{computer software}} concepts: hypertext and expert systems; which {{are useful for}} educational software development. Good educational software enhances the learning process and offers opportunities for <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> additional materials for independent studies, which would otherwise be impossible, due to the limited time and incredible growing rate of technological progress. The hypertext concept offers the students a non-linear learning style, while the expert system concept provides explanation facilities for students to probe {{the logic of the}} systems. Both approaches are extremely useful for educational software. With the proper tools, the courseware can be implemented easily and rapidly. Educational software packages in the area of concrete technology have been currently developed for use in the Department of Civil Engineering at Christian Brothers University. They are utilized as examples. Development tools, KnowledgePro and CBC-Xpert, are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The words {{university}} {{and customer service}} are not normally considered together. However, a university is accountable to its students and the wider community it serves. This paper contends that a business notion of customer service {{can be adapted to}} the university environment and is essential in providing quality student learning experiences. The infrastructure of a university {{plays an important role in}} attracting and retaining students and supporting student learning to graduation and beyond. The experiences of one university’s Corporate Services Directorate with responsibility for student support services, campus life, registry services, human resources and facilities management will be explored.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} a {{complete}} survey of student life among students belonging to the faculty of law of a private university.

To clarify the ability of the <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> to the staff the information needed to instruct the students. By clarifying the students' impressions of the faculty, and their attitudes to studies and extracurricular activities, we would gain more accurate images of the students. 2. To implement organized improvement of the faculty by knowing the students' evaluation of the faculty as soon as possible. 3. To clarify the factors that raise the abilities of students or discourage them, so that we can construct materials for students' self-reflection. To accomplish this purpose, we integrated the data about student life and the data about school achievement...|$|E
30|$|The RCOG should {{consider}} the introduction of intermediate-level training for most trainees in the 5 -year structured training programme. Presently in the UK, {{there are very few}} centres providing level 3 accreditation, and hence, it may be necessary for interested trainees to gain these skills doing a 1 – 2 -year fellowship on completion of their training. Laparoscopic training has been difficult to provide in most surgical programmes [16, 18, 19]. In the USA, formal laparoscopic training has been successfully employed in only 69 % of gynaecology residency programmes [20]. Because of the target culture in the NHS, there is little motivation for trusts and <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> appropriate time for training. As a result, trainees spend more time providing service than being trained. However, training can be acquired with proper planning and provision of individualised training [21]. The use of designated teaching lists, proper case selection and changes in service provision are essential [22]. Lack of funding is a major barrier as well but cannot be allowed to hinder the development of evidenced-based practice.|$|E
40|$|The {{academic}} community {{in almost all}} disciplines is faced with new information sources continuously. Many library resources {{have been replaced by}} electronic ones. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate a Computer Assisted Instruction hypermedia system that helps librarians and <b>faculty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> marketing students of TEI of Thessaloniki with the necessary competencies to locate and interpret the information they need. The product was one of the outcomes of the PhD thesis "Design and development if an interactive multimedia tool: a model for a bibliographic instruction course in a Greek academic institution" that was defended in June 2004 by Stella Korobili at the Department of Library and Information Science, Comenius University. In attempting to prepare the instructional material, there were several concerns: - the epistemological basis for the design and use of a hypermedia system, - the technology that will facilitate students learning, - the preferences of faculty, students and librarians regarding the content of the material, - the links that will help learners to acquire knowledge in multidimensional ways, - how evaluation of the performance of students will be handled...|$|E
