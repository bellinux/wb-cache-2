40|$|In this article, {{we present}} {{the use of}} the Automatic Ground control points Extraction {{technique}} (AGE) for increasing the automation in the geometric correction of high-resolution satellite imagery. The method is based on an image-to-image matching between the satellite data and an already <b>geocoded</b> <b>image</b> (i. e., a digital orthophoto). By using an adaptive least squares matching algorithm which implements a very robust outlier rejection technique, AGE can automatically measure many hundreds of topographic features (TFs) on the images, whose cartographic coordinates are derived from the <b>geocoded</b> <b>image</b> and elevations are extracted from an associated digital elevation model (DEM). The AGE technique has been tested for different high-resolution data: (a) 0. 62 -meter QuickBird panchromatic data (basic imagery processing level), (b) 2. 5 -meter SPOT- 5 /HRG panchromatic supermode data (standard 1 B processing level), and (c) 1 -meter Ikonos panchromatic data (standard Geo product processing level) collected in the Northern of Italy, both in flat (Torino Caselle test site) and mountain areas (Lecco test site). Regardless the relative image resolution between the satellite and the aerial data (1 -meter) and regardless the processing level of the original satellite data, a similar TFs density has been obtained for both the QuickBird and the SPOT- 5 /HRG data (4. 4 GCPs/km 2 and 4. 1 GCPs/km 2) respectively, with a geometric accuracy for the GCPs extracted of 0. 90 m for QuickBird and 3. 90 m for SPOT- 5 /HRG. For the Ikonos imagery, AGE extracted a more dense set of GCPs (8. 7 GCPs/km 2) but with a lower accuracy (3. 19 m). The TFs identified with AGE can be used as GCPs for the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) computation and, therefore, for implementing a full automatic orthoimage generation procedure. By using the commercial off-the-shelf software PCI Geomatica® v. 9. 1, orthoimages have been generated for all datasets. The geometric accuracy was verified on a set of 30 manually measured independent check points (CPs) and assessed a precision of 4. 99 m RMSE for QuickBird, 5. 99 m RMSE for SPOT- 5 /HRG, and 8. 65 m RMSE for Ikonos.

The existing Envisat ASAR Geocoding System (EGEO) can handle all Level 1 -b image products (IMS, APS, IMP, APP, IMM, APM, WSM and GM 1). Complementary to geocoded products provided by ESA (IMG, APG) the geocoding procedure applied at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) makes use of a DEM to achieve higher geolocation accuracy. The resulting <b>geocoded</b> <b>image</b> is either defined as EEC (Enhanced Ellipsoid Corrected) or as ETC (Enhanced Terrain Corrected). These products mainly differ in the underlying DEM used for geocoding. The EEC utilizes GLOBE, while the ETC utilizes the “best ” DEM available in the data base.

Further differences such as the interpolative (EEC) and rigorous (ETC) geocoding approach will also be outlined. Furthermore, an incidence angle mask can be generated. The necessary upgrades for geocoding ASAR stripline products (e. g. IMM, WSM) will be presented.

40|$|Using a {{reference}} data set of high-resolution <b>geocoded</b> <b>images</b> generated from mosaicked digital videography, we {{have examined the}} sources of errors introduced during the accuracy assessment of a regional land-cover map classified from Landsat TM imagery of central Rondônia. We compared the reference data produced by five trained interpreters to quantify the degree of subjectivity in labeling of reference data and to identify which classes {{are most likely to}} be confused by interpreters. Errors were attributed to sources including geolocation difference between reference data and classified map, change between dates, mixed pixels, and disagreement between interpreters. Interpreters disagreed on the classification of almost 30 % of the total samples; mixed pixels accounted for a large proportion of the disagreement. Agreement between any two interpreters in labeling of 30 x 30 m reference samples averaged less than 50 % for the second growth forest class. Approximately 10 % of the error in agreement between map and reference data could be attributed to geolocation error. These findings suggest that 1) definitions of land-cover types such as second growth are more subjective and variable than is commonly assumed; 2) validation data sets that include only non-mixed, non-edge samples are likely to result in overly optimistic accuracy estimates.

This interface is compatible with the OpenGIS Consortium (OGC) version 1. 1. 1 specification so that browse products can be returned as <b>geocoded</b> <b>images</b> in a well-know geographic projection. This will allow them to be displayed on a web browser and merged with other EO and GIS data available from servers already supporting the OGC WMS interface. MUIS contains over 200. 000 browse image products from a large number of sensors flying on-board ESA and Third Party Mission satellites. The images represent a wide variety of sensor types, such as SAR, sweep scanners, push-broom scanners and conical scanners. The browse images in MUIS are stored in their original sensors coordinate system. This makes it necessary for the WMS server to rectify them to match the geographic projection requested in a WMS query. This process is performed on-the-fly. The full set of EPSG namespace projection codes are supported in the rectification, in addition to the OGC specified AUTO namespace projections. The rectification is based on a rigorous geometrical model for the space/image acquisition, taking sensor model and orbital constraints into account. The acquisition model is reconstructed from the browse metadata. It also makes orthorectification possible, by using an on-line global DEM.

40|$|Due to the SAR 1 {{geometry}} imaging, SAR images include geometric distortions {{that would}} be erroneous image information and the images should be geometrically calibrated. As the radar systems are side looking, geometric distortion such as shadow, foreshortening and layover are occurred. To compensate these geometric distortions, information about sensor position, imaging geometry and target altitude from ellipsoid should be available. In this paper, a method for geometric calibration of SAR images is proposed. The method uses Range-Doppler equations. In this method, for the image georeferencing, the DEM 2 of SRTM with 30 m pixel size is used and also exact ephemeris data of the sensor is required. In the algorithm proposed in this paper, first digital elevation model transmit to range and azimuth direction. By applying this process, errors caused by topography such as foreshortening and layover are removed in the transferred DEM.

The correction of these effects becomes indispensable when quantitative image analysis is performed {{with respect to the}} derivation of geo- and biophysical parameters. The paper presents a rigorous approach for geometric and radiometric correction of SAR images. Using a digital elevation model, the imaging geometry is reconstructed and is used to perform geometric and radiometric correction of terrain induced distortions. The importance of a stringent radiometric correction based on the integration of the image brightness is emphasized. The approach guarantees that the energy contained in the image data is preserved throughout the geocoding process. The resulting backscattering images are fully terrain corrected and can be used for further quantitative investigations and may also improve qualitative studies as e. g. land cover classifications.

The algorithms use mathematical models to represent the a priori known context and the objectives of the specific task. These models are used to recognise spatial and temporal patterns which represent the objects under consideration. They may vary from simple (but very general) "man made object" features to highly complex CAD models. Dynamic models are used to discriminate objects with respect to their temporal behaviour. Different such ATR algorithms for screening, classification, <b>geocoding</b> and <b>image</b> registration, recognition, and trajectory analysis within the framework of military applications will be presented showing different complexity of the underlying models and the use of explicit and implicit models...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the use of SAR data in the context of natural disasters. A Curvelet-based change {{detection}} algorithm is presented that automatically extracts changes in the radar back-scattering from two TerraSAR-X acquisitions – pre-disaster and post-disaster - of the same area. After a logarithmic scaling of the <b>geocoded</b> amplitude <b>images</b> the Curvelet-transform is applied. The differ-entiation is then done in the Curvelet-coefficient domain where each coefficient represents the strength of a linear structure apparent in the original image. In order to reduce noise the resulting coefficient differences are weighted by a special function that suppresses minor, noise-like structures. The resulting enhanced coefficients are transformed back to the image domain and brought to the original scaling, so that the values in the difference image describe the increase and the decrease with respect to the amplitude value in the initial image. This approach is applied on three sample data sets: flood, forest fire, and earthquake. For all scenarios including natural landscapes and urban environ-ments as well areas with changes in the radar amplitude are clearly delineated. The interpretation of the changes detected in the radar images needs additional knowledge, e. g. pre-disaster maps. The combination of both could possibly deliver a robust and reliable database for the coordination of res-cue teams after large-scale natural disasters...|$|R
