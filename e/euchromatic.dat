5|$|There are {{two types}} of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and {{contains}} genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories. Active genes, which are generally found in the <b>euchromatic</b> region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.|$|E

25|$|G-banding is {{obtained}} with Giemsa stain following digestion of chromosomes with trypsin. It yields {{a series of}} lightly and darkly stained bands — the dark regions tend to be heterochromatic, late-replicating and AT rich. The light regions tend to be <b>euchromatic,</b> early-replicating and GC rich. This method will normally produce 300–400 bands in a normal, human genome.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "imprinting" [...] {{was first}} used to {{describe}} events in the insect Pseudococcus nipae.

Thus follows the popular statement that [...] "we are all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9% the same", although this would be somewhat qualified by most geneticists. For example, a much larger fraction of the genome is now thought {{to be involved in}} copy number variation. A large-scale collaborative effort to catalog SNP variations in the human genome is being undertaken by the International HapMap Project.|$|E
2500|$|The Human Genome Project was a 15-year-long, {{publicly}} funded project initiated in 1990 {{with the objective}} of determining the DNA sequence of the entire <b>euchromatic</b> human genome within 15 years.

2500|$|A public genome {{sequencing}} effort of cotton was initiated in 2007 by {{a consortium of}} public researchers. They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. [...] "Tetraploid" [...] means that cultivated cotton actually has two separate genomes within its nucleus, {{referred to as the}} A and D genomes. The sequencing consortium first agreed to sequence the D-genome relative of cultivated cotton (G. raimondii, a wild Central American cotton species) because of its small size and limited number of repetitive elements. It is nearly one-third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton (AD), and each chromosome is only present once. The A genome of G. arboreum would be sequenced next. Its genome is roughly twice the size of G. raimondiis. Part of the difference in size between the two genomes is the amplification of retrotransposons (GORGE). Once both diploid genomes are assembled, then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties. This strategy is out of necessity; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the <b>euchromatic</b> DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences respectively. Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to a very high mutation burden, MMR deficiencies result in an unusual distribution of somatic mutations across the human genome: this suggests that MMR preferentially protects the gene-rich, early-replicating <b>euchromatic</b> regions. In contrast, the gene-poor, late-replicating heterochromatic genome regions exhibit high mutation rates in many human tumors.|$|E
50|$|Male PGCs {{become known}} as gonocytes once they cease {{migration}} and undergo mitosis. The term gonocyte is generally used to describe all stages post PGC until the gonocytes differentiate into spermatogonia. Anatomically, gonocytes can be identified as large, <b>euchromatic</b> cells that often have two nucleoli in the nucleus.|$|E
50|$|Eu{{chromatin}} is {{a lightly}} packed form of chromatin (DNA, RNA and protein) that is enriched in genes, {{and is often}} (but not always) under active transcription. Euchromatin comprises the most active portion of the genome within the cell nucleus. 92% {{of the human genome}} is <b>euchromatic.</b> The remainder is called heterochromatin.|$|E

50|$|One {{epigenetic}} mechanism {{employed in}} the control of latency for CMV is heterochromatization of the viral genome. Studies have shown that during latency the IE promoter is heterochromatic while the LUNA promoter is <b>euchromatic.</b> It has also been found that latently infected cells are more enriched for histones relative to the cellular genes. This keeps the transcriptional machinery {{from being able to}} access the viral transcripts.|$|E

5000|$|The male-specific {{region of}} the Y {{chromosome}} contains a mosaic of heterochromatic sequences. In addition, it also made up of three classes of <b>euchromatic</b> sequence, which are the ampliconic genes, X-transposed, and X-degenerate. It {{has also been shown}} that an additional <b>euchromatic</b> sequence exists for the Yq11 {{region of the}} Y chromosome. These regions are all primarily interchromosomal. There are also three additional euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions for a total of four on the Y chromosome. Together, these are Yp11.2/Yp11.1, Yq11.1/Yq11.21, Yq11.23/Yq12, and Yq12/PAR2. Of these four regions, the Yq11.23/Yq12 region is unique in its structure as it is composed of recurrent TPTE and SLC25A15 duplicons which have originated from different long arms regions of chromosome 13. Furthermore, the Yp11.2/Yp11.1 and Yq11.1/Yq11.21 regions contain the more ancient duplications and are predominantly located in the subtelomeric regions. Nowadays, these duplications prefer to map to the pericentromeric regions in the modern human and chimpanzee. There has been a shift from the subtelomeric regions of the Old World monkeys to the pericentromeric regions of the modern primate. This evolutionary change coincides with the shortening of the subtelomeric regions as well as the development of higher-order alpha-satellites. 8 ...|$|E
50|$|Constitutive {{heterochromatin}} {{is found}} more commonly in {{the periphery of}} the nucleus attached to the nuclear membrane. This concentrates the <b>euchromatic</b> DNA {{in the center of the}} nucleus where it can be actively transcribed. During mitosis it is believed that constitutive heterochromatin is necessary for proper segregation of sister chromatids and centromere function. The repeat sequences found at the pericentromeres are not conserved throughout many species and depend more on epigenetic modifications for regulation, while telomeres show more conserved sequences.|$|E
50|$|Many {{overlapping}} reads {{for each}} {{segment of the}} original DNA are necessary to overcome these difficulties and accurately assemble the sequence. For example, to complete the Human Genome Project, most {{of the human genome}} was sequenced at 12X or greater coverage; that is, each base in the final sequence was present on average in 12 different reads. Even so, current methods have failed to isolate or assemble reliable sequence for approximately 1% of the (<b>euchromatic)</b> human genome, as of 2004.|$|E
50|$|In {{rare cases}} in humans, neocentromeres can form at new {{sites on the}} chromosome. There are {{currently}} over 90 known human neocentromeres identified on 20 different chromosomes. The formation of a neocentromere must be coupled with the inactivation of the previous centromere, since chromosomes with two functional centromeres (Dicentric chromosome) will result in chromosome breakage during mitosis. In some unusual cases human neocentromeres have been observed to form spontaneously on fragmented chromosomes. Some of these new positions were originally <b>euchromatic</b> and lack alpha satellite DNA altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Chromosome 20 {{is one of}} the 23 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}} in humans. Chromosome 20 spans around 63 million base pairs (the building material of DNA) and represents between 2 and 2.5 percent of the total DNA in cells. Chromosome 20 was fully sequenced in 2001 and was reported to contain over 59 million base pairs representing 99.4% of the <b>euchromatic</b> DNA. [...] Since then, due to sequencing improvements and fixes, the length of chromosome 20 has been updated to just over 63 million base pairs.|$|E
50|$|Most B {{chromosomes}} {{are mainly}} or entirely heterochromatic (and {{so would be}} largely non-coding), but some, such as the B chromosomes of maize, contain sizeable <b>euchromatic</b> segments. In general {{it seems unlikely that}} supernumeraries would persist in a species unless there was some positive adaptive advantage, which in a few cases has been identified. For instance, the British grasshopper Myrmeleotettix maculatus has two structural types of B chromosomes: metacentrics and submetacentrics. The supernumeraries, which have a satellite DNA, occur in warm, dry environments, and are scarce or absent in humid, cooler localities.|$|E
50|$|Using {{the model}} {{organism}} Drosophila melanogaster, data has been compiled regarding the genomic information and sequencing of this organism.

50|$|There {{are some}} clear ultrastructural {{features}} that differentiate telocytes from fibroblasts.

TC cellular body average dimensions are, as measured on EM images, 9.3 μm ± 3.2 μm (min. 6.3μm; max. 16.4 μm). Fibroblast nucleus is typically <b>euchromatic,</b> but TC nucleus is mostly heterochromatic. Mitochondria represent only 2% of cell body volume and the Golgi complex is small in TC. Fibroblasts Golgi complex is prominent and the rough endoplasmic reticulum is very well developed (usually 5-12%) of cell volume.|$|E
