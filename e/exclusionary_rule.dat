Evidence gathered by state law enforcement was therefore not yet bound by the same strictures as that gathered by federal law enforcement.|$|E

In this paper, we address the general topic of excluding factually relevant evidence, that is, the kind of evidence that would rationally influence the jury 2 ̆ 7 s verdict if it were admitted. We do not offer a comprehensive analysis of these <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules,</b> but add to the existing literature by identifying a new domain for economic analysis, focusing on how juries respond to the existence of such a rule.

The <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rule</b> would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution.

His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment guards against {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned {{and supported by}} probable cause. It was adopted {{as a response to}} the abuse of the writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution. Search and seizure (including arrest) must be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. The amendment is the basis for the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rule,</b> which mandates that evidence obtained illegally cannot be introduced into a criminal trial. The amendment's interpretation has varied over time; its protections expanded under left-leaning courts such as that headed by Earl Warren and contracted under right-leaning courts such as that of William Rehnquist.|$|E

25|$|Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25 (1949) was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held 6-3 that, while the Fourth Amendment was {{applicable}} to the states, the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rule</b> was not a necessary ingredient of the Fourth Amendment's right against warrantless and unreasonable searches and seizures. In Weeks v. United States 232 U.S. 383 (1914) the Court held that as a matter of judicial implication the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rule</b> was enforceable in federal courts but not derived from the explicit requirements of the Fourth Amendment. The Wolf Court decided not to incorporate the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rule</b> as part of the Fourth Amendment in large part because the States which had rejected the Weeks Doctrine (the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rule)</b> had not left the right to privacy without other means of protection (i.e. the States had their own rules to deter police officers from conducting warrantless and unreasonable searches and seizures). However, because most of the States' rules proved to be ineffective in deterrence, the Court overruled Wolf in Mapp v. Ohio 367 U.S. 643 (1961). This landmark case made the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rule</b> enforceable against the States through the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the same extent that it applied against the federal government.|$|E

40|$|The <b>exclusionary</b> {{evidence}} <b>rules</b> {{derived from}} the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments continue {{to play an important}} role in constitutional criminal procedure, despite the intense controversy that surrounds them. The primary justification for these rules has shifted from an 2 ̆ 2 imperative of judicial integrity 2 ̆ 2 to the 2 ̆ 2 deterrence of police conduct that violates [...] . [constitutional] rights. 2 ̆ 2 Regardless of the justification it uses for the rules 2 ̆ 7 existence, the Supreme Court continues to limit their breadth 2 ̆ 2 at the margin, 2 ̆ 2 when 2 ̆ 2 the acknowledged costs to other values vital to a rational system of criminal justice 2 ̆ 2 outweigh the deterrent effects of exclusion. The most notable limitation on the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules</b> is the impeachment exception, which permits the use of illegally obtained evidence at trial to impeach the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s testimony. The shift from a judicial integrity rationale to a deterrence rationale for the rules, however, does not explain the origins of this exception. The Court created the impeachment exception in 1954 in Walder v. United States before rejecting the judicial integrity approach. Walder suggests that the Court has supported the exception based on principle, as well as on policy considerations. This article argues that attempts to justify the impeachment exception as a matter of policy or as a matter of principle are equally misguided. Both methods wrongly consider the integrity of factfinding at a criminal trial a value that can meaningfully be balanced against the constitutional values protected by the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules.</b> Instead, a coherent approach to the scope of the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules</b> must approach that question entirely as a matter of constitutional criminal procedure. Constitutional guarantees do not supply independent values to balance against the integrity of factfinding-they define that integrity. Consequently, the impeachment exception should be eliminated because it improperly compromises constitutional rules of criminal procedure in the name of furthering what the Court claims to be 2 ̆ 2 other values vital to a rational system of criminal justice. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Like many {{international}} tribunals, the International Court of Justice subscribes {{heavily to}} the principle of free admissibility of evidence. Neither its statute nor rules impose substantive restrictions on the admissibility of evidence, whether by way of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules</b> or an <b>exclusionary</b> discretion. Instead, the court’s practice has been to focus on evaluating and weighing the evidence after it has been admitted. There are certainly features of the ICJ that sets it apart from domestic courts and arguably justify such an approach: the ICJ is for settling disputes between sovereign states; it does not use a typical fact-finding system; its rules and practices reflect a mix of civil and common law traditions; and traditional <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules</b> were not conceived with inter-state dispute resolution in mind. Yet for any judgment to have legitimacy, the evidential foundations must be strong and there should be a coherent and principled mechanism to sieve out problematic evidence at an early stage. Having this mechanism can also ensure that resources are not wasted and rights protected. Through an examination of the court’s rules and jurisprudence and the rules and practices of other international tribunals, this article makes the case for the codification of a provision that gives the ICJ an exclusionary discretion...|$|R

40|$|The most {{problematic}} part of Professor Mirjan Damaška 2 ̆ 7 s fine {{book is the}} title. 2 ̆ 7 Professor Damaška does {{an excellent}} job of situating American evidence law in the procedural context in which American trials occur. He identifies three major procedural elements. First, juries are traditionally cited as the primary or sole explanation for our extensive set of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules,</b> which are said to express mistrust of lay adjudicators. Professor Damaška points out as well that lay juries permit a divided court, with a professional judge who has exclusive control over 2 ̆ 2 questions of law, 2 ̆ 2 and that this division is necessary for the operation of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules</b> because it makes it possible to keep the excluded evidence from the notice of the trier of fact. Second, our privatized system of factfinding is based on party control over the production of evidence, which polarizes the presentation and makes the evidence itself suspect. Finally, the use of one-time, single-case juries requires concentrated trials that take place in a continuous and comparatively compact period of time. Given this temporal concentration, questions about the reliability of evidence must be resolved quickly-frequently on the spot-which limits the possibility of additional investigation or rebuttal, and favors exclusion as a remedy. Professor Damaška 2 ̆ 7 s argument (to which I have not nearly done justice) is rich {{and for the most part}} persuasive. But why call it Evidence Law Adrift? A stronger case could be made that evidence law is fixed in place, or at least tightly tethered...|$|R
40|$|A {{peculiar}} {{principle of}} legal evidence in common law systems is that probative evidence may be excluded {{in order to}} increase the accuracy of fact-finding. A formal model is provided that rationalizes this principle. The key assumption is that the fact-finders (jurors) have a cognitive cost of processing evidence, an assumption well grounded in the psychological literature. Within this framework, the judge excludes evidence in order to incentivize the jury to focus on other, more probative evidence. Our analysis sheds light on two distinctive characteristics of this type of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules.</b> First, that broad exclusionary powers are delegated to the judge. Second, that exclusion by undue prejudice is peculiar to common law systems. Both features arise in our model. 1 InformationAcquisitionandtheExclusionofEvidencei...|$|R

United States, the Court held unanimously that illegal seizure of items {{from a private}} residence {{was a violation of}} the Fourth Amendment, and established the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rule</b> that prohibits admission of illegally obtained evidence in federal courts.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the American and English evidential rules {{relating to the}} admissibility of evidence obtained by illegal search or improperly by the police. It attempts to discover the theoretical bases of the different rules in these jurisdictions. The police powers of search are first examined and then the thesis critically discusses the reasons for {{and the purpose of}} the English courts' general discretion to exclude relevant evidence; the aim is to determine whether this discretion has the same purpose and function in the various areas of the law of evidence. In my conclusion the real rationale of the American <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules</b> is the protection of certain fundamental values - the policy and value postulates peculiar to a politically free and democratic society. In using these as focal points the Supreme Court has attributed a dynamic function to the rules of evidence in the area of constitutional law; contrary to the English view the purpose of the evidential rules is not solely to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. The written constitution, though not the explanation for the strict <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules,</b> does provide certain important concepts which the Supreme Court has used to justify the bolder approach to supporting the constitutional rights with the rules of evidence. The origin of the American rules is the Court's supervisory jurisdiction over criminal trials. The English rule, on the other hand, {{is the result of the}} self-imposed restrictive role of the courts, though there are understandable reasons for this. For England the inclusionary rule may be inevitable, but it has three serious defects. First, it has been arrived at by accident; it lacks theoretical justification and is inconsistent with the confession rule. Secondly, judicial statements as to the Courts' discretion to exclude such evidence are linguistically almost meaningless. Lastly, there appears to be a lack of appreciation that in the area of constitutionally defined rights rules of evidence can have as much importance as substantive rights...|$|R

40|$|Competition Policy for Computer Software Markets” Against the {{backdrop}} of the ongoing Microsoft antitrust litigation, this paper examines issues of competition policy for computer software markets. US antitrust law provides the main focus, but occasional parallels are drawn with the EU competition regime. A “dynamic compatibility regime ” is proposed. This involves a recognition that various restrictions (e. g. the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>rules</b> of a joint venture, or strong intellectual property protection) work to provide the initial safeguards or incentives necessary to encourage firms to engage in winner-takes-all “standards races”. Once a standard is established, however, the argument for such restrictions becomes far less convincing. Competition policy should recognise that quality access to the technical information underlying an established standard is likely to be indispensable for effective, ongoing competition in related markets. Where this is the case, the policy goal should be to encourage interoperability (i. e. compatibility between products which are complements to the standard) by compelling access to that information...|$|R
