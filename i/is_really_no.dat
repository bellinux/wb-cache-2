Thereafter, she has said that she intends to [...] "slow down" [...] by focusing on her teaching, although she has remarked: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> such thing called a swan song, and I won't like to keep still after being so active. ... I will keep dancing {{as long as my}} body will say yes to me".|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{appeared}} for Sir Oswald Mosley {{in several}} cases during the 1930s, having become friends with him while in Parliament. The first was a libel case against The Star, who had written a comment on one of Mosley's speeches implying that he advocated an armed revolution to overthrow the British government. [...] The case opened at the Royal Courts of Justice on 5 November 1934 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings representing Mosley, and Norman Birkett The Star. Birkett argued that The Star article {{was nothing more than}} a summary of Mosley's speech, and that any comments implying the overthrow of the British government were found in the speech itself. Hastings countered that The Star was effectively accusing Mosley of high treason, and said that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> defence to this action...I do ask for such damages as will mark [...] sense of the injustice which has been done to Sir Oswald". The jury eventually decided that The Star had libelled Mosley, and awarded him £5,000 in damages (approximately £ in 2015).|$|E
500|$|The Haunting {{opened to}} mixed reception, the {{consensus}} generally being {{that it was}} a stylish film but had major flaws in the plot and lacked excitement. Variety called the acting effective, Davis Boulton's cinematography extraordinarily dexterous and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott's production design of the [...] "monstrous" [...] house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding's screenplay had [...] "major shortcomings" [...] in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times cited The Haunting as [...] "one of the most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced" [...] but surmised that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> point to it". Writing in The Atlantic magazine, critic Pauline Kael called the film [...] "moderately elegant and literate and expensive", but criticised Russ Tamblyn for being [...] "feeble [...] cowardly-comic". She considered the film to be superior to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, also released in 1963, yet didn't consider it to be a great film. Kael said of it, [...] "It wasn't a great movie but I certainly wouldn't have thought that it could offend anyone. Yet part of the audience at The Haunting wasn't merely bored, it was hostile—as if the movie, by assuming interests they didn't have, made them feel resentful or inferior. I've never felt this in an audience toward crude, bad movies… But the few scattered people at The Haunting were restless and talkative, the couple sitting near me arguing—the man threatening to leave, the woman assuring him that something would happen. In their terms, they were cheated: nothing happened. And, of course, they missed what was happening all along, perhaps because of nervous impatience or a primitive notion that the real things are physical." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Bart D Ehrman: [...] "Mary (Magdalene) is accorded a {{high status}} among the apostles of Jesus."

2500|$|At {{the time}} Meitner herself {{wrote in a}} letter, [...] "Surely Hahn fully {{deserved}} the Nobel Prize for chemistry. There <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> doubt about it. But I believe that Otto Robert Frisch and I contributed something not insignificant to the clarification {{of the process of}} uranium fission—how it originates and that it produces so much energy and that was something very remote to Hahn." [...] In a similar vein, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Lise Meitner's former assistant, later added that Hahn [...] "certainly did deserve this Nobel Prize. He would have deserved it even if he had not made this discovery. But everyone recognized that the splitting of the atomic nucleus merited a Nobel Prize." [...] Frisch wrote similarly in a 1955 letter.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 December, Hahn {{was persuaded}} {{by two of}} his captors {{to write a letter}} to the Nobel {{committee}} accepting the prize but also stating {{that he would not be}} able to attend the award ceremony. He could not participate in the Nobel festivities on 10 December since his captors would not allow him to leave Farm Hall. Meitner said in a letter to her friend B. Broomé-Aminoff on November 20, 1945:Surely Hahn fully deserved the Nobel Prize in chemistry. There <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> doubt about it.

2500|$|The persona, he argues, is a mask for the [...] "{{collective}} psyche", a {{mask that}} 'pretends' individuality, so that both {{self and others}} believe in that identity, even if it <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> more than a well-played role through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the [...] "persona-mask" [...] as a complicated system which mediates between individual consciousness and the social community: it is [...] "a compromise {{between the individual and}} society as to what a man should appear to be". But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a character mask in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression to others, and to hide (part of) {{the true nature of the}} individual. The therapist then aims to assist the individuation process through which the client (re)gains his [...] "own self" [...] – by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the persona, and from the power of unconscious impulses.|$|E
2500|$|Janet Carr told News.com.au, [...] "When {{we first}} started [...] we knew there was nothing out there in {{mainstream}} media that satisfied us as gamers, and so we made the show from within the community...

[...] News.com.au said, [...] "Good Game thrives from online interaction with its viewers, offering free episodes and even gaming sessions with the team", citing Carr's explanation: [...] "Our forums are incredibly active, we play games regularly with people who watch the show, and the emails they send are like, 'Hey Jungy (co-host Junglist), thanks for knifing me last night!'" [...] After spontaneously deciding to attend the EB Games Gold Coast conference, thinking the experience would be lonely and awkward, Hex and Bajo were overwhelmed by the response; the hundreds of people in queues to go see them. It was due to fan requests that Ask Good Game – an exclusive segment to Good Game: Spawn Point for some time – was added back to the parent show. In 2013, Bajo and Hex had an AMA with their fans on Reddit.|$|E
