Malaysia has stated that a final report on Flight 370 will be released {{by the end of}} 2017. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted.|$|E

25|$|As Helmsman Cho sharply {{turned the}} wheel from 135 to 150 degrees, Sewol began to list to port and tilt towards the water. The overall effect {{was that the}} ship turned about 45 degrees to the right, then rotated 22 degrees on the spot for a span of 20 seconds. The cargo falling {{to one side of}} the ship caused Sewol to lose all her {{restoring}} force and allowed water to flow into the ship through the side door of the cargo loading bay and the car entrance located at the stern. This scenario was confirmed by simulations separately run by the expert advisory panel on the <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>team,</b> the Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, and the Advanced Marine Engineering Center of Seoul National University. The chief engineer testified that the tilting lasted for about two to three minutes after the initial tilt.

40|$|Bilateral or {{multilateral}} {{criminal investigations}} {{and the need}} to gather evidence abroad is nowadays more and more frequent. However, it is a complex process because of the diversity of legal instruments in force in Spain. To solve the existing problems, it is crucial to develop legislation establishing common rules to issue and execute letters of requests in pursuing of transborder evidence. This new legislation should clearly specify the role of the different legal operators that participate in criminal investigations, judges, public prosecutors and legal clerks, as well as the role of the Ministry of Justice as Central Authority. The multiple international conventions in force in Spain include provisions to request that any evidence obtained abroad be gathered following Spanish procedural formalities required under the Spanish law and jurisprudence to be admissible as evidence. The new legislation should include as an obligation that any Spanish request to other countries incorporate the description of the requirements for the requested evidence to be admissible in Spain. Likewise, it should specify how the parties in the case can participate in the issuing and in the execution procedures. The new legislation should also address the setting up of <b>Joint</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Teams,</b> granting full authority for its constitution to the investigating judge and modifying the current law that requires for its establishment an authorization from the Ministry of Justice. Equally, the role of the Spanish public prosecutors in these <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> should be similar to the role described to them in the Spanish criminal procedures rules. Recent legislation (Law 16 / 2015), does not describe with sufficient clarity the role of liaison magistrates and of the networks on international cooperation in criminal matters. It is necessary a more detailed regulation to incorporate these legal operators that can efficiently facilitate transborder evidence gathering. Similarly, the new legislation should also describe more clearly the powers granted to the Spanish National Member at Eurojust, specifically those related to criminal investigations initiated by another Member State, to the access to Eurojust of the Spanish investigating judge in national investigations and how information of Eurojust investigations are given to the defense counsel [...] ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} belief that {{organized}} crime has enormous social cost as it removes and squander financial and human resources, creates distortions {{in the common}} free market, influences the legal economy and action of enterprises, strengthens the corruption and violating human rights.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Australia and the European Union (EU) have {{different}} structures of governance, histories, and cultures, both entities face remarkably similar problems in relation to police cooperation across borders. Australia is divided in nine different criminal jurisdictions, each of them policed by its own police force. Problems of border crossing, information exchange and <b>joint</b> <b>investigations</b> therefore arise {{similar to those in}} the EU. These problems have intensified in the 20 th century with globalisation and the increased mobility of offenders.

40|$|With the 2001 EU Action Plan and the 2005 EU Counterterrorism Strategy, the European Union has {{unfolded}} a roadmap for counter-terrorism {{measures and}} an itinerary of actions to be {{undertaken by the}} Member States. In some respects, the EU strategies, flanked by the Action Plans in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, {{as well as more}} concrete forms of cooperation such as the adoption of the EU Arrest Warrant, the Member States have been encouraged to use the same conceptual apparatus, to adopt the precautionary logic (pre-terrorism), and to adopt similar organizational models (multi-disciplinary cooperation) and tools (surveillance, public-private cooperation, etc.). This may have led to a level of convergence between the national counter-terrorism approaches, in line with what the Action Plan on Organized Crime in 1997 sought to achieve by demanding from Member States that they would adapt their national structures. The number of policy-impulses that has emanated from the EU Counterterrorism strategy and ensuing policy documents has been rather numerous.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{transnational}} {{organised crime}} (TOC) {{has emerged as}} a threat to national and international security. As a result, the United Nations implemented the Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) in 2000, which aims to improve international legislation and facilitate cooperation between state parties. This research aims to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the UNTOC and the European Union’s framework, as well as take advantage of a comparative analysis so as to determine whether the international legal system may benefit from elements employed at EU level. Moreover, key challenges facing implementation and monitoring on an international level are addressed. Finally, traditional as well as non-traditional measures to combat organised crime are proposed which may be used so as to strengthen the international legal framework and to overcome weaknesses of the current framework. The above mentioned aims were achieved by conducting doctrinal (‘black letter law’) research, doctrinal research searching secondary authority, socio-legal research (‘law in practice’) and, finally, comparative cross-jurisdictional research. The research found that the fight against TOC has been characterised by the definitional opaqueness of TOC and the complexity intrinsic to law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Nevertheless, the convention provides a solid basis for mutual legal assistance and law-enforcement cooperation. The UNTOC serves as a framework of international legislation and facilitates cooperation between state parties. It does not constitute an operational treaty, which oversees specific crime-fighting activities. As a whole, state parties remain wary of using the UNTOC as it does not provide a clear, elaborate concept upon which states may rely, legislate and train around. New practices and legal innovations, such as the establishment of <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> or the integration of other fields of law, need to be considered in order to address all facets of TOC, be it cross-border criminality or economic changes.
