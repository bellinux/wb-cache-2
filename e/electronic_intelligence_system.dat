25|$|The {{reconnaissance}} {{version of}} the Vigilante, the RA-5C, had slightly greater wing area and added a long canoe-shaped fairing under the fuselage for a multi-sensor reconnaissance pack. This added an APD-7 side-looking airborne radar (SLAR), AAS-21 infrared line scanner, and camera packs, as well as improved ECM. An AN/ALQ-61 <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>system</b> could also be carried. The RA-5C retained the AN/ASB-12 bombing system, and could, in theory, carry weapons, although it never did in service. Later-build RA-5Cs had more powerful J79-10 engines with afterburning thrust of 17,900lbf (80kN). The reconnaissance Vigilante weighed almost five tons more than the strike version with almost the same thrust and an only modestly enlarged wing. These changes cost it acceleration and climb rate, though it remained fast in level flight.|$|E

5000|$|China is {{the most}} {{important}} supplier of military aid and maintains extensive strategic and military cooperation. Since 1989, China has supplied Burma with jet fighters, armored vehicles and naval vessels and has trained Burmese army, air force and naval personnel. Access to Burma's ports and naval installations provide China with strategic influence in the Bay of Bengal, in the wider Indian Ocean region and in Southeast Asia. China has developed a deep-water port on Kyaukpyu in the Bay of Bengal. It has also built an 85-metre jetty, naval facilities and major reconnaissance and <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> on the Great Coco Island, located 18 kilometres from India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, giving China capabilities to monitor India's military activities, including missile tests. However the building of <b>intelligence</b> <b>systems</b> on the island is widely regarded as a myth today and the Indian forces recently denied their existence [...] China assists in constructing a naval base in Sittwe, a strategically important sea port close to eastern India's largest city and port, Kolkata. Beijing also funds road construction linking Yangon and Sittwe, providing the shortest route to the Indian Ocean from southern China.|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to improve the {{probability}} of interception of frequency sweep and lower the system complexity of non-sweep mode of the <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>system</b> for frequency agile radar signal. A low complexity receiver structure and its associated demodulation algorithm with high probability of intercept are also presented. Moreover, the applicability of this structure for the wideband radar signal is demonstrated. First, the received signal is modulated by analog signal and treated as the local oscillator to move the local signal with different Nyquist zone into the baseband to extract the zone information. Then, the digital local oscillator synchronized with the analog modulation is used to reconstruct the demodulated sub-sampling signal. Finally, the zone and sub-sampling signal {{could be used to}} estimate signal parameters by the classical signal processing methods. Simulation results show that when the signal to noise ratio is more than- 16 dB, the probability of correct decision for the Nyquist zone is better than 90 %...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{effective}} {{detection method}} is proposed for <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> (ELINT) <b>systems</b> detecting polyphase codes radar signal {{in the low}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario. The core idea of the proposed method is first to calculate the time-frequency distribution of polyphase codes radar signals via Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD); then the modified Hough transform (HT) is employed to cumulate all the energy of WVD’s ridges effectively to achieve signal detection. Compared with the generalised Wigner Hough transform (GWHT) method, the proposed method has a superior performance in low SNR and is not sensitive to the code type. Simulation results verify {{the validity of the}} proposed method...|$|R
50|$|Modified and re-designated RC-135B {{aircraft}} {{used for}} strategic reconnaissance duties, {{equipped with the}} AN/ASD-1 <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> (ELINT) <b>system.</b> This system was characterized by the large 'cheek' pods on the forward fuselage containing the Automated ELINT Emitter Locating System (AEELS - not Side Looking Airborne Radar - SLAR, as often quoted), as well as numerous other antennae and a camera position in the refuelling pod area of the aft fuselage. The aircraft was crewed by two pilots, two navigators, numerous intelligence gathering specialists, inflight maintenance technicians and airborne linguists. When the RC-135C was fully deployed, SAC was able to retire its fleet of RB-47H Stratojets from active reconnaissance duties. All ten continue in active service as either RC-135V Rivet Joint or RC-135U Combat Sent platforms.|$|R
40|$|Pulse {{repetition}} interval (PRI) analysis {{based on}} histogram method {{is widely used}} in <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> (ELINT) <b>systems</b> for emitter recognition. The identification of PRI modulation types using the statistical histogram method has faced inaccurate recognition due to error caused by missing and spurious pulses. In this study, the modelling for the statistical prediction of spurious and missing pulses is done to estimate their distributions density of occurrences that {{can be related to}} the robustness of the PRI analysis method. The statistical modelling is simulated using the histogram PRI analysis method and the proposed model is tested for its feasibility using Monte-Carlo simulation. The results obtained show that the proposed model can be used to estimate the presence of missing and spurious pulses, and can be used for testing of the robustness of PRI analysis methods...|$|R
50|$|India {{received}} three ex-Soviet Naval Aviation Il-38s in 1977, {{with two}} more arriving in 1983. Indian modifications included fitting pylons to the fuselage side to carry the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile. The Il-38s of the Indian Navy have been sent back to Russia for upgrades. They will incorporate the new Sea Dragon avionic suite, incorporating a new radar, a Forward looking infrared (FLIR) turret under the nose and an <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> (ELINT) <b>system</b> housed in a box-like structure mounted on struts above the forward fuselage. Three upgraded aircraft, designated Il-38 SD, have been delivered to the Indian Navy. There are reports of efforts towards adding the capability to fire the Indo-Russian Brahmos cruise missile from this aircraft. Mockups have been displayed with air-launched Brahmos attached to underwing pylons on the Indian Navy aircraft.|$|R
40|$|The <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> (ELINT) <b>system</b> {{is used by}} the {{military}} to detect, extract information and classify incoming radar signals. This work utilizes short time Fourier transform (STFT) - time frequency distribution (TFD) for inter-pulse analysis of the radar signal in order to estimate basic radar signal time parameters (pulse width and pulse repetition period). Four well-known windows functions of different and unique characteristics were used for the localization of STFT to determine their various effects on the analysis. The window functions are Hamming, Hanning, Bartlett and Blackman window functions. Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to determine the performance of the signal analysis in presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Results show that the lower the transition of main lobe width and higher the peak side lobe, the better the performance of the window function irrespective of time parameter being estimated. This is because 100 percent probability of correct estimation is achieved at signal to noise ratio of about - 2 dB for Bartlett, 4 dB for both Hamming and Hanning, and 9 dB for Blackman...|$|R

50|$|Navy Day {{is celebrated}} on 8 September to commemorate its {{service in the}} Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. The navy lost {{one-half}} of its force in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The Navy heavily depended on American-built naval technology and operated a large infrastructure from 1947-1971. The Pressler amendment forced an embargo in the 1990s, during which the navy developed air independent propulsion (AIP) technology purchased from France and built the Agosta-class submarines; two of these (as well {{as one of the}} new frigates) were built at Pakistan's facilities in Karachi. The navy's surface fleet consists of helicopter carriers, destroyers, frigates, amphibious assault ships, patrol ships, mine-countermeasures, and miscellaneous vessels. Established in 1972, the Naval Air Arm provides fleet air defence, maritime reconnaissance, and anti-submarine warfare capability. Mirage 5 aircraft donated by the PAF are flown by the Navy, equipped with Exocet anti-ship missiles. The Navy's fleet of P-3C Orion turboprop aircraft, equipped with <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> (ELINT) <b>systems,</b> play a pivotal role in the Navy's gathering of intelligence. Since 2001, the navy has emphasized its role and expanded its operational scope across the country with the establishment of Naval Strategic Forces Command, based in Islamabad.|$|R
50|$|The Type 909 is {{the second}} {{purposely}} built weapon trial ship in PLAN, {{and in addition to}} conducting weapon trials for missiles, guns and rockets, the ship is also tasked to test electronic systems such as radars, communication <b>systems</b> and <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> and warfare <b>systems.</b> Designed to first supplement and then eventually replace the Yanxi-class weapon trials ship that entered service more than three decades earlier, The Type 909 has received NATO reporting name Wuhu-B class. The design incorporates specially designed accommodations for research crew to carry out their mission. The pennant number of Type 909 went through several changes, originally 909, and this was changed to 970 to avoid confusing with the type number. Subsequently, the pennant number was changed to 891. Originally only with pennant number but without any name, the ship was finally formally named as Bi Sheng on October 10, 2002.|$|R
40|$|Overview: Japan is quintessentially by {{geography}} a maritime country. Maritime surveillance capabilities – underwater, shore-based and airborne – {{are critical}} to its national defence posture. This book describes and assesses these capabilities, with particular respect to the underwater segment, about which there is little strategic analysis in publicly available literature. Since {{the end of the}} Cold War, Chinese oceanographic and navy vessels have intruded into Japanese waters with increasing frequency, not counting their activities in disputed waters such as around the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands and Okinotorishima where China and Japan have overlapping territorial claims. These intrusions have increasingly involved warships, including submarines, sometimes acting quite aggressively. Japan maintains an extraordinary network of undersea hydrophone arrays, connected to shore-stations which are typically equipped with <b>electronic</b> <b>intelligence</b> (ELINT) <b>systems,</b> for monitoring, identifying and tracking submarine and surface traffic in its internal straits and surrounding seas. Some parts of this network are operated jointly with, and are of crucial importance to, the US Navy. Japan’s superlative submarine detection capabilities would be of decisive advantage in any submarine engagement. But the relevant facilities are relatively vulnerable, which makes them very lucrative targets in any conflict. This introduces compelling escalatory dynamics, including the involvement of US forces and possible employment of nuclear options...|$|R
