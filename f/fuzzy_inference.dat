These boards use the Fuzzy Set theoretic framework to allow very vast (30 kHz) processing of full sets of information that are expressed in qualitative form using membership functions. The sensor-based and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inferencing</b> system was incorporated on an outdoor test-bed platform to investigate two control modes for driving a car {{on the basis of}} very sparse and imprecise range data. In the first mode, the car navigates fully autonomously to a goal specified by the operator, while in the second mode, the system acts as a telerobotic driver's aid providing the driver with linguistic (fuzzy) commands to turn left or right, speed up, slow down, stop, or back up depending on the obstacles perceived by the sensors. Indoor and outdoor experiments with both modes of control are described in which the system uses only three acoustic range (sonar) sensor channels to perceive the environment. Sample results are presented that illustrate the feasibility of developing autonomous navigation modules and robust, safety-enhancing driver's aids for telerobotic systems using the new <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inferencing</b> VLSI hardware and 'human-like' reasoning schemes...|$|R

5000|$|FML was {{designed}} and developed by Giovanni Acampora during his Ph.D. course in Computer Science, at University of Salerno, Italy, in 2004. The original idea inspired Giovanni Acampora to create FML was the necessity of creating a cooperative fuzzy-based framework aimed at automatically controlling a living environment characterized by a plethora of heterogeneous devices whose interactions were devoted to maximize the human comfort under energy saving constraints. This framework represented {{one of the first}} concrete examples of Ambient Intelligence. Beyond this pioneering application, the major advantage of using XML to describe a fuzzy system is hardware/software interoperability. Indeed, all that is needed to read an FML file is the appropriate schema for that file, and an FML parser. This markup approach makes it much easier to exchange fuzzy systems between software: for example, a machine learning application could extract fuzzy rules which could then be read directly into a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> engine or uploaded into a fuzzy controller. Also, with technologies like XSLT, it is possible to compile the FML into the programming language of your choice, ready for embedding into whatever application you please. As stated by Mike Watts on his popular Computational Intelligence blog:"Although Acampora's motivation for developing FML seems to be to develop embedded fuzzy controllers for ambient intelligence applications, FML could be a real boon for developers of fuzzy rule extraction algorithms: from my own experience during my PhD, I know that having to design a file format and implement the appropriate parsers for rule extraction and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> engines can be a real pain, taking as much time as implementing the rule extraction algorithm itself. I would much rather have used something like FML for my work." ...|$|E
50|$|Reward-based {{algorithms}} {{assume that}} the robot in each state (position and internal state, including direction) can choose between different actions (motion). However, the result of each action is not definite. In other words, outcomes (displacement) are partly random and partly {{under the control of}} the robot. The robot gets positive reward when it reaches the target and gets negative reward if it collides with an obstacle. These algorithms try to find a path which maximizes cumulative future rewards. The Markov decision process (MDP) is a popular mathematical framework that is used in many reward-based algorithms. The advantage of MDPs over other reward-based algorithms is that they generate the optimal path. The disadvantage of MDPs is that they limit the robot to choose from a finite set of actions. Therefore, the path is not smooth (similar to grid-based approaches). Fuzzy Markov decision processes (FDMPs) are an extension of MDPs which generate smooth paths using a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> system.|$|E

Expert systems typically consist of three parts: a knowledge base, an inference engine and interface that allows the user to express the problem in a human language.
