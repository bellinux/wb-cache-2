40|$|As the {{fundamental}} principles of long-range electron transfer (ET) in proteins are becoming well understood, interest {{is focusing on}} the mechanisms by which ET is coupled to chemical reactions such as ion transport and catalysis. Protein film voltammetry provides a powerful way to investigate these problems. The protein is immobilised on an electrode as an adsorbed electroactive film, typically a monolayer or less: then, by applying a potential, electrons are driven {{in and out of}} the active sites, resulting in diagnostically useful current signals. It is possible to resolve complex reactions over a wide dynamic range. For example, with cyclic voltammetry, scan rates exceeding 1000 V s - 1 can be used to observe coupling reactions that occur in the sub-millisecond time domain.

40|$|The pathway {{representing}} methionine {{integration and}} excision is {{an increasingly important}} target in drug design. Methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP), a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving the N-terminal methionine from nascent peptides, has been the object of many studies aimed to produce potential anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-angiogenic agents. Though clinical trials are underway for several of these compounds, like fumagillin and CKD- 731, they are still flawed based on their relatively weak inhibition and their physiological side effects. Therefore, the search for novel and potent inhibitors continues. Previous work has utilized phosphinic and phosphonic acid derivatives of methionine in co-crystallization studies with Escherichia coli MetAP (eMetAP). The {{aim of the research}} presented in this work is to study and assay various phosphorus- and sulfur-containing compounds as inhibitors and substrates in an effort {{to learn more about the}} biochemical machinery underlying MetAP catalysis. As well, we outline a predictive molecular modeling approach to MetAP inhibitor design to assist in identifying lead candidates amongst a body of possible molecular inhibitors. Ultimately, we not only hope to have identified key functional properties of molecules potentially useful as MetAP inhibitors, but also to have contributed to the knowledge base of the mechanistic features involved in this <b>enzyme’s</b> <b>catalysis...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Indigoids, {{as popular}} dyes, can be {{produced}} by microbial strains or <b>enzymes</b> <b>catalysis.</b> However, the new valuable products with their transformation mechanisms, especially inter-conversion among the intermediates and products have not been clearly identified yet. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} investigate novel microbial catalytic processes for indigoids production systematically. FINDINGS: A phenol hydroxylase gene cluster (4, 606 bp) from Arthrobacter sp. W 1 (PH(w 1)) was obtained. This cluster contains six components in the order of KLMNOP, which exhibit relatively low sequence identities (37 - 72 %) with known genes. It was suggested that indole and all the tested indole derivatives except for 3 -methylindole were transformed to various substituted indigoid pigments, and the predominant color products derived from indoles were identified by spectrum analysis. One new purple product from indole, 2 -(7 -oxo- 1 H-indol- 6 (7 H) -ylidene) indolin- 3 -one, should be proposed as the dimerization of isatin and 7 -hydroxylindole at the C- 2 and C- 6 positions. Tunnel entrance and docking studies were used to predict the important amino acids for indoles biotransformation, which were further proved by site-directed mutagenesis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We showed that the phenol hydroxylase from genus Arthrobacter could transform indoles to indigoids with new chemical compounds being produced. Our work should show high insights into understanding the mechanism of indigoids bio-production...|$|R
