5|$|Drives which encrypt all {{writes on}} the fly can {{implement}} ATA Secure Erase in another way. They simply zeroize and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure erase is done. In this way the old data cannot be read anymore, as it cannot be decrypted. Some drives with an integrated encryption may require a TRIM command {{be sent to the}} drive to put the <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its original out-of-box state.|$|E
5|$|At the airport, Jai is {{overwhelmed}} with guilt and asks Sahil to leave, {{to which he}} protests. Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that they can never be together because they have vastly different lives. They part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him leave. As he is walking away into the airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries {{to make up for}} his mistakes by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their apartment.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, when the track was still damp in some sections, Vettel set the fastest {{time of the}} night, a lap of 1:46.660 on super-soft tyres; Webber finished with the second fastest lap. Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap, half a second off Vettel's pace. Alonso, who was fourth fastest, ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and slid down the access road at the next corner; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track. Hamilton was fifth, with Barrichello and Massa in sixth and seventh places. The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher, separated by Kubica. Sutil's Force India was launched into the air when he hit a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session, and Alguersuari's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car. Sutil was fined US$10,000 (£6,300) by the stewards because he attempted to <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the pit lane in his damaged car and did not stop at a safe position on the circuit.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, Loomis is {{informed}} that Michael {{broke into the}} local elementary school. As he investigates, Loomis's colleague, Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens), and a marshal (John Zenda) come to escort Loomis back to Smith's Grove on the governor's orders. Along the way, Marion tells Loomis that Laurie is Michael's sister, but that information was kept secret for her safety. With the realization that Michael is after Laurie, Loomis forces the marshal to <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Haddonfield.|$|E

He then attempted to rape King but was unable to do so. He became angry with her and fatally shot her. Starkweather later admitted shooting Jensen, but claimed that Fugate shot King. The two fled Bennet in Jensen's car.|$|E

25|$|Just {{after the}} station of Bolzano the track {{branched}} {{off from the}} Brennerbahn and ran along the Eisack river. The line crossed the Talfer river and after two small stations (Ponte Roma and Ponte Resia) the line became split: one track proceeded to Meran and further to the Vinschgerbahn and one track branched away leftwards toward the low mountain range plateau of Überetsch. After a long bridge over the Adige river, the line got steeper and after two short tunnels reached the Überetsch plateau. Here the trains only stopped in Eppan, Kaltern and Sankt Anton, near the Mendel Funicular station. The strange thing was, that the track to the Sankt Anton station left the mainline before it arrived to the Kaltern station, so the trains had to run to Kaltern station, <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the switch, change driving direction again and then go further to the Sankt Anton station.|$|E
25|$|Patterson {{lost his}} title to Liston on September 25, 1962 in Chicago, by a first-round {{knockout}} {{in front of}} 18,894 fans. The two fighters were a marked contrast. In the ring, Liston's size and power proved too much for Patterson's guile and agility. However, Patterson did not use his speed to his benefit. According to Sports Illustrated writer Gilbert Rogin, Patterson didn't punch enough and frequently tried to clinch with Liston. Liston battered Patterson with body shots and then shortened up and connected with two double hooks high on the head. The result {{at the time was}} the third-fastest knockout in boxing history. After being knocked out, Patterson left Comiskey Park in Chicago wearing dark glasses and a fake beard for the <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York. After the fight, questions were raised on whether the fight was fixed to set up a more lucrative rematch. Overnight, Patterson seemed to lose his public support {{as a result of his}} swift knockout.|$|E
25|$|Messerschmitt, and {{subsequently}} FMR, made factory-converted Service Cars to {{order for the}} automobile service industry. Similar in concept to the Harley-Davidson Servi-Car and the Indian Dispatch Tow, the Service Car had a detachable tow bar and clamp, a revised front suspension to accommodate the tow bar when in use, and a storage system inside the car to accommodate the tow bar when not in use. The service technician would drive the Service Car to the customer's car and, if the customer's car was drivable, attach the tow bar {{to the front of}} the Service Car, clamp the other end of the tow bar to the bumper of the customer's car, and drive the customer's car to the garage. When the service was complete, he would drive the car back to the customer while towing the Service Car, detach the Service Car from the customer's car, and <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the garage. Approximately 12 were built; only one is known to exist at present.|$|E

25|$|On lap 79, Kurt Busch {{claimed the}} lead coming off pit road. On the lap 80 restart, {{he led the}} field back to the green flag. A lap later, Kurt was passed by Kyle Busch. On lap 82, Jeff Gordon repassed both Busches. A lap later, Gordon was passed by David Reutimann. On lap 84, the third caution was thrown for a large crash in the tri-oval exit. It started when Kyle Busch, on the highside, turned Johnny Sauter {{into the side of}} Kurt Busch, {{starting}} a chain reaction as several cars bounced off each other. The other cars with damage were Matt Kenseth, Michael Waltrip, Max Papis, David Stremme, Paul Menard, Sam Hornish Jr., and Elliott Sadler. Of the cars involved in the crash, Sauter was the only car that was unable to <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the pits. Papis, Sauter and Waltrip were the only three drivers who were unable to continue. Under the caution Ryan Newman and Travis Kvapil stayed out to lead a lap, but they ended up pitting anyway.|$|E
25|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session on Sunday morning was held before {{the early afternoon}} race. Bird recorded the fastest lap time of the third {{practice session}}, {{which took place in}} dry and warm weather conditions, at one minute and 2.209 seconds, almost two-tenths of a second ahead of Vergne in second and Engel was third. Turvey was fourth-fastest; Piquet was fifth and Dillmann sixth. Lynn was seventh-fastest, di Grassi eighth, d'Ambrosio ninth and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten ahead of second qualifying. Dillmann broke his front-left suspension following an impact with the barrier leaving the turn six hairpin. He could not <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> pit lane, and stopped his car at the next corner, necessitating a red flag. Di Grassi carried excessive speed driving into the turn one hairpin, and steered in the opposite direction to continue driving. The session ended early when Frijns lost control of his car's rear-end, and hit the turn ten wall, littering the circuit with debris. Frijns got out of his vehicle but limped slightly, possibly caused by hitting his leg on his car's monocoque cell.|$|E
25|$|Haig's typed diary – {{probably}} {{based on}} notes prepared in April - describes Petain as “almost unbalanced and most anxious”, claiming that after attending a French Cabinet meeting in Paris, {{where he had}} been ordered to “cover Paris at all costs”, he threatened to retreat on Paris, leaving the British right flank uncovered. Tim Travers argues that Petain said at the meeting that he would only retreat on Paris if Haig retreated on the Channel Ports, and that Major-General Clive reported from the meeting that Petain had come away satisfied that Haig would not break contact. In a postwar exchange of letters with Haig Petain denied that he had ordered a retreat on Paris or had threatened Haig that he might, a recollection which Herbert Lawrence appears to have supported. Petain appears not to have discovered until 25 March that Michael was an all-out effort, but nonetheless was, according to other eyewitness accounts, in a state of despair by Tuesday 26 March. Sheffield's view is that Haig and Lawrence, on the long <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> GHQ from their meeting with Petain may simply have misunderstood his intentions, and that any factual errors in Haig's diary for this period were honest if mistaken recollections.|$|E

25|$|Rain {{fell across}} {{parts of the}} circuit in the second hour of the race and several cars were caught out by the change in conditions. The KCMG Oreca-Nissan driven by Richard Bradley, which had been trading the LMP2 lead with Jota Sport, hydroplaned into the first Mulsanne chicane and {{impacted}} the tire barriers heavily, while further up the Mulsanne several contenders in multiple classes {{were involved in a}} heavy accident. A group of LMGTE cars as well as the No. 3 Audi were slow on the course when they were approached by the No. 8 Toyota of Lapierre at a high rate of speed. Aquaplaning under braking, Lapierre spun amongst the group of cars and impacted the barriers head on. This was followed by Bird in the LMGTE Am-leading AF Corse Ferrari who drove into the rear of Bonanomi. The accident led to a safety car intervention, during which Lapierre was able to limp the Toyota back to the pit lane for repairs that lasted for nearly an hour. Bonanomi and Bird were unable to get their cars moving again and retired. Bradley was able to <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the pit lane for repairs and kept second place in LMP2.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because the man told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E
25|$|Richard and Susan's Mexican nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza), {{tends to}} their {{children}}, Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble), in their San Diego, California home {{while they are}} in Morocco. When Amelia learns of Susan's injury, she is forced {{to take care of}} the children longer than planned and becomes worried that she will miss her son's wedding. Unable to secure any other help to care for them, she calls Richard for advice, who tells her that she has to stay with the children. Without his permission, Amelia decides to take the children with her to the wedding in a rural community near Tijuana, Mexico. Her nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal) offers to take her and the kids to the wedding. They cross the border uneventfully and the children are soon confronted by the Mexican culture and street scene. The revelry of the wedding extends well into the evening, and the kids enjoy themselves in the festivities. Rather than staying the night in Mexico with the children, Amelia decides to <b>drive</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the States with Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all four travelers, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to take them out of the United States. Intoxicated and worried, Santiago trespasses the border. He soon abandons Amelia and the children in the desert, attempting to lead off the police; his fate after this is unknown.|$|E
