According to Lytvyn <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> changing this position because he valued voters.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Royal Governor Robert Dinwiddie sent militia Major George Washington to the Ohio Country (a {{territory}} that was claimed by {{several of the}} British colonies, including Virginia) as an emissary in December 1753, to tell the French to leave.

Milne's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested, a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland. On being called into a meeting with manager, Joe Jordan, Milne was told by Jordan that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> letting him nor any of his other best players leave, but {{that he would make}} an exception for Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} round match, O'Sullivan {{opened up a}} four frame {{advantage}} over Murphy in the first session to lead 6−2. In the second session, O'Sullivan maintained his advantage to lead 10−6 going into the final session. The third session saw no comeback from Murphy and O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals 13−7. The quarter-finals would be the furthest O'Sullivan would progress, as he fell behind Ding Junhui 6–10 after the opening two sessions. Despite scoring the tournament's highest break with a 146 in the final session, he would eventually lose 10–13. Following his loss, O'Sullivan stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> retiring.|$|E
5|$|Governor-General Kerr was {{following}} the crisis closely. At a luncheon with Whitlam {{and several of his}} ministers on 30 October, Kerr suggested a compromise: if Fraser conceded supply, Whitlam would agree not to call the half-Senate election until May or June 1976, or alternatively would agree not to call the Senate into session until after 1 July. Whitlam rejected the idea, seeking to end the Senate's right to deny supply. On 3 November, after a meeting with Kerr, Fraser proposed that if the government agreed to hold a House of Representatives election {{at the same time as}} the half-Senate election, the Coalition would concede supply. Whitlam rejected this offer, stating that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> advising a House election for at least a year.|$|E

5|$|Greaves {{played only}} {{three more times}} for England after the 1966 World Cup, scoring a single goal. His final cap came in a 1–0 win over Austria on 27 May 1967. Although he was called up for UEFA Euro 1968, he {{remained}} an unused substitute throughout the tournament, as the team finished in third place. He retired from international football early the following year after telling Ramsey that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> becoming a bit-part player in the England squad. In total he scored 44 goals in 57 appearances for England. He is in fourth place on the all-time list of England goalscorers, behind Wayne Rooney, Bobby Charlton and Gary Lineker. Greaves holds the record for most hat-tricks for England– six in all.|$|E
5|$|Rogers' {{expedition}} suffered further setbacks. An unidentified disease killed {{almost a}} hundred of his expedition members, while leaving the long-term residents nearly untouched. Two of the three navy vessels, having no orders to remain, left for New York. Ships sent to Havana to conciliate the Spanish governor there never arrived, their crew revolting and becoming pirates mid-voyage. Finally, the third naval vessel left in mid-September, its commander promising to return in three weeks—a promise <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> keeping. Work on rebuilding the island's fortifications proceeded slowly, with the locals showing a disinclination to work.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{reviewer}} {{observed that}} the setting of Mr Perrin and Mr Traill – a second-rate public school – was clearly drawn from life, as indeed it was. The boys of Epsom College were delighted with the thinly disguised version of their school, but the college authorities were not, and Walpole was persona non grata at Epsom for many years. This was of no practical consequence, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> returning to the teaching profession, {{but it was an}} early illustration of his capacity, noted by Benson, for unthinkingly giving offence, though being hypersensitive to criticism himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{first new}} series of Doctor Who {{featured}} eight scripts by Davies; the remainder were allocated to experienced dramatists and writers for the show's ancillary releases: Steven Moffat penned a two-episode story, and Mark Gatiss, Robert Shearman, and Paul Cornell each wrote one script. Davies also approached his old friend Paul Abbott and Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling to write for the series; both declined due to existing commitments. Shortly after he secured writers for the show, Davies stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> approaching writers from the old series; the only writer he would have wished to work with was Holmes, who died in May 1986.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April, senior Ustaše {{commander}} Slavko Kvaternik {{proclaimed the}} establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH). The declaration came exactly one week before the VKJ's unconditional surrender to the Axis powers. The leader of the Ustaše, Ante Pavelić, was in Rome at the time and made arrangements to travel to Karlovac, just west of Zagreb. He arrived in Karlovac on 13 April, accompanied by 250–400 of his followers. Pavelić reached Zagreb on 15 April, having granted territorial cessions to Italy at Croatia's expense and promised the Germans <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> pursuing a foreign policy independent of Berlin. That same day, Germany and Italy extended diplomatic recognition to the NDH. Pavelić was declared Poglavnik ("leader") of the Ustaše-led Croatian state, which combined the territory of much of present-day Croatia, all of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of present-day Serbia.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008–09 season, Buffon {{was once}} again sidelined by several injuries. From September through January, reserve goalkeeper Alexander Manninger held his {{position}} between the sticks, gaining praise for his deputising. Due to recurring injuries, Manninger's performances and Juventus's poor form {{towards the end of}} the season (as Buffon was seen despondent whilst the team drew with both Lecce and Atalanta), there were further rumours that Buffon was displeased and wanted to part ways with the club. He admitted he was disappointed with the current results, but assured that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> leaving. After a discussion with management, he said he was reassured about the club's future and signed a contract extension to 2013. Buffon and Juventus finished the season on a high note, with two victories, finishing in second place behind Internazionale. They were knocked out of the Coppa Italia semi-finals by eventual champions Lazio and of the Champions League in the round of 16 by Chelsea. Buffon was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2009 for the sixth consecutive season since first being nominated in 2004. Buffon made his 300th appearance for Juventus in a 3–3 home draw against Chievo in 2009.|$|E

5|$|On 20 November 1816, King Girvan Yuddha died of smallpox, aged nineteen. Girvan had two wives – {{the first}} wife {{committed}} sati with Girvan, {{while the second}} wife also died of smallpox after 14 days of Girvan's death. Thus, Girvan was succeeded by his only son, Rajendra Bikram Shah, an infant of two years old, after 18 days of his father's death on 8 December 1816. Therefore, Bhimsen Thapa, in collusion with the queen regent, Tripurasundari, remained in power despite the defeat of Nepal in the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814–16. There was a sustained opposition against Bhimsen from factions centered around leading members of other aristocratic families, notably the Pandes, who denounced what they felt was his cowardly submission to the British. Paradoxically, the peace time after the Anglo-Nepalese War saw the inflation and modernization of the Nepal army, which Bhimsen used to keep his opposition under control, {{while at the same}} time convincing the suspicious British that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> using it against them. Bhimsen appointed his own family members and his most trusted men to the highest positions at the court and in the army, while members of older aristocratic families were made administrators of far-flung provinces of the kingdom, away from the capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} Mahandrihono ("knows how to wait") is {{the most}} expansive and well-preserved of the rova structures at Ambohimanga. It lies {{to the east of}} the central courtyard and sits at a higher elevation than Bevato, symbolically representing its greater political significance. It was first established by Andriambelomasina in the early 18th century during the reign of his father, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. Andriambelomasina surrounded the compound with a stone wall and within it built three houses as residences for his children—two twin houses (tranokambana) set side by side named Mahandry ("knows how to wait") and Tsararay ("has a good father"), and a third named Manandraimanjaka ("has a father who rules")—taking pains to illustrate through the names of these houses that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> usurping his father. When Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana eventually died, Andriambelomasina entombed him behind the twin houses. In Andrianampoinimerina's time this compound corresponded with the Mahandrihono compound at the rova in Antananarivo, being reserved for the king alone with his residence positioned beside the tombs of the ancestors.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994–95 NCAA season, {{the sophomore}} was soon {{called one of}} the best {{eligible}} NBA prospects, along with his peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> going pro until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined to stay in school. In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime. In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but his team lost 71–66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game. He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.|$|E

5|$|Part of Guderian's {{problem was}} the lack of mobile artillery. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> halting the {{breakout}} in order to wait for additional artillery units to be moved into place to assault Sedan. Instead, Guderian requested maximum support from the Luftwaffe. For the first few days the German air arm would be used mostly in support of Army Group B. Most of the air support over Sedan was to be provided by Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3). Initially, only limited numbers of air units were to be used, but the Luftwaffes workload was greatly increased nearer the time of the battle. The Luftwaffe was to commit I. Fliegerkorps (1st Air Corps under Ulrich Grauert), II. Fliegerkorps (under Bruno Loerzer), V. Fliegerkorps (under Robert Ritter von Greim), and VIII. Fliegerkorps (under Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen). These units came from Luftflotte 2 and Jagdfliegerführer 3 (Fighter Leader 3). The most significant unit was VIII. Fliegerkorps, nicknamed the Nahkampf-Fliegerkorps (Close Support Air Corps), which contained Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (Dive bomber Wing 77), a powerful concentration of dive-bomber units equipped with the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka precision ground attack aircraft. This powerful air concentration numbered some 1,470 aircraft; 600 Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers and Dornier Do 17 light bombers, 250 Ju 87s, 500 Messerschmitt Bf 109s and 120 Messerschmitt Bf 110s.|$|E
