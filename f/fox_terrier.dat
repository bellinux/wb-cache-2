5|$|The <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> Club of England {{was founded}} in 1876, with the American <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> Club {{following}} nine years later, becoming the first breed speciality club {{to become a member}} of the American Kennel Club. A female Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> bred by Winthrop Rutherfurd named Warren Remedy was the first winner of Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1907, 1908, and 1909. Following the popularity of conformation dog shows, the <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> was the result of selective breeding. For instance, by 1949, 120 of 140 Wire <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> champions were descended from a single championship-winning dog.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> {{has been}} more {{successful}} than any other breed at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, with four Best in Show titles going to the Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> and fourteen titles going to the Wire <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> They were both shown as one breed with two coat variations; this changed in 1985 when the American Kennel Club listed the two as separate breeds. In the UK, at Crufts, the Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> has not won any Best in Show titles, while the Wire <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> has won on three occasions.|$|E
5|$|Many breeds {{can claim}} {{heritage}} {{to the early}} <b>Fox</b> <b>terrier</b> of this period, including the Brazilian terrier, Japanese terrier, Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>terrier,</b> Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat terrier, and Tenterfield terrier.|$|E

5|$|Fox Terriers are two {{different}} breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> and the Wire <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> Both of these breeds originated in the 19th century {{from a handful of}} dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier breeds. In addition, a number of breeds have diverged from these two main types of <b>fox</b> <b>terrier</b> and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> and Rat Terrier. The Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings. They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in America than their homeland.|$|E
5|$|Old Jock (18591871), was a <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> famous {{during the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. A mostly white dog, he ran briefly with a hunting kennel before {{becoming}} a show dog, most notably with a victory at the show which popularised the <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> His main show rivalry was with a dog named Tartar, and along with a dog named Trap, the three were popular sires of the <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> breed. He was also involved in the early formation of the Jack Russell Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier breeds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Fox</b> <b>terrier</b> and Jack Russell terrier type dogs {{of today}} are all descended from dogs of that period, {{although}} documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 {{have not been}} found, although several records remain of documented breeding by John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. The <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> Club was formed in 1875 with Russell {{as one of the}} founder members; its breed standard was aspiration, and not a description of how the breed appeared then. By the start of the 20th century, the <b>Fox</b> <b>terrier</b> had altered more towards the modern breed, but {{in some parts of the}} country the old style of John Russell's terriers remained, and it is from those dogs that the modern Jack Russell type has descended.|$|E

50|$|Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> are {{renowned for}} their {{good health and}} longevity, often {{reaching}} an advanced age. With good care and a happy life, Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> can live as long as 18 to 20 years, and sometimes beyond. Factors influencing longevity include a healthy diet, a sense of belonging, sufficient exercise, room to run around and generally how happy the dog is.|$|R
5000|$|The Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier's</b> {{historic}} {{profession is}} fox bolting. A fox bolting dog will accompany {{a pack of}} foxhounds and [...] "bolt" [...] after foxes, driving them out from their hiding spots and into the line {{of sight of the}} larger dogs and men on horses. Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> with white coats {{were less likely to be}} mistaken for the fox in close combat situations, and were therefore more highly prized.|$|R

5|$|Not much {{is known}} of early 19th century {{breeding}} practices that came to create the modern <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b> However {{it is thought that}} the Beagle, Old English Bulldog, English Toy Terrier, Pointer and even Dalmatian were all used in the creation and stabilisation of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) and the New Zealand Kennel Club (NZCK) {{are some}} of {{national}} kennel associations that register both the Jack Russell terrier and the Parson Russell terrier; however, the size requirements for the Jack Russell terrier under both those standards would classify a dog as a Russell terrier in the United States. In 2009, there were 1073 Jack Russells registered with the ANKC, compared to 18 for the Parson Russell terrier. Other modern breeds are often mistaken for modern Jack Russell terriers, including their cousin the Parson Russell terrier, the Tenterfield terrier, and the Rat Terrier. Several other modern breeds exist that descended from the early <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> breed, including the Brazilian Terrier, Japanese Terrier, Miniature <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat Terrier, and Tenterfield Terrier.|$|E

50|$|Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> are {{generally}} a healthy breed and require little maintenance. They are active indoors {{and will do}} without a yard, as they can usually {{take care of their}} own exercise needs. They often have trouble tolerating cold weather without careful acclimation. Their life expectancy is about fifteen years. Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> are significantly resilient, however, as with many toy breeds, some are prone to patellar luxation (slipped stifle). Legg-Calv√©-Perthes syndrome and von Willebrand's disease are uncommon. Some dogs are allergic to beet pulp, corn, and wheat. Some dogs are also allergic to tomatoes.|$|R
50|$|Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> were {{recognized}} by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1936 {{and placed in the}} Terrier Group, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2003 (Toy Group).|$|R
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by The Kennel Club, {{the primary cause of}} death for Fox Terriers was old age, causing 31.8% of reported deaths. The secondary cause was cancer of an unspecified type, which accounted for 22.7% of reports. The average lifespan of a <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> is around 15 years; however, the Kennel Club survey reported a median age at death of 13 years and 2 months.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Terriers {{have won}} best in {{show at the}} Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show {{more than any other}} breed except for the Wire <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> a total of nine times. These {{victories}} began in 1911 with a win by Ch. Tickle Em Jock and include recent victories such as in 1995 when Ch. Gaelforce Post Script (Peggy Sue) won, and in 2010 with a victory by Ch. Roundtown Mercedes Of Maryscot.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of several Vulnerable Native Breeds in the UK. This is when there are fewer than 300 annual registrations with The Kennel Club.

5|$|The most {{successful}} dog at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show was Ch. Warren Remedy, {{who won the}} Best in Show title three times between 1907 and 1909. These victories were followed by a further Best in Show title for Ch. Sabine Rarebit in 1910. Despite the Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> breed winning the first four Best in Show titles at Westminster, it has not won again since.|$|E
5|$|This type {{of small}} white terrier {{dates back to}} the work of the Reverend John Russell, born in 1795. In 1819 he {{purchased}} a small white and tan terrier bitch named Trump from a milkman in the hamlet of Elmsford. She formed the basis for his breeding programme, and by the 1850s the dogs were recognised as a distinct type of <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cruft {{designed}} {{special train}} carriages to carry competition dogs for his shows {{from around the}} country. Cruft was Secretary of the Ranelagh <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> Show in 1901, and together with several colleagues including Sir Humphrey de Trafford created the National Terrier Club, and from the second show onwards on 21 June 1902, the show {{became known as the}} National Terrier Show. Cruft continued as Secretary of the club until 1914 when Sir William Savory took on the role.|$|E
50|$|Often, wire <b>fox</b> <b>terriers</b> are {{abandoned}} or surrendered {{for reasons}} that may include: running away instead of coming on a command; chasing cars, bicycles, other dogs, etc.; or taunting and then attacking other animals, including a household's cats and other dogs -and {{they are able to}} do serious damage. But these are actually normal behaviors for a breed designed to hunt not only foxes, but also badgers and boars, with no more fear of cows or buses than they have of small prey. Keeping one as a pet requires firm control to redirect these prey instincts and provide the dog with enough exercise and diversion. With diligent supervision, wire <b>fox</b> <b>terriers</b> can be amusing, exciting, long-lived companion animals.|$|R
50|$|Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers,</b> {{like many}} active and {{intelligent}} breeds, {{can learn to}} respond to a number of words. Toy <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> were used commonly in circus shows by clowns, and they are said to make great companions for owners with a good sense of humor.As a terrier breed, they are often active, though perhaps not as active as the Jack Russell Terrier, and are said to be well suited for older owners. They are quite trainable and often cited as making wonderful companions for people with disabilities. They are also very lovable and loyal to their owners. In addition, dogs of this breed tend not to bark very much if they are trained well.|$|R
60|$|As {{they came}} nearer a dozen dogs ran barking toward them--gaunt wolf hounds, a huge great Dane, a nimble-footed collie {{and a number}} of yapping, quarrelsome <b>fox</b> <b>terriers.</b> At first their {{appearance}} was savage and unfriendly in the extreme; but once they recognized the foremost black warriors, and the white man behind them their attitude underwent a remarkable change. The collie and the <b>fox</b> <b>terriers</b> became frantic with delirious joy, and while the wolf hounds and the great Dane were not a whit less delighted at the return of their master their greetings were of a more dignified nature. Each in turn sniffed at Meriem who displayed not the slightest fear of any of them.|$|R
5|$|In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club (PJRTC) was {{reformed}} {{with the}} aim of seeking Kennel Club recognition for the breed. The initial application was turned down, but after several further rejections, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as a variant of the <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier,</b> with the United Kennel Club following suit in 1991. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997.|$|E
5|$|The James Mortimer Memorial Silver Trophy {{is awarded}} {{permanently}} should the dog win Best in Show on five separate occasions {{with the same}} owner, otherwise a silver-plated replica is awarded. As of 2010, the most successful dog to win Best in Show at Westminster was a Smooth <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> named Ch. Warren Remedy. She was the first winner of Best in Show and the only dog to have won it on three occasions.|$|E
5|$|At the Crystal Palace dog show in 1870, in {{what was}} {{considered}} to be the dog champion class of that time with the qualification requirement of a first place win at another show, Old Jock placed second. The winner was a black and tan terrier named Trimmer, with a line-up of notable dogs {{in the history of the}} <b>Fox</b> <b>Terrier</b> including Mr. Murchison's Old Trap; Mr. W.J. Harrison's Jocko; Mr. F Sale's Tyrant, Hornet and Tartar; the Marquis of Huntly's Bounce; Mr. Bewley and Mr. Carson's Quiz; and Mr. W. Gammon's Chance. This was the final time Old Jock was exhibited in the show ring.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Maney resided in Chestnut Hill. He was {{previously}} a resident of Cambridge. He also had a summer home in Scituate, Massachusetts, where he raised Wire <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> which won championships in shows across the United States.|$|R
25|$|Cerebellar {{hypoplasia}} is {{an incomplete}} {{development of the}} cerebellum. The most common cause in dogs is an in utero infection with canine herpesvirus. It is also seen associated with lissencephaly in Wire-haired <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> and Irish Setters, and as a separate condition in Chow Chows.|$|R
50|$|The red fox, like badgers (Meles meles) are pursued with dogs, such as Dachshunds, <b>Fox</b> <b>Terriers</b> and Jagdterriers, who {{are used}} to chase critters even in their burrows.
