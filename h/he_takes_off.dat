5|$|Stan {{leads the}} kids to Terrance and Phillip, who have been cornered by the US army. La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back to Hell and killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} V-Chip and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though it means he will {{have to go back to}} Hell. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E
25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Bullitt drives home. As {{he walks up}} to his apartment, he spots Cathy's car.

25|$|The crew confronts Santa, and Leela {{presents}} {{him with}} what she believes to be a logical paradox intended to destroy him. Unfortunately, Santa proves immune to paradox, and <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> after them with a missile launcher. The crew escapes the fortress, {{and is about to}} leave in the ship, but Santa grabs the engine and prevents the ship from taking off. The heat from the engine melts the ice under Santa's feet, and he sinks in the ice, which refreezes around him.|$|E

Peter is alerted at the FBI headquarters that Neal has bolted. Peter believes that Neal has run off in search of Kate; however, he tracks him to Hagen's warehouse. With Neal, a convicted felon, inside the warehouse, Peter now has probable cause to enter. He does, and discovers Hagen running a massive counterfeiting operation.

25|$|Mehmet {{proceeds}} {{to make things}} infinitely worse for himself soon after, when he stakes his house and business on a bet, loses and swiftly disappears leaving his wife, Guizin (Ishia Bennison), {{to face up to}} the consequences. A then homeless Guzin arrives at Ali and his wife Sue's (Sandy Ratcliff) doorstep with the news that Mehmet had beaten her, and she isn't ever returning to him. Ali and Sue are forced to take Guizin and her three children, Murat, Rayif and Emine (Pelin Ahmet) into their one bedroom apartment. Mehmet returns to Walford in May 1987 and he manages to persuade his long suffering wife to give their marriage another chance. However, his promises to Guizin prove to be hollow as soon after he decides that the barmaid Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) is to be the next sexual conquest. Donna refuses his advances, but can't resist informing Guizin about his offer and Guizin and Donna nearly fight on New Year's Eve that year. Guizin and Mehmet's marriage is highly turbulent and they are always involved in intense arguments, mainly concerning money and gambling. In 1988 Mehmet and Guzin become partners in Ali's café after Sue gives up working to look after her baby. Mehmet often clashes with his wife about the amount of time <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> to gamble and the way the café is run. Later in the year Mehmet and Ali run up huge gambling debts to Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), manageress of Strokes wine bar, and who is also a member of the criminal underworld known as The Firm. Desperate for money the two turn to their café employee, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), for a loan. He agrees, but charges his employers 10 percent interest and later, when they cannot meet the repayments, he demands a stake in the café. The brothers refuse, but the debt eventually leads to Ali losing the café to Ian the following year.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "You Make Me Wanna..." [...] {{was directed by}} Bille Woodruff. It starts with Usher sitting in an orange wall recess, reaching for a guitar, before cutting to a scene of him standing in a white-and-purple circular room, wearing an open shirt. It moves to a blue backdrop where Usher advances, flanked by four dancers. The scene is replaced by five clones of Usher dancing and sitting on chairs. The video continues with the singer performing dance routines throughout; interspersed are scenes of Usher singing the song on a background of blue pipes. Toward {{the end of the}} video, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his shirt in the circular room, and finally Usher and his backup dancers step out of their shoes and walk away.|$|E
60|$|As she meditated, {{at about}} nine o'clock, {{he opened the}} door and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where <b>he</b> began to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> his boots.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} his feet. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his overcoat. His mother {{wondered}} if he were drunk.|$|R

500|$|Diana asks Paul {{to prove}} to her how far he is {{prepared}} to go to create an alliance between them and to prove his loyalty he proposes that they sleep together. Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine, but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as [...] "collateral damage." [...] Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option he has got to keep her on side. Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his wedding ring and terrible about betraying Rebecca. Badler said that the situation is an [...] "ego thing" [...] for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed. Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is [...] "fantastic" [...] and that she felt comfortable with him. She said [...] "I kind of felt like it was a well-played tennis match – every time you zing him something, he zings it right back. He's right there for you, so I absolutely loved working with him.|$|E
500|$|Writing in {{the journal}} for the Society for Psychical Research, Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo {{described}} a letter by Dr. Barthez, a physician {{in the court of}} Empress Eugenie, which claimed a sitter Morio de l'lle caught Home using his foot to fake supposed spirit effects during a séance in Biarritz in 1857. Home wore thin shoes, easy to take off and draw on, and also cut socks that left the toes free. [...] "At the appropriate moment <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> one of his shoes and with his foot pulls a dress here, a dress there, rings a bell, knocks one way and another, and, the thing done, quickly puts his shoe on again." [...] Home positioned himself between the empress and Napoleon III. One of the séance sitters known as General Fleury also suspected that Home was utilizing trickery and asked to leave but returned unobserved to watch from another door behind Home. He saw Home slip his foot from his shoe and touch the arm of the Empress, who believed it to be one of her dead children. The observer stepped forward and revealed the fraud, and Home was conducted out of the country: [...] "The order was to keep the incident secret." [...] The allegations described by Dr. Barthez and General Fleury are second hand and have caused dispute between psychical researchers and skeptics.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is broken}} up into two episodes: [...] "Secret of the Oracle" [...] and [...] "The Armageddon Machine". In the first episode, having {{defeated}} the Grand Intellect in Invasion of the Vorticons and saved the Earth, eight-year-old child genius Billy Blaze {{is building a}} faster-than-light communications radio. Upon completing it, he hears a transmission announcing that a race of aliens known as the Shikadi are planning to destroy the galaxy. Donning his helmet as Commander Keen, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> in his spaceship—first stunning his parents with his neural stunner gun as they call him in to dinner—for the planet of Gnosticus IV, home of the Oracle and the Gnosticenes that tend it, {{to find out who}} the Shikadi are and how they plan to destroy the galaxy. Upon arriving, he is met by a Council Page, who tells him that the council of immortal Gnosticenes have been kidnapped by the Shikadi and taken [...] "to the Shadowlands far to the west", leaving monsters and traps to guard them. Keen journeys through the outposts and temples of the Shadowlands, rescuing all of the Gnosticenes, and afterwards they turn on the Oracle machine. The Oracle tells Keen that the Shikadi are [...] "shadow beings from {{the far side of the}} galaxy" [...] who are building an Armageddon Machine at Korath III to blow up the galaxy and rebuild it as they wish afterwards. As the episode ends, Keen sets off to stop them.|$|E
60|$|The chauffeur {{surveyed}} the three Rovers in amazement. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> {{his coat and}} shook it briskly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his silk hat and, {{blowing out}} impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.|$|R

2500|$|A {{recurring}} joke, {{which was}} first shown in [...] "Radio Bart", is that Groundskeeper Willie {{appears to have}} a pot belly, but whenever <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his shirt, he is very muscular. One of Groundskeeper Willie's trademarks is a gruffly-spoken insulting retort, which take the writers {{a long time to come}} up with, although they do not consider them that funny.|$|E
60|$|BLOOM: I have {{forgotten}} for the moment. Ah, yes! (<b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his high grade hat, saluting) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You {{have heard of}} von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.|$|E
6000|$|My mother {{opens the}} door softly as we alight. She does not speak, only looks her question. [...] "It's all over, Maggie," [...] answers my father very quietly, as <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his coat and lays it across a chair; [...] "we've got to begin the world afresh." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his overcoat, for the {{sunshine}} was now {{inclined to be}} hot, and that {{reminded him of the}} rustling he had heard in the night. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the waistcoat and examined it. [...] "Old Butteridge won't like me unpicking this." [...] He hesitated, and finally proceeded to unpick it. He found the missing drawings of the lateral rotating planes, on which the whole stability of the flying machine depended.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his soutane, beneath {{which he}} was wearing {{close-fitting}} breeches and a cloth waistcoat, and began changing his attire.|$|R
60|$|Striking a match he lit the candle, {{and stuck}} it in between his shoes, which <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> for the purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh yes,' {{says the}} General. An' <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his hat, an' Jone says good-night to me an' shuts the door. Our room {{was better than}} Mrs. General Jackson's, so I takes her in there, an' the fust thing she does is to turn on all the gases.|$|E
6000|$|She begged {{permission}} to remain, {{and promised to}} turn her back, and so on, but I was obdurate, and she then delivered herself of a passionately affectionate farewell to her charge, which was really all directed against me, and ended with these powerful words: [...] "And if <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> your socks, my pretty, may he be blasted for evermore." ...|$|E
60|$|CRICHTON (thoughtfully). They went westward, sir, and {{the wind}} is blowing in that direction. That may mean, sir, that nature is already taking the matter into her own hands. They are all hungry, sir, and the pot has come a-boil. (<b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> the lid.) The smell will be borne westward. That pot is full of nature, Mr. Treherne. Good night, sir.|$|E
60|$|Roy Beeman's low laugh was significant. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his sombrero {{and stood}} silent. The old driver smothered a loud guffaw.|$|R
60|$|Johnson {{had been}} finding it chilly {{a short time}} ago but <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his hat now and mopped his forehead.|$|R
60|$|Then Hendry slowly {{undid the}} knots of the string {{with which the}} parcel was tied. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the brown paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gosh {{blame them}} darned mules," [...] says Straw-top, {{in a voice}} so good that I nearly apologized; [...] "they're a'lus bustin' loose." [...] And then {{he looks at me}} close, and then <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his hayseed hat, and says, in a {{different}} voice: [...] "I'd like to shake hands with Parleyvoo Pickens, the greatest street man in the West, barring only Montague Silver, which you can no more than allow." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{driver of}} the pack-horses is afraid. The fear is always there in him, {{in spite of his}} sturdy, healthy robustness. His soul is not sturdy. It is blenched and whitened with fear. The {{mountains}} are dark overhead, the water roars in the gloom below. His heart is ground between the mill-stones of dread. When he passes the extended body of the dead Christ <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his hat to the Lord of Death. Christ is the Deathly One, He is Death incarnate.|$|E
60|$|All {{this is done}} very, very quietly, very impressively. No one in {{the theater}} has ever seen a man lay a silk hat on a table before, {{and so there is}} a breathless hush. Then <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> his gloves, one by one, not two or three at a time, and lays them in his hat. The {{expectancy}} is almost painful. If he had thrown his gloves into the mica fire {{it would have been a}} relief. But he doesn't.|$|E
60|$|Monsieur Bril bored to {{the last}} page of the poems. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his spectacles, and wiped them with his handkerchief.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{hear your}} boss!" [...] cried Webb sardonically. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his hat, and bowed until it touched the floor before his wife.|$|R
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> his {{cup with}} much gravity, {{at the same}} time shaking his head at the intemperance of the Scottish harper.|$|R
