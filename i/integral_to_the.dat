5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} as <b>integral</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines.

Tiny bits of shell, sand, and bryozoans compressed over multiple layers forming structures in the limestone called ooids, which created permeable conditions that hold water.|$|E
5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was <b>integral</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.|$|E

5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being <b>integral</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} English {{football}} club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, {{with which it}} further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was <b>integral</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club's commercial success {{in that part of}} the world.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} Pfaff lattice, {{introduced}} by {{us in the}} context of a Lie algebra splitting of gl(infinity) into sp(infinity) and lower-triangular matrices. We establish a set of bilinear identities, which we show to be equivalent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pfaff Lattice. In the semi-infinite case, the tau-functions are Pfaffians; interesting examples are the matrix integrals over symmetric matrices (symmetric matrix integrals) and matrix integrals over self-dual quaternionic Hermitean matrices (symplectic matrix integrals). There is a striking parallel of the Pfaff lattice with the Toda lattice, and more so, there is a map from one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other. In particular, we exhibit two maps, dual to each other, (i) from the <b>the</b> Hermitean matrix <b>integrals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> symmetric matrix <b>integrals,</b> and (ii) from <b>the</b> Hermitean matrix <b>integrals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> symplectic matrix <b>integrals.</b> The map is given by the skew-Borel decomposition of a skew-symmetric operator.
