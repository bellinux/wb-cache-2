5|$|For {{the first}} 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final rule’s <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> of 15millirem per year. This is {{protection}} {{at the level}} of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> of 100millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1mrem/year public dose through 1,000,000 years.|$|E
5|$|In many European {{countries}} (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) {{the risk}} or <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> for {{a member of}} the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure. Moreover, the U.S. EPA’s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit.|$|E
5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to requiring that radiation employers ensure that doses are kept {{as low as}} reasonably practicable (ALARP) the IRR99 also defines <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> for certain classes of person. <b>Dose</b> <b>limits</b> {{do not apply to}} people undergoing a medical exposure or to those acting as [...] "comforters and carers" [...] to such.|$|R

50|$|Excessive {{exposure}} to natural or artificial UV-radiation means immediate (acute) and long-term (chronic) {{damage to the}} eye and skin. Occupational exposure limits {{may be one of}} two types: rate <b>limited</b> or <b>dose</b> <b>limited.</b> Rate limits characterize the exposure based on effective energy (radiance or irradiance, {{depending on the type of}} radiation and the health effect of concern) per area per time, and <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> characterize the exposure as a total acceptable dose. The latter is applied when the intensity of the radiation is great enough to produce a thermal injury.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, the Codex Alimentarius removed any upper <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> {{for food}} {{irradiation}} {{as well as}} clearances for specific foods, declaring that all are safe to irradiate. Countries such as Pakistan and Brazil have adopted the Codex without any reservation or restriction. Other countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, India, and Mexico, have permitted the irradiation of fresh fruits for fruit fly quarantine purposes, amongst others.|$|E
25|$|In some CANDU {{reactors}} the tritium is periodically extracted. Typical {{emissions from}} CANDU plants in Canada {{are less than}} 1% of the national regulatory limit, {{which is based on}} International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) guidelines (for example, the maximum permitted drinking water concentration for tritium in Canada, 7,000 Bq/L, corresponds to 1/10 of the ICRP's <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> for members of the public).

40|$|The {{radiation}} exposure of fingers, thyroid and eyes of workers handling radiopharmaceuticals during various nuclear medicine procedures {{was measured using}} thermoluminescent dosemeters. Dosemeters {{were placed on the}} finger tips of 19 workers on several different occasions for various procedures. Additionally, the routinely determined whole-body doses to various groups of workers were analysed. The finger dose measurements demonstrated clear differences between the various tasks, from 0. 0012 µGy MBq(- 1) (unpacking and installing (99) Mo/(99 m) Tc-generator) to 3. 0 µGy MBq(- 1) (syringe withdrawal, injection and waste handling of (18) F-FDG). As long as the worker was handling (99 m) Tc, the dose to the fingers was well below the ICRP <b>dose</b> <b>limits,</b> even when the activity was high. Special concern should, however, be devoted to the handling of (18) F, since the dose to the fingers could easily reach the <b>dose</b> <b>limits.</b> The estimated <b>dose</b> to eyes and thyroid was well below the <b>dose</b> <b>limits.</b> Since the introduction of the positron emission tomography/computed tomography facility, the annual whole-body dose has increased for those directly involved in the handling of (18) F.

40|$|Abstract Background Advanced {{pancreatic}} cancer has a poor prognosis, {{and the current}} standard of care (gemcitabine based chemotherapy) provides a small survival advantage. However the drawback is the accompanying systemic toxicity, which targeted treatments may overcome. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KAb 201, an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody, labelled with I 131 in {{pancreatic cancer}} (ISRCTN 16857581). Methods Patients with histological/cytological proven inoperable adenocarcinoma {{of the head of}} pancreas were randomised to receive KAb 201 via either the intra-arterial or intravenous delivery route. The <b>dose</b> <b>limiting</b> toxicities within each group were determined. Patients were assessed for safety and efficacy and followed up until death. Results Between February 2003 and July 2005, 25 patients were enrolled. Nineteen patients were randomised, 9 to the intravenous and 10 to the intra-arterial arms. In the intra-arterial arm, <b>dose</b> <b>limiting</b> toxicity was seen in 2 / 6 (33 %) patients at 50 mCi whereas in the intravenous arm, <b>dose</b> <b>limiting</b> toxicity was noted in 1 / 6 patients at 50 mCi, but did not occur at 75 mCi (0 / 3). The overall response rate was 6 % (1 / 18). Median overall survival was 5. 2 months (95 % confidence interval = 3. 3 to 9 months), with {{no significant difference between the}} intravenous and intra-arterial arms (log rank test p = 0. 79).

Initially, a phosphate process was used, where lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum phosphate. This was later abandoned when an oxalate or hydroxide method was developed; lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum hydroxide and then {{converted to a}} filterable precipitate by addition of oxalate with a trace of fluoride. The oxalate method had to be performed quickly, as the oxalate ion was susceptible to radiolysis and the lanthanum had the tendency {{to go back into}} solution. The oxalate process could be performed by remotely operated devices. The batches contained about [...] of radiolanthanum, the highest radiation levels people had ever worked with at that time.

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{determine}} the radiation dose for those who are involved in the sentinel node procedure in breast cancer patients and testing of a theoretical model. Methods: We studied 12 consecutive breast cancer patients undergoing breast surgery, and a sentinel node dissection including an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We performed measurements on the surgeon, the assistant, the theatre nurse, the pathologist and his assistant. Results: The measurements on the theatre nurse and both pathologist as his assistant are beneath the detection limit of 10 muSv. The highest measured doses are the hands of the surgeon and his assistant (17 - 61 muSv), however the <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> for hands are higher than for other parts of the body. Taking the <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> into account the abdominal wall of the surgeon relatively receives the highest dose, with an average of 8. 2 muSv per procedure. Conclusion: Radiation dose levels are less than the established <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> for (nonexposed) workers if the number of procedures is restricted to about 100 /person/year.
