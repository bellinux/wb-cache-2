40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three studies that incorporate behavioral economics element in analyzing decisions of individuals in the labor and housing market. The first chapter studies how college students learn about the earning opportunities associated with different majors. I use data from two major longitudinal surveys to develop and estimate a learning model in which students update their expectations based on the contemporaneous earning realizations of older siblings and parents. Reduced-form models show that the probability of choosing a major that corresponds to the occupation of an older sibling or parent is strongly affected by whether the family member is experiencing a positive or negative earnings shock {{at the time the}} major choice is made. Building on this finding, I estimate a model of major choice that incorporates learning from family-based information sources. The results imply that students overestimate the predictive power of family members' earnings: the decision weight placed on family wage realizations is much larger than can be justified by the empirical correlation between their own earnings and their family members' earnings. My second chapter focuses on how time preference affect their job searching under unemployment insurance (UI) policies. Previous studies find that higher UI benefit, extended UI eligibility duration, bonus payment or severance pay affects unemployed workers' job-finding hazard rate but not the subsequent job match quality. I construct and estimate a dynamic job search model endogenizing both the search intensity and reservation wage with hyperbolic discounting. Using data from several state <b>job</b> <b>bonus</b> experiments from the 1980 s (the Illinois UI Incentive Experiments), I find the model with hyperbolic discounting fits the effect of the job-bonus treatment better, and an unemployed worker's reservation wage decreases slower during search duration under the hyperbolic discounting framework, implying that bonus payments induce higher search effort but do not significantly decrease workers' reservation wages. The third chapter is a joint work with Tristan Gagnon-Bartsch and Antonio Rosato. In this study, we propose and empirically test a theoretical model of loss aversion in the housing market. Compared to the empirical findings of Genesove and Meyer (2001), our model makes a new prediction: sellers who suffer a relatively small loss (when the current market value is lower than the previous purchasing price) will set prices equal to their original purchase price. Hence the model predicts an asymmetric distribution of gains to sellers which assigns less mass to small negative values than to equally size positive values and has a spike at zero. We first use the same data-set used by Genesove and Meyer to test our new prediction and find that between 4 % and 10 % sellers incurring a loss ``bunch'' by asking a price within 5, 000 dollars of the original purchasing price. We also collect new real-estate data from the San Francisco Bay Area in 2011 and find that the pricing behavior of individual sellers is still consistent with loss aversion...|$|E

In this paper, we look at the e¤ect of the growing incidence of bonus pay on wage inequality. The basic premise of the paper is that <b>jobs</b> paying <b>bonuses</b> have a more "competitive " pay structure that rewards productivity di¤erences more than other jobs. Consistent with this view, we show that compensation in <b>bonus</b> <b>jobs</b> is more closely tied to both measured (by the econometrician) and unmeasured productive characteristics of workers. We conclude that the growing incidence of <b>bonus</b> <b>jobs</b> accounts for 30 percent of In the standard competitive model of the labor market, wages are equal to marginal products and the wage structure is determined by the equilibrium of demand and supply factors.

Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in an outlaw alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player character's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, non-player characters will feel insecure around him. If he has a high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet him and feel safe around him.

Each of these causes has its own effective solutions which can reduce the turnover of employees in the team. There is an established inefficient career growth of an operator in the work teams which should be replaced by one meeting the requirements of the operators.

This applies to more than 50 % of the staff. Former employees have agreed that the final reason for leaving was their supervisor. Trainings of managerial skills by external lecturers which are specialists in the field could help create quality background for management of the company and would be beneficial for current leaders. Conducting regular surveys of the staff's satisfaction, evaluation of the operator of the month, evaluation of the team of the month, loyalty benefits of the long-term employed operators, differentiation of work, new kinds of rewards, fees elimination, new leadership and increased awareness of operators would help to run the company more efficiently...|$|R
40|$|A whacking stick is {{not enough}} to get young people into work Kristy Muir; Abigail Powell, and Rose Butler Australia’s young people are facing some urgent problems. The {{unemployment}} rate of 15 to 24 -year-olds, at a staggering 13. 9 %, is more than double the overall national rate of 6. 3 %. It hasn’t been higher since the late 1990 s. The government has said time and again that we need to get young people working, but the figures are telling us that it’s not as simple as it would seem. The demand for jobs among Australia’s young people far outstrips the supply of jobs. When we break down the figures, the scenario looks even worse: 13. 9 % of 15 - 24 year olds (291, 832) in the labour market are unemployed; another 17. 4 % (365, 575) had jobs but were looking for more work (that is, underemployed). This amounts to around one in three young people in the labour market. This rate is at its highest since the statistics were first available in 1978.     Three pieces of a complex puzzle In this situation, as in any market, there are three pieces to the puzzle: 	People wanting work (demand for the product); 	People looking for work (demand and active buy-in to the product); and 	Actual jobs (supply). This is basic maths: 657, 407 young people plus another 1, 197, 057 underemployed and unemployed adults 24 years and older looking for work minus 149, 900 job vacancies equals not enough jobs. Assuming one job per person, this means 92 in every 100 of these people won’t get a job vacancy. Competition is fierce. This is a serious problem for young people. It affects their income, long-term employability, social participation, mental health and housing stability. It affects the families who support them. And it is a problem for society. The recently released Intergenerational Report predicted that the number of working-age people supporting each person 65 years or older will decrease from 4. 5 today to 2. 7 by 2054 - 55. We need young people to be working; we can’t afford for a large proportion to be unemployed. To achieve this, we need a supply of jobs and support for young people to obtain them. This was recognised in the report: The community and economy will benefit from opportunities to support … young people … to participate in the workforce … Ensuring that more young people are able to find employment when they leave education and training will be important to avoid entrenching disadvantage over the long term. The Abbott government is focused on “helping” unemployed people to “move into employment” through policies and programs. These include employment services, Work for the Dole, a <b>Job</b> Commitment <b>Bonus,</b> Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job and proposed budget cuts to make young people who are not “earning or learning” wait up to six months before they can receive financial support through the Newstart or Youth Allowance. These policy responses focus on part one of the puzzle – making sure young people “want” to work, or are at least looking for work. In the government’s words, they: … strengthen the incentive for young unemployed people to participate. But they do not address part two – people who want to work but are not competitive in the job market. Nor are they a solution to part three – the lack of job vacancies, not to mention ensuring jobs that are appropriate and accessible for young people. The obvious response to make young people more competitive is to increase their education and skills. Traditionally, the more education you receive, the better chance you have of getting a job. As unemployment has gone up, the national Year 12 attainment rate for 20 - 24 year olds has risen from 78 % in 2001 to 85 % in 2011. Education still matters. But as unemployment has risen, so too has the level and length of education needed to make someone employable. Today’s labour market is also highly casualised and often insecure, which means getting a job {{is not the same as}} keeping a decent job. What does this mean for young people who don’t have their Year 12 certificate or other qualifications, or are struggling to stay in school? These young people often face serious social problems that make it difficult to stay in education or find work. Unstable, unsafe housing, not having necessities like an address, enough to eat, shoes to wear or a washing machine, a lack of social skills, mental health problems and/or substance use, and experience of domestic violence all hinder a young person’s ability and capacity to study or find or hold a job. Towards a workable solution Such complex problems are unlikely to be solved with a simple solution like the motivation stick of “earn or learn”. Instead, we need different solutions to help these young people get on a pathway towards working or learning. These young people need a range of services before they can think about education and work. Varied, connected and ongoing support for young people who face complex problems has been shown to be very successful to get them through school and into work. Young people may also lack the knowledge or networks to move from school to work, or know how to find a job. It is increasingly hard for young people to secure a job without family support. Many young people also lack opportunities for alternative and flexible education, work experience placements and employment skills training. We need to match young people with the jobs available; support well-structured programs that help young people to develop the skills they need in today’s workforce; and support community organisations to do so. The recently defunded Youth Connections program made inroads in this area. The Senate Select Committee into the Abbott Government’s Budget Cuts recommended that “the government reinstate funding for Youth Connections immediately”. We also need a response to the supply side. How can we create more jobs and encourage employers to take on young people? There are a number of approaches and suggestions around. For example, the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) has proposed a partnership approach to an evidence-based Youth Employment Strategy. Overseas, high youth unemployment has prompted large-scale structural reforms and comprehensive investment in young people in the European Union. Tax incentives for employees who hire young people have been introduced in countries like South Africa and Canada, and have been suggested as a possible solution in Australia. Given that around one in three young people in the labour market are looking for work or want more work, the current policy environment does not add up. Whacking young people with a motivation stick smacks of blaming them for not wanting to work. The figures suggest this simply isn’t true. It’s also a distraction from dealing with the supply side of the puzzle. This is a complex problem that requires a complex solution. As Social Services Minister Scott Morrison said recently: Addressing the youth challenge is one that we can all share. It’s time for a serious discussion between governments, business, not-for-profits, educators, the community and young people about creating more jobs and supportive, realistic pathways to achieving them. We must focus on purpose not politics. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionHuman {{resources}} {{are among the}} most valuable sources of getting to the targets of any organization or system and are deemed as among the most prominent assets of any organization. Thus the better quality this asset has, the more probable success, prosperity and promotion the organization will enjoy (Tazhibi et al, 1389 : 650). Job satisfaction is a combination of sensations and beliefs which people hold about their current job. Job satisfaction {{is one of the most}} important factors involved in job success, the factor which causes an increase in efficiency and self-satisfaction. It also guarantees physical and psychological health leading to life satisfaction which, in turn, causes a person to learn the job skills swiftly. Social happiness has also been discussed as an important offshoot of job satisfaction, which not only influences our personal life but also our social life including our interactions and communications with other people (Van praag et al, 2004) Happiness or happiness is a word that includes such connotations as immediate pleasure, long term pleasure and pleasure of all life courses. This study is an attempt to assess the degree of job satisfaction, and social happiness among high school teachers in Jiroft, and to investigate the reciprocal relationships between job satisfaction and social happiness and to find their relationships between the variables of gender, marital status, field of instruction, level of income and educational level of the teachers. Materials & MethodsThis is a survey study. The population includes of all the high school teachers working in Giroft. According to Cochran’s formula and with the method of simple random sampling 105 participants (56 males and 49 females) were selected as the sample of the study. Materials for data collection were Smith et al’s (1969) questionnaire on job satisfaction which included components of job satisfaction, headmaster satisfaction, satisfaction with the colleagues and satisfaction with the promotions and a questionnaire designed by the researcher on social happiness. All the questions posed in the instruments, except demographic characteristics, were according to a 5 -point Likert scale. For assessing the validity of the instrument of the study, questionnaires were given to professors of social sciences and after obtaining their comments the questionnaires were finalized (face validity). Also for assessing the reliability of the questionnaire, after conducting a pre-test on 30 teachers who were not among the sample participants, Cronbach was obtained to the levels of 0. 92 and 0. 76 for job satisfaction and social happiness respectively revealing a good level of reliability for the items. Finally statistical analysis was done by using descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS software version 19. Discussion and Conclusion:According to the findings of the research, 53. 3 % of the respondents were men while 46. 7 % were women. The range of the age of the participants was between 22 to 52 and their age mean was 36. 1. 15. 2 % of them were single while the rest (84. 8 %) were married. 70. 5 % of the teachers were teaching in the field of humanities and 29. 5 % of them in experimental sciences. Also with regards to their educational level, 6. 1 % of the respondents held AA degrees, 78. 1 BA/BS degrees and 15. 2 % were at master’s level. Also results of this study showed that degree of job satisfaction of teachers with a mean of 44. 2 % was less than average and the degree of their social happiness with the mean of 57 % was above average. Also among different factors of job satisfaction, the factor of satisfaction of relationships with colleagues was the highest with the mean of 0. 60 and satisfaction with the working environment with the mean of 44. 3 % received the lowest. The mean of the factor of satisfaction with the headmaster status was 56. 44 % and satisfaction with the status of the job having the mean of 51. 54. Also satisfaction with the job promotions had a mean of 50. 07. These pieces of information show that the relationships between colleagues and the headmaster among the teachers are more favorable compared with the working atmosphere, job status, and the promotion counterparts. Other findings of this study indicated that the mean of job satisfaction and social happiness among females was significantly higher than males, which is in line with studies conducted by researchers like Clark 1997, Sloan and Williams 2000, VanPrag et al. 2003, Gazyuli and Tensel 2006. Among other findings of this study is that the mean of job satisfaction and social happiness is similar in single vs. married participants, which is incongruent with the studies of researchers like Birborn and Kaplovtis (1996) who have reported that married people have more happiness compared with the single ones. Mean of job satisfaction and social happiness of those who teach experimental sciences is almost similar to those who teach humanities. Also amount of job satisfaction and social happiness among teachers with different academic degrees turned out to be insignificantly different, which is against findings of researchers like Suza Puza (2003), Jones and Johnson (2009), Otto et al (1999), Villa et al (2005) regarding job satisfaction and Gevrin et al (1960) for social happiness. Results of correlation relationships indicated that social happiness with all its factors of job satisfaction and also the general parameter of job satisfaction had a significantly positive and meaningful correlation, meaning that as the degree of satisfaction with the working environment, satisfaction with the job status, headmaster, job promotions and relation with colleagues and generally job satisfaction increases, the level of social happiness also increases, and vice versa. These results are directly and indirectly in line with the proposed theories in research like the two-factor theory of motivation-health of Herzberg, equity theory of Adams, and needs hierarchy theory of Maslow. Also results obtained from the regression analysis of data of all participants showed that, in sum, the two variable of social happiness and gender, consecutively, could predict 47. 3 of changes in job satisfaction of which the variable of social happiness with the b= 0. 67 had a larger share in explaining changes of job satisfaction. Also regression analysis of social happiness reveals that the three variables of job status, relationships among the colleagues, and satisfaction with the status of the headmaster could explain 46. 7 of changes in social happiness of the teachers, among which the variable of job satisfaction with b= 0. 38 had a larger share in explaining changes. Based on the findings of this study following suggestions are made:In order to provide more job satisfaction and accordingly more happiness among teachers, it is suggested that system of payment and giving bonus to be revisited in a way to enable them to satisfy their basic needs and primary sources of their living and to provide a base to satisfy higher order needs. It is required to take actions in order to provide working atmospheres replete with senses of coordination and collaboration in educational and organizational settings in order to motivate teachers and to make positive changes in the attitude of colleagues which can lead to positive outlook and will activate them to work more and have an effective competition. Since satisfaction with the headmaster has an important impact on social happiness of the teachers and thus their job satisfaction, it is necessary to exert utmost precision in selecting school principals and organization managers and to select those who benefit from scientific requirements as well as managerial capabilities and good manners. Since the level of job satisfaction among male teachers was lower than females, it is required to think of methods to increase the job satisfaction of all teachers including men. In this vein, due to limitations in <b>job</b> opportunities and <b>bonuses,</b> it is required to satisfy and fulfill their job expectations in an acceptable manner based on the resources available.
