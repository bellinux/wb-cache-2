Micropower impulse radar is used to transmit a high risetime, short duration pulse to a focussed radar target area of the substrate having the two dimensional <b>identification</b> <b>marks.</b> The method further includes the steps of listening for radar echoes returned from the <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> during a short listening period window occurring a predetermined time after transmission of the radar pulse. If radar echoes are detected, an image processing step is carried out. If no radar echoes are detected, the method further includes sequentially transmitting further high risetime, short duration pulses, and listening for radar echoes from each of said further pulses after different elapsed times {{for each of the}} further pulses until radar echoes are detected. When radar echoes are detected, data based on the detected echoes is processed to produce an image of the <b>identification</b> <b>marks...</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{the above}} {{discussion}} regarding various <b>identification</b> <b>marks,</b> it is {{emphasized that the}} <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> from {{the characteristics of the}} volcanic products mostly reflect the depositional environmental information of the eruption products. Of all the <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> discussed here, only vesicles content of pyroclasts ejected from an explosive eruption {{is directly related to the}} eruption environment, which can be used as the direct evidence for identifying the eruption environment (Table 1, Table 2). Other <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> do not directly reflect the eruption environment but the depositional environment instead. The following conditions should be matched first if the aforementioned indirect marks are also used to identify the eruption environment: (1) eruption position (the crater) is flat and very close to depositional area; (2) depositional area is located in deep water in large-scale basins and meanwhile the volcanic materials do not belong to the reworked sediments of early eruptive products. Otherwise, it is difficult to ensure that the depositional environment can reflect or represent the eruption environment.|$|R

30|$|Different {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions develop various lithofacies and lithofacies associations. Therefore, not every volcanic eruption has all or {{has the same}} <b>identification</b> <b>marks.</b> The most reliable ones for identifying the explosive eruption include quenching cracks, quenching textures, vesicles abundance, large-scale cross-beddings and the underlying depositional environment; the most reliable ones for identifying the effusive eruption include pillow structures, peperites, effusive lithofacies associations (including quenching structure) and the underlying depositional environment. The common <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> of these two eruption types consist of the underlying depositional environment (background factors), quenching structure and its products which were resulted from the encountering of hot volcanic materials into the cooler water.|$|R

40|$|Internet hosts are {{threatened}} by large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The Path Identification DDoS defense scheme has recently been proposed as a deterministic packet marking scheme that allows a DDoS victim to filter out attack packets on a per packet basis with high accuracy {{after only a few}} attack packets are received. This paper proposes the Stack Path <b>identification</b> <b>marking,</b> a new packet marking scheme based on path identification, and new filtering mechanisms. The Stack Path <b>Identification</b> <b>marking</b> scheme consists of two new marking methods that substantially improve Path identifier’s incremental deployment performance i. e., Stack-based marking and Write-ahead marking. The proposed scheme almost completely eliminates the effect of a few legacy routers on a path, and performs better than the original Path identification scheme in a sparse deployment of path identifier enabled routers. For the filtering mechanism, derive an optimal threshold strategy for filtering with the Path <b>identification</b> <b>marking.</b> The system develops the path identification IP filter, which can be used to detect IP spoofing attacks with just a single attack packet. Finally, evaluate the Stack path identification’s compatibility with IP Fragmentation, applicability in an IPv 6 environment, and several other important issues relating to potential deployment of Stack path identification.
