The paper demonstrates that some well-known relationships concerning the language families resulting from ordinary ET 0 L grammars do not hold in terms of the <b>forbidding</b> ET 0 L grammars. Most interestingly, while E 0 L grammars are less powerful than ET 0 L grammars, their <b>forbidding</b> versions with conditions of length one are equally powerful. On the other hand, while EP 0 L grammars are as powerful as E 0 L grammars, FEP 0 L grammars are less powerful than FE 0 L grammars...|$|R

5|$|On paper, the edict ordered {{expulsion}} {{rather than}} a forced conversion, but it <b>forbade</b> nearly all possible destinations; in reality, the Castilian authorities preferred Muslims to convert than emigrate. Castile's western neighbor Portugal had already banned Muslims since 1497. The order explicitly <b>forbade</b> going to other neighboring regions, such as the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, the Principality of Catalonia, and the Kingdom of Navarre. Of possible overseas destination, North Africa and territories of the Ottoman Empire were also ruled out. The edict allowed travel to Egypt, then ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate, but there were few ships sailing between Castile and Egypt in those days. It designated Biscay in the Basque country as the only port where the Muslims could depart, which meant that those from the south (such as Andalusia) would have to travel {{the entire length of}} the peninsula. The edict also set the end of April 1502 as the deadline, after which Islam would become outlawed and those harboring Muslims would be punished severely. A further edict issued on 17 September 1502 <b>forbade</b> the newly converted Muslims to leave Castile within the next two years.|$|E
