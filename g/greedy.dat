40|$|Motivation: Repeats are {{ubiquitous}} in genomes and play {{important roles in}} evolution. Transposable elements are a common kind of repeat. Transposon insertions can be nested and make the task of identifying repeats difficult. Results: We develop a novel iterative algorithm, called <b>Greedier,</b> to find repeats in a target genome given a repeat library. <b>Greedier</b> distinguishes itself from existing methods by {{taking into account the}} fragmentation of repeats. Each iteration consists of two passes. In the first pass, it identifies the local similarities between the repeat library and the target genome. <b>Greedier</b> then builds graphs from this comparison output. In each graph, a vertex denotes a similar subsequence pair. Edges denote pairs of subsequences that can be connected to form higher similarities. In the second pass, <b>Greedier</b> traverses these graphs greedily to find matches to individual repeat units in the repeat library. It computes a fitness value for each such match denoting the similarity of that match. Matches with fitness values greater than a cutoff are removed, {{and the rest of the}} genome is stitched together. The similarity cutoff is then gradually reduced, and the iteration is repeated until no hits are returned from the comparison. Our experiments on the Arabidopsis and rice genomes show that <b>Greedier</b> identifies approximately twice as many transposon bases as those found by cross_match and WindowMasker. Moreover, <b>Greedier</b> masks far fewer false positive bases than either cross_match or WindowMasker. In addition to masking repeats, <b>Greedier</b> also reports potential nested transposon structures. Contact...|$|R

5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller {{amount of time and}} space than the <b>greedy</b> algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can be guaranteed {{to come up with the}} same hierarchical clustering as the <b>greedy</b> algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E
5|$|Lynott {{replaced}} Robertson with Gary Moore again, {{and around}} this time the band loosely joined forces with Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols, and also with Chris Spedding and Jimmy Bain, to form The <b>Greedy</b> Bastards, who played {{a small number of}} gigs playing a varied selection of songs. In this way Lynott was able to align his band with the punk movement and avoid being tagged as a 'dinosaur' as many other 1970s rock bands had been. Other occasional members of The <b>Greedy</b> Bastards included Bob Geldof and Pete Briquette of the Boomtown Rats.|$|E

In 1996 he recorded a solo album Love Harmonica for TWA in his home studio, this led to live work with a band dubbed <b>Greedy's</b> People and the re-recording in full band mode and subsequent re-release of the album.

5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} is extended from pairs of points to pairs of clusters. Different clustering methods perform this extension in different ways.

5000|$|The general {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to avoid being the <b>greediest</b> contestant. For each money clock played, a dollar figure is shown that rapidly increases or decreases.
