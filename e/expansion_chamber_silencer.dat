40|$|The {{boundary}} element method (BEM) {{is frequently}} employed {{to predict the}} transmission loss (TL) of an <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>silencer</b> with a rigid walled boundary, while {{the effect of the}} vibration of the end plates of the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>silencer</b> is usually ignored. However, when the airflow or acoustic pressure in a duct is large and the end plate of the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>silencer</b> is not thick enough, the effect of the vibration of the end plate should not be ignored. In this paper, based on a coupling of the BEM and the finite element method (FEM), the numerical results illustrate the existence of the effect on the TL of the vibrating end plates. Furthermore, numerical experiments also show that for an expansion chamber of constant size, the thicker the end plate, the less influence the vibration of the end plate has on the TL. And this may be helpful for the design of silencer. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

The transmission loss predictions of straight-through perforated tube silencers by the three approaches agree well with experimental measurements in the literature. The computational efficiency is compared in the paper which shows that the substructure direct mixed-body BEM can save a large amount of computation time for the large muffler contains complex internal geometry.

40|$|Transmission loss (TL) {{is often}} used to {{evaluate}} the acoustic attenuation performance of a silencer. In this work, a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element method (FEM) is employed to calculate the TL of some representative silencers, namely, circular <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>silencer</b> and straight-through perforated pipe silencer. In order to account for the effect of mean flow that exists inside the silencer, the 3 D FEM is used in conjunction with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of the flow field. More concretely, the 3 D mean flow field is computed by firstly using CFD, and then the obtained mean flow data are imported to an acoustic solution undertaken using FEM. The data transfer between the two steps is accomplished by mesh mapping. The results presented demonstrate good agreement between present TL predictions and previously published experimental and numerical works. Also, the details of the flow inside the silencers may be studied. Furthermore, the effect of mean flow velocity on acoustic attenuation performance of the silencers is investigated. It is concluded that for the studied silencers, in general, increasing flow velocity increases the TL and decreases the resonance peaks...|$|E

40|$|The {{broadband}} {{sound attenuation}} characteristics of <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>silencers</b> {{can be altered}} by their internal configuration. Three-dimensional modeling of such systems, especially {{in the presence of}} complex internal partitions, remains a challenging task. In order to tackle the system complexity, this paper presents a systematic approach based on the sub-structuring modeling principle, to investigate the effects of several typical silencer configurations and provide guidelines for possible system optimization. Through numerical examples, the effects of various internal arrangements, including the side-branch partitions, multi-chamber partitions, non-symmetric inlet/outlet, and their combined effects are investigated. Numerical predictions show good agreements with both finite element method (FEM) and experiments. Investigations suggest some critical issues and possible solutions for better silencer design.

40|$|A sub-structuring approach, {{along with}} a unit cell treatment, is {{proposed}} to model <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>silencers</b> with internal partitions and micro-perforated panels (MPPs) {{in the absence of}} internal flow. The side-branch of the silencer is treated as a combination of unit cells connected in series. It is shown that, by connecting multiple unit cells with varying parameters, the noise attenuation bandwidth can be enlarged. With MPPs, the hybrid noise attenuation mechanism of the silencer is revealed. Depending {{on the size of the}} perforation hole, noise attenuation can be dominated by dissipative, reactive, or combined effects together. For a broadband sound absorption, the hole size, together with the perforation ratio and other parameters, can be optimized to strike a balance between the dissipative and reactive effect, for ultimately achieving the desired noise attenuation performance within a prescribed frequency region. The modular nature of the proposed formulation allows doing this in a flexible, accurate, and cost effective manner. The accuracy of the proposed approach is validated through comparisons with finite element method and experiments. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{development of}} a second order model for predicting sound transmission losses of the single <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> (Muffler). Firstly, Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) is used to predict the sound transmission losses of <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber.</b> Then, accuracy of the TMM is validated against the experimental results. Finally, the second order model is developed using response surface method (RSM). Also, fractional factorial design (FFD) is carried out to investigate {{the effect of the}} <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> dimensions on the sound transmission losses at desired pure tone 500 Hz.

50|$|Once {{the exhaust}} {{pressure}} {{has fallen to}} near-atmospheric level, the piston uncovers the transfer ports. At this point energy from the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> {{can be used to}} aid the flow of fresh mixture into the cylinder. To do this, the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> is increased in diameter so that the out-going acoustic wave (created by the combustion process) creates a reflected vacuum (negative pressure) wave that returns to the cylinder. This part of the chamber is called the divergent (or diffuser) section and it diverges at 7 to 9 degrees. It may be made up of more than one diverging cone depending on requirements. The vacuum wave arrives in the cylinder during the transfer cycle and helps suck in fresh mixture from the crankcase into the cylinder, and/or prevent the suction of exhaust gases into the crankcase (due to crankcase vacuum). However, the wave may also suck fresh mixture out the exhaust port into the header of the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber.</b> This effect is mitigated by the port-blocking wave.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inertial}} supercharging {{effect from}} two-stroke engines {{is the result}} of the design of an <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> in the two-stroke exhaust system. Its carefully designed shape and length uses the expanding exhaust gasses to create a vacuum that pulls more exhaust gases (and some of the intake gasses) out of the engine. This is immediately followed by a reflected pressure wave timed to force the extra intake gasses back into the cylinder, thus achieving a greater mass of air/fuel mix in the combustion chamber than possible with conventional induction & exhaust scavenging methods. <b>Expansion</b> <b>chambers</b> only work well at a narrow engine speed range which is why two stroke engines are referred to as having a [...] "powerband".
