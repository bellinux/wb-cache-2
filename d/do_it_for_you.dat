500|$|According to Rich Thane of The Line of Best Fit, {{the track}} details the [...] "carefree {{beginnings}} of a new romance". Michael Cragg of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "ode to falling dangerously in love with someone". Cragg also said the singer is [...] "willing to share her drugs" [...] with her lover in the verse [...] "Jump off a cliff / I'd give you my last spliff / I'd <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> / Ain't love sweet?". According to Mark Savage of BBC News, the track [...] "parodies the preposterous promises" [...] made by musicians in love songs; he cited the line [...] "Chop off my hands / Chop off my feet / I'd <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> / Ain't love sweet?" [...] as an example.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of Family Guy. Far too many episodes were either seriously lacking in humor or were just plain poorly written", but added, [...] "While much of the original appeal seems to have washed-off, {{there are still a}} few moments from this season that really stand out", listing [...] "Chick Cancer", [...] "Road to Rupert", [...] "Saving Private Brian", and [...] "No Meals on Wheels" [...] as the best episodes of the season. Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires". Manisha Kanetkar of Smart House, however, felt that the series saw [...] "no sign of tiring" [...] and had [...] "as many funny moments as ever." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize {{when it comes to this}} set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which is all you really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing the things that have worked before and doing them more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> that doesn't make much of a difference." ...|$|E
