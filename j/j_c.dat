40|$|Mycobacterium smegmatis {{has been}} widely used as a mycobacterial {{infection}} model. Unlike the M. smegmatis mc(2) 155 strain, M. smegmatis <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> strain {{has the advantage of}} surviving for one week in murine macrophages. In our previous report, we clarified that the <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> strain has deleted apolar glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) in the cell wall, which may affect its morphology and survival in host cells. In this study, the gene causing the GPL deletion in the <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> strain was identified. The mps 1 - 2 gene (MSMEG_ 0400 - 0402) correlated with GPL biosynthesis. The <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> strain had 18 bps deleted in the mps 1 gene compared to that of the mc(2) 155 strain. The mps 1 -complemented <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> mutant restored the expression of GPLs. Although the <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> strain produces a rough and dry colony, the colony morphology of this mps 1 -complement was smooth like the mc(2) 155 strain. The length in the mps 1 -complemented <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> mutant was shortened by the expression of GPLs. In addition, the GPL-restored <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> mutant did not survive as long as the parent <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> strain in the murine macrophage cell line J 774. 1 cells. The results are direct evidence that the deletion of GPLs in the <b>J</b> 15 <b>cs</b> strain affects bacterial size, morphology, and survival in host cells...|$|R
