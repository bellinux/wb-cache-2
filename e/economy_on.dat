Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic <b>economy</b> <b>on</b> the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E

Saying that burdensome regulations from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency were harmful to business' ability to create jobs, he endorsed the REINS Act, which would require congressional approval of any executive regulation with an economic impact of more than $100 million.

To this end, we analyze the location decisions of new manufacturing firms in Spain. First, for a 3 -digit level, we identify for each industry which type of agglomeration economies 2 ̆ 013 localization or urbanization- explain new firm's location. And second, using the coefficients obtained in these estimations for both agglomeration economies, we analyse which industry characteristics are the sources that explain differences in the strength of these <b>economies.</b> We focus <b>on</b> industry characteristics related to the three microfoundations of agglomeration that have been most prominent in the theoretical literature: labor market pooling, input sharing and knowledge spillovers. Our results point out that for industries with high influence of localization <b>economies</b> <b>on</b> their location patterns what matters is the labour market pooling mechanism. For the industries with higher effect of urbanization <b>economies</b> <b>on</b> their location patterns, knowledge spillovers and output sharing are the sources of agglomeration.

Using a sample of Big N clients for the 2000 - 2007 period, and a scale measure based on percentile rankings of the number of audit clients at the city-industry level, we document significant specialization premiums and scale discounts in both the pre- and post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) periods. However, the effects of industry specialization and scale <b>economies</b> <b>on</b> audit pricing are highly interactive. The negative effect of city-industry scale on audit fees obtains only for clients of specialist auditors. By contrast, clients of non-specialist auditors obtain scale discounts only when they enjoy strong bargaining power, suggesting that auditors are "forced" to pass <b>on</b> scale <b>economies</b> to clients with greater bargaining power...|$|R
