5|$|Ana Po'uhila {{participated in}} the women's shot put on the behalf of Tonga at the Beijing Olympics, and was the only female athlete {{competing}} for Tonga at the 2008 Olympic games. She was born in Nuku'alofa, the national capital, which lies on the primary Tongan island of Tongatapu. Po'uhila first {{participated in the}} Olympics at age 24, when she represented Tonga in shot put at the 2004 Athens games. She represented Tonga again in Beijing {{at the age of}} 32. During the qualifying heat of her event, which took place on August 15, the Tongan field athlete was placed in the seventeen-person second heat. Po'uhila was given three attempts to put the shot as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> During the first attempt, she lobbed the shot 16.21meters, ranking 12th in her heat. She bested this ranking on her second attempt when she lobbed it 16.42meters, ranking seventh amongst those who threw during the second try. Her third and final attempt, 16.35meters, did not beat her second attempt. Using her best mark, 16.42meters, Po'uhila placed 12th out of the 16 athletes who finished the event. She ranked ahead of Taiwan's Lin Chia-Ying (16.32meters) and behind Russia's Irina Khudoroshkina (16.84meters) in a heat led by China's Gong Lijiao (19.46meters) and Belarus' Nadzeya Ostapchuk (19.08meters). Of the 33 athletes who finished the event, Ana Po'uhila ranked 27th. She did not advance to the final round.|$|E
25|$|Theosophy and spiritualism {{were both}} very popular metaphysical {{schools of thought}} {{especially}} in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs. Madame Blavatsky was critical of spiritualism; she distanced theosophy from spiritualism as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> and allied herself with eastern occultism.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{agreed to}} return {{for a few days}} in 1988 to finish off Daphne's storyline. This time, the actress asked for her {{character}} to be killed off. Smith told Robyn Harvey from The Sydney Morning Herald, [...] "I wanted Daphne to die. I didn't want to be stuck in a television series {{for the rest of my}} life. I'd taken Daphne as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go. She's run the gamut of every life experience she could possibly have. I'd had enough." [...] Daphne was critically injured during a car crash on the way to her father's funeral and she was left in a coma. Off-screen, representatives from the serial's production company tried to persuade Smith to sign a new contract, but she refused. Daphne briefly regained consciousness to say [...] "I love you Clarkey" [...] to Des, before becoming the first regular character to die.|$|E

60|$|But {{she would}} not let him go. First {{to the kitchen to}} refresh himself, whilst she and mademoiselle made ready, and then a seat for him in her {{carriage}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Meudon. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not suffer him to return on foot as he had come.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now Mr. Barker is here, I guess I {{can get the}} time." [...] Mr. Evans said, well, he {{was glad}} <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and {{went out of the}} street door. [...] "He's just one of the nicest gentlemen I've got," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Harmon, following him with her eye <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> conveniently <b>could</b> without turning her head, [...] "him and his wife both. Ever heard of the Saturday Afternoon?" ...|$|R
500|$|... ʻAna Poʻuhila was {{the oldest}} person (and the sole female athlete) to take part for Tonga at the London Olympic Games {{at the age of}} 32. She had participated in the {{previous}} two Olympic Games in Athens and Beijing. Po'uhila gained entry into the Games by meeting qualification standards because her best throw of 16.40 metres, set at the 2011 Pacific Games, was 0.90 metres better than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for the women's shot put competition. [...] She spent time in Auckland preparing for the Games. During the qualifying heat of her event, which took place on 7 August, the Tongan field athlete was placed in the sixteen-person second heat. Po'uhila was given three attempts to put the shot as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> During the first attempt, she lobbed the shot 15.80 metres, ranking 14th in her heat. Po'uhila was unable to best the ranking on her ranking when she lobbed it 15.75 metres, placing 11th amongst those who threw during the second try. Her third and final attempt, 15.11 metres, did not beat her first attempt. Using her best mark, 15.80 metres, Po'uhila placed 29th out of 30 athletes who completed the event. She finished ahead of Elena Smolyanova of Uzbekistan (14.42 metres) but behind Taiwan's Lin Chia-ying (17.43 metres) in a heat led by Yevgeniya Kolodko of Russia (19.31 metres). Of the 30 athletes who finished the event Po'uhila finished in 29th, and did not progress into the final.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of Season 16, Romana begins to take {{on some of the}} {{characteristics}} of the screaming [...] "damsel in distress", which reinforced Tamm's decision not to remain in the role as she felt the character had been taken as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go. As a result, Romana regenerates at the start of Season 17, emerging with a different physical appearance and a lighter personality.|$|E

6000|$|Their guest {{instantly}} {{abandoned his}} attitude of supplication {{for one of}} boasting: [...] "Destitute? Who the hell said I was destitute, heh?" [...] He was snarling across Claire at Mr. Boltwood. His wet face was five inches from hers. She drew her head <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> was sure that the man completely appreciated her distaste, for his eyes popped with amusement before he roared on: ...|$|R
60|$|Not feeling quite certain, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{afterwards}} said, {{whether he}} might not be 'coming over her' with these compliments, Dolly kept <b>as</b> <b>far</b> from him <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> cried again, and resolved to defend her pocket (for the letter was there) to the last extremity.|$|R
60|$|Marianne {{had retreated}} {{as much as}} {{possible}} out of sight, to conceal her distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore took a seat <b>as</b> <b>far</b> from him <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and maintained a strict silence.|$|R
60|$|The magpie listened, hopped awhile from {{branch to}} branch, and then darted away, the princess {{watching}} him anxiously as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see.|$|E
60|$|However, Gwendolen soon reappeared, {{showing her}} usual spirits, and evidently {{determined}} to ignore as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> the striking change {{she had made}} {{in the part of}} Hermione.|$|E
60|$|Harry and Kate were silent. They had mourned {{over the}} news, and Kate had cried. There {{was nothing more}} {{to be done about}} it, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see.|$|E
60|$|In {{accordance}} with this proposal, the whole party stationed themselves round the stone cistern; the two children, being very weary, fell asleep upon the damp earth, and the pretty Shaker girl, whose feelings {{were those of}} a nun or a Turkish lady, crept {{as close as possible}} to the female traveller, and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> well <b>could</b> from the unknown men. The same person who had hitherto been the chief spokesman now stood up, waving his hat in his hand, and suffered the moonlight to fall full upon his front.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} a {{soothing}} vision came to her--the vision of George Bevan knocking off her brother Percy's hat. It {{was the only}} pleasant thing that had happened almost <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> remember. And then, for the first time, her mind condescended to dwell {{for a moment on}} the author of that act, George Bevan, the friend in need, whom she had met only the day before in the lane. What was George doing at Belpher? His presence there was significant, and his words even more so. He had stated explicitly that he wished to help her.|$|R
6000|$|The {{possibility}} of Mr. Collins's fancying himself {{in love with}} her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost <b>as</b> <b>far</b> from possibility <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not help crying out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think it}} is,' said Picotee outside, {{stretching}} her neck forward as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> 'No, {{it is the}} men on the beach dragging up their boats; they expect wind to-night.' ...|$|E
60|$|To put {{the matter}} in this {{negative}} way was as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> possibly go. It was {{for him to make}} the positive proposal to which she had thus thrown wide the door.|$|E
6000|$|It was as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get. There was a pause; his intellect was {{struggling}} to comprehend; presently it did manage to catch the idea in time to save embarrassment all around, and he said gratefully-- ...|$|E
60|$|The farmer's wife {{walked out}} in front of the house into the wind, calling Franco to follow. She then {{attempted}} to drive him along the road, much as Jonas had done. She brandished her stick at him, and, when she had succeeded in getting him <b>as</b> <b>far</b> from her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> by stern and threatening language, in order to drive him farther, she threw the stick at him with all her force.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, didn't you notice?--she {{looked about}} {{her when she}} came on deck to see whether there was anybody who WAS anybody sitting there, whom she might put her chair near. But the Governor of Madras hadn't come up from his cabin yet; and {{the wife of the}} chief Commissioner of Oude had three civilians hanging about her seat; and the daughters of the Commander-in-Chief drew their skirts away <b>as</b> <b>she</b> passed. So she did the next best thing--sat <b>as</b> <b>far</b> apart <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> from the common herd: meaning all the rest of us. If you can't mingle at once with the Best People, you can at least assert your exclusiveness negatively, by declining to {{associate}} with the mere multitude." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1949 {{she decided}} to visit her brother Neill, who was air attache in the embassy in Moscow, and to take {{advantage}} of his posting there. <b>She</b> flew <b>as</b> <b>far</b> east <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> to Helsinki, and continued her journey onwards piloted in another plane, or possibly by train. Once there she made a confounded nuisance of herself ignoring all the restrictions on movement by foreigners exploring wherever she liked. When confronted by Russian police or military she would pretend not to understand the regulations on account of the language barrier. On one occasion she discovered a car with a spare ration of petrol and vanished with it. She brought back with her some blue soap, relishing the colour in drab post war Britain.|$|R
6000|$|Jerry {{poked her}} head as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> out of the window. [...] "Miss Ponsonby, {{you are going to}} the dance," [...] she said in a {{cautious}} undertone, [...] "so don't cry any more or your eyes will be dreadfully red." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{had hoped}} for an answer here--for {{a few words to}} say that her conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone, he said, ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. MARCHMONT. Well, we are {{not going}} to praise her. I hear she went to the Opera on Monday night, and told Tommy Rufford at supper that, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see, London Society was entirely made up of dowdies and dandies.|$|E
60|$|Janet {{entered the}} room. She {{sat down on}} the sofa and took her mother's hand in hers. And Hannah {{submitted}} passively. Janet could not speak. A minute might have passed, and the silence, which neither had broken, acquired an intensity that to Janet became unbearable. Never had the room been so still! Her glance, raised instinctively to the face of the picture-clock, saw the hands pointing to ten. Every Monday morning, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> recall, her father had wound it before going to work--and to-day he had forgotten. Getting up, she opened the glass door, and stood trying to estimate the hour: it must be, she thought, about six. She set the hands, took the key from the nail above the shelf, wound up the weight, and started the pendulum. And the sound of familiar ticking was a relief, releasing at last her inhibited powers of speech.|$|R
60|$|While Ralph {{took off}} his coat, she had time to notice the ferns and {{photographs}} and draperies, and to hear a hum, or rather a babble, of voices talking each other down, {{from the sound of}} them. The rigidity of extreme shyness came over her. <b>She</b> kept <b>as</b> <b>far</b> behind Denham <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and walked stiffly after him into a room blazing with unshaded lights, which fell upon a number of people, of different ages, sitting round a large dining-room table untidily strewn with food, and unflinchingly lit up by incandescent gas. Ralph walked straight {{to the far end of}} the table.|$|R
60|$|It was in vain that he {{attempted}} to dazzle her {{with the prospect of}} a visionary throne. Rowena, who possessed strong sense, neither considered his plan as practicable, nor <b>as</b> desirable, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was concerned, <b>could</b> it have been achieved. Without attempting to conceal her avowed preference of Wilfred of Ivanhoe, she declared that, were that favoured knight out of question, she would rather take refuge in a convent, than share a throne with Athelstane, whom, having always despised, she now began, on account of the trouble she received on his account, thoroughly to detest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Signora," [...] he said, {{turning to}} the q-b. She did not like him, he was impudent, and she shut a deaf ear to him as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> [...] "Signora," [...] he said, [...] "do you {{understand}} me what I say?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{held out}} the warm deerhide garment, and the girl flashed a covert glance at him. He stood close by her in loose blue shirt and thin duck trousers, and, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see by the moonlight, his face was pinched and blue with cold.|$|E
6000|$|She went, and she saw, but she didn't see Bob! And he wasn't in {{the next}} room, or in any bed in the house, or under any bed, or {{anywhere}} at all, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see; and so, pretty soon, there was a nice hubbub in that house! ...|$|E
60|$|My lovely Clara {{also was}} lost to me--she who last of the daughters of man, {{exhibited}} all those feminine and maiden virtues, which poets, painters, and sculptors, have in their various languages strove to express. Yet, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was concerned, <b>could</b> I lament that she was removed in early youth from the certain advent of misery? Pure she was of soul, and all her intents were holy. But her heart was the throne of love, and the sensibility her lovely countenance expressed, was the prophet of many woes, not the less deep and drear, because she would have for ever concealed them.|$|R
60|$|Her own happiness, {{and her own}} spirits, were {{at least}} very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her {{expectation}} of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas. So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her, that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future, would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any {{thing in the world}} for those she really valued. As for Colonel Brandon, she was not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> possibly <b>could,</b> of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the body <b>as</b> <b>far</b> from it <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> {{and ran down}} the stairs to call for fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the {{consequences}} of what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.|$|R
