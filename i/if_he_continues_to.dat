However, in April 2005, Diarra revealed that he wanted to stay with Lens for the long-term. After finishing the season, on 24 June 2005, Liverpool granted his request after Lens reached an agreement with the club on a transfer fee, purported to be €3.2million.

500|$|To be {{eligible}} for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, a candidate needs to receive votes on 75 {{percent of the total}} ballots cast by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. However, if the candidate receives less than 5 percent, he is no longer eligible for future Hall of Fame consideration by the BBWAA. Smith was first eligible for the ballot five years after he retired, and is allowed to be on the ballot through 2017 <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> meet the minimum vote threshold. Should he fail to be elected by the BBWAA, he will remain eligible for consideration by the Veterans Committee; under current rules, his first chance for consideration by that body would be in 2019 for the induction class of 2020. In his first year of eligibility, 2003, Smith received 210 votes, or 42 percent of the 496 total ballots cast. The following year, Smith only received 185 votes, or 37 percent of the 506 total ballots cast. In 2005, Smith improved from the previous year's results, and received a total of 200 votes, or 39 percent of the 516 total cast. Smith came closer to joining the Hall of Fame in 2006 by receiving 45 percent of the ballots cast, or 234 votes. In 2007, Smith's received only 217 votes, just 40 percent of the 545 total ballots cast. Smith increased his total in 2008, with 235 votes, 43.3% of the total ballots cast. He received 44.5% of the vote in 2009 and 47.3% of the vote in 2010. In 2011, he received 45.3% of the vote. [...] He peaked at a new high of 50.6% in 2012, but dropped down to 47.8% the following year. [...] In 2014, he dropped to 29.9%, but received 30.2% of the vote in 2015. He failed to gain induction in 2017, when he received 34.2% of the vote in his 15th and final year on the ballot.|$|E

Then, he turned to Bennett, smiling: [...] "Tonight you come dinner. I must make body work". As he spoke, a great spasm of pain shook his body and blood gushed from an ear. Bennett thought: [...] "He has a {{cerebral}} haemorrhage. He will kill himself <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> force his body to move". But then he reflected: [...] "He has to do all this. If he allows his body to stop moving, he will die. He has power over his body".|$|E
2500|$|Edwin Percy Whipple from North American Review {{considered}} The Tenant [...] "less unpleasant" [...] than Wuthering Heights. However, both novels, in his opinion, {{were constructed}} with an [...] "excessive clumsiness" [...] and [...] "the brutal element of human nature" [...] was equally [...] "given prominence" [...] in them. He continues: [...] " [...] seems a convincing proof, {{that there is}} nothing kindly in author's powerful mind, and that, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> write novels, he will introduce into the land of romance a larger number of hateful men and women than any other author of the day. In Gilbert he sees [...] "nothing good, except rude honesty", and while acknowledging Helen's [...] "strong-mindedness", he finds no [...] "lovable or feminine virtues". Despite this, Whipple praised novels characterization: [...] "All the characters are drawn with great power and precision of outline, and the scenes are vivid as the life itself." [...] Helen's marriage to Arthur he sees as [...] "a reversal of the process carries on in Jane Eyre", but Arthur Huntingdon, in his opinion, is [...] "no Rochester". [...] "He is never virtuously inclined, except in those periods of illness and feebleness which his debaucheries have occasioned". Whipple concludes: [...] "The reader of Acton Bell gains no enlarged view of mankind, giving a healthy action to his sympathies, but is confined to a narrow space of life, and held down, as it were, by main force, to witness the wolfish side of his nature literally and logically set forth. But the criminal courts are not the places in which to take a comprehensive view of humanity and the novelist who confines his observation to them is not likely to produce any lasting impression except of horror and disgust".|$|E

60|$|Hard {{necessity}} {{has kept}} some great writers from {{doing their best}} work, but Mr. Stevenson is at last so firmly established that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> be versatile it will only be from choice. He has attained a popularity such as is, as a rule, only accorded to classic authors or to charlatans. For this he has America to thank rather than Britain, for the Americans buy his books, the only honor a writer's admirers are slow to pay him. Mr. Stevenson's reputation in the United States is creditable to that country, which has given him a position here in which only a few saw him when he left. Unfortunately, with popularity has come publicity. All day the reporters sit on his garden wall.|$|E

60|$|In Cairo I {{married a}} Copt. She was a lady of high descent, the {{tradition}} {{in her family}} being that they were sprung {{from one of the}} Ptolemaic Pharaohs, which is possible and even probable enough. Also, she was a Christian, and well educated in her way. But, of course, she remained an Oriental, and for a European to marry an Oriental is, as I have tried to explain to others, a very dangerous thing, especially <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> live in the East, where it cuts him off from social recognition and intimacy with his own race. Still, although this step of mine forced me to leave Cairo and go to Assouan, then a little-known place, to practise chiefly among the natives, God knows we were happy enough together till the plague took her, and with it my joy in life.|$|E
