This bushing is rotated via the rotary table and thus the pipe and the attached drill string turn while the polygonal pipe is free to slide vertically in the bushing as the bit digs the well deeper. When drilling, the drill bit is attached {{at the end of}} the drill string and thus the <b>kelly</b> <b>drive</b> provides the means to turn the bit (assuming that a downhole motor is not being used).|$|R
