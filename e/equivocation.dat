25|$|Examining Kuhn's use of {{the word}} {{solution}} more closely, Stove notes that Kuhn sometimes uses it in the ordinary way regarding practical knowledge, but at other times in a weaker sense, specific to Kuhn's theory, that a solution is relative to a paradigm, people, place and time. This <b>equivocation</b> on solution actually provides Stove with an answer of exactly the type he was looking for. All his authors, with many similar words, show similar <b>equivocation.</b> Stove lists knowledge, discovery, facts, verified, understanding, explanation and notes the list is far from complete. Idiosyncratic weak senses of these words are a characteristic of the writing of his subjects that explains clearly how a reader, presuming ordinary use of language, might believe them to be expressing something more orthodox than is, in fact, their intention.|$|E

He took this disparity to mean that human mathematicians are not formal proof systems and are not running a computable algorithm.

25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of <b>equivocation,</b> because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and the fallacy of composition, because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E

500|$|Statements {{regarding}} Jesuit-encouraged plots against Queen Elizabeth {{were read}} to the court, {{as well as some}} of the plotters' confessions. Garnet defended his use of <b>equivocation</b> with his own treatise on the doctrine. He had denied his conversation with Oldcorne as it was a secret, but said that in matters of faith, <b>equivocation</b> could never be lawful. When asked by Salisbury what he would do if the pope excommunicated King James, he [...] "denied to answer". His defence of <b>equivocation</b> was scorned by Coke, who called it [...] "open and broad lying and forswearing". [...] As for Tesimond's confession, the planned assassination had not at that point happened and so Salisbury said that Garnet could easily have alerted the government. [...] Salisbury attacked the idea that it had ever been made under the seal of the confessional, and claimed anyway that Garnet could have warned the authorities after his more ordinary conversation with Catesby about the death of innocents; the priest replied by saying that at the time, he did not understand the relevance of Catesby's questions. The Earl of Northampton said, in Latin, [...] "quod non-prohibet cum potest, jubet" [...] (what a man does not forbid when he can, he orders). Garnet's defence, that he had forbidden Catesby from proceeding, was futile.|$|E
500|$|Garnet first {{appeared}} {{in front of the}} Privy Council on 13 February 1606. Present were John Popham, Edward Coke, Sir William Waad, and the Earls of Worcester, Northampton, Nottingham and Salisbury. [...] Superficially, they treated him with respect, removing their hats and addressing him as [...] "Mr Garnet", although they made fun of his relationship with Anne Vaux, claiming he was her lover, not her confessor. During his questioning he admitted some of his movements, and that he had received Catesby's letter on 6 November, but he denied being involved in the plot, whose members he did not name. [...] Garnet was convinced that his captors were interested only in the failed scheme and believed {{he might be able to}} clear his name, but the councillors also asked him about the doctrine of <b>equivocation.</b> [...] His own treatise on this topic, one of the [...] "heretical, treasonable and damnable books" [...] found amongst Francis Tresham's possessions, was laid on the council table before him. [...] Although it condemned lying, Garnet's treatise supported the notion that when questioned, for instance, on the presence of a priest in his house, a Catholic might [...] "securely in conscience" [...] answer [...] "No" [...] if he had a [...] "secret meaning reserved in his mind". [...] The occasions on which a Catholic might legitimately use <b>equivocation,</b> he supposed, were limited, but such replies could be taken as an example of insincerity or deviousness—especially to the king's council, who may not have wanted to see Garnet prove his case. [...] The council's view of <b>equivocation</b> was very different from Garnet's. [...] In their eyes, it was simple deceit.|$|E

[...] Imprisoned in the Tower of London, his conversations with fellow prisoner Edward Oldcorne were monitored by eavesdroppers, and his letters to friends such as Anne Vaux were intercepted. [...] His guilt, announced {{at the end of}} his trial on 28 March 1606, was a foregone conclusion. [...] Criticised for his use of <b>equivocation,</b> which Coke called [...] "open and broad lying and forswearing", and attacked for not warning the authorities of what Catesby planned, he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.

500|$|Dara Gellman, an {{independent}} Canadian video artist, used the kiss sequence in [...] "Rejoined" [...] {{as the basis}} of her 3-minute 1999 project alien kisses. In this piece, the kiss scene is manipulated—the video is slowed, the image enlarged and digitized—and trance music is added. New media scholar Carolyn Guertin argues that this serves to make the footage [...] "even more alien", presenting queerness as [...] "unearthly". Jean Bruce argues that, despite the inherent ambiguity of the scene in the episode, [...] "the image is still one of two women kissing, which opens up the possibilities of queer desire on its own terms". Similarly, Guertin argues that Gellman translates the (not truly queer) scene into an [...] "expression of gay love that is alien and apart, but no less erotic for being so". In using the scene in isolation, alien kisses, Bruce argues, [...] "strips away the gender <b>equivocation</b> by imposing a new queer vision". She suggests that alien kisses works as an [...] "antidote" [...] to the [...] "ultimately tame treatment" [...] Star Trek has offered of queer themes, and as a [...] "suggestion" [...] that Star Trek acknowledge the desires of queer viewers and fans [...] "beyond the occasional titillating episode".|$|E
500|$|The playwright William Shakespeare {{had already}} used the {{family history of}} Northumberland's family in his Henry IV series of plays, and {{the events of the}} Gunpowder Plot seem to have {{featured}} alongside the earlier Gowrie conspiracy in Macbeth, written some time between 1603 and 1607. [...] Interest in the demonic was heightened by the Gunpowder Plot. The King had become engaged in the great debate about other-worldly powers in writing his Daemonology in 1597, before he became King of England as well as Scotland. [...] Inversions seen in such lines as [...] "fair is foul and foul is fair" [...] are used frequently, and another possible reference to the plot relates to the use of equivocation; Garnett's A Treatise of <b>Equivocation</b> was found on one of the plotters. [...] Another writer influenced by the plot was John Milton, who in 1626 wrote what one commentator has called a [...] "critically vexing poem", In Quintum Novembris. [...] Reflecting [...] "partisan public sentiment on an English-Protestant national holiday", in the published editions of 1645 and 1673 the poem is preceded by five epigrams {{on the subject of the}} Gunpowder Plot, apparently written by Milton in preparation for the larger work. [...] The plot may also have influenced his later work, Paradise Lost.|$|E

Coke called Garnet [...] "a doctor of five Ds, namely, of dissimulation, of deposing of princes, of disposing of kingdoms, of daunting and deterring of subjects, and of destruction". His supposed inappropriate relationship with Anne Vaux was mentioned, but his adherence to the doctrine of <b>equivocation</b> proved extremely damaging. Francis Tresham's deathbed letter, which claimed that Garnet had played no part in the so-called Spanish Treason, was read aloud. [...] Tresham claimed not to have seen Garnet [...] "for fifteen or sixteen years before", despite government evidence that the two had met more recently.

500|$|Tresham {{suffered}} from a strangury caused by an inflammation of his urinary tract, and in December 1605 his health began to decline. [...] Lieutenant of the Tower William Waad, wondering if Tresham would live long enough for justice to take its course, described his condition as [...] "worse and worse". [...] Tresham preferred {{the services of a}} Dr Richard Foster over those of the Tower's regular doctor Matthew Gwinne; apparently Foster understood his case, indicating that it was not the first occasion on which he had treated him. [...] During his last days he was attended by three more doctors and a nurse, along with William Vavasour, a rumoured illegitimate child of Thomas Tresham and possibly Francis's half-brother. [...] As Tresham's wife, Anne, was apparently too upset, Vavasour wrote Tresham's deathbed confession and also an account of his last hours. [...] Tresham apologised to the Jesuit priest Henry Garnet for implicating him in the Spanish Treason, and used the rest of his deathbed confession to protest his innocence. [...] Anne and William read prayers at his bedside; he died at 2:00am on 23December. [...] Despite not being tried, his head joined those of Catesby and Percy on display at Northampton, while his body was thrown into a hole at Tower Hill.

[...] Tresham's apology never reached its intended target, and his letter, along with the discovery of Garnet's Of <b>Equivocation,</b> found among the [...] "heretical, treasonable and damnable books" [...] at Tresham's chamber in the Inner Temple, was used to great effect by Sir Edward Coke in Garnet's trial.

500|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding street prostitution was {{the foul}} language used, and while generally most {{entries in the}} lists look favourably on those women who refrained from swearing, the views expressed in the 1793 edition of Harris's List tend towards <b>equivocation.</b> [...] Mrs Cornish's genteel nature was, on occasion, interrupted by [...] "a volley of small shot", and Miss Johnson's proclivity towards [...] "vulgarity of expression and a coarseness of manner" [...] apparently suffered no shortage of admirers. [...] Mrs Russell, attractive to [...] "a number of clients among the youth, who are fond of beholding that mouth of the devil from whence all corruption issueth", was admired for her [...] "vulgarity more than any thing else, she being extremely expert at uncommon oaths". [...] Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. [...] Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home [...] "so intoxicated {{so as not to}} be able to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a [...] "violent attachment to drinking". [...] Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, [...] "often toss off a sparkling bumper," [...] while remaining [...] "a lady of great sensibility... not a little clever in the performance of the act of friction." [...] More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as [...] "almost rotten, and her breath cadaverous". [...] Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree of annoyance on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. [...] Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited [...] "great indifference" [...] while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was [...] "acting his joys". [...] Others are scorned for wearing too much makeup, and some for being [...] "lazy bedfellows". [...] A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.|$|E
