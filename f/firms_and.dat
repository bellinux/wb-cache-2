In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair. Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>firm</b> <b>and</b> partner tenure on audit quality, where audit quality is proxied by {{discretionary}} accruals. We study a sample of Spanish listed companies between 2005 and 2011 and address both {{the individual and the}} interaction effects of <b>firm</b> <b>and</b> partner tenure. Our study is motivated by the current debate, particularly intense at the EU level, on {{the impact of}} the auditor rotation regime on the quality of auditing. We find that, without considering the interaction effects, <b>firm</b> <b>and</b> partner tenure do not seem to play a relevant role as determinants of audit quality. Importantly, the interaction of <b>firm</b> <b>and</b> partner tenure shows stronger effects on audit quality than both forms of tenure separately considered. Finally, our analysis suggests that audit quality is maximized when medium <b>firm</b> <b>and</b> partner tenures interact. However, results for the interaction variables are sensitive to the accruals estimation method...|$|R

One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000. By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500. In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.|$|E

This paper reports on new comparative analyses of New Zealand’s <b>firm</b> dynamics <b>and</b> business demography that attempt to control for measurement differences, using data from Statistics New Zealand’s Business Demographic Statistics database, the OECD firm-level project, and the OECD’s analysis of the Eurostat database. The variables investigated include firm size, <b>firm</b> turnover (entry <b>and</b> exit) rates, employment turnover rates, <b>firm</b> survival rates, <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> growth. The findings suggest that once measurement differences are taken into account, overall New Zealand’s <b>firm</b> dynamics <b>and</b> demographics are broadly similar to many other OECD countries. Potential policy implications of these findings are discussed. Firm Size; Firm Dynamics; <b>Firm</b> Growth; Entry <b>and</b> Exit...|$|R

5|$|In early 1973, {{shortly after}} {{assuming}} {{the role of}} United States Attorney for Maryland, George Beall opened an investigation of corruption in Baltimore County, involving public officials, architects, engineering <b>firms,</b> <b>and</b> paving contractors. Beall's target was the current political leadership in Baltimore County. There were rumors that Agnew might be involved, which Beall initially discounted; Agnew had not been county executive since December 1966, and any misdeeds done then would be past the statute of limitations. As part of the investigation, Lester Matz's engineering firm was served with a subpoena for documents, and through his counsel he sought immunity in exchange for cooperation in the investigation. Matz had been kicking back to Agnew {{five percent of the}} value of contracts received through his influence, first county contracts during his term in Towson, and subsequently state contracts while Agnew was governor.|$|E

He wanted to study medicine but financial circumstances prevented this. Between 1943 and 1965 he worked for several Belfast tailoring <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> then as assistant manager of a Co-op department store. He married Margaret ("Peggy") Sarah Martin, another science fiction fan, in 1955 and the couple had three children: daughter Patricia, and sons Martin and Peter. White later worked for the aeroplane builders Short Brothers Ltd. as a technical clerk (1965–1966), publicity assistant (1966–1968), and publicity officer (1968–1984).|$|E

5|$|Roark's modernist {{approach}} to architecture is contrasted {{with that of}} most of the other architects in the novel. In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve. Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> commissions from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job offer. The same conflict between innovation and tradition is reflected in the career of Roark's mentor, Henry Cameron.|$|E
5|$|The P.1154 {{was judged}} to be {{technically}} superior, however, the Mirage acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, which spread work across a number of member nations.

The P.1154 was ultimately selected to meet NBMR-3, however this {{did not lead to}} orders being placed. The French government subsequently withdrew from participation once the Dassault design had not emerged victorious. NATO lacked any central budget, relying on individual member nations to actually procure military equipment, and the NBMR-3 selection went unheeded by all of these nations. Thus, in 1965, the whole project was terminated.|$|E
