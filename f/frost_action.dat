40|$|Seasonal {{freeze-thaw}} cycles in cold {{regions are}} a key factor leading to pavement damage. The duration and penetration depth of freeze-thaw cycles in the foundation layers can significantly influence the pavement performance. Frost heaves and loss of support conditions are two direct results due to pavement freezing and thawing. Current research has brought great interests in this topic, which may benefit pavement design, construction, and maintenance. Sufficient freezing depth, continuous water supply, and frost susceptible geomaterials are the three factors required resulting in pavement freeze-thaw related damage. When these factors are satisfied, stiffness and support conditions can be significantly affected due to the phase change of moisture within pavement structures. In various current pavement design guides, seasonal variation in foundation layers is taken into consideration by empirically adjusting the foundation layer moduli values. As various QC/QA testing methods is used in practice, different mechanistic properties can be derived. Even though only a few particular parameters are considered in current pavement design guides, empirical correlations were reported for transferring different properties. Values of these measurable properties change seasonally, which may differ from the values of design parameters after correlations. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate if the seasonal mechanistic property values meet the design values and if the empirical correlations match to the in situ measurements.

30|$|The Caltrans {{method is}} mostly used in California whereas the AASHTO and AI methods {{are used in}} the {{majority}} of states in the USA. Several studies have investigated pavement deterioration in the USA and Canada. A recent study [16] has investigated the local streets and roads in California and found based on the data that came from recognized pavement management systems that the statewide average pavement condition is deteriorating at a rate that is causing the California’s local streets and roads system to reach a point of crisis. While inadequate design strength can contribute to the accelerated deterioration of pavements, other location related factors can also {{have a significant impact on}} pavement deterioration. In a Canadian study [11], it has been reported that climatic factors such as temperature, <b>frost</b> and thaw <b>action,</b> and moisture are a major cause of pavement deterioration. However, in locations such as California with moderate temperatures and low moistures, pavement deterioration rates are expected to be lower when considering similar pavement structures. Therefore, in California the accelerated deterioration of pavements can generally be attributed to factors such as traffic overloads and inadequate design strength. While recognizing the significance impact of the climatic factors on pavement deterioration, this paper will only investigate the influence of inadequate design strength on pavement performance.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} the diverse experimental {{methods and results}} on the deformational behavior of the phases of concrete (mortar, aggregate and interfacial transition zone - ITZ) in meso-scale during freeze-thaw cycle (FTC). The FTC damage in concrete {{has long been a}} durability related problem in cold region like here in Hokkaido. This is why there is a large volume of research to clarify and understand the frost damage in concrete. However in spite of the large volume of research there are no consensus on the damage mechanism of concrete due primarily to concrete’s heterogeneous characteristics and the complex behavior of moisture during FTC. With this regard, it is {{the purpose of this study}} to present the deformational behavior of the constituent part of concrete (mortar, aggregate and ITZ) which is believed to be distinct from each of the other to clarify each of their role during FTC and the overall deformation of concrete. Unlike the common methodology in frost damage in concrete, specimens were sealed in the experiment so that moisture and temperature can be controlled. In addition, meso-scale size specimens are used in this study. The meso-scale size can be used to simulate the <b>frost</b> <b>actions</b> in a specific (localized) location of a bulk sample with conditions similar with the data used. Specimens were subjected to FTC under different moisture conditions. The increase in void ratio and decrease in elastic modulus associated with frost damage have been investigated and are related to the CTE change of frost damaged specimens. The study also investigates the deformational behavior of the ITZ which have not been presented in the microstructural investigation of concrete. The behavior of aggregate during FTC has been investigated as well. Based on the experimental results, the findings indicate that the deformational behavior of the specimens under FTC is primarily dependent on the amount of its moisture. The larger the amount of moisture, the larger will be the resulting deformation in both expansion and contraction behavior. The expansion during FTC is understood and pointed to be caused by the hydraulic pressure caused by ice formation during FTC. The contraction phenomena is also observed prior to the expansion. Due to constant moisture content, a limitation in the increase in tensile strain is observed during FTC and this tensile strain decreases until contraction is observed. The contraction is attributed to the removal of gel pore water arising from negative pressures. With an increased pore volume (void ratio) due to microcracks arising from frost damage and more importantly absence of available water supply, the specimens becomes partially saturated and the displaced pore water cannot be refilled, thus the sample cannot re-expand and results in contraction at the end of the FTC. After FTC tests, results show that the CTE of frost damaged mortar increases and its elastic modulus decreases which are primarily caused by microcracking when frost damage takes place. The reduction in elastic modulus has been related to the increase in void ratio which re{{presents the}} formation of microcracks of frost damaged specimens. Microcracks act as broken bridges or links which can detach the aggregate from the hardened cement paste and in effect reduces (or removes) the thermal restraint that fine aggregate and cement paste exerts on the other. The hardened cement paste can then expand or contract more freely under temperature variation, and thus can significantly affect (increase) the CTE of the whole composite (mortar). The stress transfer in the material is prevented as well due to microcracking resulting in elastic modulus reduction. One the one hand, the aggregates did not indicate considerable permanent deformation during the whole FTC though the specimens were conditioned to be fully saturated. This verifies the common acceptable knowledge that aggregate are unaffected by frost damage. The ITZ deformation is determined as distinct (being far higher) from the mortar and aggregate which is the crucial reason why the ITZ is treated as a separate phase in concrete. Besides its weaker strength, the much higher deformation of the ITZ during FTC where cracking and prominent damage are initiated and could extend to the matrix shows the important role of the ITZ during frost damage and other factors such as wet dry cycles (WDC). The obtained deformational behavior of the ITZ, mortar, and aggregate in this investigation reflects their commonly described behavior during FTC. The ITZ and mortar deformation agrees well with the observations on the occurrence of cracks for frost-damaged specimens and non-occurrence of cracks for dry specimens. These indicates the reliability of the presented method and suggests that the experimental method can be used as a basis to obtain the deformational behavior of mortar, aggregate and ITZ during FTC. Significantly, the results presented here are first and a complete data on the deformational behavior of mortar, aggregate, and ITZ have not yet been presented. The results and methodology presented in this study is therefore important in clarifying, understanding and simulation of frost damage in concrete...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} {{mechanisms of}} a cementitious material are {{greatly influenced by}} the permeability of the material for potentially aggressive substances. As the pore structure might be different for SCC in comparison with traditional concrete, some changes in durability behaviour might be noticed.

A fundamental bottle neck in this discussion is the lack of fundamental insight in the transport behaviour of potentially aggressive media in SCC. This aspect, as well as the relation with the durability of SCC is studied in the Belgian research project "Transport properties of potentially aggressive substances in self-compacting concrete and relation with durability", sponsored by the Research Programme of the Research Foundation – Flanders (F.

40|$|Natural {{environment}} of mid-latitude deserts of Central Asia is undergoing rapid changes. One of its elements is the relief. What {{needs to be}} particularly emphasized is its morphogenesis and landform evolution. In this study, a geomorphological research in the Ejina Basin (Inner Mongolia) is carried out with regard to identifying the main landforms and the contemporary geomorphic processes. We consider ancient and modern landforms as a unit and provide a general explanation for their evolution. Related environmental indications of existing landforms are discussed {{on the basis of}} climate geomorphology. Results show that the current basin is under the conditions favorable for the development and dominance of landforms originated from physical processes such as desiccation-deflation and aeolian. The landform system is characterized by its variable structure which is conditioned by specific hydrodynamics processes that existed during glaciations. It is suggested that landform patterns in Ejina are under the strong influence of rapid and/or intensive geomorphic processes. These signatures reflect the regional dynamics of landform evolution as characterized by a very effective integration of tectonic and climate-driven morphogenetic processes. Based on the present day climate data, we infer an obvious linkage of desert gorges and pediments in the basin to ancient humid phases, which provided high energy runoff for the formation of these landforms and were associated with erosional features under more humid and colder climate during the last glacial period. Desert plains and aeolian dunes in the central basin are the related products of contemporary climate. Clear evidences proving the landform inconsistency and landform instability in the Ejina are presented, indicating that the main geomorphic unit is experiencing transformation from alluvial plain to desert plain and then to aeolian dunes. However, the geomorphodiversity in the Ejina should be a compound result of complex surficial processes other than glaciation. <b>Frost</b> weathering, fluvial/alluvial <b>action,</b> desiccation-deflation and aeolian processes as well as climatic changes have played important roles...|$|R
