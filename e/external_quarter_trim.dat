50|$|The Carriage Roof option (still only {{available}} in white canvas-embossed vinyl; but now standard on Bill Blass Designer Series) received new interior rear <b>quarter</b> <b>trim</b> panel inserts (a blanked off, color-keyed padded vinyl insert filler panel covering {{the area where}} the deleted opera windows were - with round (non-switch-operated) reading/courtesy lights in the center of these panels on each side; thus effectively replacing 1978's rear quarter panel vanity mirrors). These new interior <b>quarter</b> <b>trim</b> panel inserts would also appear on the Collector's Series, (in color-keyed vinyl, or cloth - depending on the seat trim color) as the exterior landau roof design also eliminated the opera windows on this model. Here, though, the reading/courtesy lights in these quarter panel inserts had control switches above the rear seat quarter armrests, to allow them to operate as customary door-jamb activated interior courtesy lights, as well as rear seat passengers being able to switch them on and off independently as true reading lamps.|$|R
5000|$|The 1967 Deluxe Interior was revised, discontinuing the {{embossed}} running horse motif on {{the seat}} backs (the source for the [...] "pony interior" [...] nickname) {{in favor of a}} new deluxe interior package, which included special color options, brushed aluminum (from August 1966 production) or woodgrain dash trim, seat buttons, and special door panels. The hardtop also included upholstered <b>quarter</b> <b>trim</b> panels, a carryover from the 1965-66 deluxe interior. The 1967 hardtop also had the chrome <b>quarter</b> <b>trim</b> caps, carried over from 1965-66, but these were painted to match the interior in 1968 models. The 1967 deluxe interior included stainless steel-trimmed seat back shells, similar to those in the Thunderbird. These were dropped {{at the end of the}} 1967 model year, and were not included in the woodgrain-trimmed 1968 interior. The deluxe steering wheel, which had been included in the deluxe interior for the 1965-66, became optional, and could also be ordered with the standard interior. The 1968 models that were produced from January 1968 were also the first model year to incorporate three-point lap and shoulder belts (which had previously been optional, in 1967-68 models) as opposed to the standard lap belts. The air-conditioning option was fully integrated into the dash, the speakers and stereo were upgraded, and unique center and overhead consoles were options. The fastback model offered the option of a rear fold-down seat, and the convertible was available with folding glass windows. Gone was the Rally-Pac, since the new instrument cluster had provisions for an optional tachometer and clock. Its size and shape also precluded the installation of the accessory atop the steering column. The convenience group with four warning lights for low fuel, seat belt reminder, parking brake not released, and door ajar were added to the instrument panel, or, if one ordered the optional console and A/C, the lights were mounted on the console.|$|R

25|$|A Chevelle SE (special edition) was {{available}} and provided {{front and rear}} spoilers, turbine II wheels, F60x15 tires, special graphics and decals, <b>quarter</b> window <b>trim,</b> front and rear sway bars, F41 sport suspension and a deluxe interior. Three colors were available. 50 of these rare cars were built. In 1978, GM downsized its intermediate line and decided to apply the Malibu name to the whole range as it had higher recognition among buyers than Chevelle.|$|R
2500|$|For the US market, two limited {{production}} GTV-6 models stand out. The Balocco (named {{after the}} famous Balocco test track in Italy) appeared in 1982 with a production run of only 350 cars. The Balocco was {{available only in}} red with sunroof and black interior, leather-wrapped steering wheel and red piping on the seats. There were also two green Quadrifoglio badges fixed on the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>trim</b> pieces above a badge with the [...] "Balocco SE" [...] designation. A plaque inset in the glove box door designated {{the number of the}} car out of the series of 350 (XXX of 350). Later there was the GTV6 2.5 Maratona, of which only 150 were built. The Maratona model included a more aggressive aerodynamic trim package, lightweight Speedline wheels, clear engine view port, sunroof, wood steering wheel and shift knob, rear louvers and Carello fog lamps. All 150 cars were available only painted silver and with a black leather interior; and came with [...] "Maratona" [...] badging on the rear decklid, front fenders and glove box door.

50|$|The Bulldogs {{started the}} second half with a 1-yard {{touchdown}} run by Lennon Creer to take a 31-14 lead with 11:15 {{left in the third}} quarter. Jay Dudley intercepted a pass by Matt Faulkner and returned it for a 36-yard touchdown to make the score 38-14 for Louisiana Tech. Dudley's interception return for a touchdown marked the second INT return for a touchdown in the last three games. San Jose State scored a touchdown and a two-point conversion with 43 seconds left in the third <b>quarter</b> to <b>trim</b> Louisiana Tech's lead to 38-22. San Jose State would score another touchdown with a 20-yard touchdown reception to Ryan Otten to make the final score Louisiana Tech 38-28.|$|R
50|$|The Philadelphia Eagles {{opened up}} the season by {{traveling}} to Cleveland to square off against the Browns. A 43-yard field goal by veteran Browns kicker Phil Dawson gave Cleveland a 3-0 lead some six minutes into the first quarter. The Eagles would respond with a field goal of their own, though, as Alex Henery sent the ball through the uprights from 42-yards out just seconds into the second period. With the score tied at 3-3 and just seventeen seconds before the half, an 18-yard pass from Eagles' quarterback Michael Vick to wideout Jeremy Maclin extended the Eagles lead by seven. At the half, the score was 10-3, the Eagles leading the Browns by a seven-point margin. Browns kicker Phil Dawson successfully converted another field goal from 42-yards away with just under five {{minutes left in the}} third <b>quarter,</b> <b>trimming</b> the score to 10-6. Shortly afterwards, Dawson made the score 10-9 with a 22-yard field goal, his third of the day, and narrowing the Eagles' lead to one point with about fourteen minutes left in the game. The underdog Browns continued the scoring streak, taking the lead on an errant Michael Vick throw and 27-yard interception return touchdown by D'Qwell Jackson approximately thirty seconds later. With the score at 16-10 and an upset in the works, Michael Vick calmly drove the Eagles down the field and threw a strike to Clay Harbor from 4-yards out to return the lead to Philadelphia, 17-16. The Browns were unable to reciprocate and the Philadelphia Eagles narrowly claimed the week one victory. With the nail-biting win, the Eagles began their season 1-0.|$|R
40|$|Advancements {{in science}} and {{technology}} particularly in the field of biotechnology and medicine have given rise to various ethical and moral challenges. In Malaysia, these challenges require deliberation which incorporates the scientific and the religious enterprise. This study documents the various processes involved. It shows that bioethics assessment of issues such as genetically-modified food (GMF), the use of porcine enzyme (in livestock), the use of botox, organ transplantation and stem cell treatment is better addressed by the close collaboration of scholars from the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia, the Selangor Mufti Department and the Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia with members of the academia of the various public institutions of higher learning (IPTA). Bioethical issues are systematically addressed with specific focus of three indicators namely â€“ the formulation and issuance of Fatwa (religious decree), the process of Halal certification and the reliability of the source of information. The findings show that contrary to popular belief, religious authorities do not deliberate fatwa exclusively without the involvement of <b>external</b> <b>quarters</b> but rather it is complemented by scientific evidence afforded by academic experts from IPTA together with the contributions of relevant institutions such as the Ministry Of Health, National Department of Chemistry and Malaysian Agriculture Research and Development Institute...|$|R

5000|$|Spain and Argentina met in {{the fifth}} place game in a match billed by the media as the [...] "clash for crumbs" [...] after both teams fell short of {{expectations}} as pre-tournament favorites. [...] The majority of the game was surprisingly uncompetitive, as Argentina never trailed {{at any point in}} the game. After extending a 17-point halftime lead to 25 on Carlos Delfino's three-pointer with 6:45 left in the third quarter, Spain mounted a furious comeback. Rudy FernÃ¡ndez scored eleven points and Sergio Llull added seven more during a 28-6 run over the last 6:30 of the third <b>quarter</b> that <b>trimmed</b> Argentina's lead to 65-62 entering the final quarter.

2500|$|On January 4, 2015, the Cowboys, as {{the number}} 3 seed, hosted the number 6 seed Detroit Lions in the wild card round of the NFL playoffs. In the game, the Lions {{got off to a}} hot start, going up 14â€“0 in the first quarter. Dallas {{initially}} struggled {{on both sides of the}} ball. However, towards the end of the second quarter Romo threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams. Matt Prater of the Lions would kick a field goal before halftime to go up 17â€“7. Dallas came out swinging to start the second half by picking off Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford on the first play of the third quarter. However, the Cowboys failed to capitalize on the turnover, as Dan Bailey missed a field goal during Dallas's ensuing drive. Detroit then kicked another field goal to make the score 20â€“7. A DeMarco Murray touchdown later in that quarter closed the gap to 20â€“14. A 51-yard Bailey field goal almost 3 minutes into the fourth <b>quarter</b> <b>trimmed</b> the Cowboys' deficit to 3. The Lions got the ball back and started driving down the field. On 3rd down-and-1 of that Lions drive, Stafford threw a 17-yard pass intended for Lions tight end Brandon Pettigrew, but the ball hit Cowboys linebacker Anthony Hitchens in the back a fraction of a second before he ran into Pettigrew. The play was initially flagged as defensive pass interference against Hitchens. However, the penalty was then nullified by the officiating crew. The Cowboys got the ball back on their 41-yard line and had a successful 59-yard drive which was capped off by an 8-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Williams to give the Cowboys their first lead of the game at 24â€“20. The Lions got the ball back with less than 2:30 to play in regulation. Stafford fumbled the ball at the 2 minute mark. The fumble was recovered by Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, who then fumbled the ball which was recovered by the Lions. Lawrence would redeem himself by sacking Stafford on a 4th down-and-3 play. The sack led to Stafford fumbling the ball again, which Lawrence recovered to seal the game for the Cowboys, who won 24â€“20. This was the first time in franchise playoff history that Dallas had been down by 10 or more points at halftime and rallied to win the game. The following week, the Cowboys traveled to Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin to play the Packers in the divisional round. Despite having a 14â€“7 halftime lead, the Cowboys fell to the Packers 26â€“21, thus ending their season. The season ended on an overturned call of a completed catch by Dez Bryant. The catch was challenged by the Packers, and the referees overturned the call because of the [...] "Calvin Johnson rule." ...|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the nature}} of the case, and {{considering}} the isolation of Ireland, it is extremely difficult, or rather impossible, to procure independent foreign testimony, to the truth of Irish annals. But, although such testimony is denied us, yet there happily exists another kind of evidence to which we may appeal with comparative confidence. This is nothing less than the records of natural phenomena reported in the annals, for if it can be shown by calculating backwards, as modern science has enabled us to do, that such natural phenomena as the appearance of comets or the occurrence of eclipses are recorded to the day and hour by the annalists, then we can also say with something like certainty that these phenomena were recorded at their appearance by writers who personally observed them, and whose writings must have been actually consulted and seen by these later annalists whose books we now possess. If we take, let us say, the Annals of Ulster, which treat of Ireland and Irish history from about the year 444, but of which the written copy dates only from the 15th century, we see from the years 496 to 884 as many as eighteen records of eclipses and comets, and all these agree exactly with modern astronomy. How impossible it is to keep such records unless written memoranda are made at the time by eyewitnesses is shown by the fact that Bede, born in 675, in recording the great solar eclipse that took place only eleven years before his own birth, is yet two days astray in his date; while on the other hand the Annals of Ulster give, not only the correct day, but the correct hour, thus showing that their compiler, Cathal Maguire, had access either to the original, or a copy of an original, account by an eyewitness. Whenever any side-lights have been thrown from an <b>external</b> <b>quarter</b> on the Irish annals, either from Cymric, Saxon, or Continental sources, they have always tended to show their accuracy. We may take it then without any credulity on our part, that Irish history as recorded in the annals may be pretty well relied upon from the 4th century onward.|$|R

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of seven}} decontamination measures to reduce Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 (VTEC) -contaminated carcass quarters {{in a typical}} Dutch dairy-beef industrial slaughterhouse were explored. To estimate the effectiveness a stochastic epidemiological-simulation model was used and to estimate the net cost a deterministic-economic model. The estimated baseline prevalence of daily-contaminated quarters was 9. 16 % (with a 90 % confidence interval 4. 40 - 13. 10 %). A reduction in the prevalence of VTEC-contaminated quarters to 2 % using decontamination measures is achieved at costs of 0. 20 to 0. 50 per quarter, which is 16 - 40 % of the net profit per carcass. A reduction to a prevalence of 1 % will cost 0. 50 - 1. 00 per <b>quarter.</b> Additional carcass <b>trim</b> and carcass steam-pasteurization are considered as the most cost-effective decontamination measures with costs of 16, 340 and 20, 243 per year to achieve a 1 % prevalence reduction.

40|$|Abstract â€” Piezoelectric tubes with <b>quartered</b> <b>external</b> elec-trodes {{have been}} widely used as {{scanners}} in modern scanning probe microscopes. Various feedback control techniques have been developed to improve bandwidth and accuracy of these scanners. Non-contact displacement sensors, e. g. capacitive and inductive sensors, have been used for position feedback. How-ever, their measurements contain a significant noise component if operated over large bandwidths. As an alternative measure of displacement, the piezoelectric voltage induced in a tube nanopositioner has been proposed recently. This technique provides a much improved noise figure, up to three orders of magnitude better than capacitive sensors. In this arrangement, an electrode is used to actuate the tube, while the opposite electrode is used as a sensor. Operating the tube in this mode has two drawbacks: i) the operating range of the tube is reduced to half, and ii) the tube is driven asymmetrically, thus the opposite sides of the tube are no longer stressed antisymmetrically, i. e. the tube cannot be considered as a perfectly collocated system. In this paper, a new electrode pattern for piezoelectric tube scanners is presented.

The teams were tied at 90-90 heading into the fourth quarter, but Bryant and Gasol led the fourth quarter rally and the Lakers won the game 124-112. Game 3 was played in Phoenix, where the Suns used their big men and physical play to win the game. Amar'e Stoudemire scored 42 points and grabbed 11 rebounds while Robin Lopez 20 points. Odom and Bynum, however, both picked up fouls early and were ineffective for the Lakers for most of the game. The Lakers only scored 15 points in the second quarter and were down 86-84 in after three quarters. The Lakers were able to take the lead 90-89 with 8:47 to play, but the Suns rallied back to win 118-109. After battling each other in game 4 and slugging out a 23-23 first quarter, the Suns erupted for a 41 points in the second quarter, shooting 74%. Early in the 4th quarter the Lakers led 87-85. However, the Suns reserve players (who outscored the Lakers reserves 54-20) produced and 18-3 run in the 4th which the Lakers never recovered from despite Bryant's 38 points and 10 assists. In game 5, the Lakers surged to a 16-point lead in the first half including a 21-4 run and led by 18 points by half time.
