40|$|Haymaking is an {{operation}} that must {{be done in a}} certain space of time that is short at best and that is always liable to be made shorter by bad weather. For this reason there is perhaps no farm operation in which system and efficiency count for more than in haymaking; yet throughout the hay-growing area more or less haphazard methods of haymaking are still very common. This bulletin is designed to point out ways in which the more successful hay growers of the country save time and labor in this important field work. It tells how the growing scarcity of farm labor may be met by rearranging crews and changing methods, and by the adoption of up-to-date implements, such as the <b>hay</b> <b>loader,</b> push rake, and stacker. In addition to outlines of methods for various sized crews and acreages the bulletin presents, briefly, a discussion of the theory of curing hay, a thorough understanding of which is a great help in planning an efficient method of haymaking.

40|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War II {{augmented}} {{the necessity of}} utilizing agriculture 2 Ì† 7 s resources to the fullest extent in meeting increased food demands with reduced supplies of labor. One of the principal means of expanding production under such conditions is by fuller use of available farm machinery. Unfortunately, however, when a state of national emergency was declared in May, 1941, little was known either about the utilization of Iowa farm machinery or about the numbers of various types of machines available on the farms. To provide the needed information a survey was conducted in August and September of 1941 {{with the cooperation of}} the Work Projects Administration and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Information was collected in August from 2, 911 farms regarding corn planters, grain binders, grain drills, double disks, single disks, <b>hay</b> <b>loaders,</b> manure spreaders, mowers, plows, rakes, rollers, seeders, spike harrows and spring tooth harrows. The September survey obtained information from 3, 012 farms on. cornpickers, combines, ensilage cutters, grain elevators, corn shellers, feed grinders, milking machines, tractors, trucks, trailers and wagons 2 (table 1) ...|$|R
