40|$|Abstract. Beyond imaging {{the mass}} {{distribution}} of materials by X-ray absorption techniques recent synchrotron and laboratory X-ray refraction techniques provide interface contrast imaging of micro structures. This is of specific relevance to carbon fibre composites (CFRP) which constitute advanced aerospace components. Apart from merely finding isolated flaws like cracks or pores within the natural high interface density only the quantitative measurement of the differences after defined mechanical treatment provides a reliable understanding of the related macroscopic properties. The contribution of the <b>fibre</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>interface</b> of CFRP laminates to the mechanical properties is investigated by relating the mechanical damage to the additional fibre debonding after impact and fatigue. Composites of industrially sized carbon fibres for aerospace applications and of unsized fibres are compared...|$|E

Samples of matrices were exposed to the long term heat treatment in the range 1100 – 1500 °C.

Water absorption tests were conducted by immersing specimens in distilled water at room temperature until saturation (4076 h). Water absorption curves and characteristic parameters such as coefficient of diffusion and equilibrium moisture content were determined. The composites exhibited a deviation from the Fickian behaviour with a positive role played by the addition of glass fibres in terms of moisture resistance. The influence of water uptake on tensile and flexural properties of composites was evaluated and a significant reduction in both strength and modulus was observed, with a superior strength retention offered by hybrid composites. Acoustic emission (AE) and scanning electron microscopy enabled to identify the weakening of <b>fibre!</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>interface</b> induced by water ageing.

40|$|An {{improved}} micromechanics {{model has}} been developed of the stress transfer for a single fibre embedded in a matrix subjected to uniaxial loading. Debond crack growth is analysed based on the shear strength criterion such that when the interfacial shear stress reaches the shear bond strength, debonding occurs; and the average strength concept based on Weibull statistics is considered for fibre fragmentation. The influences of the interfacial shear bond strength and the fibre strength on the stress distributions in the composite constituents are evaluated. Depending on the relative magnitudes of these two strength parameters and given the elastic constants and geometric factors, three distinct conditions of the <b>fibre</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>interface</b> are properly identified which include full bonding, partial debonding and full frictional bonding. Also quantified are the necessary criteria which must be satisfied in order for each interface condition to be valid. Finally, the mean fibre fragment length is predicted {{as a function of}} applied strain using a model composite of carbon fibre-epoxy matrix. The parametric study suggests that the critical transfer length predicted when the applied strain (or stress) required for further fibre fragmentation approaches infinity, can be regarded as a material constant, which is the sum of the bonded and the debonded lengths for the model composite...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research was driven by the capability of the Ultrasonic Consolidation (UC) manufacturing process to create smart metal matrix composites for use within high value engineering sectors, such as aerospace. The UC process is a hybrid additive/subtractive manufacturing process that embeds fibres into metal matrices via the exploitation of a high plastic flow, low temperature phenomenon encountered at ultrasonic frequency mechanical vibrations. The research concerned {{an investigation of the}} use of the UC process for embedding Nickel-Titanium alloy (NiTi) shape memory alloy (SMA) fibres into Aluminium (Al) matrices which could potentially be used as vibration damping structures, stress state variable structures, as well as other future smart material applications. It was hypothesised that the fibre volume fraction within a UC matrix was limited due to a reduction in foil/foil bonding, caused by increased fibre numbers, as opposed to the total level of plastic flow of the matrix material being insufficient to accommodate the increased fibre numbers. This hypothesis was tested by increasing the NiTi SMA fibre volume fraction, within an Al 3003 (T 0) metal matrix, beyond that of previous UC work. The metal matrix and the <b>fibre</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>interface</b> of these samples was then microscopically analysed and the overall UC sample integrity was tested via mechanical peel testing.

The continuous hydration of cement and natural carbonation filled the smaller pores but contrarily the large pores remained in the porous <b>fibre</b> to <b>matrix</b> <b>interface</b> in the samples exposed to weathering. On the other hand, their microstructure presented lower air permeability than samples aged in the internal environment of the laboratory.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for modelling the post-fatigue strength and stiffness of notched fibre composite laminates has been developed. It {{is based on}} the observation of notch tip damage which can be quantified by the extent of the individual failure processes, splitting in the 0 ° plies and delamination between the 0 ° ply and off-axis plies. The notch tip damage zone grows stably under tensile cyclic loading in a self-similar manner and {{the size and shape of}} this damage zone is dependent on laminate geometry and constituent properties of the <b>fibre,</b> <b>matrix</b> and <b>interface.</b> The post-fatigue strength and stiffness of the laminate can be related uniquely to the split length, which defines the extent of damage growth.

This paper proposes {{to investigate the}} materials {{that could be used}} following Ashby's selection method.

40|$|A comprehensive, micromechanical model, {{relating}} the longitudinal stress and transverse strain during tensile testing of unidirectional <b>fibre</b> toughened ceramic <b>matrix</b> composites, has been developed. The model uses different unit-cells {{to describe the}} composite and considers all relevant damage as it develops throughout a tensile test. Specifically, the proposed model {{takes into account the}} Poisson contraction of <b>fibre</b> and <b>matrix,</b> the redistribution of mechanical stress and the relief of thermal stress due to the development of damage, and the build-up of compressive radial stresses at the interface due to the radial mismatch between <b>fibre</b> and <b>matrix</b> after <b>interface</b> debonding and sliding.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} of SiCp / 6061 A 1 in 3 % NaCl solution, at pH {{values of}} 3. 8, 7. 2 and 10. 2, {{has been studied}} using SEM and combined scanning Auger electron/ X-ray microscopy. The MMC, fabricated by powder metallurgy, contains approximately 15 percent (volume) SiC as < 10 mum particles. Scatter diagrams are applied to analyze elemental maps created by scanning Auger microscopy. The experiments reveal that some impurity elements such as Fe, Ti etc., introduced during fabrication, form intermetallic compounds and {{that these are the}} dominant factors causing micro-galvanic corrosion. The Auger maps show, by inspection, that oxygen is enriched after exposure around these intermetallics. This has been confirmed by using scatter diagrams to analyze the data contained within the map. The phenomenon is probably caused by the dissolution of aluminium, resulting in the deposition of porous corrosion products such as Al(OH) 3 and AlOOH. Because of a low overpotential for oxygen reduction, the intermetallic compounds are expected to act as cathodes. This is confirmed by the finding of magnesium hydroxide {{on the surface of the}} intermetallics after exposure of the specimen in MgCl 2 solution. It is shown that the onset of this deposition can be used to estimate the cathodic current density at the cathode. Current density at the SiC particles, estimated by this method is negligible, suggesting that the principal cause of corrosion is found in the interaction between the aluminium alloy and the intermetallics. The same method is used for SiC, / 6061 A 1 MMC. Intermetallic particles are found much more likely to be located at a <b>fibre</b> / <b>matrix</b> <b>interface,</b> and they are still a sensitive factor for localized corrosion. There is some Cr in the Fe-containing intermetallics in this matrix, this type of intermetallic is not very susceptible to micro-galvanic corrosion. Another different aspect is that the reinforcing material in SiCf / 6061 A 1 MMC is directly associated with the micro-corrosion cell. The reinforcing SiC fibre belongs to the SCS series which consists of three different layers. The SiC is grown on a carbon core by chemical vapour deposition and a protective coating is applied on the outside of the fibre. This coating is mainly composed of carbon which is slightly enriched in silicon at the surface. In this investigation we found that carbon core and carbon coating act as cathodes and form a galvanic cell with surrounding aluminium alloy. This is confirmed by the magnesium decoration method. Electrochemical techniques are also used. Several kinds of SiC fibres and graphite fibres are cathodically polarized in 3 % NaCl solution. By comparison with the anodic polarization curve of A 1 alloy, the galvanic cells between A 1 alloy and carbon core or protective coating are confirmed. There is no galvanic effect between A 1 and pure SiC. Al 3 Fe is extracted from intermetallic enriched A 1 alloy, and the electrochemical performance of this intermetallic is investigated...|$|R
