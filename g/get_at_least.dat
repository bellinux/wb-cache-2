Pujols had five hits, three home runs, four runs scored, and six RBIs in the game. He joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players in {{baseball}} history to hit three home runs in a World Series game (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year), {{became the first}} player in series history to have hits in four consecutive innings, and tied records for most hits and most RBIs in a World Series game. He had one hit and no RBIs the other six games of the series but became a World Series champion for the second time as the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E

25|$|The {{procedure}} {{by which}} deputies are elected {{is a mixture}} of first past the post and run-off systems. A candidate must take an absolute majority (more than 50%) in their constituency to win in the first round, and receive the support of at least 25% of all registered voters. Otherwise, if they <b>get</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 12.5% of the votes of all registered voters in the first round, or are one of the top two candidates remaining, they go through to the second round, where only a simple plurality is needed to win.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Californians {{voted on}} Proposition 2, which {{requires}} California farmers to provide egg-laying hens, veal calves, and pregnant pigs with housing {{that gives them}} enough room to move around beginning January 1, 2015. The law would mostly impact the state's 18 million egg-laying hens. The current industry standards call for caged hens to <b>get</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 67 square inches of space each, {{a little less than}} a regular-size sheet of paper, (a sheet of paper is 93.5 square inches) and hens are typically caged in groups of two to eight. Proposition 2 grew into the most expensive animal welfare ballot measure ever, with both sides raising nearly $8 million each. The measure passed with 63.2 percent of the vote.|$|E
25|$|There {{will usually}} be an {{estimate}} of what price the lot will fetch. In an ascending open auction it is considered important to <b>get</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a 50-percent increase in the bids from start to finish. To accomplish this, the auctioneer must start the auction by announcing a suggested opening bid (SOB) that is low enough to be immediately accepted {{by one of the}} bidders. Once there is an opening bid, there will quickly be several other, higher bids submitted. Experienced auctioneers will often select an SOB that is about 45 percent of the (lowest) estimate. Thus there is a certain margin of safety to ensure that there will indeed be a lively auction with many bids submitted. Several observations indicate that the lower the SOB, the higher the final winning bid. This is due to {{the increase in the number}} of bidders attracted by the low SOB.|$|E
5000|$|Thus every {{candidate}} <b>gets</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one ballot with a mark, and one ballot {{without a}} mark; {{as a result}} seeing any one ballot does not tell if the voter voted for the candidate or not.

500|$|After the {{ordinance}} passed, over thirty conservative political professionals and ministers from various faiths met in Bryant and Green's home {{to discuss a}} plan to raise publicity and attempt to <b>get</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 10,000 signatures on a petition to force the issue {{to be decided by}} a county voter referendum. They approved the name [...] "Save Our Children, Inc.", and voted Bryant their president, Bob Green treasurer and a man named Robert Brake—a devout Catholic with a record of civil rights participation, but increasingly concerned with the liberalization of Miami city politics—its secretary. With the assistance of a Republican-affiliated advertising executive named Mike Thompson, the coalition eschewed subtlety. They held a press conference where Bryant held a pamphlet about homosexuality she claimed was being distributed at area high schools (a statement she later retracted), and said Dade County homosexuals [...] "are trying to recruit our children into homosexuality". Far exceeding the required number of signatures, the coalition delivered more than 64,000 signatures within six weeks demanding a referendum vote, which the commission set for June 7, 1977.|$|E
500|$|The Conservatives {{did well}} in Atlantic Canada, gaining two seats in Newfoundland and nine in Nova Scotia, and {{sweeping}} Prince Edward Island's four seats. However, in Quebec, they gained only five seats as the province returned 62Liberals. The Tories gained 29seats in Ontario. Howe was defeated by Fisher, and told the media that some strange disease was sweeping the country, but as for him, {{he was going to}} bed. The Liberals still led by a narrow margin as the returns began to come in from Manitoba, and St. Laurent told Liberal minister Pickersgill that he hoped that the Tories would <b>get</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one more seat than the Liberals so they could get out of an appalling situation. As the Tories forged ahead in Western Canada, Diefenbaker flew from Prince Albert to Regina to deliver a television address and shouted to Grosart as yet another cabinet minister was defeated, [...] "Allister, how does the architect feel?"

500|$|Due {{to their}} lackluster 2013 performance, the Phillies had the seventh first-round {{pick in the}} June 5–7 MLB draft. They {{selected}} Aaron Nola, a starting pitcher from Louisiana State University predicted {{by many to be}} one of the first draft picks to reach the major leagues, for fast-tracking through the Phillies' minor-league system. In the second round, they selected another pitcher – lefthander Matt Imhof, who played college ball with the Cal Poly Mustangs – and selected Aaron Brown, a pitcher-outfielder from Pepperdine, in the third round. The Phillies changed their organizational draft philosophy from drafting unpolished players with potential to selecting players ready to contribute to the big-league club, picking only one high-school player in the first 28 rounds. Michael Baumann wrote on the Crashburn Alley blog, [...] "Given how high the Phillies drafted and how bad their farm system is at the top, I wanted them to get back into the game with one swing. This draft won’t do that, but generally you want to <b>get</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one good major league player out of every draft class, plus some odds and ends." ...|$|E

If none of the candidates <b>get</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 75% {{in the first round of}} voting, one of the candidates hands over her votes to another candidate, and the candidate who finally obtains at least 75% of the votes becomes the Elder. If there is no one else in the election, the current year's student council president becomes the Elder. In Otoboku, Mizuho gains 82% of the votes in the first round, effectively becoming the 72nd Elder in the school's history. After becoming Elder, Mizuho progressively gets more popular among the student body since he is now a symbol of the school's excellence. In the following months, Mizuho starts to get to know some of the girls better and helps them with their problems.|$|E
