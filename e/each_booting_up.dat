50|$|The DSS-1 has its {{operating}} system stored on ROM chips, {{so if you}} lose your floppy disks you can still <b>boot</b> the system <b>up</b> (unlike the E-mu Emulator, Ensoniq Mirage, and early Roland samplers which required you always have a floppy disk containing the OS). However, <b>each</b> time you <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> the DSS-1 you will not have any sounds available until you load a system into memory from floppy disk. This can usually take anywhere from 20 to 40 seconds, depending on the size and number of multisamples contained in that system. The floppies that the DSS-1 understands are the older DSDD (double-sided double-density) disks that were also used on the Ensoniq Mirage and on early Macintosh computers.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{multi-core}} processors {{are widely}} used in embedded applications due to the advantages of higher performance and lower power consumption. However, the complexity of multi-core architectures makes it a considerably challenging task to extend a single-core version of a real-time operating system to support multi-core platform. This thesis documents the process of design and implementation of a multi-core version of RODOS - an embedded real-time operating system developed by German Aerospace Center and the University of Würzburg - on a dual-core platform. Two possible models are proposed: Symmetric Multiprocessing and Asymmetric Multi- processing. In order to prevent the collision of the global components initialization, a new multi-core boot loader is created to allow that <b>each</b> core <b>boots</b> <b>up</b> in a proper manner. A working version of multi-core RODOS is implemented that has an ability to run tasks on a multi-core platform. Several test cases are applied and verified that the performance on the multi-core version of RODOS achieves around 180...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the need}} arises for actual {{firefighting}} protective equipment to be worn, {{also known as}} turnouts, a firefighter must properly wear protective equipment required. Turnout trousers {{will be the first}} article of clothing that a firefighter will usually wear. Suspenders worn with the turnout trousers should be the heavy duty type in order to stand up against such heavy weights and rigorous activities they will face. Most experienced interior firefighters (firefighters that enter the structure in an emergency) will carry, in their turnout trouser pockets, various tools and equipment as well as rope they may need during an emergency. The turnout trousers, when not in use, are usually stored scrunched down around the boots for efficient and fast access when they are needed. The firefighter may then step into <b>each</b> <b>boot</b> and pull <b>up</b> the trousers and suspenders.|$|R

40|$|Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex spacecrafts in the history of mankind. Due to the nature of its complexity, a large number of flight {{software}} (FSW) requirements have been written for implementation. In practice, these requirements necessitate very complex and very precise flight software with no room for error. One of flight software's responsibilities is to be able to <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> and check the state of all devices on the spacecraft after the wake <b>up</b> process. This <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> and initialization is crucial to the mission success since any misbehavior of different devices needs to be handled through the flight software. I have created a test toolkit that allows the FSW team to exhaustively test the flight software under variety of different unexpected scenarios and validate that flight software can handle any situation after <b>booting</b> <b>up.</b> The test includes initializing different devices on spacecraft to different configurations and validate at the end of the flight software <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> that the flight software has initialized those devices to what they are suppose to be in that particular scenario...|$|R
