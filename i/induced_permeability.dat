The objectives {{of this study were}} (a) to assess the effects of indomethacin on intestinal permeability and histology; (b) to assess the effects of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet activating factor (PAF) on the same parameters; (c) to evaluate the role of these inflammation mediators on indomethacin <b>induced</b> <b>permeability</b> modifications. Intravascular administration of 1. 25 and 2. 5 mM indomethacin induced a significant increase of 51 Cr-EDTA transfer rate. Histological analysis showed only mucosal oedema. Pretreatment with 16, 16 dimethyl-prostaglandin E 2 did not reverse these changes. Intravascular administration of PAF, leukotrienes B 4 and D 4 provoked a significant rise in 51 Cr-EDTA transfer rate and intraluminal protein leakage, with an intense vascocongestion of the mucosal capillaries. These changes were completely prevented by perfusion of the respective specific antagonists (BN 52021 for PAF, LY 255, 583 for leukotriene B 4 and MK 571 for leukotriene D 4). None of these three antagonists, however, or MK 886, a selective 5 '-lipo-oxygenase inhibitor, could reverse the indomethacin <b>induced</b> <b>permeability</b> changes. Indomethacin induced increased intestinal permeability at these high concentrations {{does not seem to be}} a result of changed prostanoid or PAF metabolism.

The role of the enteric nervous system (ENS) inthese diseases is largely unknown. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigatethe effects of enteric nerves on colonic epithelial transport, motility and permeabilityunder normal and bile acid exposed condition. The studies of colonic motility, transmural potential difference (PD), net fluid transportand permeability were carried out on the isolated proximal and distal rat colon with intactblood supply and innervation, mainly in vivo. 3 H-mannitol and 14 C-urea wereadministered i. v. as clearance probes. 4 mM decoxycholic acid (DCA) was put into thelumen to induce chemical irritation of the surface epithelium. The effects of the nerveblockers atropine, hexamethonium, lidocaine (applied onto the serosal surface) and thenitric oxide inhibitor Nw-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) were studied under control conditionsand during mucosal bile acid exposure. Muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine inhibited motor activity, had no significanteffect on net fluid transport and inhibited the bile acid induced increase in small solutepermeability. Nicotinic receptor blockade with hexamethonium abolished motor activity,enhanced electrically silent absorption in proximal colon, inhibited electrogenic secretionin distal colon and inhibited the bile acid <b>induced</b> <b>permeability</b> increase. Serosal lidocaineinduced colonic contractions, dissociated the normal linkage between contractions andsecretion, and inhibited the bile acid <b>induced</b> <b>permeability</b> increase in proximal colon. NO synthesis blockade with L-NNA potentiated the bile acid induced permeabilityincrease in distal colon. The data suggest that the ENS regulates not only colonic motility and secretion but alsocolonic permeability. The neural control of the colonic mucosa seems to be differentlyorganized from that of the small intestine. Instead of activating secretomotor neurons,chemical stimulation with bile acids leads to a largely neurally mediated increase incolonic permeability, a response that is in turn inhibited by nitric oxide. These resultssuggest that enteric nerves may play a pathophysiological role in the inflamed colonicmucosa. Pharmacological intervention with the neurally mediated permeability-regulatingsystem may be a new target for treatment of colonic secretomotor disorders...|$|E
40|$|Several {{conceptual}} {{models for}} unconventional reservoirs {{have been proposed}} in recent years based on extensions of well-studied analytical/semi-analytical models for conventional reservoirs. The standard semi-analytical approaches assume uniform properties in the reservoir. In this study, we develop new models for production data analysis of hydraulically fractured wells based {{on the concept of}} nonuniform induced properties, in particular, the <b>induced</b> <b>permeability</b> field and the induced interporosity flow field. In the <b>induced</b> <b>permeability</b> field approach, we consider the case when the hydraulic fracturing operation alters the ability of the formation to conduct fluids throughout, but in varying degrees depending on the distance from the main hydraulic fracture plane. In the induced interporosity flow field, we assume that, {{as a result of the}} hydraulic fracturing treatment, the density of micro-fractures (natural and induced) is high near the hydraulic fracture face, but gradually decreases away from it. We also address common issues related to variations in the wellbore pressure, desorption effects, and non-linearity caused by gas flow, with the intent to provide a simple, yet clear understanding of their effects on the production performance. The methods used in this work include mostly semi-analytical techniques (Laplace transform and numerical inversion to the time domain). Analytical (formulae in the time domain) and numerical simulation (finite difference) techniques are also used to validate the results from the new models. The results indicate that the maximum and minimum induced permeabilities may provide the key to evaluate the overall completion efficiency in unconventional formations, where the extent and quality of the stimulated volume are equally significant. Also, the closely spaced micro-fractures have a strong impact on well performance, even when their density is diminishing toward the far parts of the stimulated reservoir. We conclude that the new models preserve the typical linear-flow signature of commonly observed well performance of unconventional shale reservoirs; however, the extrapolation of the production behavior departs from the standard models significantly. This research contributes to the understanding of the production behavior of unconventional reservoirs to characterize the quality of the stimulated reservoir and to consider often neglected factors effecting forecasts of well performance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mitochondrial}} adenine nucleotide translocators (Ant) are bi-functional {{proteins that}} transport ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane, and regulate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) which initiates apoptosis. The mouse has three Ant isoforms: Ant 1 expressed in heart, muscle, and brain; Ant 2 expressed in all tissues but muscle; and Ant 4 expressed primarily in testis. Ant 1 -deficient mice manifest muscle and heart but not brain pathology. Brain Ant 1 is induced by stress, while Ant 2 is not. Ant 1 -deficient mice {{are resistant to}} death induced by systemic exposure to the brain excitotoxin, kainic acid (KA), and their hippocampal and cortical neurons are significantly more resistant to neuronal death induced by glutamate, KA, and etoposide. The mitochondrial membrane potential of Ant 1 -deficient brain mitochondria is increased and the mtPTP is more resistance to Ca++ <b>induced</b> <b>permeability</b> transition. Hence, Ant 1 -deficiency may protect the brain from excitotoxicity by desensitizing the mtPTP and by blocking the pro-apoptotic induction of Ant 1 by stress...|$|E

After pre-loading the ANT-containing proteoliposomes with ATP, malate or AMP, a gradual {{release of the}} trapped compounds by increasing the external Ca 2 + concentrations could be demonstrated. N-Methyl-Val- 4 -cyclosporin did not inhibit the Ca 2 + dependent release of internal substances from ANT liposomes. This inhibitor {{was found to be}} specific for the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP) in intact mitochondria or reconstituted MTP-like protein complexes (e. g. hexokinase, porin, ANT complex).

In this work, we applied 1 H NOESY to study details of the interaction of polyacrylic acid (PAA) fractions of molecular weights 5 and 240 [*]kDa with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles. We showed that PAA of two different molecular masses modifies lipid bilayers increasing disorder and probability of close contact between polar and hydrophobic groups. PAA molecules adsorb near the interface of lipid bilayers but do not penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer and, thus, cannot participate in formation of transbilayer channels, proposed in earlier works. Increasing the molecular mass of PAA from 5 [*]kDa to 240 [*]kDa does not change the effect of PAA on the bilayer, although PAA 240 forms a more compact structure (either intra-molecular or inter-molecular) and interacts more strongly with interface lipid protons...|$|E

In conclusion, 1) endothelial cell barrier dysfunction occurs in cells treated with high concentrations of dextrose, 2) statin treatment of endothelial cells normalizes barrier permeability, and 3) the favorable effects of statins may be attributed to the inhibition of the dextrose-induced increase in superoxide anions, whereas inhibition of endothelin expression was observed only at supratherapeutic concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Vascular {{permeability}} factor/Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VPF/VEGF), a multifunctional cytokine, {{is a potent}} inducer of vascular permeability, an important early step in angiogenesis. It is known that the neurotransmitter dopamine can inhibit VPF/VEGF mediated angiogenesis, in particular microvascular permeability, but the effectors of this action remain unclear. Results Here, we define the signaling pathway modulated by dopamine that inhibits VPF/VEGF induced vascular permeability in endothelial cells. Signals from VPF/VEGF lead {{to changes in the}} phosphorylation of tight junction protein zonula occludens (ZO- 1) and adherens junction proteins like VE-cadherin and associated catenins, thus weakening endothelial cell-cell adhesion and increasing vascular permeability. We found VEGF receptor- 2 (VEGFR- 2) {{to be part of a}} multi-protein complex involving ZO- 1, VE-cadherin and β-catenin. VPF/VEGF induced phosphorylations of VE-cadherin, β-catenin and ZO- 1 were inhibited by dopamine treatment.

Furthermore, we identified Src as an important target for dopamine-mediated inhibition of VPF/VEGF <b>induced</b> <b>permeability.</b> Conclusion Taken together, our results provide molecular insights of dopamine function in the vascular endothelium and suggest a central role of Src in regulating key molecules that control vascular permeability. </p...|$|E

The acceleration of respiration and swelling were inhibited by the SH-reagent N-ethylmaleimide, and by the specific permeability transition inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA). In addition, these cations, like Ca 2 +, induced release of ADP entrapped in the mitochondrial matrix space, and the morphological change of mitochondria induced by these cations was essentially the same as that induced by Ca 2 +.

40|$|International audienceOxidative {{damage has}} been {{reported}} {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence suggests that the antidiabetic drug metformin prevents oxidative stress-related cellular death in non-neuronal cell lines. In this report, we point to the direct neuroprotective effect of metformin, using the etoposide-induced cell death model. The exposure of intact primary neurons to this cytotoxic insult <b>induced</b> <b>permeability</b> transition pore (PTP) opening, the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), cytochrome c release, and subsequent death. More importantly, metformin, together with the PTP classical inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA), strongly mitigated the activation of this apoptotic cascade. Furthermore, the general antioxidant N-acetyl-L: -cysteine also prevented etoposide-promoted neuronal death. In addition, metformin was shown to delay CsA-sensitive PTP opening in permeabilized neurons, as triggered by a calcium overload, probably through its mild inhibitory effect on the respiratory chain complex I. We conclude that (1) etoposide-induced neuronal death is partly attributable to PTP opening and the disruption of DeltaPsim, in association with the emergence of oxidative stress, and (2) metformin inhibits this PTP opening-driven commitment to death. We thus propose that metformin, beyond its antihyperglycemic role, can also function as a new therapeutic tool for diabetes-associated neurodegenerative disorders...|$|E

The infected erythrocyte is a multicompartmental system, and its transporters are of interest as drug targets {{in their own right}} and as potential routes for the delivery of antimalarial drugs. Choline is an important nutrient that penetrates infected erythrocyte membranes through the endogenous carrier and through parasite-induced permeability pathways, but nothing is known about its transport into the intracellular parasite. Here we present the first characterization of choline transport across the parasite membrane. Transport exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent K-m of 25. 0 +/- 3. 5 muM for choline. The carrier is inhibitor-sensitive, temperature-dependent, and Na+-independent, and it is driven by the proton-motive force. Highly active bis-amidine and bis-quaternary ammonium compounds are also known to penetrate the host erythrocyte membrane through parasite-induced permeability pathways.

In this study, we have investigated how the binding of {{a panel of}} synthetic phenylglyoxal derivatives influences the opening and closing of the PTP. Using both isolated mitochondria and mammalian cells, we demonstrate that the resulting arginine-phenylglyoxal adduct can lead to either suppression or induction of permeability transition, depending on the net charge and hydrogen bonding capacity of the adduct.

When mammalian cells were incubated with low concentrations of negatively charged phenylglyoxal derivatives, the addition of oligomycin caused a depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This depolarization was completely blocked by cyclosporin A, a PTP opening inhibitor, indicating that the depolarization was due to PTP opening. Collectively, these findings highlight that the target arginine(s) is functionally linked with the opening/ closing mechanism of the PTP and that the electric charge and hydrogen bonding of the resulting arginine adduct influences the conformation of the PTP.

Membrane potential measurements using PIPLC treated and non-treated BBMV suggest that both APN could participate as Cry 1 Ac receptor.

Despite its importance, the mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. The small protein VP 4, encoded by the genomes of most viruses of the order Picornavirales, {{has been shown to}} be involved in membrane alterations. Here we analyzed the permea-bilization activity of the natively nonmyristoylated VP 4 protein from triatoma virus (TrV), a virus belonging to theDicistroviri-dae family within the Picornavirales order. The VP 4 protein was produced as a C-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) fu-sion to achieve its successful expression. This recombinant VP 4 protein is able to produce membrane permeabilization in model membranes in a membrane composition-dependent manner. The <b>induced</b> <b>permeability</b> was also influenced by the pH, being greater at higher pH values. We demonstrate that the permeabilization activity elicited by the protein occurs through discrete pores that are inserted on the membrane. Sizing experiments using fluorescent dextrans, cryo-electronmicroscopy imaging, and other, additional techniques showed that recombinant VP 4 forms heterogeneous proteolipidic pores rather than common pro-teinaceous channels. These results suggest that the VP 4 protein may be involved in the membrane alterations required for ge-nome transfer or cell entry steps during dicistrovirus infection. IMPORTANCE During viral infection, viruses need to overcome the membrane barrier in order to enter the cell and replicate their ge...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{simulations}} of multiphase fluid and heat transport through a porous medium define combinations of rock properties and boundary conditions {{which lead to}} geyser-like periodic discharge. Within the rather narrow range of conditions that allow geyser-like behavior, eruption frequency and discharge are highly sensitive to the intrinsic permeabilities of the geyser conduit and the surrounding rock matrix, to the relative permeability functions assumed, and to pressure gradients in the matrix. In theory, heat pipes (concomitant upward flow of steam and downward flow of liquid) can exist under similar conditions, but our simulations suggest hat the periodic solution is more stable. Simulated time series of geyser discharge are chaotic, but integrated quantities such as eruption frequency and mass discharge per eruption are free of chaos. These results may explain the observed sensitivity of natural geysers to small strains such as those caused by remote earthquakes, if ground motion is sufficient o <b>induce</b> <b>permeability</b> changes. Changes in geyser behavior caused by minor preseismic deformation, periodic surface loading, and Earth tides {{are more difficult to}} explain in the context of our current model...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} we studied the molecular mechanisms of the monodesmosidic saponin digitonin on natural and artificial membranes. We measured the hemolytic activity of digitonin on red blood cells (RBCs). Also different lipid membrane models (large unilamellar vesicles, LUVs, and giant unilamellar vesicles, GUVs) in the presence and absence of cholesterol were employed. The stability and permeability of the different vesicle systems were studied by using calcein release assay, GUVs membrane permeability assay using confocal microscopy (CM) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and vesicle size measurement by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results support the essential role of cholesterol in explaining how digitonin can disintegrate biological and artificial membranes. Digitonin <b>induces</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> or causes membrane rupturing only {{in the presence of}} cholesterol in an all-or-none mechanism. This effect depends on the concentrations of both digitonin and cholesterol. At low concentrations, digitonin <b>induces</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> while keeping the membrane intact. When digitonin is combined with other drugs, a synergistic potentiation can be observed because it facilitates their uptake...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of fluids through the Earth’s crust controls the redistribution of elements to form mineral and hydrocarbon deposits, the release and sequestration of greenhouse gases, and facilitates metamorphic reactions that influence lithospheric rheology. In permeable systems with a well-connected porosity, fluid transport is largely driven by fluid pressure gradients. In less permeable rocks, deformation may <b>induce</b> <b>permeability</b> by creating interconnected heterogeneities, but without these perturbations, mass transport is limited along grain boundaries or relies on transformation processes that self-generate transient fluid pathways. The latter can facilitate large-scale fluid and mass transport in nominally impermeable rocks without large-scale fluid transport pathways. Here, {{we show that}} pervasive, fluid-driven metamorphism of crustal igneous rocks is directly coupled {{to the production of}} nanoscale porosity. Using multi-dimensional nano-imaging and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that in feldspar, the most abundant mineral family in the Earth’s crust, electrokinetic transport through reaction-induced nanopores (< 100 [*]nm) can potentially be significant. This suggests that metamorphic fluid flow and fluid-mediated mineral transformation reactions can be considerably influenced by nanofluidic transport phenomena...|$|R
