40|$|Background: Estimating the {{lifetime}} {{risk associated with}} (i. e., the <b>penetrance</b> of) <b>genetic</b> abnormalities that predispose individuals to cancer is important for <b>genetic</b> counseling. (<b>Penetrance</b> may be estimated from the degree of familial aggregation of cancer, that is, {{the extent to which}} cancers cluster in families.) Early penetrance studies of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations used high-risk families with multiple cases of breast cancer, a study design that led to very high penetrance estimates. However, such studies were subject to potential ascertainment biases. To offset such biases, recent studies have used data from family members of probands ascertained from population-based incident cases of cancer. The use of case probands is, however, also subject to bias because all risk factors are over-represented in case patients. To draw attention to this problem, literature on the pen...|$|R

5000|$|The genetic {{component}} {{appears to be}} inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with high <b>genetic</b> <b>penetrance</b> but variable expressivity in females; this means that each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the predisposing genetic variant(s) from a parent, and, if a daughter receives the variant(s), the daughter will have the disease to some extent. [...] The genetic variant(s) can be inherited from either the father or the mother, and can be passed along to both sons (who may be asymptomatic carriers or may have symptoms such as early baldness and/or excessive hair) and daughters, who will show signs of PCOS. The phenotype appears to manifest itself at least partially via heightened androgen levels secreted by ovarian follicle theca cells from women with the allele.

40|$|A {{disease is}} {{considered}} {{rare in the}} United States when it affects one individual per 1, 250 and one individual per 2, 000 in Europe.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a "rare" genetic disorder that is becoming more commonly recognised. Recent evidence indicates that it is more frequent (1 - 2 / 10, 000) than previously estimated.

40|$|Providing valid risk {{estimates}} of a <b>genetic</b> disease (<b>penetrance)</b> using family data requires an adjustment for ascertainment bias, since families are selected through affected individuals.

Another widely used method is simply to exclude the proband and to analyse {{the rest of the family}} without any correction (which we refer to as the “proband excluded likelihood ” or PEL). The choice of the method may not be straightforward when analysing data. Indeed, the prospective likelihood assumes knowledge of the probability π that an affected individual is ascertained and does not allow for specific mortality of affected individuals. On the other hand, the PEL assumes that there is only one proband per family which implies that the probability of ascertainment is low.

This study investigates whether low <b>penetrance</b> <b>genetic</b> risk factors may result in phenotype modification in LS patients. To conduct a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to assess the association between low <b>penetrance</b> <b>genetic</b> risk modifiers and CRC in LS patients. A systematic review was conducted of the PubMed and HuGENet databases. Eligibility of studies was determined by pre-defined criteria. Included studies were analysed via the per-allele model and assessed by pooled odds ratios and establishing 95 % confidence intervals. Study heterogeneity was assessed via Cochrane's Q statistic and I 2 values. Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plots. Subgroup analysis was conducted on gender. Statistical software used was the Metafor package for the R programme version 3. 1. 3. Sixty-four polymorphisms were identified and sufficient data was available for analysis of ten polymorphisms, with between 279 and 1768 CRC cases per polymorphism. None demonstrated association with CRC risk in LS patients. However in sub-group analysis the polymorphism rs 16892766 (8 q 23. 3) was significant in males (OR 1. 53, 95 % CI 1. 12 - 2. 10). The variable phenotype presentation of the disease still remains largely unexplained, and further investigation is warranted. Other factors may also be influencing the high variability of the disease, such as environmental factors, copy number variants and epigenetic alterations. Investigation into these areas is needed as well as larger and more definitive studies of the polymorphisms analysed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: The genetic {{basis of}} complex traits often {{involves}} {{the function of}} multiple genetic factors, their interactions and {{the interaction between the}} genetic and environmental factors. Gene– environment (G×E) interaction is considered pivotal in determining trait variations and susceptibility of many genetic disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases or mental disorders. Regression-based methods assuming a linear relationship between a disease response and the genetic and environmental factors as well as their interaction is the commonly used approach in detecting G×E interaction. The linearity assumption, however, could be easily violated due to non-linear <b>genetic</b> <b>penetrance</b> which induces non-linear G×E interaction.

To improve silencing by expressed antisense RNAs (asRNAs), we systematically altered several design parameters and targeted multiple reporter and essential genes in Escherichia coli.

PTasRNAs targeted against the ackA gene within the acetate kinase-phosphotransacetylase operon (ackA-pta) triggered target mRNA decay and a 78 % reduction in AckA activity with high <b>genetic</b> <b>penetrance.</b> PTasRNAs are abundant and stable and function through an RNase III independent mechanism {{that requires a}} large stoichiometric excess of asRNA. Conditional ackA silencing reduced carbon flux to acetate and increased heterologous gene expression. The PT design also improved silencing of the essential fabI gene.

40|$|The Author 2015. Background: Low <b>penetrance</b> <b>genetic</b> variants, {{primarily}} {{single nucleotide}} polymorphisms, have substantial influence on colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility. Most CRCs develop from colorectal adenomas (CRA). Here we report {{the first comprehensive}} field synopsis that catalogues all genetic association studies on CRA, with a parallel online database [[URL] Methods: We performed a systematic review, reviewing 9750 titles, and then extracted data from 130 publications reporting on 181 polymorphisms in 74 genes. We conducted meta-analyses to derive summary effect estimates for 37 polymorphisms in 26 genes. We applied the Venice criteria and Bayesian False Discovery Probability (BFDP) to assess the levels of the credibility of associations. Results: We considered the association with the rs 6983267 variant at 8 q 24 as 'highly credible', reaching genome-wide statistical significance {{in at least one}} meta-analysis model. We identified 'less credible' associations (higher heterogeneity, lower statistical power, BFDP > 0. 02) with a further four variants of four independent genes: MTHFR c. 677 C > T p. A 222 V (rs 1801133), TP 53 c. 215 C > G p. R 72 P (rs 1042522), NQO 1 c. 559 C > T p. P 187 S (rs 1800566), and NAT 1 alleles imputed as fast acetylator genotypes. For the remaining 32 variants of 22 genes for which positive associations with CRA risk have been previously reported, the meta-analyses revealed no credible evidence to support these as true associations. Conclusions: The limited number of credible associations between low <b>penetrance</b> <b>genetic</b> variants and CRA reflects the lower volume of evidence and associated lack of statistical power to detect associations of the magnitude typically observed for genetic variants and chronic diseases. The CRA gene database provides context for CRA genetic association data and will help inform future research directions...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the HFE gene, it became apparent that C 282 Y homozygous HFE hemochromatosis is the most common autosomal recessive genetic disorder in populations of northern European descent, where it attains a maximum prevalence of approximately 1 in 200. Cross-sectional studies have revealed that the clinical penetrance of symptoms of iron-loading disease is relatively low and highly variable. Although there is no standard definition of clinical penetrance, large studies of newly diagnosed C 282 Y homozygotes that have specifically assessed liver disease have obtained data showing that penetrance occurs in between 24 and 43 % of males and 1 and 14 % of females.

40|$|Allelic {{variation}} in the genome leads to {{variation in}} individuals' production of proteins. This, in turn, leads to variation in traits and development, and, in some cases, to diseases. Understanding the genetic basis for disease can aid {{in the search for}} therapies and in guiding genetic counseling. Thus, it is of interest to discover the genes with mutations responsible for diseases and to understand the impact of allelic variation at those genes. A subject's genetic composition is commonly referred to as the subject's genotype. Subjects who carry the gene mutation of interests are referred to as carriers. Subjects who are afflicted with a disease under study (that is, subjects who exhibit the phenotype) are termed affected carriers. The age-specific probability that a given subject will exhibit a phenotype of interest, given mutation status at a gene is known as penetrance. Understanding penetrance is an important facet of <b>genetic</b> epidemiology. <b>Penetrance</b> estimates are typically calculated via maximum likelihood from family data. However, penetrance estimates can be biased if the nature of the sampling strategy is not correctly reflected in the likelihood. Unfortunately, sampling of family data may be conducted in a haphazard fashion or, even if conducted systematically, might be reported in an incomplete fashion. Bias is possible in applying likelihood methods to reported data if (as is commonly the case) some unaffected family members are not represented in the reports. The purpose here is to present an approach to find efficient and unbiased penetrance estimates in cases where there is incomplete knowledge of the sampling strategy and incomplete information on the full pedigree structure of families included in the data. The method may be applied with different conjectural assumptions about the ascertainment strategy to balance the possibly biasing effects of wishful assumptions about the sampling strategy with the efficiency gains that could be obtained through valid assumptions...|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} {{regulation of}} gonadotropin secretion {{is integral to}} a properly functioning reproductive system. Transcriptional regulation and secretion of the two gonadotropins diverge during late proestrus and early estrus when LH levels decline with the termination of the preovulatory gonadotropin surge, while FSH remains elevated. Gonadal steroid hormone feedback is a crucial component of the control of gonadotropin synthesis in the pituitary gonadotrope, and progestins may be of particular importance for the secondary FSH surge. In the current study, we have focused on delineating the mechanisms of progestin regulation of the gonadotropin Beta-subunits. Within the murine FSHBeta promoter, our studies demonstrated that a FOXL 2 element at - 350 and a nearby Smad half-site are necessary for both progestin responsiveness and synergy between activin and progestin. In {{the context of the}} - 300 rat LHBeta promoter, we found that the - 200 /- 150 bp region contributes to basal gene expression, most likely by binding transcriptional activators. Additionally, we contributed to finer mapping of progesterone suppression of basal and GnRH-induced LHBeta gene expression by identifying a critical segment at the - 300 /- 280 bp region of the promoter. Finally, to study the feedback regulation of progesterone in gonadotrope cells in vivo, we created a gonadotrope- specific PRKO: the PRKOLacZ/Flox/LHBeta-Cre mouse line. Though, our studies did not show any significant impairment of fertility, possibly due to <b>genetic</b> <b>penetrance</b> or mosaicism issues, they serve as preliminary data indicating trends towards lower reproductive function, such as lower number of litters and pups, as well as lower levels of circulating hormones...|$|E
40|$|While up to 25 % {{of ovarian}} cancer (OVCA) cases {{are thought to be}} due to {{inherited}} factors, the majority of genetic risk remains unexplained. To address this gap, we sought to identify previously undescribed OVCA risk variants through the whole exome sequencing (WES) and candidate gene analysis of 48 women with ovarian cancer and selected for high risk of genetic inheritance, yet negative for any known pathogenic variants in either BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In silico SNP analysis was employed to identify suspect variants followed by validation using Sanger DNA sequencing. We identified five pathogenic variants in our sample, four of which are in two genes featured on current multi-gene panels; (RAD 51 D, ATM). In addition, we found a pathogenic FANCM variant (R 1931 *) which has been recently implicated in familial breast cancer risk. Numerous rare and predicted to be damaging variants of unknown significance were detected in genes on current commercial testing panels, most prominently in ATM (n = 6) and PALB 2 (n = 5). The BRCA 2 variant p. K 3326 *, resulting in a 93 amino acid truncation, was overrepresented in our sample (odds ratio = 4. 95, p = 0. 01) and coexisted in the germline of these women with other deleterious variants, suggesting a possible role as a modifier of <b>genetic</b> <b>penetrance.</b> Furthermore, we detected loss of function variants in non-panel genes involved in OVCA relevant pathways; DNA repair and cell cycle control, including CHEK 1, TP 53 I 3, REC 8, HMMR, RAD 52, RAD 1, POLK, POLQ, and MCM 4. In summary, our study implicates novel risk loci as well as highlights the clinical utility for retesting BRCA 1 / 2 negative OVCA patients by genomic sequencing and analysis of genes in relevant pathways...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{diagnosis}} of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) {{can be challenging}} because the clinical presentation is highly variable and <b>genetic</b> <b>penetrance</b> is often low. METHODS: To determine whether {{a change in the}} distribution of desmosomal proteins {{can be used as a}} sensitive and specific diagnostic test for ARVC, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of human myocardial samples. RESULTS: We first tested myocardium from 11 subjects with ARVC; of these samples, 8 had desmosomal gene mutations. We also tested myocardium obtained at autopsy from 10 subjects with no clinical or pathological evidence of heart disease as control samples. All ARVC samples but no control samples showed a marked reduction in immunoreactive signal levels for plakoglobin (also known as gamma-catenin), a protein that links adhesion molecules at the intercalated disk to the cytoskeleton. Other desmosomal proteins showed variable changes, but signal levels for the nondesmosomal adhesion molecule N-cadherin were normal in all subjects with ARVC. To determine whether a diminished plakoglobin signal level was specific for ARVC, we analyzed myocardium from 15 subjects with hypertrophic, dilated, or ischemic cardiomyopathies. In every sample, levels of N-cadherin and plakoglobin signals at junctions were indistinguishable from those in control samples. Finally, we performed blinded immunohistochemical analysis of heart-biopsy samples from the Johns Hopkins ARVC registry. We made the correct diagnosis in 10 of 11 subjects with definite ARVC on the basis of clinical criteria and correctly ruled out ARVC in 10 of 11 subjects without ARVC, for a sensitivity of 91 %, a specificity of 82 %, a positive predictive value of 83 %, and a negative predictive value of 90 %. The plakoglobin signal level was reduced diffusely in ARVC samples, including those obtained in the left ventricle and the interventricular septum. CONCLUSIONS: Routine immunohistochemical analysis of a conventional endomyocardial-biopsy sample appears to be a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic test for ARVC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The phenome is the {{complete}} set of phenotypes resulting from genetic variation in populations of an organism. Saturation of a phenome implies the identification and phenotypic description of mutations in all genes in an organism, potentially constrained to those encoding proteins. The human genome is believed to contain 20 - 25, 000 protein coding genes, but {{only a small fraction}} of these have documented mutant phenotypes, thus the human phenome is far from complete. In model organisms, genetic saturation entails the identification of multiple mutant alleles of a gene or locus, allowing a consistent description of mutational phenotypes for that gene. Saturation of several model organisms has been attempted, usually by targeting annotated coding genes with insertional transposons (Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus) or by sequence directed deletion (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or using libraries of antisense oligonucleotide probes injected directly into animals (Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio). This paper reviews the general state of the human phenome, and discusses theoretical and practical considerations toward a saturation analysis in humans. Throughout, emphasis is placed on high <b>penetrance</b> <b>genetic</b> variation, of the kind typically asociated with monogenic versus complex traits...|$|R

In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the recently identified haplotype encompassing genes of DNA repair and apoptosis, is associated with increased risk of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. Methods: We used a case-control study design (156 carcinomas, 981 adenomas and 399 controls) to test the association between polymorphisms in the chromosomal region 19 q 13. 2 - 3, encompassing the genes ERCC 1, ASE- 1 and RAI, and risk of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas in a Norwegian cohort. Odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were estimated by binary logistic regression model adjusting for age and gender. Results: The ASE- 1 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of adenomas, OR of 1. 39 (95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 81), which upon stratification was apparent among women only, OR of 1. 66 (95 % CI 1. 15 – 2. 39). The RAI polymorphism showed a trend towards risk reduction for both adenoma...|$|R
40|$|The largest part of {{this thesis}} is devoted to newly {{developed}} statistical methods for age at onset linkage analysis. We used frailty models in which random effects were introduced to model the dependence between outcomes of relatives due to sharing of marker alleles Identical By Descent. From the retrospective likelihood of the marker data conditional on the phenotypes, we derived score tests for genetic linkage analysis. The score statistics appear to be classical Non-Parametric Linkage statistics weighted by functions of the age at onset (or age at censoring) of the family members. These tests are based on allele-sharing, they {{can be applied to}} families ascertained through their phenotypes, and they do not require specification of <b>genetic</b> models or <b>penetrance</b> functions. Further, they can incorporate both affected and unaffected family members. In fact, the age at disease onset of the affecteds and the age at censoring of the unaffecteds are considered by this approach. Finally, with respect to the likelihood-ratio tests proposed in the literature the derived score tests are computationally faster, locally most powerful, and robust. For all these reasons, the proposed weighted NPL statistics provide a practical solution for mapping genes for complex diseases with variable age at onset. Promotores: H. C. van Houwelingen, J. J.
