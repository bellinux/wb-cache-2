Another dramatic effect of relativity is that the radiation pattern is distorted from the isotropic dipole pattern expected from non-relativistic theory into an extremely forward-pointing cone of radiation. This makes synchrotron radiation sources the most brilliant known sources of X-rays. The planar acceleration geometry makes the radiation linearly polarized when observed in the orbital plane, and circularly polarized when observed at a small angle to that plane.|$|E

The plasma wakefield accelerator is one concept (1 – 3) being developed for this purpose. In plasma wakefield acceleration, a charge-density wake with high accelerating fields {{is driven by the}} passage of an ultra-relativistic bunch of charged particles (the drive bunch) through a plasma (4 – 6). If a second bunch of relativistic electrons (the trailing bunch) with sufficient charge follows {{in the wake of the}} drive bunch at an appropriate distance, it can be efficiently accelerated to high energy. Previous experiments using just a single 42 -gigaelectronvolt drive bunch have accelerated electrons with a continuous energy spectrum and a maximum energy of up to 85 <b>gigaelectronvolts</b> from the tail of the same bunch in less than a metre of plasma (7). However, the total charge of these accelerated electrons was insufficient to extract a substantial amount of energy from the wake. Here we report high-efficiency {{acceleration of}} a discrete trailing bunch of electrons that contains sufficient charge to extract a substantial amount of energy from the high-gradient, non-linear plasma wakefield accelerator. Specifically, we show the acceleration of about 74 picocoulombs of charge contained in the core of the trailing bunch in an accelerating gradient of about 4. 4 gigavolts per metre.

Here, we demonstrate attosecond control of collective electron motion in plasmas driven by extreme intensity (≈ 1018 W/cm 2) light fields. Controlled few-cycle near-infrared light waves are tightly focused at the interface between vac-uum and a solid-density plasma, where they launch and guide subcycle motion of electrons from the plasma with characteristic energies in the multi-kiloelectronvolt range- two orders of magni-tude more than what has been achieved so far in atoms and molecules. Basic spectroscopy of the coherent extreme ultraviolet radiation emerging from the light-plasma interaction allows us to probe this collective motion of charge with sub- 100 -attosecond resolution. This is an important step towards attosecond control of charge dynamics in laser-driven plasma experiments. Two major trends can nowadays be identified in the interaction of ultrashort laser pulses with matter.

The inference that the greater than 1 <b>GigaelectronVolt</b> gamma-rays from synchrotron emission in the flare were produced by electrons of energy up to approx. 5. 1 PetaelectronVolt indicates the nonoccurrence of vacuum Cerenkov radiation by these electrons. This implies a new, strong constraint on superluminal electron velocities delta(sub e) less than or equal to approximately 5 x 10 (exp - 21). It immediately follows that one then obtains an upper limit on the superluminal neutrino velocity alone of delta(sub v) less than or equal to approximately 5. 6 x 10 (exp - 19), many orders of magnitude better than the time-of-flight constraint from the SN 1987 A neutrino burst. However, if the electrons are subluminal the constraint on the absolute value of delta(sub e) less than or equal to approximately 8 x 10 (exp - 17), obtained from the Crab Nebula gamma-ray spectrum, places a weaker constraint on superluminal neutrino velocity of delta(sub v) less than or equal to approximately 8 x 10 (exp - 17) ...|$|E
