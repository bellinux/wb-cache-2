40|$|Recently, {{experimental}} {{series of}} co-current gas-liquid upward bubbly flows in a 6 m-height and 54. 8 mm i. <b>d.</b> <b>vertical</b> titanium <b>pipe</b> had been {{conducted at the}} TOPFLOW thermal hydraulic test facility, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Germany. The experiments were initially performed to develop a high quality database of two-phase flows {{as well as to}} validate new CFD models. An ultrafast dual-layer electron beam X-ray tomography, named ROFEX, was used as measurement system with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The gathered cross sectional grey value image results from the tomography scanning were reconstructed, segmented and evaluated to acquire gas bubble parameters for instance bubble position, size and holdup. To assign the correct paired bubbles from both measurement layers, a bubble pair algorithm was implemented {{on the basis of the}} highest probability values of bubbles in position, volume and velocity. Hereinafter, the individual characteristics of bubbles were calculated include instantaneous three dimensional bubble velocities, Sauter mean diameters and the movement angle in polar-azimuthal directions. The instantaneous three dimensional bubble velocities are discussed through the distribution results of the axial, horizontal, radial and azimuthal velocities in statistical parameters.

40|$|AbstractThe {{pressure}} drop of gas-solid flow for absorber sphere pneumatic conveying {{is important for}} the design and operation of the gas circulator. The simplified one-dimension model is introduced to predict the {{pressure drop}} of gas- solid flow for absorber sphere pneumatic conveying. The pressure drop of gas-solid flow in the <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe</b> is the main component part of the total gas-solid flow for absorber sphere conveying. The pressure drop of gas-solid flow for absorber sphere conveying in the <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe</b> with the inside diameter 47 mm and conveying height 23 m is predicted by the simplified model. The superficial gas velocity considered is in the range of 1. 5 to 3. 0 times of the terminal velocity of a single particle. The solid mass flow rate considered is in the range of 0. 2 to 1. 2 kg/s. Particle velocity, solid friction factor and solid mass flow rate are important parameters to predict pressure drop of <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe.</b> The typical empirical correlations of particle velocity and solid friction factor reported in the literature are adopted to predict the pressure drop of <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe.</b> The superficial gas velocity for absorber sphere conveying is suggested to be two times of the terminal velocity of a single particle. For the suggested superficial gas velocity, the predicted pressure drop of <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe</b> by using empirical correlations is in the range of 15 to 20 kPa and 31 to 50 kPa for solid mass flow rate at 0. 2 kg/s and 1. 2 kg/s, respectively.

Therefore, the flow of petroleum or gas through a <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe</b> from oil reservoir to platform/subsea system is significant to cater the enhancement of oil recovery. This research are based on this principle, and is more focused on the study for multiphase-flow pattern of petroleum production plus the turbulent coefficient effect on the bubbly flow in <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe</b> using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. Multiphase-flow is chosen rather than the two-phase flow because the multiphase-flow are considered to be more realistic to give more accurate result thus easily implemented to a real situation. In studying the flow pattern of the multiphase-flow, the result obtains are manipulated with varying the velocity profile of each phase and observing which phase velocity gives a better flow of oil through the <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe.</b> While for the study of the turbulent coefficient effect on the bubbly flow in <b>vertical</b> <b>pipe,</b> firstly the simulation was run on the constant of bubbly flow to obtain the flow model.
