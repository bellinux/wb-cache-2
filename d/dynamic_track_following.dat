50|$|Unlike {{preceding}} systems, 8mm {{did not use}} {{a control}} track on the tape to facilitate the head following the diagonal tracks. Instead 8mm recorded a sequence of four sine waves on each video track such that adjacent tracks would produce one of two heterodyne frequencies if the head mistracked. The system automatically adjusted the tracking such that the two frequencies produced were of equal magnitude. This system {{was derived from the}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>track</b> <b>following</b> (DTF) used by the Philips Video 2000 system. Sony rechristened the system as automatic track following (ATF) as the 8mm system lacked the ability of the heads to physically move within the head drum.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>Track</b> <b>Following</b> (DTF) {{eliminated}} {{the need for}} a separate control track, and enabled the video heads to accurately follow the recorded tracks on the tape during playback. Therefore, by design V2000 machines does not require a video tracking control (however, Grundig's model 1600 lacked DTF). During record, a sequence of four pilot frequencies is recorded with the video signal. During playback, if a video head reads an adjacent track, a voltage of up to ± 150 volts is applied to the piezo-electric material on which the video heads are mounted. The flexible head mount enables the head to accurately read every track (ie, no noisebars), at up to seven times normal speed forwards, and fives times in reverse. VHS developers JVC later introduced a so-called [...] "Dynamic Drum" [...] in a few top-of-the-range devices.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{continental}} Europe {{there were}} three choices by 1980, {{with the arrival of}} the Video 2000 format from Philips and Grundig, which replaced Philips' outdated [...] "VCR" [...] format. Although it featured many capabilities formerly only available on expensive broadcast video recorders, V2000 had too long a development cycle and arrived late to the market. Apart from this, to keep costs down many of its unique features, such as <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Track</b> <b>Following,</b> were only implemented on the most expensive models, meaning mainstream models suffered from indifferent video quality. Also, many features that came standard on VHS and Betamax machines (such as direct AV in and out connectors), were only available as expensive [...] "optional extras" [...] on V2000. The machines were also found to be less reliable than their VHS and Beta counterparts and for all these reasons the format never gained substantial market share. V2000 was cancelled in 1985, the first casualty of the format war.|$|E

With the {{large-scale}} speed-up of the railway, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>track</b> stabilizer will {{play an important}} role on the track overhauling and railroading of new line in our country. Bogie {{is one of the major}} critical components of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>track</b> stabilizer; its vibrating characteristic will affect the vibrating characteristic of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>track</b> stabilizer directly. The method of numerical simulate was used, based on ADAMS simulation, the horizontal exciting forces of the vibration exciter under working conditions were gained. Then the exciting forces were loaded on the bogie, and the dynamic characteristics of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>track</b> stabilizer bogie under the working conditions were obtained on the bases of the ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The analysis results show that the lateral and nod vibrating characteristics of the bogie under working conditions were strong. The analysis results of this paper will provide foundation for the research on the dynamic characteristics and working security of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>track</b> stabilizer...|$|R

The prediction model consists of a three-degrees-of-freedom <b>dynamic</b> <b>track</b> model and modified track properties.

40|$|Motion detection/estimation plays {{a crucial}} role in <b>dynamic</b> visual <b>tracking.</b> Whether a <b>dynamic</b> visual <b>tracking</b> system can {{successfully}} track a moving target closely depends on the quality of motion detection/estimation results. In <b>dynamic</b> visual <b>tracking,</b> the camera used to capture images is not stationary, so any slight vibration of the camera motion or the target motion can lead to a blurry image causing the visual tracking performance to be deteriorated. To cope with this difficulty, a motion detection/estimation approach consisting of a region-based spatial distribution of Gaussians (SDG) -like matching algorithm, a template-update-with-memory algorithm, and a template mask is developed in this study. Moreover, linear interpolation on vision commands is performed to improve the <b>tracking</b> performance. A <b>dynamic</b> visual <b>tracking</b> system designed for locking the target’s image {{in the center of the}} image plane is used as the test platform. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

40|$|In recent years, indoor {{localisation}} {{and movement}} tracking {{of people and}} objects has generated interest {{for a variety of}} applications ranging from transport to health care. We present a localisation network designed to track people in an indoor environment. The localisation network consists of static nodes placed at predetermined locations in a building. Users carry a mobile node to track their current position. The mobile node has onboard motion sensors to detect a person’s heading direction and motion state. A <b>dynamic</b> <b>tracking</b> mode was used to determine a person’s position. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>tracking</b> model was implemented using a Multi-Hypothesis Estimation algorithm. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>tracking</b> model determines the mobile node’s position by using the mobile node’s proximity to static nodes, mobile node’s motion sensor information and the building’s floor-plan. We found that by using a multi-hypothesis estimation algorithm, robust localisation accuracy, could be achieved in real-time. The position resolution of the localisation network was found to have a maximum error between 1 m and 3. 5 m. Further work involves extensive testing the localisation network with multiple mobile nodes and over a larger test region. Other areas involve investigating how multiple mobile nodes placed on a user can be used to improve the estimate of the user’s position...|$|R
