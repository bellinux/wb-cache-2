25|$|Until 2002, the UDF spanned a {{somewhat}} wide ideological spectrum on the centre-right. A tongue-in-cheek characterisation of UDF's membership {{is that it}} was the union of <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right that was neither far-right nor a Chirac supporter. However, the UDF suffered for its lack of cohesion, in contrast to the RPR. The economic policies proposed by UDF's leaders ranged from left-leaning, in favor of social justice, to strongly laissez-faire economics. Such divergences led the laissez-faire advocates of Liberal Democracy, such as Alain Madelin, to split out of UDF on 16 May 1998. This departure followed the elections of UDF politicians for the presidents of 4 regional councils with the votes of FN elects. Indeed, the Liberals refused to condemn these alliances.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the final}} episode of the season to be filmed, though not the last to air. According to Jenna Fischer, <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set was excited {{in a manner that}} she likened to {{students}} {{on the last day of}} school. The giddiness particularly shows in Fischer's performance: Pam skips after Jim into the break room, she bounces on her toes at the end of the [...] "fake crying" [...] talking head, and she taps the soda can three times to get Jim to release the jinx.|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. <b>Everybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E

500|$|Three more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene {{were then}} called by Nosanchuk. George Darby {{told the court}} that in his conversations with Lamb the {{defendant}} had changed his story three times. He considered Lamb to be anti-social, aggressive and psychopathic—unable to appreciate the incident's consequences with any depth of feeling. Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him {{in an interview that}} he treated all people [...] "like bugs" [...] except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than swatting a fly. Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: [...] "I hate <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street. I probably will kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug." [...] Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few defence mechanisms, she said, and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences.|$|E
500|$|A promotional teaser was {{released}} before the full {{release of the}} video; it saw Roberts walking on the New York City pavements, {{with a pair of}} backing dancers gaining looks from men. It also showed a neon-style aspect of the video, where Roberts wore Nike Air Max trainers, with neon moving sperm-shaped graffiti moving to the beat of the track. OK! magazine responded well whilst noting her unusually short dress in the video, they said [...] "we can't help but feel upbeat and summery when watching the star bounce about for single Lucky Day." [...] Aaron Spencer-Charles of Metro gave a mixed review, whilst describing the video, he ended with [...] "and that's it really. Nicola strolls along with a few colourful effects to keep things interesting. Maybe adding a male model would have made things a bit livelier." [...] Popjustice commented on Nicola's seemingly lack of confidence in the video, stating Nicola, you light up our world like nobody else. But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell, you don't know you're beautiful. Her short-dress in the video sparked criticism from some critics, to which Roberts responded saying [...] "I'm not safe with fashion, and I haven't been for a long time. I liked it, and <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team liked it on the day. It was 120 degrees, so anything longer, I'd have died." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sports Polls that Make Fun of Crappy Sports Polls - The show is {{generally}} irritated by absolute reverence given to sports and one method of rebellion against this is putting up [...] "sports polls" [...] {{that have nothing}} to do with sports. [...] Usually the Sports Poll that Makes Fun of Crappy Sports Polls involves a question brought up during conversation and sometimes involves a question the show's personalities are arguing about. [...] The Audience Vote will serve as the decision as to who wins the argument. [...] Dan often grades the show based on the randomness of the poll questions, the more random and non-sports related the poll questions are, the better Dan considers the show to be. [...] The audience vote, to date, has never come back 50/50, and <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show is anxiously anticipating this statistical anomaly.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{spent most}} of his early career at Universal Studios until The Thing, after which he left for Lucasfilm to work on Return of the Jedi at the {{invitation}} of Howard Kazanjian. From that point on, Brown's career has taken on a freelance aspect that has allowed him to work on an eclectic list of films and with some of the top actors in the business including Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Samuel L. Jackson, and Kevin Bacon. During the filming of a scene with Barbra Streisand on All Night Long in which Streisand was playing a character who could not sing, Brown remembered, [...] "...when we started to film that scene, she opened her mouth and this incredible voice came out. And <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set just stood there with their mouths open listening to this. Then she stopped because {{she was supposed to be}} singing badly....It was astounding being in the room with her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure <b>everybody</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2012, Barton {{discussed}} {{her recent}} {{preference for the}} horror genre, following roles in Homecoming, Apartment 1303 and Sibling [...] "I literally became obsessed with that genre. I can't tell you. Because I never watched it when I was younger; {{it used to be}} way too terrifying for me." [...] However Barton added that, [...] "I think I've gone through my little phase, for the moment." [...] In June, Barton appeared in the new music video of Noel Gallagher's <b>Everybody's</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Run.|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't care if there'd be madams allays. They're {{the best}} as is going for trade anyhow," [...] said the ostler. What the ostler said was true.

Hugh Stanbury could not understand why he was charged a shilling a mile, instead of ninepence, for the gig to Nuncombe Putney. He got no satisfactory answer, and had to pay the shilling. The truth was, that gigs to Nuncombe Putney had gone up, since a lady, separated from her husband, with a colonel running after her, had been taken in at the Clock House.|$|E
