40|$|The human {{microbiota}} is {{a complex}} ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms harboured by the human body. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, in particular targeted amplicon sequencing of the 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S-seq), are enabling the identification and quantification of human-resident microorganisms at unprecedented resolution, providing novel insights {{into the role of}} the microbiota in health and disease. Once microbial abundances are quantified through NGS data analysis, diversity indices provide valuable mathematical tools to describe the ecological complexity of a single sample or to detect species differences between samples. However, diversity is not a determined physical quantity for which a consensus <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>unit</b> of measure have been established, and several diversity indices are currently available. Furthermore, they were originally developed for macroecology and their robustness to the possible bias introduced by sequencing has not been characterized so far. To assist the reader with the selection and interpretation of diversity measures, we review a panel of broadly used indices, describing their mathematical formulations, purposes and properties, and characterize their behaviour and criticalities in dependence of the data features using simulated data as ground truth. In addition, we make available an R package, DiversitySeq, which implements in a unified framework the full panel of diversity indices and a simulator of 16 S-seq data, and thus represents a valuable resource for the analysis of diversity from NGS count data and for the benchmarking of computational methods for 16 S-seq...|$|E
40|$|The {{service sector}} is not {{traditionally}} {{seen as an}} emission intensive sector with a great environmental impact. The service sector is, however, economically a large and fast-growing sector and consequently the absolute emissions will grow. Even though a shift to a more service-oriented economy decreases the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity per unit GDP it does not in itself imply that the GHG emissions would decrease in absolute terms. To improve the environmental performance of service oriented companies, the negative environmental impacts must be identified and measured. A framework mentioned in several guidelines for studying the environmental impact, is the life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. Based on the LCA framework, a methodology called carbon footprinting has been developed to assess the environmental impact. The carbon footprint methodology is broadly used by companies and organisations to examine and understand the GHG emissions occurring from products, services and processes. The overall objective {{of the study is}} to get an overview of the environmental impact of service oriented companies, focusing on climate change. The aim is to find the relevant components for calculating the carbon footprint of a service oriented company and determine which activities and variables that stand for most of the emissions. The methodology used in this study is the life cycle assessment (LCA). Two applications of the methodology; input-output LCA (IO-LCA) and hybrid LCA, have been applied. The assessment follows the GHG protocol for boundary definition and guidelines. A case study was performed on one digital service creation company located in Helsinki, Finland. The included environmental impacts are limited to climate change and CO 2 equivalents, which is the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>unit</b> of carbon footprint in this study. The study compares three different LCA models and analyses the difference between national and international models. Additionally, the relationship between costs and emissions are analysed. Previous research suggests that the service sector should focus on office premises and business travel as these in general are perceived to cause most of the emissions. This study, however, shows that such generalisation cannot be made for service oriented companies as they represent a large variety of businesses. The three different models gave surprisingly similar results, mostly due to modest sized office premises and lack of detailed process information for the hybrid LCA. In the case study company business travel stands for most of the emissions (29 %). Commuting does not cause significant emissions and the remaining categories have similar magnitudes of emissions. The total emissions are approximately 1 400 tCO 2 eq. Compared to previous studies the studied company’s emissions are lower than average. No direct correlation between costs and emissions was found...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{longitudinal}} {{space charge}} effects have become of increased importance {{in a variety}} of dynamical situations. The CEBAF FEL injector beam dynamics shows large space-charge effects, even at 10 MeV ({gamma} {approx} 20). Space-charge dominated longitudinal motion has also been studied in the IUCF ion storage ring. Previously a longitudinal envelope equation with a self-consistent phase-space distribution has been developed, and has been of considerable use in analyzing the motion of these cases. Longitudinal motion in detailed agreement with this envelope equation has been observed at the U. of Maryland Laboratory for Plasma Research, and at the GSI electron cooling storage ring ESR, {{as well as at the}} IUCF. However, the initial presentation in ref. 4 used non-relativistic linear- accelerator bunching motion as a simplifying approximation in order to avoid inadvertent errors and minimize misprints, and must be adapted to include relativistic and/or synchrotron effects. In the present note we extend the envelope equation formulae to include relativistic, synchrotron, and acceleration effects, and define the various factors in the equations in explicit detail. The object is to obtain a set of debugged formulae for these extended cases, with all of the various factors defined explicitly, so that the formulae can be used as a reference without repetitive rederivations. The usual ambiguities over emittance <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>units</b> <b>and</b> {beta}, {gamma}, g factors should be resolved. The reader (or readers) is invited to discover any remaining errors, ambiguities or misprints for removal in the next edition. 12 refs...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A set of core {{diabetes}} indicators {{were identified}} in a clinical review of current evidence for the EUBIROD project. In order to allow accurate comparisons of diabetes indicators, a standardised currency for data storage and aggregation was required. We aimed to define a robust European data dictionary with appropriate clinical definitions {{that can be used}} to analyse diabetes outcomes and provide the foundation for data collection from existing electronic health records for diabetes. METHODS: Existing clinical datasets used by 15 partner institutions across Europe were collated and common data items analysed for consistency in terms of recording, data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>units</b> of measurement. Where necessary, data mappings and algorithms were specified in order to allow partners to meet the standard definitions. A series of descriptive elements were created to document metadata for each data item, including recording, consistency, completeness and quality. RESULTS: While datasets varied in terms of consistency, it was possible to create a common standard that could be used by all. The minimum dataset defined 53 data items that were classified according to their feasibility and validity. Mappings <b>and</b> standardised <b>definitions</b> were used to create an electronic directory for diabetes care, providing the foundation for the EUBIROD data analysis repository, also used to implement the diabetes registry and model of care for Cyprus. CONCLUSIONS: The development of data dictionaries and standards can be used to improve the quality and comparability of health information.

40|$|The Dutch {{government}} refers in its {{coalition agreement}} to the biobased economy (BBE) {{as one of}} the pillars of ‘sustainable growth and development’, where a choice is made for a realistic and ambitious renewable growth strategy. The EU also has ambitious objectives for the BBE. The use of biomass, renewable raw materials and the reutilisation of scarce materials correspond to the objectives for the circular economy. Incentive policy measures are implemented in various ways, such as the blending obligation or certification and the SDE: Renewable Energy Production Incentive Scheme (Stimulering Duurzame Energieproductie, Netherlands Enterprise Agency). The use of biomass is thus on the rise for heat and energy generation and for production of biofuels. Comparable incentive measures still lack for other sectors in the BBE, such as the chemical industry. The transition from an economy based on fossil raw materials, to the biobased economy (BBE) and circular economy, requires a structural approach to innovation and consistent policy aimed at the efficient use of biomass and residual streams. To determine the effects of government policy in this field and in order to direct policy, it is necessary to be able to track the development of the BBE {{and to be able to}} compare this to international trends. This requires a proper and unequivocal method of data collection <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of terms. From this perspective, a monitor is needed with which the use of renewable biobased raw materials in the Dutch economy can be observed. It is important, for reliable monitoring of the BBE, that unequivocal <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>units</b> are used <b>and</b> that the system boundaries are established unequivocally in a protocol. Transparent information on available and usable sources is important in order to obtain a clear picture of the BBE over time.

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of the task assigned to the media towards the fulfillment of the rights of the child; specifically as contained in article 17 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child and as required by the Oslo Challenge of 1999, this study examined the coverage given to child rights by the Nigerian and Ghanaian newspapers. Using content analysis research design, both government-owned and privately-owned national newspapers from the two countries were used. The study examined the extent of coverage given to child rights, the specific child rights issues reported, prominence given to the reports, journalistic genres adopted and the performance of government-owned papers in comparison to privately-owned newspapers, among others. A total of 1200 newspaper issues were randomly drawn from the four newspapers over five-year period, from 1999 - 2003. The study recorded high inter-coder reliability ranging between almost perfect and substantial agreement, thus establishing the appropriateness of coding instructions, category <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>unit</b> of analysis. The quantitative analysis used percentages and chi-square goodness fit. The qualitative analysis focused on textual abuse of structures that may constitute abuse of children. The results showed that while child rights issues were generally underreported by the four newspapers, Ghanaian newspapers gave greater coverage to child issues with 56. 9 % than Nigerian newspapers with 43. 1 % and the difference was very significant. The findings also showed that government-owned newspapers with 60 % did better than privately-owned newspapers (40 %) in reporting child rights. Furthermore, {{there was a lack of}} balance in the genres adopted in reporting child rights and poor public engagement on the issue. Moreover, the dominant voices behind child rights were those of advocates and NGOs, while children voices were hardly heard. The findings also revealed weak newsworthiness of child issues and lack of enough evidence to establish textual abuse of children in all the newspaper issues examined. It was therefore recommended that the newspapers should improve on the coverage given to child rights in all aspects to further stimulate public and policymakers response to the issue. There is also the need to have a policy guide that would ensure greater commitment on the part of the press to child rights. And finally, there is need for continuous existence of government-owned newspapers, in the interest of public service, as they are in a better position to report development issues like child rights, than privately-owned newspapers...|$|R
