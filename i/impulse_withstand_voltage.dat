40|$|The vacuum {{switching}} technology is preferred {{used in the}} medium voltage level due to its high reliability, {{the high number of}} switching operations, its free-maintenance as well as its long term durability. Contrary to gas-insulated switches, the contact surface of a vacuum circuit breaker has a substantial influence on the withstand voltage. Charge carriers, escaped from the contacts due to an electrical field stress, will be accelerated in the contact gap, whereas the absorbed energy could not be reduced significantly, because of the marginal number of collisions. Caused by the impact on the contact surface, additional charge carriers may be generated with a subsequent breakdown. The required withstand voltage of a vacuum circuit breaker is reached by a conditioning of the metallic surfaces inside the vacuum circuit breaker. A mechanical handling alone is not sufficient. All established procedures for conditioning vacuum circuit breakers to reach a required withstand voltage use current limited breakdowns to remove emission centers which are the origin of a breakdown. In this work, a conditioning process for industrial type vacuum circuit breakers is investigated, using high-frequency currents in the kHz-range. Due to high current rises before and high voltage rises after a current interruption during a current zero crossing, a reignition of a vacuum insulation can be enforced. On the one hand the high-frequency conditioning process has been evaluated if the required lightning <b>impulse</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> can be reached reliably, on the other hand it has been investigated, how far the lightning <b>impulse</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> can be increased beyond it. It is investigated, to what extend the voltage and current distribution, measured during a high frequency conditioning process, can be used to specify the reached lightning <b>impulse</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage.</b> The conditioning process is successful only, if every critical emission centre is removed. Therefore the spatial distribution of the arcs is an important information for the evaluation of the conditioning process. Here, a circuit breaker model is used for optical investigations of the conditioning arcs. The surfaces of the contacts are investigated using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy...|$|E

When evaluating the compatibility of ester oils with existing transformer insulation designs, {{it is essential to}} not only compare the mean breakdown voltages of the oils, but also to consider the role of dispersion and thus the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> levels (with the acceptable breakdown likelihood). Insulation designers sometimes estimate the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> of mineral oil from the dispersion of the data, assuming that the breakdown voltages of the oil follow a parametric distribution. However, {{there is a lack of}} discussion as to whether this method would be suitable for estimating the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltages</b> of ester oils. This paper uses samples of breakdown voltages of a synthetic ester, a natural ester and a mineral oil to analyze their distributions, and discusses the applicability of using Weibull and Gaussian distributions to estimate the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltages</b> of the esters.

40|$|Today's {{design and}} {{manufacturing}} of high voltage equipment focuses increasingly on a {{shift away from}} SF 6 as a quenching and isolation medium. SF 6 is has a detrimental effect on the atmosphere's greenhouse potential. Bans or regulations regarding SF 6 may well be imposed on the industry in the future. In order to replace SF 6 with air as insulation, {{more research is needed}} to achieve compact and efficient designs. The goal of this master thesis has been to investigate the effect of barriers on the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> in rod-plane gaps, with atmospheric air, subjected to positive high voltage impulses. The high voltage electrode was a rod with a spherical tip and a diameter of 7 mm. The barriers used as insulation were made out of Lexan polycarbonate plates and measured 1 mm times 600 mm times 600 mm. The 50 %breakdown voltage, the standard deviation and the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> have been determined using the up- and down-method. The barriers were tested in several configurations, changing both the horizontal and vertical placement of the barrier in the rod-plane gap. In addition to physical experiments, these configurations have been investigated in terms of electric background eld calculations in COMSOL,as well as streamer inception voltage calculations in MATLAB. The results show an increase in the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> of up to 28 % for the configuration with the largest barrier protrusion. The optimal barrier position has been found to be close to the high voltage rod. However, a relative decrease in the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> is observed when the rod is touching the barrier. This can be explained by a strong tangential eld allowing the streamer to propagate along the surface of the barrier. For a small barrier, protruding 0 mm from the tip of the rod, the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> is lower than that of a barrier-less rod plane gap when the barrier touches the rod. A sharp increase of above 10 % in the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> is shown in a barrier with a 0 mm overlap, by simply moving the barrier 10 mm closer to the high voltage rod. This can to some degree be explained by applying electric potential to the barriers in the background eld distributions. It has been shown that the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> can be predicted to some extent with a very simple formula for the congurations with the largest barrier protrusions. A method of predicting <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> based on streamer inception calculation in several steps, with electric eld distribution calculations has been suggested...|$|R

40|$|During {{switching}} of disconnectors (DS) in GIS a varying {{number of}} pre-strikes and re-strikes occur. Due {{to the very}} short duration of the voltage collapse, traveling surges are generated in the busbar duct. These very fast transient overvoltages (VFTO) can become the limiting dielectric stress which defines the dimensions at UHV voltage levels. The decision shall {{be based on the}} maximum VFTO peak value that occurs with reference to the rated lightning <b>impulse</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> (LIWV) of the equipment. If the maximum VFTO is higher than the LIWV, it is necessary to consider the VFTO level as dimensioning criteria or to suppress VFTO by suitable measures. The main challenges are the reduction in VFTO amplitudes and finally the reduction of the effects of VFTO on the equipment. For the different sources of VFTO and for the different equipment different mitigation methods are known. The damping of VFTO by integration of a damping resistor is a well proven technology. The way to overcome the drawback of such unwieldy designs is to use other internal damping measures. Several methods have been proposed and examined in the past, such as ferrite material or high frequency (RF) resonators. The VFTO damping solution utilizing ferrite rings has been analysed and tested and will be described here. The measurements show that a damping effect can be achieved, but with an important drawback: the magnetic material goes easily into saturation, which complicates the design and reduces its general applicability and robustness. A new approach for damping is to implement compact electromagnetic high-frequency resonators with low quality factor specially designed to cover a wider frequency range. The novelty of this idea is not only to design the resonators but also to dissipate the VFTO energy. The VFTO damping effect of the developed RF resonator tuned to the dominant harmonic component was confirmed by experiments. Rings of a nanocrystalline alloy placed around the GIS conductor were also investigated. Depending on number, material and size of the rings a good mitigation could be achieved...|$|E

The advantageous thermal and molecular properties make it suitable as an insulating gas, however, it is a strong green house gas. With the present climate challenges, one of the measures of reducing emission of climate gases is to phase out the use of SF$_ 6 $-insulated medium voltage switchgears. An environmentally friendly alternative is air, which has a lower <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> than SF$_ 6 $. For backwards compatibility, the primary manufacturers in this development is optimization (to compensate for lower withstand) of current designs without increasing the dimensions.
