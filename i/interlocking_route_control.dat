40|$|Abstract — Multihoming {{is used by}} stub {{networks}} to improve the reliability of their Internet connectivity. In recent years, commercial “intelligent <b>route</b> <b>control</b> ” devices are used by multihomed stub {{networks to}} optimize the routing of their Internet traffic. In this work, we first conduct measurement of qualities of alternate paths through multihoming. In the remaining part, we study the <b>route</b> <b>control</b> of traffic {{among a group of}} multihomed stub networks which may belong to an organization and exchange data regularly. This type of <b>route</b> <b>control</b> is special because the access links of such networks may not be over-provisioned and are shared by traffic <b>controlled</b> by multiple <b>route</b> <b>control</b> devices. Such shared bottlenecks may affect the effectiveness of uncoordinated “intelligent route control”. We propose a global optimization based approach to coordinate the <b>route</b> <b>control</b> among such a group of networks. Our approach can avoid oscillations which may be caused by uncoordinated <b>route</b> <b>control.</b> Simulation results show that our approach has advantages over equal-splitting based static load-balancing...|$|R

40|$|Today’s Internet {{users and}} {{applications}} are placing increased demands on Internet service providers (ISPs) to deliver fine-grained, flexible <b>route</b> <b>control.</b> To assist network operators in addressing this challenge, we present the Intelligent <b>Route</b> Service <b>Control</b> Point (IRSCP), a <b>route</b> <b>control</b> architecture {{that allows a}} network operator to flexibly control routing between the traffic ingresses and egresses within an ISP’s network, without modifying the ISP’s existing routers. In essence, IRSCP subsumes the control plane of an ISP’s network by replacing the distributed BGP decision process of each router in the network with a more flexible, logically centralized, application-controlled route computation. IRSCP supplements the traditional BGP decision process with an explicitly ranked decision process that allows <b>route</b> <b>control</b> applications to provide a per-destination, per-router explicit ranking of traffic egresses. We describe our implementation of IRSCP {{as well as a}} straightforward set of correctness requirements that prevents routing anomalies. To illustrate the potential of application-controlled route selection, we use our IRSCP prototype to implement a simple form of dynamic customer-traffic load balancing, and demonstrate through emulation that our implementation is scalable. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multihoming is {{increasingly}} being employed by large enterprises and data centers to extract good performance and reliability from their ISP connections. Multihomed end networks today can employ {{a variety of}} <b>route</b> <b>control</b> products to optimize their Internet access performance and reliability. However, {{little is known about}} the tangible benefits that such products can offer, the mechanisms they employ and their trade-offs. This paper makes two important contributions. First, we present a study of the potential improvements in Internet round-trip times (RTTs) and transfer speeds from employing multihoming <b>route</b> <b>control.</b> Our analysis shows that multihoming to 3 or more ISPs and cleverly scheduling traffic across the ISPs can improve Internet RTTs and throughputs by up to 25 % and 20 %, respectively. However, a careful selection of ISPs is important to realize the performance improvements. Second, focusing on large enterprises, we propose and evaluate a widerange of <b>route</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms and evaluate their design trade-offs. We implement the proposed schemes on a Linuxbased Web proxy and perform a trace-based evaluation of their performance. We show that both passive and active measurementbased techniques are equally effective and could improve the Web response times of enterprise networks by up to 25 % on average, compared to using a single ISP. We also outline several “best common practices ” for the design of <b>route</b> <b>control</b> products. Index Terms—Multihoming, performance, reliability...|$|R

Means of mechanization and automation are being built to achieve as efficient forming of freight trains as possible. Modern, fully automatic systems based on extensive utilization of computers are being implemented.

One part of these systems is responsible for automatic routing of coupled or isolated cars through the ladder.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the main {{limitations of the}} existing Intelligent <b>Route</b> <b>Control</b> (IRC) model at the AS-level. Among such limitations we found that all solutions avail-able at present are standalone. As a side-effect, they can only provide one-way <b>route</b> <b>control,</b> i. e., they can intelligently control how traffic flows from an AS but not how it flows into the AS. Furthermore, all available solutions behave in a fully selfish way, that is, they operate without considering the effects of their decisions {{in the performance of}} the network. Based on these limitations, we propose to extend the existing IRC model from standalone and selfish to a collective and friendlier IRC model. Our evaluations confirm that when several route controllers compete for the same network resources, the standalone and selfish ones are outperformed by those using a collective and friendlier approach, and this becomes especially noticeable as the network utilization increases. A key advantage is that our extensions can be installed and used today, by simply perform-ing software upgrades to any of the existing IRC solutions.
