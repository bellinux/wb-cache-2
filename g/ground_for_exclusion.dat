40|$|Severe asthma in {{the elderly}} places a high burden on {{affected}} individuals and society. Emerging therapies target specific phenotypes of the asthma disease spectrum, and can be beneficial for older asthmatics, albeit their response might be altered due to age-related characteristics. Paradoxically, these characteristics are often <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> from clinical trials. The question thus arises how the senior asthmatic population can successfully enter the era of targeted therapy. Therefore, we highlight characteristics of this population relevant to effective treatment, and review the evidence for targeted therapy in elderly patients. For targeted therapy {{it is important to}} account for aging, as this affects the distribution of phenotypes (e. g. late-onset asthma, non-eosinophilic asthma) and may alter biomarkers and drug metabolism. Elderly asthmatics suffer from age-related comorbidities and subsequent polypharmacy. A systematic search into targeted asthma therapy yielded no randomized clinical trials dedicated to older asthmatics. Post hoc analyses of the anti-immunoglobulin E agent omalizumab indicate similar efficacy in both younger and older adults. Conference abstracts on anti-interleukin- 5 and anti-interleukin- 13 therapy suggest even more pronounced effects of targeted treatments in late-onset disease and in asthmatic patients 65 years or older, but full reports are lacking. For non-eosinophilic asthma {{in the elderly}}, there is not yet high-level evidence for targeted therapy, but macrolides may offer a viable option. In conclusion, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the effect of older age on the safety and efficacy of targeted asthma therapy. Further investigations in the elderly are needed, with special emphasis on both late-onset asthma and therapeutics for non-eosinophilic asthma...|$|E
40|$|Under European {{trade mark}} law, ‘functional’ signs, i. e. signs {{exclusively}} consisting of shapes which {{result from the}} nature of the product, are necessary to achieve a technical result, or give substantial value to the goods, are barred from trade mark protection with absolute and permanent effect, without the possibility to establish acquired distinctiveness. While the rule may appear sound as such, its application in practice is problematic, in particular as regards the third <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion,</b> which {{is often referred to as}} ‘aesthetic functionality’: the dangerous implications of that rule for particularly attractive design have become obvious in the recent decision by the General Court, T- 508 / 08 – Bang & Olufsen. The article traces the origins of that rule in US case law and screens its application in Europe. It is argued that the original aim of the functionality doctrine in its various forms, namely to foster and maintain efficient competition, has been lost out of sight. Instead of embarking on an analysis of competitive concerns, courts tend to focus their attention on elements of largely accidental character, like the attractiveness of shapes in the early stage of marketing. Against that, the position is endorsed that it should not be precluded forever that a shape, initially attracting customers by its pleasant appearance, will become a valid sign at a later stage. Instead of focusing on how the public, at a given point in time, perceives and evaluates a certain shape, the crucial test should consist of an analysis of the competitive potential of the shape at stake, considering to what extent its assignment to one particular right holder would be liable to impede, or even exclude, efficient and meaningful competition...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: People are {{influenced}} by the neighborhood in which they live. The neighborhood may be particularly important for children’s wellbeing because of the constraints it imposes on their patterns of daily activities. Furthermore, the neighborhood is a central context for social development, being a place where children form networks and learn social skills and values. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe how social capital in the neighborhood is perceived by children living in rural areas, and to reveal what this adds to their sense of wellbeing. Methods: The study had a descriptive research design with a qualitative approach. Seven single-sex focus group interviews were conducted with children the in 6 th grade (aged  11 – 12  years). Data were analyzed using deductive content analysis. Results: The children perceived a lack of social capital due to environmental and social constraints in their everyday lives. However, their wellbeing was enhanced by strong cohesion in the neighborhood. In addition, settings such as the school, the natural environment, and sporting associations were highly valued and emerged as crucial factors for enhancing the children’s wellbeing. The spatial isolation that characterizes rural areas created a special context of social network structures, cohesion and trust, but was also a breeding <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> and social control. The stories revealed paradoxical feelings of living in a good and safe area that simultaneously felt isolated and restricted. Conclusions: From a rural perspective, this study reveals the complexity of the children’s perceptions of their social environment, and the ways in which these perceptions have both positive and negative effects on wellbeing. The results highlight how important it is for health professionals in rural areas to consider the complex influence of bonding social capital on children’s wellbeing, and to be aware that it can promote exclusion as well as cohesion...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The {{conventional}} wisdom is that {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001, prompted a substantive change in U. S. immigration policy on visa issuances and the grounds for excluding foreign nationals from the United States. A series of laws enacted in the 1990 s, however, may have done as much or more to set current U. S. visa policy and the legal grounds for exclusion. This report’s review of the legislative developments in visa policy over the past 20 years and analysis of the statistical trends in visa issuances and denials provide a nuanced study of U. S. visa policy and the grounds for exclusion. Foreign nationals not already legally residing in the United States who wish to come to the United States generally must obtain a visa to be admitted. Those admitted on a permanent basis are known as immigrants or legal permanent residents (LPRs), while those admitted on a temporary basis are known as nonimmigrants (such as tourists, foreign students, diplomats, temporary agricultural workers, and exchange visitors). They must first meet a set of criteria specified in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that determine whether they are eligible for admission. The burden of proof is on the foreign national to establish eligibility for a visa. Conversely, foreign nationals also must not be deemed inadmissible according to other specified grounds in § 212 (a) of the INA. These § 212 (a) inadmissibility criteria are health-related grounds; criminal history; security and terrorist concerns; public charge (e. g., indigence); seeking to work without proper labor certification; illegal entrants and immigration law violations; ineligible for citizenship; and aliens illegally present or previously removed. The number of aliens excluded on the basis of § 212 (a) of the INA has fluctuated over the years. In FY 2008, § 212 (a) exclusions of prospective nonimmigrants hit 35, 403 and surpassed the prior high point of 34, 750 in FY 1998. For prospective LPRs, § 212 (a) exclusions peaked in FY 1998 and FY 1999, reaching over 89, 000 in both years. The § 212 (a) exclusions of prospective LPRs fell from FY 2000 through FY 2003, then began climbing to reach 77, 080 in FY 2008. Most LPR petitioners who were excluded on § 212 (a) grounds from FY 1994 through FY 2004 were rejected because the Department of State (DOS) determined that the aliens were inadmissible as likely public charges. By FY 2004, the proportion of public charge exclusions had fallen but remained the top basis for denial. The lack of proper labor certification was another leading <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> from FY 1994 through FY 2004. By FY 2008, however, illegal presence and previous orders of removal from the United States was the leading ground. Exclusions of nonimmigrant petitions have a somewhat different pattern than that of immigrant petitions. Violations of immigration law were the leading category from FY 1994 through FY 2006, but fell to the second ranking by FY 2008. Illegal presence and prior removal became the leading ground in FY 2008. Over time, criminal activity has become a more common ground for refusal, and has represented a larger portion of exclusions among nonimmigrant petitioners than it was for immigrant petitioners. Legislation aimed at comprehensive immigration reform may take a fresh look at the grounds for excluding foreign nationals enacted over the past two decades. Expanding the grounds for inadmissibility, conversely, might be part of the legislative agenda among those who support more restrictive immigration reform policies. More specifically, the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who allegedly attempted to ignite an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, has heightened scrutiny of the visa process and grounds for exclusion. This report will be updated as warranted...|$|E

40|$|Studies of Mexican American {{integration}} {{have come}} to a methodological and theoretical impasse. Conventional investigations have provided limited insight as they are outsider-based perspectives examining native-born minorities {{within the context of the}} immigrant experience and race-cycle paradigms. Grounded in cultural ideologies and nationalist narratives, dominant descriptions of minorities have created a conceptual straight that circumscribes the discourse to assimilationists? models of integration. Moreover, studies of marginal groups produce negative consequences by highlighting cultural differences that tautologically reinforce the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusions.</b> Little <b>grounded</b> work has been conducted specifically looking at racialized native-born minorities and the dynamics of their generational process of integration. Through embedded ethnography and the narratives of subject participants, this research provides direct insight into processes of contemporary integration and the social structural accommodation of native-born Mexican Americans. As a means of sidestepping conceptual barriers, this discussion theoretically frames the integration of Mexican American professionals within the context of modernity and liberal human development. By responding to the above critiques, this paper presents an alternative approach to the analysis and explanation of the roots of race-cycle paradigms in the first section. The second section establishes the context for the research and explains the basis for the papers structure and conceptual arguments. As a means of moving the discourse away from established models, the third section provides a critical overview of the classical and contemporary literature on minority integration through a process of textual deconstruction. In addition, the section also constructs a theoretical dynamic between structural determinations and individual adaptations to modernity that promotes integration.
