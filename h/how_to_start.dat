25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that fathers generally tend to avoid sexual conversations with their children. Many fathers have uncertainties on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> to the conversation. Other times they simply put the initiative on their daughters to come to them with questions or issues. Even when the conversation is launched fathers tend to be judgmental or only talk about abstinence. Fathers {{are more likely to}} forbid daughters from having sex when they are talking. Wilson et al. (2010) found that some fathers felt that talking about the potential consequences of sex was easier than talking about sex itself. Fathers overall tend to apply more orders when talking to their daughters than giving them unbiased information or simply listening and trying to give them their best advice.|$|E

He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, ‘I don’t know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [...] One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [...] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album.

Brown described Kubrick as a [...] "well-meaning...sweet guy", and noted that his wife had a [...] "visceral response" [...] to the character's death when later viewing the episode. Matthew Humphreys portrayed the vampire Dixon, and considers him a [...] "deeply misunderstood" [...] character.

A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda {{was unhappy with}} his pay and threatened to leave Square {{if he could not}} compose music. Final Fantasy developer Hironobu Sakaguchi, one of the three designers for the upcoming Chrono Trigger, suggested he score the game, remarking, [...] "maybe your salary will go up." [...] Mitsuda reflected, [...] "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing." [...] Mitsuda has said that he was unsure of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>start,</b> saying that he [...] "must've tried to start writing the music 4 times" [...] and that it took [...] "a month and a half" [...] before he knew how to compose the music for Chrono Trigger.|$|E

Andy (Ed Helms), still upset from his recent broken engagement with Angela (Angela Kinsey), suggests that Kevin should be mean to Lynne, providing only backhanded compliments and ignoring her calls. Jim (John Krasinski) suggests he ask her out, but not immediately and take things slow. Pam (Jenna Fischer), on the other hand, suggests he ask her out immediately and not be afraid to express himself to her. When Lynne visits the office, Kevin said he has decided to simply tell her what exactly he is thinking. He tells her {{that she has a}} nice smile and he would like to take her out to dinner and a movie, which she accepts. Kevin then accidentally says [...] "Nice...boobs", but Lynne seems flattered by the statement.|$|E

500|$|Sanath Jayasuriya is a Sri Lankan cricketer {{and former}} {{captain of the}} Sri Lanka {{national}} cricket team. He is an all-rounder and opening batsman, and {{is known for his}} aggressive batting style that has earned him the name [...] "Master Blaster". His batting style introduced a new strategy to the game during the 1996 World Cup, where he and fellow opener Romesh Kaluwitharana batted highly aggressively in the early overs using fielding restrictions to their advantage. This later became a standard opening batting strategy, and according to Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath, Jayasuriya [...] "changed everyone's thinking about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> innings". As a result of his performances, Jayasuriya was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1997, despite not having played in the previous English cricketing season. He has scored a number of centuries in both Test and One Day International (ODI) games, but {{has not been able to}} score a century in a Twenty20 International match, where his highest score is 88.|$|E

500|$|Etan Cohen {{created the}} role of Kirk Lazarus {{as a way of}} lampooning the great lengths that some method actors go to depict a role. Downey was {{approached}} by Stiller about the part while on vacation in Hawaii. Downey said on CBS' The Early Show that his first reaction was, [...] "This is the stupidest idea I've ever heard!" [...] and that Stiller responded, [...] "Yeah, I know— isn't it great?" [...] In another interview, Downey said that he accepted the part but, having no idea where or even <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> building the character of Lazarus, eventually settled on a jive-esque speech pattern and a ragged bass voice; he then auditioned Lazarus' voice over the phone to Stiller, who approved the characterization immediately. Downey revealed that he modeled the character on actors Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, and Daniel Day-Lewis. The initial script was written for Downey's character to be Irish, but was altered after Downey stated he could improvise better as an Australian (he had previously played a similar outlandish Australian character in the film Natural Born Killers). Downey's practice of remaining in character between takes and even off the film set was also written into the script for his character to perform. Downey required between one and a half to twohours of make-up application. According to Downey, [...] "One makeup artist would start on one side of my face and a second makeup artist would start on the other side, and then they'd meet in the middle." ...|$|E
