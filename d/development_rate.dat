25|$|Studies of fungal {{infection}} consistently reveal that plants with endophytes {{are less likely}} to suffer substantial damage, and herbivores feeding on infected plants are less productive. There are multiple modes through which endophytic fungi reduce insect herbivore damage, including avoidance (deterrence), reduced feeding, reduced <b>development</b> <b>rate,</b> reduced growth and/or population growth, reduced survival and reduced oviposition. Vertebrate herbivores such as birds, rabbits and deer show the same patterns of avoidance and reduced performance. Even below-ground herbivores such as nematodes and root-feeding insects are reduced by endophyte infection. The strongest evidence for anti-herbivore benefits of fungal endophytes come from studies of herbivore populations being extirpated when allowed to feed only on infected plants. Examples of local extinction have been documented in crickets, larval armyworms and flour beetles.|$|E

40|$|Experimentally derived temperature-dependent <b>development</b> <b>rates</b> for planktonic {{fish eggs}} are {{required}} for developing Individual Based Models (IBMs) of early life history stages and for estimating daily egg production in ichthyoplankton surveys. <b>Development</b> <b>rates</b> of Irish Sea plaice eggs were experimentally determined for temperatures between 4. 5 and 12 C. Differences in <b>development</b> <b>rates</b> were apparent when these results were compared with literature data for eggs from North Sea parents. On average, plaice eggs from the Irish Sea developed more rapidly and hatched up to 2 days earlier compared with North Sea eggs incubated at the same temperature. In terms of parental effects, larger females tended to produce larger eggs but egg size decreased over successive batches from the same female within a year. Temperature-dependent egg <b>development</b> <b>rates</b> were influenced by egg size in a non-linear manner for eggs incubated at 6 C, but egg size had no effect at higher temperatures. Since most plaice eggs sampled from the Irish Sea during ichthyoplankton surveys in 1995 and 2000 were found in waters cooler than 8 C, such effects may modify egg <b>development</b> <b>rates</b> in the wild...|$|R
40|$|Environmental factors, such as {{temperature}} and photoperiod can play {{important roles in}} insect development. Numerous studies have researched insects and their responses to photoperiod, {{but there has been}} little research to show if the duration of light alters <b>development</b> <b>rates</b> in blow flies. A review of previous literature revealed differences in the light regime (L:D) reported for the study. This study examined the effects of photoperiod on <b>development</b> <b>rates</b> of Phormia regina Meigen, Cochliomyia macellaria F., and Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy using four light regimes of 0, 12, 16, and 24 h of light measured at both 20 C and 26 C. Environmental growth chambers were used to conduct the experiments with larvae reared on ground beef or beef liver inside 3. 55 -liter rearing containers. Using an analysis of variance, the results showed significant differences in <b>development</b> <b>rates,</b> from egg to adult emergence (d) among several treatments for each species at each temperature. There was a temperature by light interaction, and the data showed that the effects of light are magnified at lower temperatures. <b>Development</b> <b>rates</b> of all three species in the larval stage (egg to pupa) were the fastest when reared under cyclic light. Therefore, <b>development</b> <b>rates</b> determined from studies of forensically important species that used full light 24 : 0 (L:D) h may be too slow, i. e., the post mortem interval is inaccurate. The significance of this research will allow more accurate post mortem interval determinations in medico-legal criminal investigations by pinpointing the photoperiod where <b>development</b> <b>rates</b> occur the fastest...|$|R
25|$|Through {{the study}} of Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis larvae, {{barbiturates}} were found to increase {{the length of the}} larval stage of the fly, which will ultimately cause an increase {{in the time it takes}} to reach the stage of pupation. Morphine and heroin were both believed to slow down the rate of fly development. However, closer examination of the effects of heroin on fly development has shown that it actually speeds up larval growth and then decreases the <b>development</b> <b>rate</b> of the pupal stage. This actually increases the overall timing of development from egg to adult. Research of Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae), reared on various concentrations of morphine injected meat, found higher concentrations of morphine in shed pupal casings than in adults. Cocaine and methamphetamine also accelerate the rate of fly development.|$|E
25|$|Golden mice {{reproduce}} {{all year}} long. However, the reproductive season varies geographically. The majority of O. nuttalli reproduce from September to spring in Texas but from March to October in Kentucky and Tennessee. The breeding period in Missouri also lasts from spring {{to fall and}} extends from April until October. Golden mice in captivity tend to reproduce most frequently during the early spring and late summer. Because the gestation period is only about 25–30 days, females can produce many litters in one year. Litters tend to be larger in the fall than the spring. Captive mothers {{have been known to}} produce up to seventeen litters in an eighteen-month period. A litter of golden mice typically consists of two or three young, but ranges from one to four. Aside from the mother, all other adults leave the nest when the litter is born. Newborn golden mice have a rapid growth and <b>development</b> <b>rate</b> and are able to achieve independence by three weeks of age with sexual maturity following within a few weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Sphingid {{caterpillars}} are {{medium to}} large in size, with stout bodies. They have five pairs of prolegs. Usually, their bodies lack any hairs or tubercules, but most species have a [...] "horn" [...] at the posterior end, {{which may be}} reduced to a button, or absent, in the final instar. [...] Many are cryptic greens and browns, and have countershading patterns to conceal them. Others are more conspicuously coloured, typically with white spots on a black or yellow background {{along the length of the}} body. [...] A pattern of diagonal slashes along the side is a common feature. When resting, the larva usually holds its legs off the surface and tucks its head underneath (praying position), which, resembling the Egyptian Sphinx, gives rise to the name 'sphinx moth'. Some tropical larvae are thought to mimic snakes. [...] Larvae are quick to regurgitate their sticky, often toxic, foregut contents on attackers such as ants and parasitoids.
