5|$|The {{damage from}} Rosita made a large {{impact on the}} tourist industry. The time of impact {{happened}} just before the Easter and ANZAC Day Holiday period.

Many visitors delayed or cancelled their trips, and some cut short their holiday. Car hire companies that had been booked out <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> period had people returning vehicles early.|$|E

They anticipated finishing the album {{by the end of the}} summer, in order for it to be released <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> season. Aly & AJ thought it ironic that they were prepping a Christmas album during the hottest days of the year. Alyson Michalka told the Saginaw News that producers Armato and James filled the studio with Christmas decorations, Christmas cookies, and a tree with gifts to open after they were done, in order for them to get in the Christmas spirit.|$|E

5|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} go on holiday {{together}} and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David.

Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog faced a {{difficult}} production cycle. Development began in 2004 following {{the completion of}} Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003). The game was designed to relaunch the franchise for the seventh generation of video game consoles, and the team was initially led by Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka, but Naka resigned to form his own company, Prope. The team then split {{to work on the}} Wii game Sonic and the Secret Rings (2007). The game was rushed to market in time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> season; versions for the Wii and Microsoft Windows were cancelled. The game is often referred to with colloquial terms that reference its year of release, such as Sonic '06.|$|E

5|$|By 2000, the city's Christmas decorations also {{included}} lighted snowflakes on the utility poles of Easton streets surrounding the Peace Candle. The 32 six-foot snowflake decorations cost just over $10,800, which were funded {{in part by}} a $6,000 Community Development Block Grant secured by the city. The Easton Holiday Committee said it was becoming increasing difficult to raise sufficient funds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiday</b> display and sought $10,000 from the city council, but they were rejected. In response, six of the eleven Easton Holiday Committee members resigned in March 2001, prompting fear that the Peace Candle would not be erected during its 50th anniversary that following holiday season. However, the committee was filled with new volunteers who revamped efforts to raise funds through the sale of wax candles and greeting cards. The Peace Candle was lit during a ceremony on November 23, 2001, in dedication to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as rescue workers from New York City, The Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania who responded the day of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Lewis attends court, {{where he}} is found guilty and sentenced to perform forty hours {{community}} service. While dining at The Bistro, Lewis charms a food critic and Nick Tilsley offers him a two-week trial as head waiter. Gail disapproves but Audrey defends Lewis and he later buys Audrey a bracelet as a gift of thanks. When Nick finds some money missing from the till, he and Gail believe Lewis took it. Audrey also doubts Lewis but when she learns that Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) took the money, she tries unsuccessfully to stop Lewis from leaving. Lewis returns for his wages and tells Nick that his community service has finished and he is leaving for good. Audrey arrives to see Lewis, asks him to stay and professes her love for him. They spend the night together at Audrey's house and agree to keep their relationship secret. Once David and Gail find out about their relationship, Audrey and Lewis make it public. Lewis suggests they go on holiday together to the Mediterranean and Audrey agrees. She asks David to sign her salon back to her so she can help pay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>holiday,</b> but he refuses.|$|E
