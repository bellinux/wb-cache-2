5|$|The {{importance}} of high-contrast patterns for successful disruption was predicted {{in general terms}} by the artist Abbott Thayer in 1909 and explicitly by the zoologist Hugh Cott in 1940. Later <b>experimental</b> <b>research</b> has started to confirm these predictions. Disruptive patterns work best when all their components match the background.|$|E
5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, <b>experimental</b> <b>research</b> would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Purdue, Armstrong {{decided to become}} an <b>experimental</b> <b>research</b> test pilot. He applied at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base, which was later redesignated as the ‘‘NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center’’ in 2014. Although the committee had no open positions, it forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, where Armstrong began working in March 1955. Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted a couple of months, and by July 1955 he had returned to Edwards AFB for a new job.|$|E

5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. <b>Experimental</b> <b>research</b> with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} in gene frequencies between the original population and colony may also trigger {{the two groups}} to diverge significantly {{over the course of}} many generations. As the difference, or genetic distance, increases, the two separated populations may become distinct, both genetically and phenetically, although not only genetic drift but also natural selection, gene flow, and mutation contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony's gene frequency led most scientists to consider the founder effect (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant driving force in the evolution of new species. Sewall Wright was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his shifting balance theory of speciation. Following after Wright, Ernst Mayr created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size following the founder effect were critically important for new species to develop. However, there is much less support for this view today since the hypothesis has been tested repeatedly through <b>experimental</b> <b>research</b> and the results have been equivocal at best.|$|E
