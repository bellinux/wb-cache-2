50|$|The {{transition}} can {{be readily}} understood {{by the use of}} the Holstein-Primakoff transformation applied to a two-level atom. As a result of this transformation, the atoms become Lorentz harmonic oscillators with frequencies equal to the difference between the energy levels. The whole system then simplifies to a system of interacting harmonic oscillators of atoms, and the field known as Hopfield dielectric which further predicts in the normal state polarons for photons or polaritons.If the interaction with the field is so strong that the system collapses in the harmonic approximation and complex polariton frequencies (soft modes) appear, then the physical system with nonlinear terms of the higher orderbecomes the system with the Mexican hat-like potential, and will undergo ferroelectric-like phase transition.In this model, the system is mathematically equivalent for one mode of excitation to the Trojan wave packet, when the circularly polarized field intensity corresponds to the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> constant.

This results in the formation of a special superconducting phase in low magnetic fields dubbed [...] "Semi-Meissner" [...] state. The vortices, whose density is controlled by applied magnetic flux density, do not form a regular structure. Instead, they should have a tendency to form vortex [...] "droplets" [...] because of the long-range attractive interaction caused by condensate density suppression in the area around the vortex. Such vortex clusters should coexist with the areas of vortex-less two-component Meissner domains. Inside such vortex cluster the component with larger coherence length is suppressed: so that component has appreciable current only at the boundary of the cluster.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{actually}} two engagement times {{to consider in}} an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coupling.</b> The first one is {{the time it takes}} for a coil to develop a magnetic field, strong enough to pull in an armature. Within this, there are two factors to consider. The first one is the amount of ampere turns in a coil, which will determine the strength of a magnetic field. The second one is air gap, which is the space between the armature and the coil shell or rotor. Magnetic lines of flux diminish quickly in the air. The further away the attractive piece is from the coil, the longer it will take for that piece to actually develop enough magnetic force to be attracted and pull in to overcome the air gap. For very high cycle applications, floating armatures can be used that rest lightly against the coil shell or rotor. In this case, the air gap is zero; but, more importantly the response time is very consistent since there is no air gap to overcome. Air gap is an important consideration especially with a fixed armature design because as the unit wears over many cycles of engagement the armature and the rotor will create a larger air gap which will change the engagement time of the clutch. In high cycle applications, where registration is important, even the difference of 10-15 milliseconds can make a difference, in registration of a machine. Even in a normal cycle application, this is important because a new machine that has accurate timing can eventually see a [...] "drift" [...] in its accuracy as the machine gets older.|$|E
