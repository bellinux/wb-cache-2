500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E

What followed was described by journalist Robert Matthews as [...] "an immediate explosion." [...] Supporters of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin started riots that were so severe that French soldiers were called in to quell them. Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin agreed to split the contested 18 seats in a southwest constituency among themselves {{as a result of}} a mediation performed by Félix Houphouët-Boigny. However, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin made it clear that he would not allow Apithy to remain the Prime Minister of Dahomey, but Apithy was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> his demands.

Recording work for Fallen started at Ocean Studios in Burbank, California, where most of [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] was {{recorded}}, prior to full album production.

During an interview, Lee recalled that during the recording process of the song it was said {{to her that the}} song must feature male vocals: [...] "It was presented to me as, 'You're a girl singing in a rock band, there's nothing else like that out there, nobody's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> you.

[...] He had ignored German economic naysayers, and told Hermann Göring [...] "that everyone on all sides was always raising economic misgivings against a threatening war with Russia. From now onwards he wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> any more of that kind of talk and from now on he was going to stop up his ears in order to get his peace of mind." [...] This was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had been preparing reports on the negative economic consequences of a Soviet invasion—that it would be a net economic drain unless it was captured intact. Given Hitler's latest demands regarding negative advice, Thomas revised his report. [...] Reich Finance Minister Schwerin-Krosigk also opposed an invasion, arguing that Germany would lose grain because of Soviet scorched-earth policies, lack of effective Soviet transport and the loss of production labor with a German attack in the East. [...] Schnurre agreed with the economic loss assessment.|$|E
