25|$|The third process, nasal substitution, also {{presents}} two varieties. Both varieties of nasal substitution affect adjacent consonants {{of the same}} type: alveolar (coronal), bilabial, or velar. The <b>first</b> <b>variety</b> is often triggered by reduplication, resulting in spelling changes: sel is reduplicated to sensel ("tired").|$|E

Dyrenkov at the Experimental Design Office of the Department of Mechanization and Motorization of the RKKA (UMM RKKA). Two types of turrets, {{armed with the}} 76mm regimental gun mod. 1927 and DT tank machine gun in a ball mount, were assembled by the Izhora Factory. They were partially pressed and welded. The <b>first</b> <b>variety</b> was installed on the T-26 mod. 1931 in February 1932 and the second type was used in November 1932 (in the last case, the rear armoured plate of underturret box was made sloping).|$|E
2500|$|Indian coffee, grown {{mostly in}} {{southern}} India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as [...] "Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavour is defined as: [...] "The best Indian coffee reaches the flavour characteristics of Pacific coffees, but {{at its worst}} it is simply bland and uninspiring". The two well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta.

The ornamentals petunia and Jerusalem cherry, and other plants such as tobacco and horse nettle, are also members of this family. Eggplant was so named because the <b>first</b> <b>varieties</b> introduced to English-speaking people had egg-shaped fruits. Its scientific name is Solanum melongena var. esculentum...|$|R

2500|$|The second {{variety of}} nasal substitution, limited to {{bilabial}} and velar consonants, occurs across word and morpheme boundaries: kalap pahn is pronounced [...] ("always will be"); Soulik kin soupisek is pronounced [...] ("Soulik is [...] busy"). This second {{variety of the}} nasal substitution process is phonemically more productive than the first: it includes all results possible in the <b>first</b> <b>variety,</b> as well as additional cluster combinations, indicated in green below. Some alveolar pairs produce an intervening vowel, represented as V below. Not all clusters are possible, and not all are assimilative, however.|$|E
2500|$|After a year {{of mixed}} success with his <b>first</b> <b>variety</b> troupe called [...] "Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theater," [...] {{followed}} by the Panic of 1837 and three years of difficult circumstances, he purchased Scudder's American Museum, at Broadway and Ann Street, New York City, in 1841. Barnum improved the attraction, renamed [...] "Barnum's American Museum," [...] upgrading the building and adding exhibits, {{and it became a}} popular showplace. Barnum added a lighthouse lamp which attracted attention up and down Broadway and flags along the roof's edge that attracted attention in daytime. From between the upper windows, giant paintings of animals drew stares from pedestrians. The roof was transformed to a strolling garden {{with a view of the}} city, where he launched hot-air balloon rides daily. A changing series of live acts and curiosities, including albinos, giants, midgets, [...] "fat boys," [...] jugglers, magicians, exotic women, detailed models of cities and famous battles, and, eventually, a menagerie of animals were added to the exhibits of stuffed animals.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} irreducibility of {{resonance}} varieties of graded rings over an exterior algebra E with {{particular attention to}} Orlik-Solomon algebras. We prove that for a stable monomial ideal in E the <b>first</b> resonance <b>variety</b> is irreducible. If J is an Orlik- Solomon ideal of an essential central hyperplane arrangement, then we show that its <b>first</b> resonance <b>variety</b> is irreducible {{if and only if}} the subideal of J generated by all degree 2 elements has a 2 -linear resolution. As an application we characterize those hyperplane arrangements of rank {{less than or equal to}} 3 where J is componentwise linear. Higher resonance varieties are also considered. We prove results supporting a conjecture of Schenck-Suciu relating the Betti numbers of the linear strand of J and its <b>first</b> resonance <b>variety.</b> A counter example is constructed that this conjecture is not true for arbitrary graded ideals...|$|R

Our Commissar distributed them to us with an explanation. If we had gone another step they would have seen us. As it was we had to blast two Davids before we got back. There were hundreds of them, all around. Like ants. We took pictures and slipped back here, bolting the lid tight." ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{third variety}} {{of this type}} the human-headed body is united at the waist with the {{shoulders}} of a bull's body, in which it terminates. This occurs on an early vase. (Brit. Mus., No. 452.) On the coins of Oeniadæ in Acarnia, and on those of Ambracia, all of the period after Alexander the Great, the Achelous has a bull's body, and head with a human face. In this variety of the type the human element is almost absorbed, as in the <b>first</b> <b>variety</b> cited above, the coin of Metapontum, the bull portion of the type is only indicated {{by the addition of}} the horns and ears to the human head. On the analogy between these, varieties in the type of the Achelous and those under which the metamorphoses of the marine goddess Thetis are represented, see Gerhard, Auserl. Vasenb. ii. pp. 106-113. It is probable that, in the type of Thetis, of Proteus, and also of the Achelous, the singular combinations and transformations are intended to express the changeful nature of the element water.|$|E

50|$|Maris Piper {{was one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>varieties</b> with {{resistance}} to G. rostochiensis with the H1 gene giving complete {{resistance to}} UK strains. The widespread growth of Maris Piper led to the closely related G. pallida (to which Maris Piper has no resistance) becoming the main potato cyst nematode in the UK.When nematodes feed on the roots, the H1 gene results in the potato roots dying, preventing the nematodes from feeding and making it likely they die or turn into males. H1 is though to encode a protein that specifically detects the product of one nematode gene during feeding, a so-called gene-for-gene relationship.|$|R
