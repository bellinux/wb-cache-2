The Tower is also important because of its role in establishing the aesthetic potential of structures whose appearance is largely dictated by practical considerations.|$|E
25|$|On February 21, 1931, Dr. Carlos E. Chardón was {{appointed}} as {{chancellor of the}} university. During his tenure the university experienced significant growth in endowments. These {{were used in the}} expansion of the physical facilities at the Río Piedras and Mayagüez Campuses. This helped turn the university into a respected educational center. Chardón resigned from the post of Chancellor in 1936, being succeeded by Juan B. Soto. The most <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period was the expansion of the buildings of the University as part of a plan for the rehabilitation of Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|An <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{algorithm}} {{is the use}} of Price Functions and Reduced Lengths. For a directed graph G with arc-lengths ι(·), a price function is a function φ from the nodes of G to the real numbers. For an arc uv, the reduced length with respect to φ is ιφ(uv) = ι(uv) + φ(u) − φ(v). A feasible price function is a price function that induces nonnegative reduced lengths on all arcs of G. It is useful in transforming a shortest-path problem involving positive and negative lengths into one involving only nonnegative lengths, which can then be solved using Dijkstra’s algorithm.|$|E

25|$|Another early poetry collection/genre is the Chu Ci (dated to the Warring States period about 475–221 BCE), {{which is}} typified by various line lengths and the imagery and {{influence}} of the vernacular associated {{with the state of}} Chu, in southern China. One <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is the Li Sao, attributed to Qu Yuan. These poems from the State of Chu are among the most important of all Classical Chinese poetry, however, these poems and their style seem to have had less impact on Classical Chinese poetry, at least at first, than did the Shijing collection and style.|$|E
25|$|On October 11, Soviet {{plenipotentiary}} Boris Legran {{arrived in}} Yerevan with a text {{to negotiate a}} new Soviet-Armenian agreement. The agreement signed at October 24 secured Soviet support. The most <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> agreement dealt with Kars, which Armenia agreed to secure. The Turkish national movement was not happy with possible agreement between the Soviets and Armenia. Karabekir was informed by the Government of the Grand National Assembly regarding the Boris Legran agreement and ordered to resolve the Kars issue. The same day the agreement between Armenia and Soviet Russia was signed, Karabekir moved his forces toward Kars.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of these}} changes came the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program (SSMP), which, among other things, {{included}} funds {{for the development of}} methods to design and build nuclear weapons that would work without having to be explosively tested. In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments, and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1billion, with completion in 2002.|$|E

A natural question arises as follows.|$|R
25|$|To {{come up with}} a fast {{boat for}} IMS racing (or PHRF) Rob Ball aimed for maximum {{all-around}} speed relative to sailing length by providing a large rig, low center of gravity, narrow waterline beam, and weight concentrated amidships (to minimize pitching). Gentle handling characteristics result in a boat that is easy to sail, and make a boat sail faster in practice, so a big, stall-resistant keel and rudder were an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> design. The keel is large and deep, with an elliptical profile and narrow chord length where it joins the hull. There is a partial skeg -ahead of the big rudder to help dampen the quarter wave, improve tracking, and to fair in a more substantial rudder shaft.|$|E
25|$|Solapur is a {{city with}} multi-linguistic and multi-cultural features. Solapur has a mixture of Marathi and Kannada speakers. The festival of Makar Sankranti {{is one of the}} largest festivals celebrated by the Lingayat {{community}} in Solapur. The Nandidhwaj rally and their marriage is the important part of the festival. The Nandidhwaj rally goes through the 68 temples of Lord shiv which are situated in different parts of the city. Gadda yatra is another <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> festival. It is a fair which is organised on Hom Maidan. Along with Makar Sankranti people also celebrate Shiv Jayanti, Gudipadwa, Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi and some more.

People visit the temple to worship Goddess Rupabhawani for nine days in Navratri.|$|E
25|$|These {{remaining}} {{canals and}} their ecosystem was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, {{with the purpose}} of saving them. An <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ecosystem is a juniper tree called a “ahuejote” that is native to the shallow waters of the lake/canals. These stem erosion, act as wind breakers and favor the reproduction of a variety of aquatic species. Some of these endemic species include a freshwater crayfish called an acocil, and the Montezuma frog. However, the most representative animal from these waters is the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). This amphibian was used as a medicine, food and ceremonial object during the Aztec empire. It was considered to be an incarnation of the god Xolotl, brother of Quetzalcoatl. It has been studied due to its abilities to regenerate limbs and other body parts. It can also reach sexual maturity as a larva, which no other amphibian can do. While mostly aquatic, it does have limited ability to breathe air. As of 2003, there were only 600 axolotls known to exist in the wild. Most of the threat to the species is loss of habitat and pollution, but the introduction of non-native fish such as tilapia has also had disastrous effects on the population of this and other species. Conservation efforts include research and environmental education. The Grupo de Investigación del Ajolote en Xochimilco (GIA-X) is a nonprofit research group dedicated to the preservation of the axolotl, which is in danger of extinction. It works to better understand the creature {{as well as with the}} local community to protect what is left of its habitat. In addition to species that live in the area year round, the wetlands here host about forty percent of the migratory bird species that arrive to Mexico, roughly 350, use the wet areas around Xochimilco for nesting. Many of these come from the United States and Canada. However, much of this habitat has been urbanized. About 700 species have been found in the area overall. Some of the migratory species include pelicans, storks, buzzards and falcons.|$|E

500|$|In September 1943, the Italians capitulated and the Germans {{occupied}} Montenegro, {{establishing an}} area command ( [...] 1040) under Generalmajor (Brigadier) Wilhem Keiper. Soon after, the German Special Envoy in Belgrade Hermann Neubacher, Milan Nedić, and the German Military Commander in south-east Europe General Hans Felber arranged for Đurišić to be released. Neubacher {{had developed a}} plan to establish a union between Serbia and Montenegro and submitted it to Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in October 1943. Đurišić was an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> plan. He was well regarded by the Chetniks and pro-Chetnik populace in Montenegro, and Stanišić and Đukanović had been killed. Neubacher, Nedić and Felber believed Đurišić {{could be used to}} fight the Partisans in Montenegro and help form closer relations between Serbia and Montenegro. Although Neubacher's plan did not gain Hitler's approval, Đurišić received supplies including arms and ammunition from the Germans and in November 1943 he returned to Montenegro to fight against the Partisans. At this time he established closer ties with Dimitrije Ljotić, whose Serbian Volunteer Corps (SDK) provided him with weapons, food, typewriters, and other supplies. He also worked with Nedić, who promoted him to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and appointed him assistant to the commander of the SDK. According to Pajović, Đurišić was promoted in early to mid-1944 by the Yugoslav government-in-exile on the advice of Mihailović.|$|E
