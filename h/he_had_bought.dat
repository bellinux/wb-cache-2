5|$|Despite ongoing {{financial}} difficulties, Cerna {{graduated from}} university in 1906. His thesis was passed with a Magna cum laude qualifier. He was by then seriously ill with tuberculosis, and sought {{a change in}} climate. Cerna spent much of this period traveling through the Old Kingdom, and several times visited regions of the Southern Carpathians, in particular the area of Rucăr, the Bucegi Mountains, and the Jiu Valley. As Călinescu notes, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> himself a horse from a Rucăr local on credit, and failed to deliver the promised sum on time.|$|E
5|$|Garrick {{built the}} temple on land {{adjoining}} a villa that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> in October 1754 {{to serve as}} a country retreat. The villa's riverside garden, a plot now known as Garrick's Lawn, was separated from the main property by the road from Kingston upon Thames to Staines. Garrick commissioned the building of an elaborate grotto-tunnel under the road, illuminated by 500 lanterns, to facilitate private access to the lawn from the house.|$|E

5|$|Hanneman's {{interest}} in German war medals and Nazi Germany was illustrated {{by many of}} his lyrics. Those interests in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS began with medals {{given to him by}} his father, including some taken from a dead German soldier. His most prized medal was his Knight's Cross, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> from a Slayer fan for $1000. While touring with Motörhead, Hanneman discovered Motörhead vocalist Lemmy's {{interest in}} medals, and the two discussed medal designs, weapons and tactics used by the Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|Grill married Lovisa Ulrika Lüning (1744–1824) in Stockholm in 1772. They had ten children. She was the {{daughter}} of wholesaler Johan Christian Lüning and Margaretha Sabbath. In 1775, Grill sold the manor and the steel factory to Qvist and moved to Godegård where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> the manor and the ironworks from the estate of Jean de Geer. In doing so he followed the pattern of other supercargos who made their fortunes abroad during {{a short period of time}} in the East India trade and on their return invested their money in Swedish factories and farms.|$|E

5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse {{at the hands of}} his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo.

5|$|After Árbenz's resignation, {{his family}} {{remained}} for 73 {{days at the}} Mexican embassy in Guatemala City, which was crowded with almost 300 exiles. During this period, the CIA initiated {{a new set of}} operations against Árbenz, intended to discredit the former president and damage his reputation. The CIA obtained some of Árbenz's personal papers, and released parts of them after doctoring the documents. The CIA also promoted the notion that individuals in exile, such as Árbenz, should be prosecuted in Guatemala. When they were finally allowed to leave the country, Jacobo Árbenz was publicly humiliated at the airport when the authorities made the former president strip before the cameras, claiming that he was carrying jewelry <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> for his wife, María Cristina Villanova, at Tiffany's in New York City, using funds from the presidency; no jewelry was found but the interrogation lasted for an hour. Through this entire period, coverage of Árbenz in the Guatemalan press was very negative, influenced largely by the CIA's campaign.|$|E
5|$|During an {{engagement}} early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued a wounded soldier; his Russian comrades refused {{to help and}} Walpole carried {{one end of a}} stretcher and dragged the man to safety. For this he was awarded the Cross of Saint George; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty Walpole returned to Petrograd. Among the city's attractions for him was the presence of Konstantin Somov, a painter with whom he had formed a close relationship. He remained there until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in Rye, and retreated to a cottage <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> in Cornwall. In January 1916 he was asked by the Foreign Office to return to Petrograd. Russians were being subjected to highly effective German propaganda. The writer Arthur Ransome, Petrograd correspondent of The Daily News, had successfully lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, wanted Walpole to take charge.|$|E

5|$|George Tennant, born in 1765 {{and the son}} of a {{solicitor}} in Lancashire, {{moved to}} the area in 1816, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> the Rhydings estate. The Glan-y-wern Canal was unused at the time, following Lord Vernon's distraint, but Tennant, who had no previous experience with canals, decided to lease it, enlarge it and extend it. He planned to make it suitable for barges of , which would gain access to the river Neath through a lock at Red Jacket. Where the canal turned northwards across Crymlyn Bog, he would extend it to the west, to terminate at a lock into the River Tawe, near Swansea harbour. He believed that Swansea docks would provide a better shipping point than Neath or Giant's Grave, and hoped that the canal would encourage the development of the corridor through which it ran. He attempted to gain support for the scheme from local landowners, but when none was forthcoming, he decided to fund the project himself. Lord Vernon's estate had been inherited by the Earl of Jersey in 1814, and so Tennant leased the Glan-y-wern Canal from him.|$|E
5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly {{to refurbish}} a basement rehearsal room <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> from Badfinger. The Sex Pistols rehearsed in this room, lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons {{of the members}} as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had turned up at the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when he got the job, Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he settled on a Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 because of increased shop rates.|$|E
5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E

5|$|When {{both men}} were arrested on 18 January, Carty said he was {{innocent}} of the allegations and claimed {{he had been in}} a pub in Kilburn with relatives and friends, and stayed the night at a relative's house. When police searched his home, they found a pair of trainers that forensic tests showed had a drop of ap Rhys Pryce's blood on one toe. DNA from several people, including Brown, were found on the trainers. Officers also found a top with traces of Brown's DNA, and fibres found on Pryce's overcoat were microscopically indistinguishable from the material of that top. Brown also said he had been in Kilburn {{the night of the murder}} and initially claimed that he had nothing to do with either the robbery of the other man or the robbery and murder of Pryce. When the mobile phone of the other victim (Ali) was discovered at his home, he claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> it from two men. Detectives also found that Brown had hoarded press cuttings of Pryce.|$|E
5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E
