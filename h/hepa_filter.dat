2500|$|The Type A1 cabinet, {{formerly}} known as Type A, has a minimum inflow velocity of 75ft/min. The downflow air, considered contaminated, splits just above the work surface (the BSCs smoke split) and mixes with the inflow. This air is drawn, through ductwork, {{up the back of}} the cabinet where it is then blown into a positive pressure, contaminated plenum. Here, the air is either recirculated, through a <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter,</b> back down over the work zone, or exhausted out of the cabinet (also through a <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter).</b> Sizing of HEPA filters and an internal damper are used to balance these air volumes. This type is not safe for work with hazardous chemicals even when exhausted with a [...] "thimble" [...] or canopy to avoid disturbing internal air flow.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{increased}} risk of infection for patients caused by construction and renovation near hematology inpatient clinics is a major concern. The use of high-efficiency particulate absorption (<b>HEPA)</b> <b>filters</b> can {{reduce the risk of}} infection. However, there is no standard protocol indicating the use of <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> for patients with hematological malignancies, except for those who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This quasi-experimental study was designed to measure the efficacy of <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> in preventing infections during construction. Materials and Methods: Portable <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> were placed in the rooms of patients undergoing treatment for hematological malignancies because of large-scale construction taking place near the hematology clinic. The rates of infection during the 6 months before and after the installation of the portable <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> were compared. A total of 413 patients were treated during this 1 -year period. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} the antifungal prophylaxis and treatment regimens between the groups. The rates of infections, clinically documented infections, and invasive fungal infections decreased in all of the patients following the installation of the <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters.</b> When analyzed separately, the rates of invasive fungal infections were similar before and after the installation of <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> in patients who had no neutropenia or long neutropenia duration. <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> were significantly protective against infection when installed in the rooms of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, patients who were undergoing consolidation treatment, and patients who were neutropenic for 1 - 14 days. Conclusion: Despite the advent of construction and the summer season, during which environmental Aspergillus contamination is more prevalent, no patient or patient subgroup experienced an increase in fungal infections following the installation of <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters.</b> The protective effect of <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> against infection was more pronounced in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, patients undergoing consolidation therapy, and patients with moderate neutropenia...|$|R

2500|$|Principals of {{operation}} use motor driven blowers (fans) {{mounted in the}} cabinet to draw directional mass airflow around a user and into the air grille - protecting the operator. [...] The air is then drawn underneath the work surface and {{back up to the}} top of the cabinet where it passes through the HEPA filters. A column of HEPA filtered, sterile air is also blown downward, over products and processes to prevent contamination. Air is also exhausted through a <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter,</b> and depending on the Type of Class II BSC, the air is either recirculated back into the laboratory or pulled by an exhaust fan, through ductwork where it is expelled from the building.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{practices}} can {{be followed}} to mitigate mold issues in buildings, {{the most important}} of which is to reduce moisture levels that can facilitate mold growth. Properly functioning air conditioning (AC) units are essential to controlling levels of indoor airborne fungal spores. Air filtration reduces the number of spores available for germination, especially when a High Efficiency Particulate Air (<b>HEPA)</b> <b>filter</b> is used. A properly functioning AC unit also reduces the relative humidity, or the moisture inherent in the air. [...] The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently recommends that relative humidity be maintained between 30% to 50% to preempt mold growth. [...] Considering that fungal growth requires cellulose, plant fiber, as a food source, using building materials that do not contain cellulose is an effective method of preventing fungal growth.|$|E
2500|$|The Type C1 BSC was {{borne out}} of {{necessity}} to control infectious material, chemical hazards, reduce operating costs and add flexibility in modern laboratories. The Type C1 moves air by mixing inflow air with {{the air in the}} columns of downflow air marked for recirculation. Air above a clearly delineated section of the work surface is drawn by a second internal fan where it is exhausted through a <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter.</b> The C1 differs from a Type A in that it can use this single pass airflow, and when installed in a ducted operating mode, can protect from hazardous chemistry, like the Type Bs. The C1 also differs from the Type B BSCs in several ways; (1) it does not require a hard connected, dedicated exhaust system and blower to operate, (2) pending a risk assessment, the BSC can run for an extended duration to increase operator protection during a remote exhaust system failure, and (3) Type C1 BSCs can run without being connected to an exhaust system at all.|$|E

40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has {{invested}} considerable effort in developing fireproof high-efficiency particulate air (<b>HEPA)</b> <b>filters.</b> Due {{to the nature}} of LLNL’s research, the air leaving its lab facilities must be filtered before it is released into the atmosphere; thus, each laboratory is equipped with large banks of <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> through which all internal air is exhausted. Over the years, however, fires have erupted in the labs and entire banks of <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> have been destroyed, resulting in repairs and crucial downtime that prove costly. Engineers and scientists alike have been seeking a permanent solution to this problem, and one proposition is to make the filters themselves fireproof rather than installing sprinkler systems and other preventative measures to protect them, as is the current practice. The challenge is to make <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> fireproof. <b>HEPA</b> <b>filters</b> are comprised of several critical components: the filter media material, the sealant, and the gasket.

50|$|High-efficiency {{particulate}} arrestance (HEPA) filters remove {{at least}} 99.97% of 0.3-micrometer particles {{and are usually}} more effective at removing larger particles. HEPA purifiers, which filter all the air going into a clean room, must be arranged so that no air bypasses the <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter.</b> In dusty environments, a <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter</b> may follow an easily cleaned conventional filter (prefilter) which removes coarser impurities so that the <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter</b> needs cleaning or replacing less frequently.

5000|$|Many vacuum {{cleaners}} also use HEPA filters {{as part of}} their filtration systems. This is beneficial for asthma and allergy sufferers, because the <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter</b> traps the fine particles (such as pollen and dust mite feces) which trigger allergy and asthma symptoms. For a <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter</b> in a vacuum cleaner to be effective, the vacuum cleaner must be designed so that all the air drawn into the machine is expelled through the filter, with none of the air leaking past it. This {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Sealed HEPA" [...] or sometimes the more vague [...] "True HEPA". Vacuum cleaners simply labeled [...] "HEPA" [...] may have a <b>HEPA</b> <b>filter,</b> but not all air necessarily passes through it. Finally, vacuum cleaner filters marketed as [...] "HEPA-like" [...] will typically use a filter of a similar construction to HEPA, but without the filtering efficiency.
