40|$|Abstract. Rails flaw {{detection}} both before installation and during exploitation takes substantial time. To speedup {{the process of}} {{flaw detection}} in rails without the necessity of thorough scanning the low-frequency guided-wave ultrasonic flaw detector AKR 1224 was developed. Operation of AKR 1224 is based on guided-wave ultrasound propagation in head, web and <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail.</b> The detection is made with pulseecho method. Echo-signals are displayed in common time-amplitude sweep. AKR 1224 operates with twelve element antenna array with dry acoustic contact as sending and receiving device. Experimental research and application of the devices have proved that:- For each of five rail ’ surfaces (head’s surface, head’s side edge, web, foot’s body and foot’s edge) {{a unique set of}} parameters and settings (operation frequency, group and phase ultrasound velocity etc) is necessary;- Defects in head are detected the same way as in all head’s surfaces (surface or side);- Flaw detection in web can be carried out from any side;- The flaws in foot’s body can be detected only from the body itself. Either body’s top or its edge can be used for testing;- The maximum distance for flaw detection even for big defects in rails ’ foot cannot exceed 3 - 3, 5 m due to the acoustic energy losses in places of rails ’ connections and noises from them...|$|E

50|$|When welding rails {{together}} {{using the}} Thermite process {{began at the}} start of the 20th century, a section of railhead approximately 3/4 in long, also called a dutchman, was often placed between the sections being joined, with only the web and <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> being new Thermite steel.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{complete}} the junction, CPR demanded that the OA&PS lay 1,700 <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> {{on the far side}} of the crossing, so their trains could be run clear of the CPR line. To aid this, the OA&PS men laid their lines right up to the B&O so they could hand-carry the rails the short distance to the far side of the road. As the crossing was not operational, they were not legally allowed to be operating rails on CP land, so the CPR men were ordered to tear it up, forcing the OA&PS crew to carry the rails from further away. The OA&PS re-laid their line again, with reports that this caused a fight.|$|R

50|$|The mostly {{westerly}} site, {{stands at}} the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rails</b> Road. This mill dates from 1600 when it was owned by Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. By 1830 there were two waterwheels powering three grinding stones, however problems with the water supply in the summer meant that the mill was often not working at full capacity. The mill continued operating until the 1930s after which the buildings quickly fell into disrepair and were demolished in the early 1950s with a small car parking area now occupying the site. The dam wall was damaged in 1967 by dredging work and eventually collapsed in March 2001. The RVCG and Sheffield Council filled in the pond and created a new one nearby with a pond dipping platform. The official opening was on 17 May 2007.|$|R

50|$|In late 1830s England, railway lines had a vast {{range of}} {{different}} patterns. One {{of the earliest}} lines to use double-headed rail was the London and Birmingham Railway, which had offered a prize for the best design. This rail was supported by chairs and the head and <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> had the same profile. The supposed advantage was that, when the head became worn, the rail could be turned over and re-used. In practice, this form of recycling was not very successful as the chair caused dents in the lower surface, and double-headed rail evolved into bullhead rail in which the head was more substantial than the foot.|$|R

Rough shingle ballast was used as dictated by the available supplies. As well as the permanent way, the line was equipped with 'props' by way of signals, a level crossing, water tower, coaling stage and other items, to create a railway-like atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{failures}} <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> {{often occur}} at the rail foot, since the geometry of this zone gives rise to stress concentrations under service loads or defects during rail manufacture and installation. In this paper, the fatigue behavior of cracks at the web/foot region <b>of</b> a <b>rail</b> is analyzed numerically. Analytical models in the literature for a semi-elliptical surface crack in a finite plate assume that the geometry of the front remains semi-elliptical during the whole propagation phase and the ellipse axes do not undergo translations or rotations. Fatigue tests show {{that this is not}} the case for such cracks in rails. A predictive model for crack growth has been developed by assuming an initial small crack at one probable initiation point between the web and <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> in reference to a service condition loading. SIF values have been estimated by means of the finite element method and the plastic radius correction. The results attained were compared with crack growth experimental data...|$|R

40|$|A {{parameter}} used as {{an indication}} of elastic response and quality in several railroads is the track modulus (u), which requires the determination of displacements (deflections) in the field. This paper aims to present a Device for Meas-urements of Displacements (DMD), developed to register deflections during the passage of trains without interrupting the railroad operation. To demonstrate its feasibility, the DMD was used in measurements of two sections in Estrada de Ferro Carajás (EFC), with different conditions of ballast and sleeper. The results showed that the device proved to be suitable for performing the measurement of displacements, which are subsequently used in calculating the track modulus. Additionally, in the case study it was observed that the way of loading (function of speed) relies on different mechanical responses and that measurement on the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> is more appropriate. Furthermore, it was observed that the device may likely indicate a possible defect in the wheel or in the rail. In general, {{it was found that the}} DMD can be a useful tool to help on the railroad maintenance management...|$|R

The permanent way consists of flat-bottomed or Vignoles patterned rail stated to weigh 40 lbs per lineal yard in lengths <b>of</b> 15 <b>feet,</b> 17 feet 6 inches, and 21 feet, laid on transverse sleepers of half-round Baltic timber creosoted (4½ in.), and 9 feet long placed at an average distance <b>of</b> three <b>feet</b> apart, centre to centre, except that {{on some of the}} sharpest curves an extra sleeper has been inserted under every 21 <b>feet</b> length <b>of</b> <b>rail.</b> No chairs are made use <b>of,</b> but the <b>rail</b> is fastened to the transverse sleepers by a fang-bolt with a clip under the head, overlapping the flange <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> on one side, and by a wrought iron spike on the other side.

40|$|Characterization of the {{defects in}} wheel-rail contact, in railway transport, using {{vibration}} signals has been, {{in the last}} years, {{an important factor in}} the maintenance of the railroads in order to limit the impact of the vibrations both in the own installations and in its surroundings. This work is a contribution to the study and the characterization of possible present defects in movable material of the subway of Barcelona (FCMB). For it, the use of time-frequency techniques for signal analysis is proposed. In the work, signals coming from the vibration <b>of</b> the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> to the passage of a train are analyzed using STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform) and CWT (Continue Wavelet Transform). The vibration signals, generated by the passage of a train on the railway line, are non-stationary. So, techniques based on FT (Fourier Transform) and used for stationary signals are not suitable for the analysis and the characterization of this type of signals. When applying FT to a signal, the temporary information is lost. Therefore, it does not allow establishing the exact moment in which significant alterations of the signal, coming from the defects in the wheel-rail contact, takes place. In order to solve this problem, the STFT and the CWT are used to analyze the obtained in situ nonstationary vibrations...|$|R
50|$|Conditions {{that affect}} the {{installed}} stress arise through lots of activities. It is accepted that any action that disturbs the ballast, track components, geometry and rails will affect the 'Critical Rail Temperature' and cause {{the stability of the}} track to be subject to adverse thermal forces. A typical example would be when a piece <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> has been removed due to a defect, or when an Insulated block joint (IBJ) is to be replaced. In cases such as these, the stressing engineer would ensure that the old rail is measured and marked with 'TellTale' indicators on the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> at the extremities of the replaced length. The rail would then be 'Flame Cut', and the clips securing it to the sleepers/ties are removed starting at the point of the cut outward to the limit of renewal. The existing defective rail is then cut out and movement at the 'tell tales' noted for re-instatement. The stressing engineer will then calculate the 'Original Stress free temperature' of the removed section and determine how much stress, if any has been lost and needs replacing. The new rail is fitted and welded at one end. The new rail is then cut to suit the Calculated length and a stressing kit is then fitted at the end still to be welded. The kit is clamped to the rail and it pulls the gap together, leaving enough space for a second weld. Once the rail is stressed to the appropriate temperature the weld is made. After setting the weld and an appropriate cooling period of time has elapsed, the stress kit is removed.|$|R

5000|$|For {{the first}} time since 1958, the fare on the SIRT was {{increased}} on September 1, 1972 to 35 cents. The increase was from an average fare of 22 cents. The fare increase applied to the whole system, and was accompanied by the elimination of commutation tickets and student tickets. Previously, fares ranged from 20 to 35 cents. 16 per cent of riders of the 17,000 daily riders had no change in fare. There was a 10 per cent increase for 51 per cent of passengers and a 15 per cent increase for the remaining 33 per cent. The fare increase was expected to bring in an extra $400,000 a year. At the time, the line was operating at a deficit of $2.9 Million a year, with $2.5 Million of it offset by a subsidy from the city.

40|$|AbstractThe fatigue {{behaviour}} of cracks at the <b>foot</b> region <b>of</b> a <b>rail</b> {{subjected to}} bending load has been investigated. Depending on {{the position of}} initiation of a small semi-elliptical surface crack in a rail, the crack front changes shape during propagation to failure due to the large variation of the stress intensity factor from point to point round the crack front {{due to differences in}} the local stress field as each point round the crack front lies at different distances from the neutral axis <b>of</b> the <b>rail.</b> This condition implies a variable crack growth rate that transforms the crack front shape during fatigue crack propagation. SIF values have been estimated by means of both the finite element method and analytical solutions derived for a semi-elliptical crack in a finite rectangular cross-section beam. The SIF value predictions obtained with the two methods show good agreement suggesting that the analytical solutions can be used for a rapid assessment of the severity of a flaw in a rail. A predictive model for crack growth has been derived for an initial small crack at an initiation point at the foot/web corner <b>of</b> a <b>rail</b> tested under four point bending fatigue in the laboratory, showing a reasonably good prediction of both the shape and size of the crack at failure when compared with experiment...|$|R
