5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} other models. One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are clearly divided between the levels of government, and the states have little say in federal <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn pharmacoeconomics {{the costs}} and {{consequences}} of alternative medications are compared. Many countries have begun to use pharmacoeconomic evidence to support decisions on licensing, pricing, reimbursement, or addition to the formulary. In Saudi Arabia, it is not mandatory to submit cost effectiveness evidence to support licensing or addition to the formulary decisions however, data will be considered if submitted. Previous {{evidence suggests that the}} use of pharmacoeconomic evidence by Saudi Pharmacy and Therapeutic (P&T) committee members in formulary <b>decisions</b> <b>making</b> process is limited mainly because of lack of expertise and lack of resources.
