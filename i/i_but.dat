She never fired her guns in anger during her career. Dante Alighieri was refitted in 1923, stricken from the Navy List in 1928 and subsequently sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{structure}} of the Scottish royal court in the period before the reign of David <b>I,</b> <b>but</b> by the late thirteenth century, it had taken on a distinctly feudal character. The major offices were the steward or stewart, chamberlain, constable, marischal and chancellor. The office of stewart, responsible for management of the king's household, was created by David I and given as an hereditary office to Walter Fitzalan, whose descendants became the House of Stewart. The office was merged with the crown when Robert II inherited the throne.|$|E

5|$|The College {{is almost}} entirely self-financed, {{and is not a}} {{recipient}} of any regular public funding. Its officers do have official salaries, which {{are paid for by the}} Crown. The salaries of the officers were raised during the reign of King James <b>I,</b> <b>but</b> were reduced under William IV. These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day; however today the amount is seen only as nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which professional fees are charged.|$|E
5|$|The Lexington-class {{aircraft}} carriers were {{a pair of}} {{aircraft carriers}} built for the United States Navy (USN) during the 1920s.

The Treaty, however, allowed two of the unfinished ships to be converted to carriers. They were the first operational aircraft carriers in the USN and were used to develop carrier aviation tactics and procedures before World War II {{in a series of}} annual exercises.|$|E

5|$|The Sun-grazing comets of 1668, 1689, 1702 and 1945 seem to {{be closely}} related to those of 1882 and 1965, {{although}} their orbits are not well enough determined to establish whether they broke off from the parent comet in 1106, or the previous perihelion passage before that, {{some time in the}} 3–5th centuries AD. This subgroup of comets is known as Subgroup II. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli, which was seen in 1970, is more closely related to this group than Subgroup <b>I,</b> <b>but</b> appears to have broken off during the previous orbit to the other fragments.|$|E

In Pasargadae Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the reign of Cyrus the Great. A palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus had constructed this building, however due to the cuneiform script being used, the palace {{is believed to have been}} constructed by Darius.|$|E
