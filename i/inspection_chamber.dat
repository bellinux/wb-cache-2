50|$|Water {{collected}} by a rain gutter is fed, usually via a downpipe (also called a leader or conductor), {{from the roof}} edge {{to the base of}} the building where it is either discharged or collected. The down pipe can terminate in a shoe and discharge directly onto the surface, but using modern construction techniques would be connected through an <b>inspection</b> <b>chamber</b> to a drain that led to a surface water drain or soakaway. Alternatively it would connect via a gulley (u-bend) with 50mm water seal to a combined drain. Water from rain gutters may be harvested in a rain barrel or a cistern.|$|E

NIK stressed that geological works (in the period analysed) were carried out in {{a small part of the}} concession area. Often, the works recorded significant delays. Lack of dynamics in these works can be attributed to economic-financial factors, incorrect public administration measures, and broadly lack of transparency of the legislative process in the works of the Polish legislator...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{the results of a}} {{research}} project called eXtensible Project Documentation Reporting Language (XPDRL). The main objective of this project is {{to improve the quality of}} the core project documentation that serves for supporting the construction works in Spain and to facilitate an efficient exchange of information between the stakeholders in the Spanish Architectural Engineering and Construction sector, in particular their relationship with the Professional Associations and Spanish control public bodies. Starting from the premise that high quality project documentation is the basic precondition for a good quality in all the phases of the whole buildings and facilities life cycle, the project is based on Internet, XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) and the new Spanish standards about the quality in the project documentation (UNE 157000 series). As a result, a new set of XBRL taxonomies has been developed to support the processes of elaboration, verification, sending to the Professional Association, digital stamping, delivery, control, compulsory registration and storage of the construction project core documentation by the public authorities. Our proposal can be extended to other countries, particularly in Europe, since regulations are becoming similar in all EU countries. The potential for spin-off technology utilization is also significant in the areas of insurance, <b>inspection</b> <b>chamber,</b> digital reporting and project management...|$|E
50|$|For their renowned {{draining}} system, Lothal engineers provided corbelled roofs, and {{an apron}} of kiln-fired bricks over the brick {{face of the}} platform where the sewerage entered the cesspool. Wooden screens inserted in grooves in the side drain walls held back solid waste. The well is built of radial bricks, 2.4 m in diameter and 6.7 m deep. It had an immaculate network of underground drains, silting chambers and cesspools, and <b>inspection</b> <b>chambers</b> for solid waste. The extent of drains provided archaeologists with many clues regarding the layout of streets, organisation of housing and baths. On average, the main sewer is 20 - 46 cm in depth, with outer dimensions of 86 × 68 × 33 cm (34 × 27 × 13 in). Lothal brick-makers used a logical approach in manufacture of bricks, designed with care in regards to thickness of structures. They were used as headers and stretchers in same and alternate layers. Archaeologists estimate that in most cases, the bricks were in ratio 1:0.5:0.25 on three sides, in dimensions which were integral multiples of large graduations of Lothal scale of 25 mm.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the Civil War, the Chamber {{gathered}} {{funds and}} {{wrote to the}} President, Congress, the New York State Legislature and the New York City Council regarding the defenses of the New York Harbor. Eventually, the State Legislature allocated one million dollars to the project and after <b>inspection</b> the <b>Chamber</b> deemed these defenses acceptable. [...] The Chamber also commemorated significant events and in 1861 issued medals to the defenders of Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens for their bravery during April and May of that year. Over the course of 1862 and 1863, the Chamber condemned the acts of the CSS Alabama and the CSS Florida, sloops-of-war known for capturing and burning Union merchant and naval ships.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} Luigi Maria Sicca {{suggests}} {{on the one}} hand that organization theory offers an interpretation of the reality of arts producing organizations and on the other that the empirical analysis of these realities can supply new input for organization theory. As a practical example of artistic production the Author refers to an international chamber music festival. Close <b>inspection</b> of <b>chamber</b> music will reveal characteristics that apply to any type of organization. Sicca begins by looking at the nature of arts management and the arts manager. L. M. Sicca goes on to analyse the characteristics of the production process in the performing arts, which can be seen as communication taking place on three levels: between audience and performers (concept of “prosumer”); within the performing group (“listening ability”); between the author of the written text and the performer/interpreter (“concept of value”). Luigi Maria Sicca finishes by showing how in a symbolic-cultural framework the features identified in the paper can feed back into organization studies...|$|R
40|$|The main scope was the {{development}} of support code for a marble tile inspection machine. Marble tiles running on a conveyor belt are captured with a linear CCD camera, and the images are being used for geometrically inspection within 300 msec, which is the available time until the tile reaches the selection mechanism right after the <b>inspection</b> <b>chamber.</b> Supporting algorithm should be fully functional, fast, full proof, and should be easily modifiable to accommodate tiles of any size and colouring. Since the whole system would be fully automated and used by inexperienced personnel, the algorithm should self-check for CCD array problems, such as burned pixels, dirt on the sensor itself or on the housing. The absence of marble tiles on the belt or totally misplaced tiles should also be accounted for and alert the users. The algorithm also supports storage on a database of a cropped image of the tile in a predefined image size. The proposed algorithm is {{taking advantage of the}} constrained environment to extract edge pixel and form edge line using robust least squares. The corners of the tile are detected using line intersection, which in turn are used to calculate the geometrical characteristics. The final tile cropping is being done using projective transformation to adjust rotation, misalignments and size uniformity in the created image tile database. 1. 1 Rationale 1...|$|E
40|$|In a {{world with}} an {{increasing}} urban population, analysing the construction impacts of sanitation infrastructures through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is necessary for defining the best environmental management strategies. In this study, {{the environmental impacts of}} one linear meter of sewer constructive solution were analysed for different pipe materials and diameters used in Southern Europe; a unit of different sewer appurtenances (pump, manhole and <b>inspection</b> <b>chamber)</b> was also considered. The impacts of the pipe materials were compared considering different lifespan periods and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) {{turned out to be the}} worst option, being polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and concrete the most favourable ones. Few data are available on the material and energy flows in the installation stage; therefore, a comparative analysis of trenches with sand and concrete bedding was conducted. The results show that the installation stage represents up to 80 % of the total life-cycle impact of the constructive solutions. Concrete pipes with half-concrete/half-sand bedding are the best option and produce 20 - 30 % of the impact of HDPE pipes with concrete bedding. Hence, designers should focus not only on the pipe but also on the trench model. A methodology was presented to enable the impact aggregation of the different sewer elements, and Betanzos (Spain) was selected to conduct a pilot study in small cities. In the future, studies will need to incorporate the use and maintenance stage, as it is not standard and varies according to the physical features of the cities. Finally, this study provides basic concepts for developing eco-efficiency indicators...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} types of gas {{detectors}} which are used in CERN in LHC project, There is a main parts for the gas detectors which must be in all gas detectors types like Multiwire proportional chambers, such as the micromesh gaseous structure chamber (the MicroMegas), Gas-electron multiplier (GEM) detector, Resistive Plate Champers [...] . Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment detecting muons which are powerful tool for recognizing signatures of interesting physics processes. The CMS detector uses: drift tube (DT), cathode strip chamber (CSC) and resistive plate chamber (RPC). Building RPC’s was my project in summer student program (hardware). RPC’s have advantages which are triggering detector and Excellent time resolution which reinforce the measurement of the correct beam crossing time. RPC’s Organized in stations :  RPC barrel (RB) there are 4 stations, namely RB 1, RB 2, RB 3, and RB 4  While in the RPC endcap (RE) the 3 stations are RE 1, RE 2, and RE 3. In the endcaps a new starion will be added and this what my group worked on, we almost finished with the first disc for {{the one of the}} end caps and one more disc still for the other one. There are stips for building RPC’s and after that the Quality Assurance steps will be applied on the new RPC’s which are:  Leak Test of Gas Gaps and chamber  Spacer test of the gas gaps  High voltage test of Gas gaps and <b>chamber</b>  Visual <b>Inspection</b> of <b>chamber</b>  Cosmic test of chamber  Online Database And also there is experimental steps which I will I will discuss in the report with the testing procedur...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{patients}} with C-shaped {{configuration of the}} root canal system are definitely {{a problem in the}} everyday dental practice. The C-shaped configuration of the root canal {{can be seen in the}} mandibular and maxillary molars. The treatment of these teeth is very difficult. Purpose: To trace the treatment of clinical cases with C-shaped configuration of the root canal system. Material and methods: There are some different cases that are described with a C-shaped configuration of the root canal system with one, two, three and four separate root canals. Careful exploration of the floor of the pulp <b>chamber,</b> <b>inspection</b> with magnification, use of ultrasonic irrigation and a modified filling technique are of particular use. Results and Discussion: Clinical cases of a C-shaped pulp chamber and root canal system shows that this root canal aberration occurs in a wide variety and variability with a single root canal up to two, three and four separate root canals. The diameter of the root canal themselves also varies from very wide to such with a small diameter. Conclusions: Knowledge of the different anatomical variations will improve the endododntic practice of the general dental practitioners...|$|R
40|$|The NEXT Long-Duration Test {{is part of}} a {{comprehensive}} thruster service life assessment intended to demonstrate overall throughput capability, validate service life models, quantify wear rates as a function of time and operating condition, and identify any unknown life-limiting mechanisms. The test was voluntarily terminated in February 2014 after demonstrating 51, 184 hours of high-voltage operation, 918 kg of propellant throughput, and 35. 5 MN-s of total impulse. The post-test inspection of the thruster hardware began shortly afterwards with a combination of non-destructive and destructive analysis techniques, and is presently nearing completion. This paper presents relevant results of the post-test inspection for the discharge chamber as well as other miscellaneous components such as the high-voltage propellant isolators and electrical cabling. Comparison of magnetic field measurements taken during pretest and post-test inspections indicate that the field strength did not degrade, consistent with performance data obtained during the test. <b>Inspection</b> of discharge <b>chamber</b> mesh samples show a deposition coating primarily composed of grid material that is approximately 15 micrometers in thickness. This thickness is well within the retention capability of the mesh and is therefore not expected to present any issues. Approximately 3. 1 grams of deposition flakes were found {{at the bottom of the}} discharge chamber, composed primarily of grid material and carbon. Calculated size histograms of these flakes indicate that 99 % have a maximum dimension of 200 micrometers or smaller, which is significantly less than the ion optics grid gap. Larger flakes that are capable of causing a grid-to-grid short will be analyzed to determine if their formation will occur in flight or is a facility effect. The high-voltage propellant isolators as well as numerous other electrical insulators were inspected and no evidence of arcing or any other issues were found...|$|R
