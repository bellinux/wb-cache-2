The group determined that steps {{need to be}} taken in: Expediting Plan Approvals, Clarification of new regulation and permitting rules and NEPA and Environmental Assessment requirements. Executive Director Lori Leblanc of GEST was quoted stated, [...] "Our focus is simply on getting our Coast back to work fueling America. We will be working aggressively {{over the next few weeks}} and months to get clarification on new rules issued by the BOEM for <b>driling</b> plans and permits, and then to pressure the agency to apply necessary resources to expeditiously process backlogged drilling plans, particularly for deepwater operations, so permits can effectively move through the system." ...|$|E
40|$|Laser <b>driling</b> is {{a common}} commercially {{developed}} technique for material processing. From the application viewpoint, it is the end product for a laser system, for instance a drilled hole, that matters. Laser pulse profile {{is the most important}} parameter controlling the laser hole drilling process. An efficient and practical method is therefore needed to develop a relationship between the pulse parameters and the depth of hole produced in a known material. In the present study, dimensionless groups are developed to optimize laser pulse parameters to give information on workpiece materials. Consequently, an optimal laser pulse for drilling an aluminum workpiece is predicted...|$|E

This technology {{is one of the}} greatest developments in drilling operations. Casing drilling involves drilling and casing a well simultaneously. In casing <b>driling</b> process, downhole tools can be retrieved, through the casing on wire-line, meaning tool recovery or replacement of tools can take minutes versus hours under conventional methods. This process employs wireline-retrievable tools and a drill-lock assembly, permitting bit and BHA changes, coring, electrical logging and even directional or horizontal drilling. Once the casing point is reached, the casing is cemented in place without tripping pipe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe present <b>Drile,</b> a {{multiprocess}} immersive instrument {{built upon}} the hierarchical live-looping technique and aimed at musical performance. This technique consists in creating musical trees whose nodes {{are composed of}} sound effects applied to a musical content. In the leaves, this content is a one-shot sound, whereas in higher-level nodes this content is composed of live-recorded sequences of parameters of the children nodes. <b>Drile</b> allows musicians to interact efficiently with these trees in an immersive environment. Nodes are represented as worms, which are 3 D audiovisual objects. Worms can be manipulated using 3 D interaction techniques, and several operations {{can be applied to}} the live-looping trees. The environment is composed of several virtual rooms, i. e. group of trees, corresponding to specific sounds and effects. Learning <b>Drile</b> is progressive since the musical control complexity varies according to the levels in live-looping trees. Thus beginners may have limited control over only root worms while still obtaining musically interesting results. Advanced users may modify the trees and manipulate each of the worms...|$|R
40|$|Main {{objective}} of horizontal <b>driling</b> {{is to place}} a drain-hole for a long distance within the pay zone to enhance productivity or injectivity. In drilling horizontal wells, more serious problems appear than in drilling vertical wells. These problems are: poor hole cleaning, excessive torque and drag, hole filling, pipe stucking, wellbore instability, loss of circulation, formation damage, poor cement job, and difficulties at logging jobs. From that reason, successful drilling and production of horizontal well depends largely on the fluid used during drilling and completion phases. Several new fluids, that fulfill {{some or all of}} required properties (hole cleaning, cutting suspension, good lubrication, and relative low formation damage), are presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Introduction An {{effectiveness}} of mining largely {{depends on the}} <b>driling</b> rate, which is determined in great part by a drilling bit shape and properties. So, the optimal design of drilling tool is currently a very important problem. The following two ways to improve drilling are commonly used: first,experimental, and second, basing on the simulation of stress state and rock fragmentation in drilling. Possibilities of these ways are limited: the problem of 3 -D simulation of deformation and fragmentation of heterogeneous rock under loading with intricately shaped tool is rather complex {{and has not been}} solved yet. The paper seeks to develop a principle and method of design and improvement of drilling tool, which could make it possible to create new high-efficient drilling bit constructions. Currently, the methods of information theory are widely used to describe a behaviour of complex systems [1]. In particular, the deformation and failure of granular, heterogeneous or damaged materials c...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of the present condition of the bridge over Poljanska Sora in Gorenja vas. Because the load-bearing structure is made from reinforced concrete, {{the first part of the}} thesis describes mechanical properties of concrete and reinforcement and their mutual compatibility. After that, there is a description of processes and causes, which influence on the deterioration of reinforced concrete structures. After the theoretical part, there is a description of the bridge and a description of tests, which were made in order to define the present state of the structure. Tests are divided into two parts, field and laboratory tests. Field tests include description of the visible damages of the structure, procedure and the depth measurement results of the carbonation according to the European standard SIST EN 14630 : 2007 and description of the concrete cored specimens <b>driling</b> according to the standard SIST EN 12504 - 1 : 2009. Taken coreds of the concrete from reinforced concrete parts of the bridge were analysed and described in the laboratory and then prepared for the further analyses and tests, which include tests for presence of chloride ions at various depths, compressive strength measurements of the concrete in structures according to the European standard SIST EN 12504 - 1 : 2009 and the measurement of carbonation depth in accordance with the same standard as for the field tests. In the last part of the thesis I have presented all completed tests and the final results as a part of overall evaluation of the condition of the existing bridge construction over Poljanska Sora...|$|E
40|$|Cet article rappelle tout d'abord, un constat du XVe Congrès du Conseil Mondial de l'Énergie (Madrid, septembre 1992) : au cours des 30 prochaines années, les énergies fossiles vont continuer à être à la base de tout approvisionnement énergétique. Examinant les {{conditions}} de ce maintien dans un contexte géopolitique difficile, il montre qu'une des voies à privilégier est d'accroître les efforts de recherches pour réaliser les progrès scientifiques et technologiques qui permettront de satisfaire {{la demande}} en pétrole et en gaz pour le début du 21 ème siècle. L'effort de R & D nécessaire pour disposer des technologies pétrolières et gazières de la prochaine décennie nécessite une recherche faite en commun, car seule une recherche coordonnée évitera une dispersion des efforts français. L'élargissement des réserves économiquement exploitables, la maîtrise du coût de production et la réduction des coûts des chaînes gaz des champs de production aux régions consommatrices, tout en assurant la protection de l'environnement sont les prochains défis à relever. Pour faire face à ces attentes de l'industrie, d'importants efforts de recherche doivent être menés dans les domaines scientifiques correspondants, afin de mieux appréhender les phénomènes et de développer les solutions les plus appropriées. En définitive, les progrès scientifiques et technologiques, nécessaires à l'élargissement des réserves économiques exploitables, à une plus grande accessibilité aux ressources pétrolières et gazières, ainsi qu'à une utilisation mieux ciblée de l'énergie face à la protection de l'environnement, demandent un accroissement sensible des efforts de recherche. Une telle politique ne peut se concevoir sans recourir à un partenariat plus large et sans une incitation et un financement substantiel de la part de la puissance publique, française ou européenne. This article begins by recalling a statement {{made at the}} 15 th World Energy Council (Madrid, September 1992) : during the next 30 years, fossil energy sources {{will continue to be}} the basis for all energy supplies. By looking at the conditions of this assertion within a difficult geopolitical context, it shows that one of the privileged routes is to increase research efforts to make scientific and technological advances that will make it possible to fulfill the demand for oil and gas {{at the start of the}} 21 st century. The R&D effort required to make oil and gas technologies available for the next decade calls for concerted research to be done, for only coordinated research will prevent the dispersal of French efforts (Fig. 6). Increasing economically exploitable reserves, mastering production costs and reducing the costs of gas chainsfrom producing fields to consumer regions, while ensuring environmental production, are the challenges that have to be faced. To cope with these expectations for the industry, great research efforts must be made in the corresponding scientific areas so as to gain a better understanding of phenomena and to develop the most suitable solutions (Fig. 7). The leading R&D axes to be promoted between now and 2000 are then explained. Reducing exploration risks requires, above all, a better petroleum assessment of basins. The progress expected will be based on the scaling up of 2 D basin modeling to 3 D modeling for assessing the ultimate reserves of a basin (Fig. 8 and Plate I). Improving the determining of the geometry of subsurface geologic structures will benefit from progress in structural imaging, whose aim is to obtain an assessment of the position and shape of seismic reflectors. These are geologic concepts (the understanding the geologist has of the architecture of deltaic or alluvial deposits, of different types of reefs, etc.) which, based on geostatistics and expressed by numerical modeling, will make lithological interpolation among wells (Fig. 9 and Plate II), thus leading to the better characterization of reservoirs. In structures where there is already a good understanding of the formations, the progress expected for the years to come, thanks to geophysical techniques, will involve prestack inversion, which will ascertain important characteristics such as the presence of gas or even the distinction of two fluids as well as the obtaining of three-dimensional data. Concerning production from fields, the stakes for R&D are considerable since the problem is now to produce from the great majority of small and structurally complex fields, or even, in some countries, to resume production from fields hampered by a relatively rustic recovery method. Such undertakings are essentially based on a better understanding of reservoir dynamics. On line of reflection that is certainly important for the future will be to analyze behavior laws in complex cases. In this area as well, numerical modeling is what will synthesize all the data (Plate V). After the reservoir has been characterized and the production method decided upon, it is indispensable to ascertain the most effective ways of operating. In this area, the technical mastery sought after aims to reduce the cost-to-quantities produced ratio while ensuring environmental protection, for example such as replacing oil-base <b>driling</b> fluids by nonpolluting fluids. Achieving optimum production at less cost will require better use of the processing capacities already in place. This will be achieved by the development of multiphase production, in particular for marginal or deep offshore fields. Concerning new production systems and within a context in which oil companies are seeking to exploit marginal fields and deep-water discoveries under the best possible economic conditions, the Nomad project (Plate VI) for multiphase evacuation via a light floating support seems to be destined for a great future. To decrease costs, another alternative is to use automated and unmanned installations. Gas transportation often entails the constraint of exorbitant costs, thus compromising the competitivity of gas projects. This is especially the case for the international transport of natural gas in the form of LNG, which will expand in the most competitive markets only if decisive technological progress is achieved so as to bring about a substantial decrease in costs throughout the entire LNG chain. Lastly, the chemical conversion of natural gas into fuels or petrochemical base stocks may be considered as an alternative solution to liquefaction for production from gas fields very far away from the consumer markets. For both economic and environmental reasons, natural gas appears to be the best possible base stock for manufacturing synthetic fuels. All in all, scientific and technological progress required for the increasing of economically exploitable reserves, for gaining greater accessibility to oil and gas resources, and to better target use of energy in the face of environmental production, require an appreciable increase in research efforts. Such a policy is inconcevable without having recourse to more widespread partnership and without incentives and substantial financing by both French and European public authorities...|$|E
