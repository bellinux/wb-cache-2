40|$|Experiments {{with early}} entry light sawing of Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) contraction joints began in Iowa in 1989. Since that time, changes in early sawing equipment have occurred {{as well as}} changes in specifications for sawing. The option to use early sawing for transverse contraction joints was specified in 1992. A problem happening occasionally with early sawing was the break out {{of some of the}} concrete around the end of the joint as the saw blade approached the edge of the slab. To prevent this, it was proposed that the sawing would terminate approximately 1 / 2 " to 3 / 4 " before the edge of the slab, creating a "short joint". This procedure would also leave a concrete "dam" to prevent the run-out and waste of the hot liquid joint sealant onto the shoulder. It would also eliminate the need for the labor and material for applying a duct tape dam at the open ends of each sawed joint to stop hot liquid sealant run-out Agreements were made with the contractor to apply the "short joint" technique for 1 day of paving. The evaluation and results are compared with an adjoining control section. The research found no negative aspects from sawing the "short joint". Three specific findings were noted. They are the following: 1) No <b>joint</b> <b>end</b> "blow-out" spalls of concrete occurred. 2) The need for the duct tape dam to stop liquid sealant overflow was eliminated. 3) <b>Joint</b> <b>end</b> corner spalls appear to be caused mainly by construction shouldering operations equipment. The "short joint" sawing technique can be routinely applied to early entry sawed transverse contraction joints with expectations of only positive results...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the issue of optimal control in collaborative multi-agent systems with stochastic dynamics. The agents have a joint task {{in which they have}} to reach a number of target states. The dynamics of the agents contains additive control and additive noise, and the autonomous part factorizes over the agents. Full observation of the global state is assumed. The goal is to minimize the accumulated joint cost, which consists of integrated instantaneous costs and a <b>joint</b> <b>end</b> cost. The <b>joint</b> <b>end</b> cost expresses the joint task of the agents. The instantaneous costs are quadratic in the control and factorize over the agents. The optimal control is given as a weighted linear combination of single-agent to single-target controls. The single-agent to single-target controls are expressed in terms of diffusion processes. These controls, when not closed form expressions, are formulated in terms of path integrals, which are calculated approximately by Metropolis-Hastings sampling. The weights in the control are interpreted as marginals of a joint distribution over agent to target assignments. The structure of the latter is represented by a graphical model, and the marginals are obtained by graphical model inference. Exact inference of the graphical model will break down in large systems, and so approximate inference methods are needed. We use naive mean field approximation and belief propagation to approximate the optimal control in systems with linear dynamics. We compare the approximate inference methods with the exact solution, and we show that they can accurately compute the optimal control. Finally, we demonstrate the control method in multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics consisting of up to 80 agents that have to reach an equal number of target states...|$|E

The new roller consists of ceramic sleeve and steel shaft connected only under a small shrink fitting ratio because of the brittleness.

To analyze the coming out problem more efficiently, in this paper, the two-dimensional shrink fitted structures are considered. Then, the effects of the magnitude of load and shrink fitting ratio are investigated under large number of loading cycle. Finally, the coming out mechanism is discussed for larger number of cycles by focusing on the shear stress and displacement at the <b>joint</b> <b>end.</b> The coming out occurs when the negative shear stress is unstable.

From the perturbation theory we identify the relevant scaling of the magnetic field and of the temperature.

The beams’ transverse stiffnesses and splice joints’ rotational stiffnesses were derived from the test data.

A simple analysis was developed for splice-jointed beams and was used to predict the transverse and rotational stiffnesses determined from the test data.

30|$|Structural {{members are}} {{designed}} against the buckling {{mode of failure}} using an appropriate design standard such as the European Standard EN 1993 - 1 - 1 [26]. Linear elastic finite element analysis is not sufficient when checking {{for this type of}} failure mode and non-linear analysis must then be used. This is mainly because of the geometric imperfections and eccentricities present in the structural connections. The latter is most common for towers which are fabricated from members having an angle cross section using a single bolt or welding without the use of a gusset plate. This eccentricity in the connection induces a secondary bending moment at the <b>joint</b> <b>end</b> of the members [6, 27]. Results from actual full-scale tower tests indicate that linear static analysis is not consistent in modelling the behaviour of the structure. It is also reported that bending stresses in the members, which initially were assumed to be negligible, can be as high as the axial stresses [27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Ref. [27] gives a number of reasons why the pin joint assumption does not hold for real towers. One of the main reasons is due to the main legs normally being continuous through the joint and due to the fact that, usually, more than one bolt is used in the connections, so that they should be assumed to be semi-rigid and not pinned. The bending moments at the connections are referred to as the second-order effect.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhile {{modeling}} the trapeziometacarpal (TMC) joint for determination of tendon forces, the TMC {{has been considered}} frictionless and passive moments created by soft tissues neglected. This, however, becomes inaccurate when reaching the <b>joint</b> <b>end</b> range of motion and considering that the TMC is entirely crossed by a complex network of skin, ligaments, soft tissues, and tendons. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the passive moments with respect to joint posture in order to further include this relationship in biomechanical modeling. An experimental method was proposed to estimate in vivo a global passive moment including the sum of the actions of each passive anatomical structure. An external force was applied at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint in various directions ranging from neutral position to full extension and full adduction to full abduction. The passive moment was computed and expressed as a function of the adopted joint angles. An exponential regression was then developed to fit the experimental data and to propose a generic passive moment model. Results showed a good agreement between the proposed exponential regression model and the experimental measures. Moreover, it was shown that joint stiffness could represent more than 60 % of the net joint moment during a typical pulp grip task. These results showed the necessity to include the data in biomechanical modeling. The results may help predict more realistic tendons force especially in abduction/adduction muscles.

40|$|In this study, a novel {{design of}} {{adhesive}} single-lap joint was proposed and investigated. In this new design, load eccentricity {{as well as}} singular peel stresses in the joint interface were avoided. In fact, numerical calculations show that, in the new design, the interfacial normal stress becomes compressive in the <b>joint</b> <b>end</b> region, and the shear load is more evenly transferred over {{the length of the}} joint. Experimental results using cross-ply carbon/epoxy composites as adherends show that the strength of the new joint is significantly higher than that of the conventional single lap joint. Efforts were made to investigate effects of the four most relevant design parameters of the wavy joint on the critical interfacial stress distributions. By careful selecting the design parameters, interfacial stresses can further be optimized. Test results with unidirectional composite adherends confirm that joint strength can further be improved through careful design. In order to fully demonstrate advantage of the new wavy-lap joint over the conventional single-lap joint, fatigue tests were carried out to determine durability performance of the wavy-lap joint. Fatigue tests show that under the same loading conditions, i. e. same maximum load levels or same load percentage levels, fatigue performance of the wavy-lap joint is much better than that of the conventional single-lap joint. Further study shows that fatigue life of adhesive joint, either flat or wavy, is strongly dependent on loading frequency. This {{is due to the fact}} that FM 73 adhesive is a viscoelastic material. With the increase of frequency, fatigue lives of both joints also increase. However, the wavy joint still outperforms the flat joint at all loading frequencies. ...|$|E
40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy reform aims {{at higher}} {{international}} trade compatibility and better targeting of social, environmental and consumer concerns, while seeking {{to ensure the}} sustainable development of EU agriculture. To optimise the effectiveness. and efficiency of CAP reform options towards multi functionality implementations, tools are required to assess the impacts of agricultural production on the multiple functions of European landscapes. The Euroepan Model of European Agriculture (MEA) has a multifunctional perspective but policy makers lack multi functionality impact assessment tools. MEA-Scope will develop such a tool and thus will close the existing gap between pure ecological or social process models and sectoral macro-econometric or equilibrium models. To ensure compatibility with the MEA, a specific interpretation of multi functionality will be devised and used {{in the design of}} MEA-Scope. MEA-Scope will be spatially explicit and will perform impact assessments of agricultural land use modifications at farm and landscape level. This will be achieved by linking three existing micro-economic models that simulate different aspects of farm structure. economics, production and environmental impact. Appropriate scope and detail will be ensured by simultaneous analyses of the regional demands for multiple landscape functions and of end user information needs. DESCRIPTION OF WP 6 WP 6 : Subsidiarity, governance, and social demand issues Work package 6 will contribute to the project providing a participatory approach at two levels. Level 1 is dedicated to the regional case-study areas and aims at valuating and analysing social demand for multifunctionality. Level 2 deals with end-user involvement at EU level and therefore acts as an integrative feedback tool for the entire project. D 6. 1 Agricultural EU gouvernance structures: status/trends Here, a review of EU governance structures particularly of the EU Commission is developed. A review of academic and grey literature as well as EU administration documents will be conducted. The literature review will be complemented by a survey of 5 to 10 key-informants at EU level in order to identify upcoming trends and information demands at the prospective end user level. D 6. 2 Rules for “down-scaling” types of CAP reform measures Subtask 6. 2 combines the results of the literature and document review (D 6. 1.) with the results from CAP reform evaluation processes, and with the insights gained from the analysis of regional demand priorities for different multifunctionality aspects (D 6. 3). These sources shed light on the regionally different norms that influence the way in which CAP policy options are implemented regionally within the EU subsidiarity framework. The generation of formalised rules closes a gap in policy impact analysis that otherwise exists within the system of signal transmission from Brussels in to the European regions. D 6. 3 Case study on regional multifunctionality demand Analysis and valuation of social demand for multifunctionality will be based on the expert valuation method (EVM). EVM assumes that consumers implicitly endow public authorities with the representation of their interests in the provision of public goods, e. g. their interest in attractive landscapes. Consequently, consumers delegate all decisions to a principal. In turn, the principal has to carry out a formal valuation procedure in order to assess and fulfil the demand of the consumer. The EVM process therefore includes principals, or “experts” respectively with close regional ties to their consumer “constituency”. EVM will be performed in 4 case-study regions. In order to consider the potential differences in the demand for multifunctionality, and to cover the European dimension of the project DE, IT, DK and PL will be chosen for EVM case-studies. EVM will be conducted in two steps analogue to the well known Delphi-Method. Step one comprises a semi-structured survey of approximately 20 regional experts (case-study level). There will be regional decision-makers to be surveyed as well as experts form regional administration authorities, farmers associations, nature conservation organisations, tourist offices, parties etc. Step two will confront the experts with the group results gained in step one and will generate conclusions and orders of magnitude (priorities) to regional social demand for multifunctionality. The case study surveys will include a gender dimension to account for genderspecific perceptions and demands regarding land use and settlement in rural areas. D 6. 4 End user workshops Subtask 6. 4 will first of all identify relevant end-users on the EU level. End users will participate in subtask 6. 4 in a series of three workshops. The first workshop will focus on the end users’ information needs, requirements and EU policy priorities with respect to MEA-Scope. The outcome allows (a) for outlining the most relevant CAP reform scenarios for which multifunctional impact assessments are needed, and (b) for the definition of technical specifications of the MEA-Scope tool, particularly with respect to the functions/indicators to be covered. A second workshop will be conducted to evaluate and to discuss the mid-term project results. The aim of this workshop is to identify potential needs for project adjustments on the one side. On the other side, this workshop will formulate tentative suggestions for policy recommendations that can will make the MEA-compatible multifunctionality interpretation (conceptually developed at WP 2) more tangible. Recommendations may include preferred institutional arrangements as well as modifications to existing or planned CAP policy measures. A third workshop will bring the integration process of the project results to a first climax as the integration is performed as a <b>joint</b> <b>end</b> user-project scientist policy impact analysis. By outlining the potential policy consequences of the MEA-Scope findings at the EU level, the development of a targeted policy model is further enhanced...|$|E
