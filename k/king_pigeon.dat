[Polynesia.]--The {{savage and}} cannibal Fijians were no {{exceptions}} to the general rule, for Dr. Seemann wrote me word that they make pets of the flying fox (bat), the lizard, and parroquet. Captain Wilkes, in his exploring expedition (ii. 122), says the pigeon in the Samoon islands [...] "is commonly kept as a plaything, and particularly by the chiefs. One of our officers unfortunately on one occasion shot a pigeon, which caused great commotion, for the bird was a <b>king</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and to kill it was thought as great a crime as to take {{the life of a}} man." ...|$|E

25|$|For {{these three}} {{missions}} that Commando conducted, {{he received the}} PDSA Dickin Medal, which {{is considered to be}} the animals' medal equivalent to the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for bravery in the UK. He received the award along with Royal Blue, the <b>King's</b> <b>pigeon</b> from the Royal Lofts at Sandringham. They were both presented their awards on 12 April 1945 in London by Rear Admiral R. M. Bellairs. The citation for the award that Commando received is as follows.|$|R
5000|$|Josef Crosby {{joined forces}} with Victor Gagnon, {{formerly}} of Seven Nations, to create <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Kings</b> in 2017. Their first show was at Celtic Fling in PA June 2017 (the first year Scythian was not invited back to play since 2006). Check them out here: <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Kings</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|Note that Kapotasana, {{without the}} [...] "Raja" [...] prefix {{is an entirely}} {{different}} pose and the two are easily confused. Salamba Kapotasana is a misnomer and should be called Salama Rajakapotasana instead. <b>King</b> <b>Pigeon</b> and Pigeon are different poses.|$|E
50|$|A pose {{from the}} Ashtanga {{tradition}} is an advanced asana which resembles Chakrasana, or Wheel Pose. The shins and forearms {{are on the}} ground, the front body stretched upwards in the air. The pose is reached by going into a backbend with knees on the ground. It requires flexibility to bring the head back until it reaches the ground. Kapotasana is an asana which helps {{to open up the}} chest and also strengthens the back and groin. It opens and increases the flexibility of the hips, at the same time strengthening the back, and stretching the thighs and the groin.There is another pose sometimes referred to as pigeon pose, but is actually properly referred to as <b>King</b> <b>Pigeon</b> or Rajakapotasana They are two very different poses, and <b>King</b> <b>Pigeon</b> has different variations as well. One bent leg is out front, with the shin perpendicular, parallel {{to the front of the}} mat. The other leg is stretched out straight behind. The body is held upright and the back foot may be held in a hand, or in the crook of the elbow. The chest may also be folded over the front leg.|$|E

5000|$|Yasin {{published}} three poetry collections: First Love, Crying {{from the}} Heart, and Come on, Children. His short story [...] "The Blue Pigeon" [...] is a first-person narrative from the point-of-view {{of a blue}} <b>pigeon</b> <b>king</b> captured by <b>pigeons</b> of another color; he commits suicide rather than live his life in confinement. The Ministry of State Security objected to the story in part because blue is the color used by some factions of the Uighur independence movement. The story appeared in the Kashgar Literary Journal, a magazine based in Kashgar, Xinjiang. Yasin was arrested a month later.|$|R

40|$|About 120 {{pairs of}} American <b>king</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{were used to}} {{investigate}} the effect of olanzapine on laying interval. Olanzapine {{was added to the}} basal diet of 720 days old pigeon breeders at the level of 0, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 25 mg kg - 1, respectively. During 60 days of treatment, laying interval of 0. 75 and 1. 25 % group decreased significantly by 37. 46 and 29. 83 % (p< 0. 05), respectively. This change was accompanied by significantly elevated plasma FSH and progesterone levels whereas declined PRL levels and diminished Prolactin Receptor (PRLR) mRNA expression in liver of olanzapine-treated pigeons. The results provided evidence that olanzapine shorten the laying intervals accompanying with changes in the secretion of hormones and expression of PRLR gene...|$|E
40|$|Toll-like {{receptor}} 7 (TLR 7) {{is activated}} by single-stranded RNA and synthetic imidazoquinoline components, and induces interferon production. In this study, we cloned the TLR 7 gene from <b>King</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba livia). The TLR 7 {{open reading frame}} is 3144 bp and encodes a 1047 -amino acid protein, consisting of a canonical TLR composition with 15 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Amino acid-inserting modifications were found at position 15 of LRR 2, LRR 11, LRR 13, and LRR 14 and position 10 of LRR 10. The tissue distribution of pigeon TLR 7 suggests that immune-associated tissues, especially the spleen and liver, have high TLR 7 expression. HEK 293 T cells transfected with pigeon TLR 7 plasmid responded to the agonist R 848, indicating a functional TLR 7 homolog. Following R 848 stimulation of pigeon peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the levels of IFN-γ, IL- 6, IL- 8, CCL 5, and IL- 10 mRNA, assessed using quantitative real-time PCR, were significantly up-regulated. After Newcastle disease virus vaccine strain LaSota inoculation and agonist R 848 injection, the level of TLR 7 mRNA in the spleen of pigeons increased significantly in the R 848 -injected group, but decreased in the LaSota-inoculated group at three day post-infection (d. p. i.). The mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly upregulated in both LaSota-inoculated and R 848 -injected groups. Triggering pigeon TLR 7 leads to robust up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, suggesting {{an important role in}} the innate immune response...|$|E
40|$|Hair {{cells were}} dissociated from the semicircular canal, utricle, lagena and saccule of white <b>king</b> <b>pigeons.</b> Type I hair cells were {{identified}} morphologically {{based on the}} ratios of neck width to cuticular plate width (NPR < 0. 72) as well as neck width to cell body width (NBR < 0. 64). The perforated patch variant of the whole-cell recording technique {{was used to measure}} electrical properties from type I hair cells. In voltage-clamp, the membrane properties of all identified type I cells were dominated by a predominantly outward potassium current, previously characterized in semicircular canal as IKI. Zero-current potential, activation, deactivation, slope conductance, pharmacologic and steady-state properties of the complex currents were not statistically different between type I hair cells of different vestibular end organs. The voltage dependence causes a significant proportion of this conductance to be active about the cell's zero-current potential. The first report of the whole-cell activation kinetics of the conductance is presented, showing a voltage dependence that could be best fit by an equation for a single exponential. Results presented here are the first data from pigeon dissociated type I hair cells from utricle, saccule and lagena suggesting that the basolateral conductances of a morphologically identified population of type I hair cells are conserved between functionally different vestibular end organs; the major conductance being a delayed rectifier characterized previously in semicircular canal hair cells as IKI...|$|R
50|$|The Brown Barrel Walk {{is an easy}} to {{moderate}} grade track half a kilometre in length that goes from Nurrewin past power lines and through rainforest and moist eucalypt forest. Birds here include superb lyrebird, pilotbird, cicadabird, logrunner, rose robin, golden whistler, <b>king</b> parrot, topknot <b>pigeon.</b> Its name derives from Eucalyptus fastigata, or brown barrel.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "missing comments" [...] trend on Scythians Facebook page {{continued}} into 2017, with fans still seeing their comments {{in support of}} Josef Crosby and <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Kings</b> being deleted or hidden. Some fans even found themselves being banned from the public Scythian Facebook page after voicing support for Crosby, and questioning why Scythian did not show their own support for their former bandmate in his new venture.|$|R
50|$|Clover Hill Road is a 3.5 {{kilometre}} track, easy grade. It {{follows a}} maintenance trail to Macquarie Rivulet and several waterfalls {{and a large}} boulder. The track goes to a parking area after 3 kilometres. The track then deteriorates near a Turpentine grove. It then comes to a dilapidated concrete causeway over the rivulet. Crossing it, it goes to Rainbow Falls and a balancing rock. The rock is about 50 metres tall and the waterfall is behind it. Birds here include white-throated treecreeper, large-billed gerygone, Bassian thrush, topknot pigeon, brown cuckoo-dove, wonga <b>pigeon,</b> <b>king</b> parrot, grey goshawk, Lewin’s honeyeater, and nocturnal spotlighting may produce a powerful or sooty owl.|$|R
50|$|The avian {{population}} here comprises a mix {{of residents}} as well as migratory birds. The birds migrate across Himalayas from Tibet, China, Europe and Siberia during winters. Some of these birds fly over 5000 km and above 8500 meters high to reach here. Some of the major migratory birds during the season are greylag goose, pintail, cotton teal, red-crested pochard, gadwall, shoveller, coot and mallard. Some major local migratory and residential birds are sarus crane, painted stork, peafowl, white ibis, dabchick, whistling teal, open-bill stork, white-necked stork, pheasant-tailed jacana, bronze winged jacana, purple moorhen, lapwing, tern, vulture, <b>pigeon,</b> <b>king</b> crow, Indian roller and bee-eater.|$|R
