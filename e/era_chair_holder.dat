30|$|Ideally, the {{competition}} for <b>ERA</b> <b>chairs</b> and new “teaming for excellence institutes” {{is accompanied by a}} restructuring of the public research system: An evaluation based on measuring performance in terms of internationally recognized publications and patents would facilitate the reallocation of unproductive research groups to academic teaching, leaving the scarce resources to the most productive researchers. The Structural funds could be used to provide infrastructure to highly productive researchers. If wisely combined, the Structural funds together with the two new European programs will enable Greece to create research institutes and universities of the highest quality.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks from}} three {{different}} angles at the royal chair of chemistry founded in 1685 {{at the university of}} Leuven. First, we consider the position of the chair within the faculty of Medicine and the university at large. Secondly, we place the chair within the context of university reforms which were a constant matter of conflict between university authorities and the government. Thirdly, we will consider the position of the <b>chair</b> <b>holders.</b> How did they define their academic status as skilled practitioners or knowledgeable experts? We argue that the introduction of the chemistry laboratory course in the medical curriculum coincided with a loss of autonomy of the chemical professors, who increasingly turned towards the scientific world outside the university. status: publishe...|$|R
