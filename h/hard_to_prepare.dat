Early products in this sphere included PowerTelnet which is comparable to today's ssh, and PowerFTP, which provided encrypted file transfer.

25|$|After {{attending}} a Dallas Mavericks-San Antonio Spurs playoff game during the Warriors' offseason, Randolph became motivated {{to improve his}} play, hitting the gym <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for the following season. Randolph's efforts first began to reward him in that year's Summer League being held in Las Vegas, Nevada where he not only began to dominate consistently but was also referred to by various sportswriters as being the best talent in the entire Summer League. Among other highlights, including a then-Summer League record tying 42-point explosion in game four against the Chicago Bulls' Summer League team, Randolph was invited to attend the USA Basketball Men's National Team mini-camp following his dominant Summer League performance. Though many believed Randolph was a lock to win Summer League MVP, the honor was given to 2009 first overall pick Blake Griffin. On October 14, 2009 the Warriors extended Randolph's contract through the 2010–11 NBA season.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} season opener, Rita and Dexter are living happily {{together}} in a suburban neighborhood with Astor, Cody, and new baby Harrison. In [...] "Remains to be Seen" [...] Dexter is in a terrible car accident, and Rita demands that he give her his keys {{so that she can}} drive him. In [...] "If I Had a Hammer," [...] friction begins to develop in the couple's relationship, and Dexter seeks guidance from Arthur Mitchell (John Lithgow), a family man who appears to balance his responsibilities with his secret life as the [...] "Trinity Killer". In [...] "Hungry Man," [...] Rita works <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> Thanksgiving dinner. She shares a kiss with the next door neighbor, Elliot Larson (Rick Peters), when she asks if she can use his stove. Dexter arrives for an appointment with Rita for marriage counseling, but gets called to a crime scene as soon as he arrives. Soon after, Rita confesses that she and Elliot kissed, although Dexter tries to brush it off. Rita later admits that she felt hurt that he did not seem to care about her indiscretion. Dexter then punches Elliot and warns him to stay away from Rita, which reassures her that Dexter loves her. In the fourth season finale, Dexter asks her to go out of town so they can have a belated honeymoon; in reality, Dexter wants to keep her safe from Mitchell, who has learned his real identity and threatened to kill him and his family. After killing Mitchell, Dexter returns home and finds a message from Rita that she returned to pick up her identification for the flight. Dexter finds her dead in the bathtub [...] Mitchell's last victim. In the fifth season premiere [...] "My Bad", Dexter realizes, much to his own surprise, that he genuinely loved Rita and is devastated by her death. Julie Benz reprised her role as Rita as a special guest star in a flashback to her and Dexter's first date, and as a corpse.|$|E

Although Barrington saw that the training facilities and grounds were poor compared to those in England he praised the New Zealanders for their efforts, but Boycott constantly complained and annoyed many locals who had worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for the England team's arrival. He became the first England captain to lose a Test to New Zealand when he put them in to bat in the First Test and saw England collapse to 64 all out in the last innings. Boycott made 1 and the other players resented his comments that they played like schoolboys. In the Second Test Barrington with the backing of the players told Boycott to declare so that England would have a chance of winning and by dismissing New Zealand for 105 they squared the series. The Third Test was drawn, but by arguing with Barrington in public and berating the New Zealand press corps Boycott made certain he would not be made England captain again. On their return to England Brearley soon resumed his role and Willis was made vice-captain; [...] "No manager worked harder on behalf of his players nor was better appreciated. Certainly no player on that tour that I spoke to would dissent from this view".|$|E

40|$|Unsymmetric Schiff base {{complexes}} {{have attracted}} more attention {{in recent years}} due to their diverse effects in catalytic reactions. Due to their high dissymmetry, unsymmetric metallosalen complexes are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> than symmetric ones. This means that X-ray crystallographic structural determination is sometimes unavailable, so their absolute configurations are determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy instead. Herein, some quadridentate unsymmetric metallosalen nickel(l]) complexes were synthesized and their structures were characterized by CD spectra. An empirical rule for assignment of the absolute configurations of tetra-coordinated pseudo-planar Ni(II) complexes was put forward. Furthermore, a fingerprint was found to judge whether the metallosalen complexes are symmetric or unsymmetric. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|In 2009, 14. 5 {{percent of}} {{students}} in New York State graduated high school with a local diploma. The State {{is in the process}} of phasing out the local diploma as an option, requiring students to achieve the more rigorous Regents diploma or drop out and seek their General Educational Development (GED) diploma. For now, students with disabilities have the additional possibility of leaving school with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) diploma, which is basically a certificate of achievement that carries few of the benefits of the other graduation credentials. Policy makers reason that without the local diploma to fall back on, schools will push <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> more students <b>to</b> qualify for the Regents diploma and thereby graduate young adults who are better equipped to succeed in higher education and the job market. What will happen to the young people who previously depended on the local diploma to graduate from high school? Will they be able to achieve the more challenging Regents diploma? Or will they be left behind? And would they have derived any benefit from the local diploma in the first place? In this paper, we explore the potential loss of opportunity that individual students are likely to experience as a result of the phasing out of the local diploma. We first explain the current diploma options available in New York State and identify the demographic profile for each type of diploma. We then provide a closer look at nine students who graduated with a local diploma in recent years and what would have happened, from their perspectives, if the local diploma had not been available. We conclude by urging the State to develop pathways to graduation for struggling students, particularly students who are unable to pass the Regents exams...|$|R
5000|$|The above {{explanation}} for self-branding {{can be summarized}} by Sirgy's self-congruity theory. It is proposed that consumer behavior is partially determined by the similarity between consumers' psychological comparisons of the brand-user-image. This self-congruity affects consumption behavior of consumers through motives such as need for self-consistency (e.g. [...] "I am a good student because I work <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for examinations and I always get good grades") and self-esteem. On the other hand, high self-congruity occurs when the consumers find appropriate match between their own self-image and the brand-image. Only high self-congruity would help consumers maintain and enhance self in a positive direction. Further from the above notions, high self-congruity will lead to positive attitudes towards the brand and repeated purchase ...|$|E
50|$|Bacterial {{artificial}} chromosomes (BACs) are circular DNA molecules, {{usually about}} 7kb in length, that {{are capable of}} holding inserts up to 300kb in size. BAC vectors contain a replicon derived from E. coli F factor, which ensures they are maintained at one copy per cell. Once an insert is ligated into a BAC, the BAC is introduced into recombination deficient strains of E. coli by electroporation. Most BAC vectors contain a gene for antibiotic resistance and also a positive selection marker. The figure to the right depicts a BAC vector being cut with a restriction enzyme, followed by the insertion of foreign DNA that is re-annealed by a ligase.
