40|$|SUMMARY To {{realize the}} {{harmonious}} {{cooperation with the}} operator, the man-machine cooperative system must be designed so as to accommodate with {{the characteristics of the}} operator’s skill. One of the important considerations in the skill analysis is to investigate the switching mechanism underlying the skill dynamics. On the other hand, the combination of the feedfor-ward and feedback schemes has been proved to work successfully in the modeling of human skill. In this paper, a new stochas-tic switched skill model for the sliding task, wherein a minimum <b>jerk</b> <b>motion</b> and feedback schemes are embedded in the differ-ent discrete states, is proposed. Then, the parameter estimation algorithm for the proposed switched skill model is derived.

6000|$|The boys nudged elbows while Mose {{threw the}} saddle on the cringing brute and cinched it till the pinto, full of suffering, drew great, quiet gulps {{of breath and}} groaned. Swift, practiced, relentless, Mose dragged at the latigo till the wide hair web {{embedded}} itself in the pony's hide. Having coiled the rope neatly out of the way, while the broncho stood with drooping head but with a dull red flame in his eyes, Mose flung the rein over the pony's head. Then pinto woke up. With a mighty sidewise bound he attempted to leave his rider, but Mose, studiedly imperturbable, with left hand holding the reins and right hand grasping the pommel, went with him {{as if that were}} the ordinary way of mounting. Immense power was in the stiff-legged leaping of the beast. His body seemed a ball of coiled steel springs. His [...] "watch-eye" [...] rolled in frenzy. It seemed he wished to beat his head against his rider's face and kill him. He rushed away with a rearing, <b>jerking</b> <b>motion,</b> in a series of jarring bounds, snapping his rider like the lash of a whip, then stopped suddenly, poised on his fore feet, with devilish intent to discharge Mose over his head. With the spurs set deep into the quivering painted hide of his mount Mose began plying the quirt like a flail. The boys cheered and yelled with delight. It was one of their chief recreations, this battle with a pitching broncho.|$|E
60|$|I {{made many}} {{excursions}} into the country, {{in search of}} a good station for collecting birds and insects. Some of the villages a few miles inland are scattered about in woody ground which has once been virgin forest, but of which the constituent trees have been for the most part replaced by fruit trees, and particularly by the large palm, Arenga saccharifera, from which wine and sugar are made, and which also produces a coarse black fibre used for cordage. That necessary of life, the bamboo, has also been abundantly planted. In such places I found a good many birds, among which were the fine cream-coloured pigeon, Carpophaga luctuosa, and the rare blue-headed roller, Coracias temmincki, which has a most discordant voice, and generally goes in pairs, flying from tree to tree, and exhibiting while at rest that all-in-a-heap appearance and <b>jerking</b> <b>motion</b> of the head and tail which are so characteristic of the great Fissirostral group to which it belongs. From this habit alone, the kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, trogons, and South American puff-birds, might be grouped together by a person who had observed them in a state of nature, but who had never had an opportunity of examining their form and structure in detail. Thousands of crows, rather smaller than our rook, keep up a constant cawing in these plantations; the curious wood-swallows (Artami), which closely resemble swallows in their habits and flight but differ much in form and structure, twitter from the tree-tops; while a lyre-tailed drongo-shrike, with brilliant black plumage and milk-white eyes, continually deceives the naturalist by the variety of its unmelodious notes.|$|E

50|$|A type of {{abnormal}} behavior shown in captive animals is self-injurious behavior (SIB). Self-injurious behavior indicates any activity that involves biting, scratching, hitting, hair plucking, or eye poke {{that may result}} in injuring oneself. Although its reported incidence is low, self-injurious behavior is observed {{across a range of}} primate species, especially when they experience social isolation in infancy. Self-bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the arms, legs, shoulders, or genitals. Threat bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the hand, wrist, or forearm—while staring at the observer, conspecific, or mirror in a threatening manner. Self-hit involves striking oneself on any part of the body. Eye poking is a behavior (widely observed in primates) that presses the knuckle or finger into the orbital space above the eye socket. Hair plucking is a <b>jerking</b> <b>motion</b> applied to one’s own hair with hands or teeth, resulting in its excessive removal.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of the jerk vector and the resulting curvature and torsion are investigated in the motion of a charged particle under the influence uniform of electric and magnetic fields. It is shown that a uniform electric field, by itself, does not produce jerk and hence cannot create torsion. It produces curvature if the initial velocity of the charged particle has a component perpendicular to the electric field. A uniform magnetic field, on the other hand, produces <b>jerk</b> <b>motion,</b> and curvature and torsion of constant magnitudes. The perpendicular and parallel components of the initial velocity of the particle {{are responsible for the}} curvature and torsion, respectively. When electric and magnetic fields parallel with one another are present, they both contribute to curvature and torsion. The path is a helix which is continuously being stretched out. As a result, both curvature and torsion approach zero as time progresses...|$|R
5000|$|A quarry in Wales {{was used}} for the {{location}} of Rimmer's death-day opening scene for the episode. [...] The live action footage of the scene was merged with model footage of Blue Midget and Red Dwarf, which was seen in the distant background. During the pre-record filming of the episode, Craig Charles's then-wife was giving birth to their son Jack; Craig filmed the scenes where Lister's face was visible as quickly as possible and then rushed away to be at the birth of his son (arriving twenty minutes late). The remainder of location shooting, in which Lister was wearing a space-suit, had production manager Mike Agnew as the double for Lister. But in fact the plaster cast couldn't fit Agnew's foot as he had bigger feet than Craig Charles — {{a close look at the}} episode would reveal that there are several frames in the episode where neither the Cat nor Lister (stood in by Agnew) had casts.

5000|$|For small arms, the way {{in which}} the shooter {{perceives}} the recoil, or kick, can have a significant impact on the shooter's experience and performance. For example, a gun that is said to [...] "kick like a mule" [...] is going to be approached with trepidation, and the shooter may anticipate the recoil and flinch in anticipation as the shot is released. This leads to the shooter jerking the trigger, rather than pulling it smoothly, and the <b>jerking</b> <b>motion</b> is almost certain to disturb the alignment of the gun and may result in a miss. The shooter may also be physically injured by firing a weapon generating recoil in excess of what the body can safely absorb or restrain; perhaps getting hit in the eye by the rifle scope, hit in the forehead by a handgun as the elbow bends under the force, or soft tissue damage to the shoulder, wrist and hand; and these results vary for individuals. In addition, as pictured on the right, excessive recoil can create serious range safety concerns, if the shooter cannot adequately restrain the firearm in a down-range direction.|$|E

A nicely balanced propeller will spin just fine and it actually is not critical to have it heavy to one side, because the hole diameter always allows one side (slightly longer) to drop during the <b>jerking</b> <b>motion</b> which occurs. To observe the effect, the propeller attached {{to the end of the}} ribbed stick must not be pinned at its exact centre of mass, i.e. off-center or loose. For a functioning whammy diddle, there should be a [...] "preferred" [...] angle (i.e. when stationary, if the propeller is rotated around its axis and then released, it should return to its lowest-energy rest angle relative to the ribbed stick.)

2500|$|Snagging, the {{indiscriminate}} {{taking of}} fish using weighted hooks that are {{ripped through the}} water with quick <b>jerking</b> <b>motions,</b> was controversially outlawed on the Salmon River in the early 1990s. It had previously been argued that snagging was ethical due to the difficulty in enticing Chinook and coho salmon to strike, as these fish die after spawning and do not feed once they enter the river. However, proponents of the snagging ban noted that the river also contained several species that survive beyond their spawning seasons, such as steelhead, brown trout and Atlantic salmon; snagging could not possibly avoid impacting these fish as well. In addition, snagging opponents claimed that the practice was unethical as it violated the doctrine of [...] "fair chase", and noted that snagging was associated with both injuries and problematic behavior, such as littering, the targeting of fish merely to harvest their eggs for profit, and fistfights among anglers.|$|R

40|$|In {{planning}} an s-curve speed profile {{for a computer}} numerical control (CNC) machine, centripetal acceleration and its derivative have to be considered. In a CNC machine, these quantities dictate how much voltage and current should be applied to servo motor windings. In this paper, the necessity of considering centripetal jerk in speed profile generation especially in the look-ahead mode is explained. It is demonstrated that the magnitude of centripetal jerk {{is proportional to the}} curvature derivative of the path known as "sharpness". It is also explained that a proper limited <b>jerk</b> <b>motion</b> is only possible when a G 2 -continuous machining path is planned. Then using a simplified mathematical representation of clothoids, a novel method for approximating a given path with a sequence of clothoid segments is proposed. Using this method, a semi-parallel G 2 -continuous path with adjustable deviation from the original shape for a sample machining contour is generated. Maximum permissible feed rate for the generated path is also calculated...|$|R
