The major problems for these modules are concentration polarization and subsequent fouling. By using gas-liquid two-phase flow, these {{problems can be}} ameliorated. This thesis aimed to optimize the use of gas-liquid two-phase flow as a cleaning mechanism for <b>submerged</b> <b>flat</b> sheet membrane. The effect of various hydrodynamic factors such as airflow rate, nozzle size, nozzle geometry, intermittent bubbling, intermittent filtration, channel gap width, feed concentration and membrane baffles were investigated for model feed materials (yeast suspensions and mixed liquor from activated sludge plants). Insights into mechanisms by which two-phase flow reduces fouling for <b>submerged</b> <b>flat</b> sheet membranes were obtained by using Computational Fluid Dynamics. Experiments conducted showed that an optimal airflow rate exists beyond which no further flux enhancement was achieved. Fouling reduction increased with nozzle size at constant airflow. Nozzles of equal surface area but different geometries performed differently in terms of fouling reduction. Bubble size distribution analyses revealed {{that the percentage of}} larger bubbles and bubble rise velocities increased with the airflow rate and nozzle size. Thus {{the results of this study}} suggest that the effectiveness of two-phase flow depends on the bubble size. CFD simulations revealed that average shear stress on the membrane increased with airflow rate and bubble size and further indicated that an optimal bubble size possible exists. Using intermittent filtration as an operating strategy was found to be more beneficial than continuous filtration. This study also showed the importance of the size of the gap between the <b>submerged</b> <b>flat</b> sheet membranes. Increasing the gap from 7 mm to 14 mm resulted in an increase in fouling by about 40 % based on the rate of increase in suction pressure (dTMP/dt). Finally, this is the first study which investigated the effect of baffles in improving air distribution across a <b>submerged</b> <b>flat</b> sheet membrane. It was found that baffles decreased the rate of fouling at least by a factor of 3. 0 based on the dTMP/dt data...|$|R

Guyots are most commonly found in the Pacific Ocean. Guyots show evidence of having been above the surface with gradual subsidence through stages from fringed reefed mountain, coral atoll, and finally a <b>flat</b> topped <b>submerged</b> mountain. The steepness gradient of most guyots is about 20 degrees. To technically be considered a guyot or tablemount, they must stand at least 914 m tall. [...] However, there are many undersea mounts that can range from just less than 91 m to around 914 m. [...] Very large oceanic volcanic constructions, hundreds of km across, are called oceanic plateaus. Seamounts are made by extrusion of lavas piped upward in stages from sources within the Earth's mantle to vents on the seafloor. Seamounts provide data on movements of tectonic plates on which they ride, and on the rheology of the underlying lithosphere. The trend of a seamount chain traces the direction of motion of the lithospheric plate over {{a more or less}} fixed heat source in the underlying asthenosphere part of the Earth's mantle. There are thought to be up to an estimated 50,000 seamounts in the Pacific basin.

Depending on the value of psi_ 0, the momentum per incident photon picked up by the mirror covers the range between the Abraham and Minkowski values, i. e., the interval (2 _ 0 /nc, 2 n_ 0 /c). Here ħ is the reduced Planck constant, w_ 0 is the frequency of the incident photon, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. We argue that a simple experimental setup involving a dielectric slab of refractive index n, a vibrating mirror placed a short distance behind the slab, a collimated, monochromatic light beam illuminating the mirror through the slab, and an interferometer to measure the phase of the reflected beam, is all that is needed to deduce the precise magnitude of the radiation {{pressure on}} a submerged mirror. In the proposed experiment, the transparent slab plays the role of the submerging liquid (even though it remains detached from the mirror at all times), and the adjustable gap between the mirror and the slab simulates the variable phase-angle psi_ 0. The phase of the reflected beam, measured as a function of time during one oscillation period of the mirror, then provides the information needed to determine the gap-dependence of the reflected beam's Doppler shift and, consequently, the radiation pressure experienced by the mirror.

40|$|The Chattian-Aquitanian {{carbonate}} {{system of}} Isili sub-basin (SE Sardinia, Italy) were studied {{to better understand}} the hydrodynamic processes controlling the formation of landward-downlapping, rhodolith-rich, giant clinoforms. The studied flat-topped platform was attached to an island (semi-isolated) and migrated onshore (landward) over a shallow marine, protected embayment. The depositional profile is characterized by four, sea to land, zones: seaward slope, flat-topped platform (<b>submerged</b> <b>flat),</b> landward slope and mixed siliciclastic-carbonate embayment. In particular, these zones record different levels, from high to moderate, of hydrodynamic energy and persistency. The paleodepth of the studied succession, based on T/D test on Amphistegina specimens, red-algal genera and geometric reconstruction of the overall system, ranges from 10 to 30 m for the platform up to around 40 m for the landward slope base. Thus, the flat-topped platform was permanently submerged and an extensive carbonate (sea grass, algal and bryozoan-algal) factory along with oyster framestones developed. The widespread presence in the barren zones of rhodolith-to-shell rich small to very small compound dunes (high-energy zone) suggests that the flat-topped platform was periodically swept by unidirectional, landward-directed currents. These currents allow the formation of large-scale, rhodolith-rich clinobeds along the landward slope (washover fan-like system). The presence of rodolith pavements developed along the flat-topped platform at or slightly below the fairweather wave base suggests that clinobeds were formed in a nearshore, shallow subtidal setting. Finally, the shallow marine, protected embayment (moderate-energy zone) represents the widening distal reaches of the currents flowing or along the clinoforms or from the coast basinward (river floods and/or ebb tidal currents). Despite few tidal-related sedimentary structures such as bi-directional ripples and small compound dunes separated by finer-grained "drapes" or reactivation surfaces were observed, the prevailing processes acting over the platform are unidirectional, landward-directed currents possibly associated with longshore currents and/or wave actions. However, the resultant migration of the whole system onshore (landward) cannot be easily explained with storm or wind-related processes. Thus the studied flat-topped platform seems to be controlled by long term tidal regulation within a meso to macro tidal regime. In particular, such meso/macro tidal environments experience multiannual to multidecennial phases of stronger/weaker tidal range fluctuations resembling periods of relatively sea highs and lows with respect to the mean sea level (0 m). All the (wind, storm, wave and tidal) currents sweeping the flat-topped platform were maxima during phases of strong tidal fluctuations generating erosion and sediment transportation over the flat and accumulation on the landward slope (clinobeds). Conversely, during phases of weaker tidal range fluctuations overall currents were minima, clinoforms did not develop and factories widespread re-colonized the <b>submerged</b> <b>flat.</b> Therefore, the studied platform developed in a current-dominated and tidal modulated setting. Finally, the studied carbonates of Sardinia suggest that the Sardinian seaway and the incipient Provencal basin during the Chattian-Aquitanian were, locally, capable to generate meso to macro tidal conditions...|$|R

Experiments were conducted with a <b>flat</b> sheet membrane <b>submerged</b> in a suspension prepared from kaolin clay powder of size varying from 0. 1 to 4 mm (Sigma) with a mean particle size 2. 10 mm. The particle size distribution of clay was unimodal and the concentration of kaolin clay {{was similar to the}} biomass concentration in a membrane bioreactor (10 g/L). The effects of scouring and permeate flux rates were studied in terms of the membrane fouling rate. A linear relationship between the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and particle deposition was established for different air flow rates and permeate flow rates. Air scouring was more effective at a low permeate flux. There was only a minor change in the mean particle size of deposited colloidal particles on the membrane at a given flux under varying air flows and at the beginning all had a similar rise in TMP. However, at the later stages as particles accumulated on the membrane surface there was a significant rise in TMP. 15 LMH flux was observed as critical flux beyond which a rise in the permeate flux showed a sharp rise in the TMP which varied with air flow rates and particle deposition. The sharp TMP rise that occurred during the initial few hours of operation indicated that air flow for fouling mitigation strategies should target this period to optimise the membrane process.

The results confirmed that at equal COD load in the influent (minimum COD:P (250 : 5) ratio for EBPR), milk always provided sufficient soluble substrate than the carbohydrate mix, but also improved the EBPR performance. The laboratory scale treated 10 L/day where 2 parallel treatment trains for milk and an equivalent carbohydrate mix as supplement to compare and study the P sequestration from hypothesised P ligands in milk and easily assimilable carbon (AOM) after fermentation for biological P uptake. The aerobic bioreactors used <b>submerged</b> <b>flat</b> sheet membranes (AeMBR) to improve the effluent quality and reduce the suspended solid residues.

40|$|Aircraft wakes ar~ {{dominated}} {{by a pair of}} strong counter-rotating vortices that give rise to the well known 'wake hazard' wherein an aircraft encountering the wake may be subjected to severe forces and moments. Eventually, naturally occurring instabilities grow and cause the breakdown of the wake vortices. The purpose of this current study is to gain a further understanding of instabilities which are supported by and develop in counter-rotating vortex pairs (vortex dipoles). Particularly, it is of importance to try to ascertain under which conditions such instabilities develop and grow and whether it is possible to promote their occurrence by means that could bOe practically implemented on an aircraft. Also ofinterest is whether there are conditions under which such instabilities may not occur. This research is mainly of an experimental nature in which the studies are conducted using water as a medium. A rig has been designed and built to generate a pair of counter rotating vortices in a water tank. The vortices are generated by rotating two <b>flat</b> plates <b>submerged</b> in the water. As the plates rotate, the fluid boundary layer rolls off of the plate edges and thus generates a vortex. The plates are controlled via a stepper motor and code written in LabView. Vortex strength, r, core radius, a, and separation distance between the vortex pair, h, can be controlled by rotating the plates at various angular velocities and though various angular displacements. The rig described above generates vortices with no axial velocity, besides those which occur due to end effects. In order to compare the behaviour of vortices with axial velocity to those without, experiments have also been conducted on a delta wing which was towed through a large (8 m long) water tank. The vortices have been characterised by computing a velocity field from experimental data derived using the PlY technique. Subsequent to this, the vortex characterisation parameters, circulation, r, core radius, a, and separation distance, b, were extracted by means of a least squares fit to a Lamb-Oseen vortex profile. In order to observe instabilities which may occur, the colunmar vortex centre line was mapped by means of flow visualisation using hydrogen bubbles as markers. A new data processing algorithm has been developed to extract frequencies and amplitudes of the 'wave' like vortex centre line disturbance from the flow visualisation and has provided a new insight into this phenomenon. A full discussion of the accuracy of the techniques used is given in the thesis.

Biofouling is a universal problem in almost all membrane filtration applications, leading to the decrease in flux or the increase in transmembrane pressure depending on different operation mode. Air scoring or regular membrane cleaning has been utilized for fouling mitigation, which requires increased energy consumption as well as complicated operations. Besides, repeating cleaning will trigger the deterioration of membranes and shorten their lifetime, elevating cost expenditures accordingly. In this way, GDM filtration stands out from conventional MBR technologies in a long-term operation with relative stable flux, which has been observed in many studies. The objective {{of this study was to}} monitor the biofilm development on a <b>flat</b> sheet membrane <b>submerged</b> in a GDM reactor with constant gravitational pressure. Morphology of biofilm layer in a fixed position was acquired by an in-situ and on-line OCT (optical coherence tomography) scanning at regular intervals for both visual investigation and structure analysis. The calculated thickness and roughness were compared to the variation of flux, fouling resistance and permeate quality, showing expected consistency. At the end of experiment, the morphology of entire membrane surface was scanned and recorded by OCT. Membrane autopsy was carried out for biofilm composition analysis by total organic carbon (TOC) and liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD). In addition, biomass concentration was obtained by flow cytometer and adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) method. The data of biofilm components indicated a homogeneous biofilm structure formed after a long-term running of the GDM system, based on the morphology observation by OCT images. The superiority of GDM in both flux maintaining and long-term operation with production of high quality effluent was demonstrated, as well as the suitability of OCT for biofouling monitoring was emphasized...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{organic matter}} decomposition in permeable sediment of a sloping intertidal sand flat (German Wadden Sea) affected by current-induced pore water exchange and pore fluid drainage. Seasonal and spatial scales of aerobic and anaerobic mineralization were investigated at 2 sites, one {{near the water}} line {{and one on the}} upper flat. Hydrodynamic forcing during inundation caused deeper oxygen penetration through flushing of the uppermost sediment layer. This flushing resulted in higher areal oxygen consumption rates and lower depth integrated sulfate reduction rates in the <b>submerged</b> <b>flat</b> compared to the rates measured during exposure. Mineralization rates in the top 15 cm of the sediment were similar between both study sites and ranged from 38 (winter) to 280 mmol C m– 2 d– 1 (summer), with sulfate reduction contributing 3 to 25 % to total mineralization, depending on the season. At the upper flat, these seasonal differences were reflected in the pore water concentrations of nutrients, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Near the low water line, however, pore water nutrient and DIC concentrations were independent of the season and up to 15 times higher compared to the values recorded in the upper flat. The differences in concentrations of metabolic products between the 2 sites resulted from a low tide drainage extending deep below the uppermost flushed layer and causing seepage of pore water near the low water line. Mineralization and nutrient release in these permeable intertidal sediments is affected by 2 circulation processes that work on distinctly different temporal and spatial scales: (1) rapid ‘skin circulation’ through the uppermost sediment layer during inundation that is characterized by short flow paths, low pore water residence time and immediate feedback to the ecosystem, and (2) slow ‘body circulation’ through deeper sediment layers during low tide that is characterized by long flow paths and pore water residence times, and acts as a buffered nutrient source to the ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|Biofouling {{represents}} {{the main problem}} in membrane filtration systems. Biofouling arises when the biomass growth negatively impacts the membrane performance parameters (i. e. flux decrease and feed channel pressure drop). Most of the available techniques for characterization of biofouling involve membrane autopsies, providing information ex-situ destructively {{at the end of}} the process. OCT, is non-invasive imaging technique, able to acquire scans in-situ and non-destructively. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of OCT as in-situ and non-destructive tool to gain a better understanding of biofouling behavior in membrane filtration systems. The OCT was employed to study the fouling behavior in two different membrane configurations: (i) <b>submerged</b> <b>flat</b> sheet membrane and (ii) spacer filled channel. Through the on-line acquisition of OCT scans and the study of the biomass morphology, it was possible to relate the impact of the fouling on the membrane performance. The on-line monitoring of biofilm formation on a flat sheet membrane was conducted in a gravity-driven submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) for 43 d. Four different phases were observed linking the variations in permeate flux with changes in biofilm morphology. Furthermore, the biofilm morphology was used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to better understand the role of biofilm structure on the filtration mechanisms. The time-resolved OCT analysis was employed to study the biofouling development at the early stage. Membrane coverage and average biofouling layer thickness were found to be linearly correlated with the permeate flux pattern. An integrated characterization methodology was employed to characterize the fouling on a flat sheet membrane, involving the use of OCT as first step followed by membrane autopsies, revealing the presence of a homogeneous layer on the surface. In a spacer filled channel a 3 D OCT time series analysis of biomass development under representative conditions for a spiral-wound membrane element was performed. Biomass accumulation was stronger on the feed spacer during the early stage, impacting the feed channel pressure drop more than the permeate flux. OCT biofilm thickness map was presented as new tool to evaluate the biofouling development in membrane filtration systems through the use of a false color scale...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{the use of}} {{membrane}} filtration process is rapidly increasing in industrial fields, especially {{in the field of}} water and wastewater treatment. Aeration {{is one of the most}} important processes in MBR systems. The cost of aeration is the main operating cost. It can provide the biomass with oxygen and prevent them from settling down. Besides, the shear stress created by the aeration process can scour the solid from the membrane surface to control the growth of cake layer and increase the filtration flux. At the same time computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become a leading modeling and analysis tool for fluid simulation because of its advances in computational performance. Recently more and more studies have used CFD techniques to investigate and model the fluid flow through a membrane module and to study the membrane performance. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the shear stress on the membrane plate induced by a single bubble in the MBR system. A better understanding of the shear stress caused by aeration in MBR, which depend greatly on operating conditions and bubble size, can be achieved by using numerical simulation. This thesis focuses on the operation conditions, bubble sizes and the geometry of the membrane models etc. as well as their influence on shear stress. The thesis firstly introduces the basics of membrane and CFD as well as the model theories. Then a model for simulation of the membrane systems is established and its independence on the mesh size and model geometry was tested. Experiments for validation are conducted. The results of this simulation and the results from the experiments and from literature are presented and compared. Finally in models with an appropriate geometry, an appropriate mesh size and most importantly reliable results, different simulations are carried out to simulate the bubble formation, to investigate the effect of different parameters on the bubble motion, to study what affects the shear stress and shear force, especially in the escape zone, where the bubble moves out of the gap between the <b>submerged</b> <b>flat</b> sheet membranes. The novel of this study lies in the flexibility of membranes. The membrane in almost all CFD simulations for membrane in previous studies was set as rigid wall. In the last part of this thesis, the membrane was set to be flexible. A two-way system coupling was applied for the simulation of the membrane movement and the rise of the bubble. At first the formation of bubbles was studied. The amount of gas injected into the water, the way it is injected (continued aeration and discontinued aeration), the inlet configurations and the inlet velocity of the gas determine the bubble shape and size. Then it was found out that the bubble size has a very powerful impact on the bubble motion and shear stress exerted by rising bubbles. An increase in bubble size leads to an increase in maximal shear stress, which also means an increase in cleaning effect on the membrane surface in the filtration. When the bubble size is larger than the gap width, this cleaning effect is no longer that much significant. As for the bubble rising velocity, it reaches its maximal value at a bubble diameter of 5 mm, above which, the wall effect of the membrane makes the bubble slow down. This effect was more significant for the bubbles, whose diameter is larger than the channel gap of membranes. For these bubbles a slug flow could be observed, and according to their spherical-cup shape, they belong to Taylor bubbles. To identify the most effective multi-phase flow pattern for fouling control, membrane module configurations with different gap width were evaluated with CFD. The shear stress was found out to be highest at the smallest gap distance. Considering the clogging problem for small membrane gaps, it is concluded that the rise of a 5 mm bubble between the membranes with a gap of 6 mm might be the optimal conditions for the aeration during the filtration process. The fluid velocity was also investigated in this study. The averaged shear stress shows a linear dependence on the fluid velocity and the bubble motion can increase the shear stress at low fluid velocity significantly. 2 d simulation and 3 d simulation were also compared in this study. The numerical results from 3 d simulation were more reliable. At last a two-way system coupling simulation was performed to investigate the effect of membrane movement on the shear stress. It was found out that the maximal shear stress produced by membrane movement and bubble rising is more than ten times greater than that only induced by the rise of a single bubble...|$|R
