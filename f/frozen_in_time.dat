He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and {{strength}} of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn {{in the past to}} live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection. With their creator's death, both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers. Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price: Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever, while Watanuki must stay in Yūko's shop. The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in hope of finding a way to bring back the clones who still exist as the two feathers. Before departing on their separate ways, Syaoran and Sakura confess their mutually strong, close and pure romantic love for each other as they hope to meet again.|$|E

40|$|We review {{research}} {{aimed at}} {{the development of an}} analytical and numerical framework for tracking the evolution, in an incompressible viscous fluid, of scalar fields, called `vortex surface fields' (VSFs), whose instantaneous isosurfaces always contain continuous vortex lines. A set of equations describing the evolution of VSFs starting from a known initial condition is proposed and discussed. Non-uniqueness in the initial-value problem is resolved with the introduction of evolution in a pseudo-time variable where the vorticity, <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> real <b>time,</b> plays the role of an advecting field. A numerical method for following both the real and pseudo-time evolution is described and its regularization properties are discussed.

40|$|Based on {{long-term}} fieldwork in Indonesia and Tanzania, this article sheds {{new light on}} the contested relationship between tourism and cosmopolitanism. The ethnographic findings shift the attention from tourists to key service providers as those accruing most cosmopolitan capital through the tourism encounter. Local tour guides are able to use their privileged contacts with foreign visitors to develop cross-cultural competencies and to enhance their own cosmopolitan status. They substantiate the idea that cosmopolitanism is no privilege of the rich and well-connected and that physical or spatial mobility is not a necessary condition to become cosmopolitan. Paradoxically, the guides’ dreams of becoming more cosmopolitan (and more modern and Western) can only materialize if they represent to tourists their lifeworld, including themselves, as <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> both <b>time</b> and space, because it is exactly this kind of imaged and imagined difference tourism sells to tourists for the build-up of their own cosmopolitan capital. status: publishe...|$|R
500|$|Tøjner {{describes}} {{the work as}} [...] "Lichtenstein's finest formulation of a counter-image to the many explosions in his universe", noting that the drama is past its peak although it {{may seem to be}} at a crescendo. He also notes that [...] "the tears are drawn with classic Lichtenstein waxy fullness" [...] despite the surrounding water, which must be significant since [...] "naturalistic justification" [...] is absent. A November 1963 Art Magazine review stated that {{this was one of the}} [...] "broad and powerful paintings" [...] of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. Nonetheless, the name of the work was not universally known. [...] In a December 1964 Art Magazine review of his October 24– September 19, 1964 Castelli Gallery show, Lichtenstein was referred to as the author of I Don't Care, I'd Rather Sink (Drowning Girl). According to Gary Garrels of the Museum of Modern Art, the work is a [...] "poetics of the utterly banal, of displaced ordinariness" [...] resulting in an [...] "image <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and space", making it [...] "iconic". Comparing this to the source, Garrels says it is a rendering [...] "in a simplified vocabulary" [...] produced while Lichtenstein put aside his mechanical objectivity. According to The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, extreme examples of his formalization become [...] "virtual abstraction" [...] when the viewer recalls that the motif is an element of a larger work. Thus, Lichtenstein reinforced a non-realist view of comic strips and advertisements, presenting them as artificial images with minimalistic graphic techniques. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material stressed the plainness of his motifs as an equivalent to mechanical commercial drawing, leading to implications about his statements on modern industrial America. Nonetheless, Lichtenstein appears to have accepted the American capitalist industrial culture.|$|E

As his adventure proceeds from here, Serge is able to recruit a multitude of allies to his cause. While assisting Kid in a heist Viper Manor to steal the Frozen Flame, he learns that ten years before the present, the universe split into two dimensions—one in which Serge lived, and {{one in which he}} perished. Through Kid's Astral Amulet charm, Serge travels between the dimensions. At Fort Dragonia the use of a Dragonian artifact called the Dragon Tear, Lynx switches bodies with Serge. Unaware of the switch, Kid confides in Lynx, who stabs her as the real Serge helplessly watches. Lynx boasts of his victory and banishes Serge to a strange realm called the Temporal Vortex. He takes Kid under his wing, brainwashing her to believe the real Serge (in Lynx's body) is her enemy. Serge escapes with help from Harle, although his new body turns him into a stranger in his own world, with all the allies he had gained up to that point abandoning him due to his new appearance. Discovering that his new body prevents him from traveling across the dimensions, he sets out to regain his former body and learn more of the universal split that occurred ten years earlier, gaining a new band of allies along the way.. He travels to a forbidden lagoon known as the Dead Sea—a wasteland <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> dotted with futuristic ruins.
