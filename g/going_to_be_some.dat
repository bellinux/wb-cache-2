Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> kind of paradise or saving grace. I got there and realized that my problems were following me.

500|$|Before {{production}} {{on the second}} season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest. According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest. However, Sam's storyline was later adjusted to pair him with glee club member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) after producers observed the chemistry between Overstreet and Agron. Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, {{a member of the}} rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of the middle of the season." [...] Kurt transfers from McKinley High to Dalton Academy and falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine only considers him a close friend. However, when Kurt sings the Beatles song [...] "Blackbird" [...] in [...] "Original Song", Blaine finally realizes his true feelings and the two kiss, marking the start of the relationship. Criss noted, [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." [...] When imagining Blaine and Kurt's potential future together, Murphy expected to treat them the same as all other Glee relationships by making their pairing [...] "as flawed and as exposed as everyone else's." [...] This plan was confirmed by Falchuk after the characters kissed for the first time, though he later clarified: [...] "They're solid. They have problems—you have two stars dating each other, there's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> competition there." [...] In the second-season finale, they each tell the other, [...] "I love you", and early in the third season they decide to have sex for the first time.

2500|$|As Birds of Prey {{approached}} its hundredth issue, Simone used issues #99 and #100 {{to shake}} up the lineup. She let Black Canary leave the team with her ward, a little girl called [...] "Sin", and used a prison break arc to introduce superhumanly strong Big Barda, pacifist Judomaster and rascally Misfit into the new squad, and with the new Spy Smasher as an ambiguous Jack Bauer-like anti-heroine and Lois Lane cornering Oracle into almost giving away her secret identity. Again, the characters were chosen to provide a foil for each other, and affirmed her love for her characters: [...] "The team {{is a group of}} individuals, quite unlike the friendship between Dinah, Helena and Babs. And any team with Barda on it automatically has a certain bull in a China shop tremble, and I love that...

There are always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> people who find that not to their taste, but at the same time, Birds of Prey regularly brings in people who don't otherwise read mainstream comics, a whole audience that may not pick up any other superhero titles, and I love that niche, that little area between good taste and utter shamelessness." [...] Finally, Simone stated her agony of leaving the book: [...] "I miss the characters in all the books I've worked on. Writing the last issue of Birds of Prey I'm doing was actually physically painful." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Pussycat Dolls {{were created}} by {{choreographer}} Robin Antin and her roommate Christina Applegate in 1993 after inviting several dancers to explore Antin's idea of classic Las Vegas-style burlesque {{and give it a}} more contemporary spin. In 1995, the group began performing every Thursday at Johnny Depp's Los Angeles club, the Viper Room. In 2000, Gwen Stefani was invited to sing and perform with the Dolls and brought along Interscope Geffen A chairman Jimmy Iovine and then-president of A Records; both took interest into turning it in a singing group. In 2003, Antin struck a joint venture with Interscope Records to develop the Pussycat Dolls into a brand, with Iovine assigning the project to Fair. Fair stated that he wanted to create an album which would [...] "involve music and visuals". He explained that [...] "there's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> technological changes as well as creative changes in the way we go about it." [...] The auditions drew about 500 aspiring performers, of which two singers—Nicole Scherzinger and Melody Thornton—were recruited, joining Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta and Kimberly Wyatt to form a new recording group. Fair stated that even though [...] "there were some adequate voices in the original group," [...] Scherzinger and Thornton where needed [...] "to bring the ability."
