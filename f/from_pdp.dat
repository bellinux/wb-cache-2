Multipath components were resolved in time {{by using a}} sliding correlator with 10 -ns resolution and in space by sweeping a directional antenna with 7 half power beamwidth in the azimuthal direction. Power delay profiles (PDPs) and power angle profiles (PAPs) were measured in various indoor and short-range outdoor environments. Detailed multipath structure was retrieved <b>from</b> <b>PDPs</b> and PAPs and was related to site-specific environments.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour and {{mechanism for}} mild steel in hydrochloric acid solutions was studied by chemical (hydrogen evolution, HE & mass loss, ML) and electrochemical (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy & potentiodynamic polarization) methods at 25 o C.

Microstructural studies for mild steel after immersion in HCl solutions of different concentrations showed general and pitting corrosion and the latter becomes more pronounced at higher level of HCl concentration. Accordingly, it was found that Rct value decreases while both Cdl and icorr. values increase with increasing HCl concentration. PDP results revealed that the steel dissolution is anodically controlled. Estimation of the ratio Z/vs <b>from</b> <b>PDP</b> data indicated that mild steel dissolution occurs via multistep mechanism.

40|$|Eportfolios have rapidly {{established}} {{themselves as}} a key feature of higher education as universities strive to meet the auditing requirements of personal development planning (pdp). Initial university ePortfolio pilot projects suggested that students were unlikely to engage with the ePortfolio unless it was assessed (Chalk, 2008) and ePortfolios {{could be seen as}} representing a shift <b>from</b> <b>pdp</b> as a process (for development) to PDP as artefact (auditing). Our question was: Can ePortfolios provide value in increased engagement with learning? Rather than evaluating existing commercial ePortfolio options we decided to explore the use of RGA (repertory grid analysis) as a means of identifying key personal constructs related to eTechnologies that might be employed to support personal development. RGA is a method of providing insights into how a person constructs their unique view of the world (Kelly 1955). Four scenarios were chosen based on the pdp work of researchers. Our initial analysis showed how differently we had developed our work and several key constructs arose including: Transformation 'versus' recording identity Ownership Audience Conformity This paper will explore the implications of this work and the further RGA data derived from staff and students. It describes a shift amongst staff engaged with pdp towards eTechnologies that could be seen as enabling a more nuanced and contextualised response to the process of supporting student learning as opposed to simply meeting the requirement for ‘reflection as national policy’ Clegg and Bradley (2006 : 465) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difficulties and opportunities that Chinese transfer students encounter in learning in one American university. The researcher also explored the strategies that transfer students used to deal with the difficulties and opportunities. The study employed qualitative survey and interview methods. Ninety-seven students who transferred from Zhejiang University City College and Xi’an Jiaotong University City College to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln were invited to participate. These students came to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln through the Partner Degree Program (PDP). Forty-one individuals completed the online survey and two students participated in interviews. The participants were asked about their learning experiences in UNL, including the learning abilities in class and after class. The content involved reading, listening, writing and speaking and students’ attitudes towards American teaching methods. Seven questions directed the research: (a) what is the student’s basic information? (b) how do students evaluate their English abilities in general? (c) how do students evaluate their English abilities in listening, speaking, reading and writing? (d) how do students evaluate their performances in class? (e) what are students’ attitudes towards American teaching methods? (f) what are students’ attitudes towards assignments after classes? and (g) regarding the difficulties encountered as transfer students, what are the attitudes towards credit transfer, class selection, having classes, doing homework, and communicating with English-speaking students? The results demonstrated that the transfer students <b>from</b> <b>PDP</b> have difficulties in adjusting to American learning environment. The professional words, instructors’ accents, and speaking speeds were the three factors that hindered most the students’ learning on the American campus. Moreover, students’ English abilities were an important factor. Their personal characteristics and the learning habits formed in Chinese learning environments made them need more time to adjust to the new learning environment. Helping students better adjust to the American campus and encouraging instructors to raise their own awareness of students’ difficulties is essential for students success on the complex American campus.
