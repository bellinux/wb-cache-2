40|$|The {{importance}} of good software testing is often reported. Traditionally, acceptance testing {{is the last}} stage of the testing process before release to the customer. Unfortunately, {{it is not always}} appropriate to wait so long for customer feedback. Emerging agile methods recognise this and promote close interaction between the customer and developers for early acceptance testing, often before implementation commences. Indeed, Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) is a process that uses customer interaction to define tests and tool support to automate and execute these. However, with existing tools, tests are usually written from new descriptions or rewritten from existing documentation. Here, the challenge is to allow developers and customers to annotate existing documentation and automatically <b>generate</b> <b>acceptance</b> tests without rewrites or new descriptions. This paper introduces the related ideas and describes a particular experiment that assesses the value of using annotated text to create acceptance tests...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSun is an {{unlimited}} energy source {{and it may}} be used to replace internal combustion engines in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV's). Through concentrated solar thermal energy stored in thermal batteries with phase changing materials it's possible to drive thermal engines for generating electricity on board, thus reducing the amount of electrical batteries required. Therefore, optimization through advanced control techniques is needed, provided that transformation from thermal to electrical energy has low efficiency. Optimization is achieved by means of system identification and custom parameters design and is applicable to any sun powered plant using the technology of concentrated thermal energy. The current development includes a prototype of a small campus vehicle with 60 Km range, and combines concepts of user-centred design to <b>generate</b> <b>acceptance</b> of Sun-powered systems. Moreover, excess energy generated in the vehicle is used to provide electric energy for houses. Finally, the concept of transformation from any Electric Vehicle to Sun powered Thermal-HEV is introduced...|$|E
40|$|Courtship is a {{widespread}} behavior in which one gender conveys to the other a series of cues about their species identity, gender, and suitability as mates. In many species, females decode these male displays and either accept or reject them. Despite the fact that courtship has been investigated for a long time, the genes and circuits that allow females to generate these mutually exclusive responses remain largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that the Krüppel-like transcription factor datilógrafo (dati) is required for proper locomotion and courtship acceptance in adult Drosophila females. dati mutant females are completely unable to decode male courtship and almost invariably reject males. Molecular analyses reveal that dati is broadly expressed {{in the brain and}} its specific removal in excitatory cholinergic neurons recapitulates the female courtship behavioral phenotype but not the locomotor deficits, indicating that these are two separable functions. Clonal analyses in female brains identified three discrete foci where dati is required to <b>generate</b> <b>acceptance.</b> These include neurons around the antennal lobe, the lateral horn, and the posterior superior lateral protocerebrum. Together, these results show that dati is required to organize an...|$|E

Portrayals in advertising equal an admission as citizens, which homosexual women are currently neglected as media circumscribe male homosexuality as norm. Knowledge of how homosexual women identifies with portrayals in advertising is currently sparse. Aim: The overall {{aim of this study}} is to satiate the gap of knowledge of portrayals of homosexual women in advertising and how the dual identity of gender and sexuality influence the interpretation of advertisements targeting homosexual women. Method: A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodology. The sample includes self-identified homosexual women recruited consecutively during a two-month period. In total 113 homosexual women participated in the study. To provide a realistic interpretation, actual print advertisements portraying female homosexuals were used as stimuli within the contexts of mainstream media and gay media. Results: The female homosexual group appears to be heterogeneous since the perception of the individual sexual identity and lifestyle was not aligned but rather dispersed. However, the participants’ perception of the sexual identity and lifestyle of the female homosexual group is that is a homogenous group. Conclusion: Within the female homosexual group a stigmatization exist regarding gender behaviour that does not correspond with the recurrent portrayal in advertising of homosexual women as a homogenous group. ...|$|E
40|$|Bycatch {{reduction}} technology (BRT) modifies {{fishing gear}} to increase selectivity and avoid capture of non-target species, or to facilitate their non-lethal release. As {{a solution to}} fisheries-related mortality of non-target species, BRT is an attractive option; effectively implemented, BRT presents a technical 'fix' that can reduce pressure for politically contentious and economically detrimental interventions, such as fisheries closures. While {{a number of factors}} might contribute to effective implementation, our review of BRT literature finds that research has focused on technical design and experimental performance of individual technologies. In contrast, and with a few notable exceptions, research on the human and institutional context of BRT, and more specifically on how fishers respond to BRT, is limited. This {{is not to say that}} fisher attitudes are ignored or overlooked, but that incentives for fisher uptake of BRT are usually assumed rather than assessed or demonstrated. Three assumptions about fisher incentives dominate: (1) economic incentives will <b>generate</b> <b>acceptance</b> of BRT; (2) enforcement will generate compliance with BRT; and (3) 'participation' by fishers will increase acceptance and compliance, and overall support for BRT. In this paper, we explore evidence for and against these assumptions and situate our analysis in the wider social science literature on fisheries. Our goal is to highlight the need and suggest focal areas for further research. © Inter-Research 2008...|$|E

In a unique fast track procedure, an international arbitration tribunal had to determine {{in accordance with the}} Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) of 2005, in particular the Abyei Protocol and Abyei Appendix, the Interim National Constitution (INC) and general principles of law, whether the Abyei Border Commission (ABC) exceeded its mandate, which was to define and demarcate the area of the nine Ngok Dinka chiefdoms transferred to Kordofan in 1905. In case of excess, the parties entrusted the tribunal with redefining the boundaries of the disputed territory based on the parties’ submissions. To guarantee the transparency of the procedure and to <b>generate</b> <b>acceptance</b> by all stakeholders on the ground, all hearings and documents were made publically available. The procedure and the more than 200 -pages-long final Award from July 2009 constitute an illustrative example of an international dispute settlement procedure dealing with an intra-state (territorial) dispute between a state and a secessionist movement.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "If the public used the dollar coin rather than the dollar note, the government could potentially save up to $ 500 million annually. The Mint spent $ 67. 1 million to promote the new dollar coin from 1998 to 2001, including expenditures for a marketing and advertising program; public relations and publicity programs; 23 partnerships with banking, entertainment retail, grocery and restaurant chains; and promotional events with transit agencies. Most of the $ 67. 1 million was used for a national advertising campaign to build public awareness, <b>generate</b> <b>acceptance,</b> and encourage use of the new dollar coin. The Mint also worked with contractors to stimulate the new dollar coin's use {{in state and local}} government operations and used its own staff for marketing activities in federal government facilities, but it did not track the costs for the use of Mint staff. According to the Mint, between January 2000 and December 2001, the new dollar coin had generated $ 1. 1 billion in revenue and $ 968 million in seigniorage. The Mint faces several barriers in its efforts to increase the new dollar coin. The most substantial barrier is the current widespread use of the dollar bill in everyday transactions and public resistance to begin using the new dollar coin. Other barriers that hinder wider circulation include (1) negative perceptions the public may have of the coin after two failed introductions, (2) lack of public information about the savings to the government from using the new coin, (3) lack of public awareness about the comparative advantages of the dollar coin over the dollar bill, and (4) the idea that the ease of carrying the bill is more beneficial than the durability of the dollar coin. In general, the Mint's marketing plan describes a program that is much smaller in scope than the marketing campaign used to launch the new dollar coin in 2000. The Mint plans to address some, but not all, of the barriers to increasing use and recognizes that successfully achieving widespread use of the new dollar coin will be difficult if the dollar bill cocirculates with the new dollar coin. The Mint's 2001 report to Congress did not fully and accurately describe the costs of the marketing campaign, the results obtained, and problems encountered. The 2002 report gave more details on marketing costs and a fuller description of the problems encountered. ...|$|E

A mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group intervention was pilot tested for acceptability and effectiveness in this patient group. Methods Nineteen men were initially recruited to three groups and 12 completed final assessments. Outcomes assessed included anxiety, depression, cancer-related distress, prostate cancer-specific quality of life, and mindfulness skills at baseline, immediately, and 3 months post-intervention. Satisfaction measures and in-depth interviews were undertaken post-intervention to describe men's personal {{experiences of the}} groups. Results Significant improvements were observed for anxiety (p?=? 0. 027), avoidance (p?=? 0. 032), and mindfulness skills (p?=? 0. 019), with a trend for a reduction in fear of cancer recurrence (p?=? 0. 062). Effect sizes were moderate to large. A shared group identity, acceptance of, and learning from other group members were key aspects of the group context that contributed to acceptance of progressive disease.

In this paper, we discuss the organizational context in which CECs function in Europe focusing on five aspects.

CECs, perhaps particularly in transitional countries, must counter the charge of "alibi ethics". CECs must define their contribution to in-house quality management in their respective health care organization, clarifying how ethical reflection on various levels serves the hospital and patient care in general. This last challenge is made more difficult by lack of consensus about appropriate quality outcomes for CECs internationally. These are daunting challenges, but the fact that CECs continue to develop suggests that we should make the effort to overcome them. We believe there is a need for further research that specifically addresses some of the institutional challenges facing CEC...|$|R

Applying institutional and factual analyses, the paper provides counterarguments that rebut these claims and arguments. For a long time, advocates of globalization have argued its benefits to all parties. The experience of SWFs puts such claims to the test. In the meantime, however, GCC SWFs should open up a bit more and reveal their investments profiles showing both gains and losses.
