5|$|Banksia sessilis is {{endemic to}} the Southwest Botanical Province, a floristic {{province}} renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, {{located in the}} southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a Mediterranean climate, with wet winters and hot, dry summers. B.sessilis occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin, east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay, and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the Karri forest in the cool, wet, southwest corner of the province, but <b>even</b> <b>there,</b> B.sessilis var. cordata occurs along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war on 3 September 1939 and the rapid conquest of Poland, Shaw was accused of defeatism when, in a New Statesman article, he declared the war over and demanded a peace conference. Nevertheless, when he became convinced that a negotiated peace was impossible, he publicly urged the neutral United States to join the fight. The London blitz of 1940–41 led the Shaws, both in their mid-eighties, to live full-time at Ayot St Lawrence. <b>Even</b> <b>there</b> they were not immune from enemy air raids, and stayed on occasion with Nancy Astor at her country house, Cliveden. In 1943, {{the worst of the}} London bombing over, the Shaws moved back to Whitehall Court, where medical help for Charlotte was more easily arranged. Her condition deteriorated, and she died in September.|$|E
5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not <b>even</b> <b>there</b> when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade in Southern China by itself was probably not great. The Canton trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of Canton, and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to Canton, and <b>even</b> <b>there</b> was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. The main {{effect of the}} Old China Trade was an increased import of opium and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist world system after 1830. However, the maritime fur trade played a minor role in this process.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Turkey {{he met with}} Skene, the British Vice-Consul, who had him introduced to Omar Pasha and invited to view the Turkish regiments. Nolan was not particularly impressed by them, judging the irregulars incapable of withstanding a Russian cavalry charge and finding the horses too small. He ordered 250 of them anyway, finding them appropriate for the British artillery {{if not for the}} cavalry. His report to Somerset (now Baron Raglan, and commander of the British forces in Turkey) included a proposal for a trip to Syria, where he claimed the horses were more appropriate. This proposal was eventually agreed to, and he went to İskenderun on 9 May. When they arrived they discovered that Turkish officials had already bought most of the army horses in northern Syria, and so they continued on to Beirut and then Damascus. <b>Even</b> <b>there,</b> they failed to find horses of sufficient quality, and so they left the city on 21 May in hopes of making contact with the Bedouin. They left with a train of 292 horses, mostly bought from the 'Anizzah, and were met at Beirut by the steamship Trent and transported back to Turkey.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} results were produced in western Slavonia, where Croatian forces began pushing the JNA away from Grubišno Polje towards Lipik on 31 October, {{and away from}} Nova Gradiška towards Okučani on 12 November. In mid-November, another push along the NovskaOkučani axis recaptured several villages by 9 December, while Lipik was recaptured by the Croatian forcesnow renamed the HVon 7 December. The mountains of Papuk and Bilogora, north of Pakrac where the Croatian Serb militia was {{not supported by the}} JNA, were brought under Croatian control in the same period. A HV offensive to recapture the Okučani area, codenamed Operation Orkan 91, commenced {{in the final days of}} December. The area was attacked from the directions of Pakrac, Novska and Nova Gradiška. The effort made no progress except west of Nova Gradiškabut <b>even</b> <b>there</b> it was very limited. Under international pressure, Tuđman called off the offensive on 26 December.|$|E

25|$|Groundwater is {{unevenly}} distributed and {{can only}} be extracted in certain areas, specifically in weathered areas above the bedrock and fractured zones. <b>Even</b> <b>there</b> yields are limited to about 10 m3/day per borehole, which is barely enough to supply a small village with water.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{arrived in}} the Netherlands somewhere around 5000 BC with the Linear Pottery culture, who were {{probably}} central European farmers. Agriculture was practised only on the loess plateau in the very south (southern Limburg), but <b>even</b> <b>there</b> it was not established permanently. Farms did not develop {{in the rest of}} the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Occitan's {{decline is}} {{somewhat}} less pronounced in Bearn {{because of the}} province's history (a late addition to the Kingdom of France), though <b>even</b> <b>there</b> the language is little spoken outside {{the homes of the}} rural elderly. The village of Artix is notable for having elected to post street signs in the local language.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people who}} are {{drowning}} manage to save themselves, or are assisted by bystanders or professional rescuers. Less than 6% of people rescued by lifeguards need medical attention, and only 0.5% need CPR. The statistics are not as good for rescue by bystanders, but <b>even</b> <b>there,</b> a minority require CPR.|$|E

25|$|Metering is rare {{outside the}} capital and <b>even</b> <b>there</b> only a {{fraction}} of customers are metered, in particular water committees in the informal settlements in Port-au-Prince as well as industrial customers. Many private citizens and some major consumers, such as luxury hotels, have disconnected from the public network and receive all their water via tanker trucks.|$|E
25|$|In June 1905, Fra Pio's health worsened to such {{an extent}} that his {{superiors}} decided to send him to a mountain convent, in the hope that the change of air would do him some good. This had little impact, however, and doctors advised that he return to his home town. <b>Even</b> <b>there</b> his health failed to improve. Despite this, On January 27, 1907, he still made his solemn profession.|$|E
25|$|Two barren years followed: 1996 {{was spent}} entirely in Surrey's second team, {{and he was}} {{generally}} expensive <b>even</b> <b>there,</b> regularly going for five runs an over. The following season he played no county cricket at any level, his only appearance of note being in a minor match, for the Earl of Arundel's XI against Ireland in a friendly one-day game in August. He did at least take 3–39 on that occasion. In 1997, he made 3 Minor Counties Championship appearances for Hertfordshire against Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Buckinghamshire.|$|E

25|$|The {{rigidity}} of cumulenes {{arises from}} the fact that the internal carbon atoms carry two double bonds. Their sp hybridisation results in two π bonds, one to each neighbor, which are perpendicular to each other. This bonding reinforces a linear geometry of the carbon chain. If the number of consecutive double bonds is odd, there is cis–trans isomerism as for alkenes. Cumulenes with non-equivalent substituents on each end exhibit isomerism. If the number of consecutive double bonds is <b>even,</b> <b>there</b> is axial chirality as for allenes.|$|E
25|$|Major style guides advise {{consulting}} {{a dictionary}} {{to determine whether}} a compound modifier should be hyphenated; the dictionary's hyphenation should be followed even when the compound modifier follows a noun (that is, regardless of whether in attributive or predicative position), because they are permanent compounds (whereas the general rule with temporary compounds is that hyphens are omitted in the predicative position because they are used only when necessary to prevent misreading, which is usually only in the attributive position, and <b>even</b> <b>there,</b> only on a case-by-case basis).|$|E
25|$|The usual source {{which is}} quoted in this instance, is Melis Stoke, a chronicler {{in the service}} of count Floris V of Holland, but {{although}} he tries to back up the Hollandic claims on the Frisian territories, he lacks sound arguments. He suspects the counts of Holland obtained their rights as heirs to one Gerolf, Count in Friesland (the operative word here being in), who had been count of Holland during the Franconian period, which was at that time a part of Greater Frisia, but <b>even</b> <b>there</b> he has to admit it is only as suspicion.|$|E
