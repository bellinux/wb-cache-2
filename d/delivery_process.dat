25|$|As {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} one, the {{delivery}} phase is in between the release phase and the deployment phase. A software vendor develops and releases a software product and afterwards it has to be transported to the customer. This phase is the <b>delivery</b> <b>process.</b> This process is highly complex because the vendor often has to deal with a product which has multiple versions, variable features, dependency on external products, and different kinds of distribution options. The CCU method helps the software vendor in structuring this process.|$|E
25|$|In figure 2, the process-data {{diagram of}} the {{delivery}} phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side {{you can see the}} meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package just has to contain 1 software package. On {{the left side of the}} picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the <b>delivery</b> <b>process.</b> This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.|$|E

A group of four candidates associated with the Australian Labor Party (ALP) contested the election as the [...] "Tin Tin for NUS" [...] ticket. It was discovered that one of the students, Stephen Donnelly, had gained access to the postal ballots during the <b>delivery</b> <b>process.</b> When challenged to explain their behaviour, all four candidates withdrew their nominations. The deputy returning officer writes that the candidates Stephen Donnelly, Robert Larocca, Nigel Rhode and Robin Scott were charged with Dishonest Conduct and Interfering with Ballot Papers. He escalated the matter to the Dean of Glenn College and then the University Secretary but found them disinterested and the matter was never formally prosecuted by the police. Stephen Donnelly has subsequently become the Assistant State Secretary in the Victorian branch of the ALP.|$|E

40|$|Land {{administration}} {{theory has}} developed a new, multi-disciplinary approach to building, designing and managing land administration systems (LAS). The articulation of the approach runs parallel to development of land indicators to improve reliability and usefulness of international comparisons of LAS tools, especially in response to demands for good governance. These developments form the background to formulation of human rights based land acquisition standards. However, land <b>delivery</b> <b>processes</b> in general, and the sub-set of compulsory land acquisition and resettlement processes, in particular, are complex and cross-cutting.
