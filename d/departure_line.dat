2500|$|USS PC-552 was a Class 461 Patrol Craft ("PC") {{which was}} at the {{forefront}} of the naval efforts during the Normandy invasion. It served as convoy protection in the North Atlantic and, as one of about ten PC control vessels off [...] Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion. PC-552 was among the first ships to reach waters off Omaha Beach. PC-552, primary control vessel for Fox Green sector of the beach, was forced into rescue efforts and recovery of bodies at the <b>departure</b> <b>line</b> for Fox Green when the Duplex Drive tanks that survived the initial disastrous launch were swamped at the line with only two surviving. The PC was diverted into this effort for forty-five minutes and ultimately only five tanks, the two that survived the launch disaster and three that were aboard LCT-600 whose commander raised his ramp when the first off foundered and instead landed them on the beach, reached the beach.|$|E
50|$|In early April, Sands trained army {{units in}} amphibious exercises. On the 18th, she {{embarked}} {{units of the}} 162nd Infantry and got underway for Humboldt Bay. Steaming with TG 77.2, the Central Attack Group for the Hollandia operation, she arrived in the transport area early {{on the morning of}} the 22nd. At 0600, her boats were lowered and loaded. Five minutes later, they were en route to the <b>departure</b> <b>line.</b> At 0735, they returned and were hoisted on board. The APD then took up gunfire support duties.|$|E

Soon after 0630 on 15 June, {{she was in}} her assigned transport area, 7 mi off Saipan. By 0700 her boats had departed for a demonstration feint off Mutcho Point, Garapan. Her boats reloaded in mid-morning, she shifted to the Charan Kanoa transport area. At 1103 she received orders to send her troops in to beach [...] "Green Two". The first boats shoved off for the <b>departure</b> <b>line</b> at 1135 and by 1340 the job was completed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Departures</b> <b>Line</b> works {{similarly}} {{to the previous}} GoTime IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Instead of dialling (902) 480- plus the 4-digit number found on bus stop signage, one dials (902)-480-8000 and following the voice responses, one would input the bus stop number to access route departure times. The system gives the estimated departure time if available, scheduled times if the bus is not reporting real-time data or is delayed {{by a number of}} minutes, adjusted time to depart when schedule adjustments are made, and will announce when a bus is arriving within the minute.|$|R
50|$|Following {{shakedown}} in Chesapeake Bay, YMS-311 {{headed south}} and on 23 December reported for duty to Commander, Caribbean Sea Frontier. From January to mid-May 1944, she {{served in the}} Curaçao-Aruba area, escorting freighters and oilers to and from convoy rendezvous points. Then ordered to the Pacific Ocean, the YMS proceeded to Panama, thence continued on to California and Hawaii. Arriving at Pearl Harbor {{at the end of}} July, she underwent further training in August, then steamed west to the Admiralties. On 11 October, YMS-311 departed Seeadler Harbor in TU 79.12.1. Seven days later, she arrived at the entrance to Leyte Gulf and began sweeping operations to clear the way for the invasion force which followed. Through the 19th, despite Japanese aerial resistance, she continued to sweep in Leyte Gulf; then, on the 20th, joined LST group Baker on the <b>departure</b> <b>line</b> off Blue Beach 2 -- Orange Beach 1 and assumed duty as control ship.|$|E
50|$|On the 18th, Sands {{arrived at}} Sydney {{for a brief}} respite. On the 28th, she got {{underway}} to return to New Guinea with cargo and personnel for Milne Bay, Buna, and Cape Sudest. From 6 to 24 February, she completed another run to Sydney; then, on the 27th, loaded troops at Cape Sudest for transport to the assault beaches at Los Negros Island, Admiralties. Sailing on the 29th, she crossed the Bismarck Sea; arrived off the assault area shortly after 0730 the next day; dispatched her loaded LCP(R)s to the <b>departure</b> <b>line</b> by 0742; then, as the first waves reached the shore, commenced gunfire support operations. At 0835, Sandss boats hit the beach with the 3rd assault wave. The intense crossfire which had caught earlier waves continued as they approached. Poor organization on the beach slowed offloading and assisted {{the accuracy of the}} Japanese defenders. Sands suffered two casualties, one killed, one seriously injured, from her boat crews and lost her no. 1 boat.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{dialysis}} fluids {{has become increasingly}} important {{in the treatment of}} HD patients. Purified water represents over 95 % of its volume. Bacterial and endotoxin content of Reverse Osmosis (RO) water is usually kept under control by bacterial filters, inserted in the distribution departure loop, and by monthly disinfection of the distribution circuit; the simpler the circuit, the better. This paper reports 12 years experience during which Ultraviolet Irradiation (UV) has replaced bacterial filters. To keep the bacterial growth under control in a complex RO water circuit (including a tank and multiple loops) a simple UV lamp was inserted in the <b>departure</b> <b>line.</b> It proved sufficient to keep bacterial count within AAMI norms. Failure of the UV lamp was associated with a rise of up to 500 cfu/ml in the last (fourth week) before routine disinfection. Normal levels were again obtained after replacement of the UV lamp. Six years later, a second UV lamp was added on the return loop. Bacterial counts and endotoxin levels in RO water promptly fell to < 1 cfu/ml and < 0. 125 EU, till today. It is concluded that UV lamps should be favoured over bacterial filters in systems that are not disinfected daily, such as the RO water circuit. The principle of UV irradiation is explained and its advantage over bacterial filters is discussed. Future possible applications of UV are presented...|$|E

The Method {{used in this study}} is descriptive analytical research method. This study also related to the Direktorat Jendral Perhubungan Darat and to predict the amount of vehicle and passenger using Regresi Linier method (Sudjana, 1990). Based on the calculation and the observation at the location, the Pacitan Town Terminal is not fulfilling the criteria of passenger terminal of A type. This can be proved from the area that less of 5 ha; arrival and departure area are not natty in arrangement, the waiting room is not enough to cover the passenger; the other facilities which less of adequate and it is only available for bus AKAP and AKDP. Pacitan Town Terminal has a wide of 4335, 35 m 2 (in 2017) available to cover buses at capacity of 31 buses/hours.

5000|$|In {{the end it}} took a {{determined}} campaign by Henry VII to largely stamp out the use of livery badges by others than the king, and reduce them to things normally worn only by household servants {{in the case of}} the aristocracy. Livery badges issues by guilds and corporations, and mayors, were exempt, and these continued in use until the 19th century in some cases. A particular concern in all the legislation was to forbid the issuing of liveries to those without a permanent contract with the lord; these groups assembled for a particular purpose were believed to be the most dangerous. The Statute of Liveries of 1506 finally forbade entirely the issuing of liveries to those of higher rank; they had to be domestic servants or persons experienced in the law, unless covered by a specific royal licence. A well-known story, first told by Francis Bacon but unsupported in the remaining records, has Henry visiting his principal military commander John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford at Hedingham Castle, who at his <b>departure</b> <b>lined</b> the king's exit route with liveried retainers, for which Henry fined him 15,000 marks. [...] In fact modern historical analysis of the court records shows few prosecutions, but by the end of Henry's reign liveried retainers do seem to have ceased to be a major problem. While the badges of the nobility were carefully restricted, the royal badges of the Tudors, most famously the Tudor rose that signified the union of the Lancastrian and Yorkist dynasties, were used more widely than ever before, for example being added freely to King's College Chapel, Cambridge when the Tudors completed Henry VI's unfinished building. The Collar of Esses became in effect a badge of office, though of course still denoting allegiance to the monarch.|$|R
