Comparisons between analytical calculations and numerical simulations are presented regarding three aspects: (1) cyclic pumping; (2) dispersion; and (3) finite horizontal wells in a finite domain (a freshwater lens). Various hydrogeological conditions and pumping regimes within a dry half year are considered. The {{results show that the}} influence of elastic and phreatic storage (which are not taken into account in the analytical solutions) on the upconing of the <b>interface</b> <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b> Furthermore, the analytical calculations based on the interface approach compare well with numerical simulations as long as the dimensionless interface upconing is below 1 / 3, which is in line with previous studies on steady pumping. Superimposing an analytical solution for mixing by dispersion below the well over an analytical solution based on the interface approach is appropriate in case the vertical flow velocity around the interface is nearly constant but should not be used for estimating the salinity of the pumped groundwater. The analytical calculations of interface upconing below a finite horizontal well compare well with the numerical simulations in case the distance between the horizontal well and the initial interface does not vary significantly along the well and in case the natural fluctuation of the freshwater lens is small. In order to maintain a low level of salinity in the well during a dry half year, the dimensionless analytically calculated interface upconing should stay below 0. 25. <br/...|$|E
40|$|I {{read the}} article by Ozkan and colleagues(7) with interest. The authors {{administered}} intraperitoneally in rats, erythropoietin (EPO) following transect and repair the sciatic nerve and observed that EPO treatment increased axonal regeneration. The functional recovery of the sciatic nerve was better during {{the third and fourth}} months after the operation than in the first weeks. Moreover,they observed that repeated EPO administration was not found more effective than single dose therapy. It seems that these results were due to a Schwann cell proliferation(2, 6, 10) in the transected scitatic nerve. Likewise, previous studies in rats have reported that the histological and functional recovery of the injured sciatic nerve can also be feasible after transplantation blood-derived CD 133 cells embedded in atelocollagen gel into a silicone tube(4) or following to inject nerve growth factor into the silica gel conduit(10). These above-mentioned studies were performed into rats and in sciatic nerves with acute injury. On the contrary, since December 2007,we have observed that placing omental tissue round the injured sciatic nerve, we can improve the function of the foot and leg (unpublished observation). My colleagues and I treated to a 26 -year-old woman who there was underwent right sciatic nerve injury during a prosthesis at the hip, in June 13, 2007. Immediately after the operation,she presented motor and sensory loss in her right lower limb, and later on, she received only rehabilitation. Personal history: At the age of 2. 8 years, she suffered tonsillitis, septicemia and shortly after, arthritis in interphalangeal, knee and hip joints. She received treatment with antibiotics. Two months later, she presented pain located in both of them hips, and subsequently, difficulty to walk. During her childhood and adolescence she was attended in the Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación, in Mexico city. The axamination showed to a patient in wheelchair and in a good state of nutrition. She presented shortening of the right pelvic limb on 3 cm, and flatfoot. Hypotrophy, hypotonia and hpothermia in her leg and foot. Her motor evaluation was as follows: Toes (grade 0), foot (grade 0),leg (grade 0 - 1),thigh (grade 1 - 3) and hip (grade 4). Anesthesia in the leg and foot,and moderate hypesthesia on the cutaneous zone of the minor sciatic nerve. Indifferent plantar response Two electrodiagnostic test revealed absence of motor and sensory neuroconduction in the tibial, peroneal and major sciatic nerves. Before surgery, the patient´s status was recorded on videotape. In December 12, 2007, an omental transplantation (free omental graft with vascular microanastomosis) was performed without complications. The major sciatic nerve was located through a vertical incision on the posterior surface of the right thigh, at the level its apparent origin. During the surgery we found(9) : 1) fibrous tissue round the major sciatic nerve and its collateral branches; 2) several venous vessels with thrombosis, and 3) paleness and moderate hypotrophy (reduced to 75 per cent and 5 cm length) at the proximal portion of the major sciatic nerve. The distal segment of the omentum was wrapped round the injured sciatic nerve. Basically we used the same surgical technique, that in patients with an ischemic leg due to complete obstruction of the femoral artery above the knee(1, 5, 6). Objective neurological improvement occurred beginning the second day after surgery. The temperature in the right lower limb increased, and the voluntary movement of the thigh and leg improved. Likewise during the first days the right flatfoot was corrected to its normality. During whole postoperative evolution she has received rehabilitation. Presently after 29 months of follow-up, the motor evaluation is: toes (grade 0 - 1), foot (grade 1 - 3), leg (grade 2 - 4),and thigh and hip (grade 5). Moreover, she present moderate hypesthesia in the leg and foot, and normal sensory in the thigh. She can walk with help of orthopedic devices on the right leg and foot. Unlike the experimental observations in rats(2, 4, 7, 10), we believe that our results were due to three factors. First, surgical liberation of the sciatic nerve; Second, functional recovery of axons in the residual sciatic nerve,and Third, because of axonal regeneration(2 - 4, 9). Neurological improvement of their thermoregulatory, sensory and motor mechanisms was better during the first days or weeks after surgery than in the following months or years. A result similar to previous observations into patients with chronic injury in the spinal cord(8) and optic chiasma(9). So therefore, our results indicate that axons in ischemia and ischemic penumbra in the residual sciatic nerve can improve if circulation is restituted through the omentum, and later on, because of oxonal regeneration(2, 3, 7, 8). Because the omentum promotes the neoformation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) since the 6 hours after the surgery and, through omental penetrating neovessels in the injured sciatic nerve, it receive an increase in blood flow, oxygen, neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, adipocytokines and omental stem cells(3, 8 - 10). Thus, we believe that our neurosurgical technique provided from the first, a revascularization to the ischemic sciatic nerve and later on, adult mesenchymal stem cells for differentiating into multiple cell types including Schwann cell proliferation. These results, as well as the functional recovery of the ischemic optic chiasma(9) confirms that placing omentum directly on or round the injured nervous tissue can lead to neurological improvement. Likewise, based in these observations, I think that an omental transplantation on the anterior and lateral surface of the medulla oblongata, it could improve the function of the ischemic pyramids due to atherosclerosis in the V 4 segments of the vertebral arteries. In conclusion, these experimental and clinical observations indicate that is feasible improve the function of axons into the injured nervous trunks such as sciatic nerves and braquial plexus after an omental transplantation.

Often it is difficult, dangerous and expensive to train people in the actual {{environment in which they}} will be working. For example, training firefighters in a burning building is dangerous and very costly (a building is destroyed). Therefore, it would be advantageous to perform training in a less dangerous and less costly environment. We describe and compare four different interfaces for navigation and general familiarity training of an office environment, approximately 160 feet by 27 feet (the sixth floor of Packard Laboratory on Lehigh University's campus, referred to as the "sixth floor" throughout this document.) These <b>interfaces</b> <b>are</b> Immersive Remote Reality (IRR) (see [Boult, et. al. ]), Virtual Environment (VE), Enhanced Blueprint (EBP) and Traditional Blueprint (BP).

However, the most obvious disadvantage of the interfaces compared to the actual environment is that they model the environment with varying levels of realism. We give a description of an experiment we designed and performed to test familiarity and navigation skills.

40|$|Hospital environments {{are ranked}} {{as one of}} the most {{stressful}} contemporary work environments for their employees, and this especially concerns nurses (Nejati et al. 2016). One of the core problems comprises the notion that the current technology adopted in hospitals does not support the mobile nature of medical work and the complex work environment, in which people and information are distributed (Bardram 2003). The employment of inadequate technology and the strenuous access to information results in a decrease in efficiency regarding the fulfilment of medical tasks, and puts a strain on the attention of the medical personnel. This thesis proposes a solution to the aforementioned problems through the design of ambient displays, that inform the medical personnel with the health statuses of patients whilst requiring minimal allocation of attention. The ambient displays concede a hierarchy of information, where the most essential information encompasses an overview of patients’ vital signs. Data regarding the vital signs are measured by biometric sensors and are embodied by shape-changing interfaces, of which the ambient displays consist. User-authentication permits the medical personnel to access a deeper layer within the hierarchy of information, entailing clinical data such as patient EMRs, after gesture-based interaction with the ambient display. The additional clinical information is retrieved on the user’s PDA, and can subsequently be viewed in more detail, or modified at any place within the hospital. In this thesis, prototypes of shape-changing <b>interfaces</b> <b>were</b> designed and evaluated in a hospital environment. The evaluation was focused on the interaction design and user-experience of the shape-changing interface, the capabilities of the ambient displays to inform users through peripheral awareness, as well as the remote communication between patient and healthcare professional through biometric data. The evaluations indicated that the required attention allocated for the acquisition of information from the shape-changing <b>interface</b> <b>was</b> <b>minimal.</b> The interaction with the ambient display, as well as with the PDA when accessing additional clinical data, was deemed intuitive, yet comprised a short learning curve. Furthermore, the evaluations in situ pointed out that for optimised communication through the ambient displays, an overview of the health statuses of approximately eight patients should be displayed, and placed in the corridors of the hospital ward...|$|R

After six weeks, significantly lower astrocytic and microglial reactions were found surrounding the low-density probes, approaching no reaction at all.

40|$|Technological {{improvements}} {{the last}} decade have made digital drawing a very effective method for artistic expression. Thanks to more widely available and affordable peripheral devices such as pen tablets, {{an increasing number of}} artists are creating digital works. However, many fundamental interactions of modern day drawing systems have seen little change in over twenty years. Therefore, it is time to investigate what kind of innovation can be brought to these interactions with the computational power of today's desktop computers. This thesis shows the development, implementation and evaluation of novel canvas and stroke interactions. A novel way to orientate the canvas through gestures is presented. This is a modeless, effective way for artists to use the canvas which takes little time to become proficient in. A new interaction tool gives the artist intuitive control over stroke shapes by utilizing the brush stroke paradigm which artists are very familiar with. The tool can be used to freely shape lines with very few restrictions. Methods to create scalable line art from freehand drawing input are discussed. A technique to improve the visual quality of lines is also presented. A global theme of the thesis is the creation of a visually appealing <b>interface</b> which <b>is</b> <b>minimal,</b> yet effective. Finally, these concepts are evaluated through a case study and an informal user study. Results show that the key concepts presented here can be useful additions to the workflow of an artist. ...|$|R

Micro free-flow electrophoresis (μFFE) {{is a unique}} separation technique because of its continuous nature. Analytes are pressure driven through a planar separation channel, and an electric field applied laterally to the flow producing a spatial separation. Fabrication methods associated with μFFE devices hinder our ability to address the limitations of μFFE. This work focuses on a novel fabrication method to reduce the overall fabrication cost and time, followed by validating and characterizing the device. A novel μFFE device is fabricated in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) by 3 D printing {{two sides of the}} device and then acetone vapor bonding them while simultaneously inserting electrodes and clarifying the device. Fluorescent dyes are separated, and their limit of detection determined. After validation of the new fabrication method, a new device design is made with the sample inlet modified so that 2 D nLC × μFFE separations can be performed. 2 D nLC × μFFE separations of fluorescent dyes, proteins, and tryptic BSA digest are demonstrated.

40|$|It was {{recently}} {{found that the}} silicon oxynitride prepared by oxidation of silicon-rich silicon nitride (SRN) has several important features. The high nitrogen and extremely low hydrogen content of this material allows it {{to have a high}} dielectric constant and a low trap density. The present work investigates in further detail the electrical reliability of this kind of gate dielectfic films by studying the charge trapping and interface state generation induced by constant current stressing. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements indicate that for oxidation temperatures of 850 and 950 degrees C, the <b>interface</b> trap generation <b>is</b> <b>minimal</b> because of the high nitrogen content at the interface. At a higher oxidation temperature of 1050 degrees C, a large flatband shift is found for constant current stressing. This observation {{can be explained by the}} significant reduction of the nitrogen content and the phase separation effect at this temperature as found by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study. In addition to the high nitrogen content, the Si atoms at the interface exist in the form of random bonding to oxygen and nitrogen atoms for samples oxidized at 850 and 950 degrees C. This structure reduces the interface bonding constraint and results in the low interface trap density. For heavily oxidized samples the trace amount of interface nitrogen atoms exist in the form of a highly constraint SiN 4 phase and the <b>interface</b> oxynitride layer <b>is</b> a random mixture Of SiO 4 and SiN 4 phases, which consequently reduces the reliability against high energy electron stressing.

Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} collagen fibers cross-linked by the biocompatible dicatechol nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) have mechanical strength comparable to native tendons. This work focuses on investigating fibroblast behavior on fibrillar and NDGA cross-linked type I collagen to determine if NDGA modulates cell adhesion, morphology, and migration. A spinning disk device that applies a range of hydrodynamic forces under uniform chemical conditions was employed to sensitively quantify cell adhesion strength, and a radial barrier removal assay was used to measure cell migration on films suitable for these quantitative in vitro assays. The compaction of collagen films, mediated by the drying and cross-linking fabrication process, suggests a less open organization compared to native fibrillar collagen that likely allowed the collagen to form more inter-chain bonds and chemical links with NDGA polymers. Fibroblasts strongly adhered to and migrated on native and NDGA cross-linked fibrillar collagen; however, NDGA modestly reduced cell spreading, adhesion strength and migration rate. Thus, it is hypothesized that NDGA cross-linking masked some adhesion receptor binding sites either physically, chemically, or both, thereby modulating adhesion and migration.

General corrosion of buried pipes <b>is</b> <b>minimal</b> and <b>is</b> readily counteracted. In contrast, localised corrosion such as pitting is the primary means of pipes failing. A leading cause of pitting is the action of microbes at the steel/soil <b>interface.</b> This <b>is</b> both difficult to predict and prevent and can lead to leaks and ultimately to failure by bursts. These can be expensive to locate and repair...|$|R
