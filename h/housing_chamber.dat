40|$|Damage to the {{eye from}} blast {{exposure}} can occur {{as a result of}} the overpressure air-wave (primary injury), flying debris (secondary injury), blunt force trauma (tertiary injury), and/or chemical/thermal burns (quaternary injury). In this study, we investigated damage in the contralateral eye after a blast directed at the ipsilateral eye in the C 57 Bl/ 6 J and DBA/ 2 J mouse. Assessments of ocular health (gross pathology, electroretinogram recordings, optokinetic tracking, optical coherence tomography and histology) were performed at 3, 7, 14 and 28 days post-trauma. Olfactory epithelium and optic nerves were also examined. Anterior pathologies were more common in the DBA/ 2 J than in the C 57 Bl/ 6 and could be prevented with non-medicated viscous eye drops. Visual acuity decreased over time in both strains, but was more rapid and severe in the DBA/ 2 J. Retinal cell death was present in approximately 10 % of the retina at 7 and 28 days post-blast in both strains. Approximately 60 % of the cell death occurred in photoreceptors. Increased oxidative stress and microglial reactivity was detected in both strains, beginning at 3 days post-injury. However, there was no sign of injury to the olfactory epithelium or optic nerve in either strain. Although our model directs an overpressure air-wave at the left eye in a restrained and otherwise protected mouse, retinal damage was detected in the contralateral eye. The lack of damage to the olfactory epithelium and optic nerve, as well as the different timing of cell death as compared to the blast-exposed eye, suggests that the injuries were due to physical contact between the contralateral eye and the <b>housing</b> <b>chamber</b> of the blast device and not propagation of the blast wave through the head. Thus we describe a model of mild blunt eye trauma...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{instruments}} for areal topography measurement {{can be especially}} sensitive to noise when scanning is required. Such noise has different sources, including those internally generated and external sources from the environment [1]. For some instruments, {{it is not always}} possible to evaluate each single contributor. Nevertheless, it is possible to evaluate the noise added to the output during the normal use of the instrument. Such noise is defined in ISO 25178 part 605 [1] as “measurement noise”. In this work, the measurement noise is assessed for a commercial point autofocus instrument (Mitaka MLP- 3 SP), installed in the manufacturing metrology laboratory at The University of Nottingham. The investigation is carried out by areal acquisitions of 100 µm× 100 µmwith a 100 ×magnification objective and a sampling distance of 0. 1 µm along the x-axis and 1 µm along the y-axis. The measurement noise is evaluated by applying established subtraction and averaging methods described elsewhere [2, 3]. The results reveal a maximum calculated value of 20 nm (subtraction method) and a minimum of 8 nm (subtraction method). An oscillationis observed in the acquired surface topographies, which is due to a thermal drift induced by the air conditioning system. The disturbance can be reduced using the temperature correction tool in the software of the instrument. Experiments performed when the air conditioning system is inactive, showed drift of the instrument due to the temperature which is estimated, in the worst case, as 0. 9 µm/oC(calculated as Sz/ΔT), over one hour measuring time. The investigation was then repeated applying the temperature correction tool and the evaluation of the measurement noise results in a value of 2 nm (both methods). The overall temperature variation, measured in the <b>housing</b> <b>chamber</b> of the instrument, is smaller than 0. 1 o C during each repeated measurement. In conclusion, the point autofocus instrument shows a clear dependence on the environmental noise. The measurement noise uncertainty contributor in the worst case is estimated to be unoise= 20 nmwhen the temperature correction tool Abstract submitted to the www. metprops 2017. se conference is not applied [2]. The use of the built-in temperature correction tool allows the measurement noise uncertainty contributor to be reduced tounoise= 2 nm...|$|E
