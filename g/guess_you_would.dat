6000|$|... "What {{would you}} think of me if I came over to your store and told your {{customers}} that I could sell them goods cheaper than you could? I rather <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be for running me out--and mighty lively, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> And {{the best}} thing you can do now is to stop till the storm lifts. Shouldn't wonder if it did about midnight," [...] said the man, {{stirring}} up the red embers, as if anxious to do something for her comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be hungry, and <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be sleepy," [...] he said, {{in a deep}} musical voice, [...] "so I have {{prepared}} breakfast. Are you ready?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ralph, I <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be busy {{altering}} Fairmead on opportunity, and {{now that}} your sister has {{turned it into a}} palace I should always be afraid of spoiling something; so I have arranged by mail to camp with Hudson, of the next preemption. His place is scarcely a mile away. Miss Lorimer, you don't realize the joys of living as a bachelor, or <b>you</b> <b>would</b> freely forgive me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be off at once, Francisco, {{directly}} {{the ceremony}} was over. I own that I, myself, would have stayed for a {{time to see the}} grand doings in the Piazza, but this child would not hear of our doing so. She said it would be a shame, indeed, if you should arrive home and find no one to greet you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nasmyth {{said he did}} not know, and Acton nodded. [...] "Any way," [...] he rejoined, [...] "we can {{ascertain}} it in the city. Now, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{like that}} man run right out of the neighbourhood? It would be safest, and it might perhaps be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Crying!" [...] Of course I am crying, and I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be crying, [...] too, [...] If {{people were}} telling such stories as they tell about me, about YOU. [...] Oh yes, you can laugh {{if you want}} to, and smoke as you didn't care [...] how, [...] And get your brains {{softened}} like uncle's. Dr. Jones says you're [...] gettin' it now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dolly, Dolly," [...] the agonized mother cried, flinging herself {{upon her}} child's mercy, as it were; [...] "Don't {{be hard on}} me; don't be hard on me! My darling, how could I ever <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{look at it like}} this? How could I ever guess my {{daughter}} and his would see things for herself in so different a light from the light we saw them in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Truly, Sir,' said Catherine, 'I never <b>guessed</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> clog {{yourself}} with a babe in the cradle, and I deemed him more safely nursed at Windsor.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so," [...] Guy said. [...] "I {{should have}} been here before, but I joined the procession, as I <b>guessed</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be there also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{saw your}} smoke, Tom, and <b>guessed</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be glad of {{a mug of}} hot tea. You have seen no signs of Indians, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Gordon laughed. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] he said, [...] "I like that, naturally. I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{have taken}} their view of him once. Well, since {{you can put your}} pride in your pocket, you're evidently growing. There's just one way of putting {{anything}} through here, and that's to take hold and hang right on, no matter what it costs. I guess there's one of the boys wanting you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would,</b> {{and that}} is just what we would do, if we didn't take the long journey south when Jack Frost freezes {{everything}} tight up there where my home is," [...] returned Mrs. Quack. [...] "He comes earlier up there and stays twice as long as he does here, and makes ten times as much ice and snow. We get most of our food in the water or in the mud under the water, as of course you know, and when the water is frozen, there isn't a scrap of anything we can get to eat. We just HAVE to come south. It isn't because we want to, but because we must! There is nothing else for us to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} eight years of her life, Helen {{suffered}} from dementia but gained peace painting watercolors. “They’re abstract but just lyrical and beautiful,” said her daughter Alice in an October 2013 interview with Forbes. “I have two. One’s very happy and…oh, whimsical, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say. Then there’s one she did right before she died. I mean, you could almost tell. She knew.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say so,"--replied Lucy quickly--"but {{there was}} no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did not, and her liking me is every thing. You shan't talk me out of my satisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, {{and there will be no}} {{difficulties}} at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women, indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jimmy, with {{a little}} laugh, [...] "I don't quite know. There were, you see, several reasons. To begin with, I had {{to come out of}} the mail-boat for my year's training, and when that was over there were a good many men on the Company's list to be worked off before they wanted me again. Trade is slack over there, and it seemed wiser to await my turn. After all, it doesn't cost so much to come across second-class and Colonist; and I <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be glad to see me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For me, [...] "the {{last long}} wave;" [...] and a most gentle smooth one it is,' said Averil; 'for you to refit {{for a fresh}} voyage. Dear Leonard, I have often <b>guessed</b> what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Harold's job allowed Mamie Phipps Clark to live {{what she}} {{considered}} a privileged childhood. Black physicians were rare during that time. Her {{mother did not}} need to work to supplement the family income. Clark stated, “I had a very happy childhood. I really did. We were comfortable. How can I tell you I had a happy childhood? I enjoyed everything. I enjoyed school. I loved school. I enjoyed recreation. I enjoyed the little travelling we did. I was very happy. I can’t say it was impoverished, or—for me, it was privileged. For me. Now, by objective standards, I would <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say it was just an average family. But it was a very privileged childhood.” (as cited in Lal, 2002, p. 1) ...|$|E
5000|$|Grevious {{spent most}} of her youth helping her mother and trying to stay out of trouble. Her mother was a {{domestic}} servant: [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> call her a nanny, but she was not called a nanny then. But she did the things that the nannies are doing now and being paid very well for. She raised up children." [...] Grevious attended Constitution Elementary School and then Dunbar Junior and High School, both segregated schools, almost always bringing home good grades. She credited her mother with giving her the drive and self-confidence to succeed: [...] "She instilled in us that we needed to be the very best that we could. That we needed to have a goal and that that goal would mean that we had to depend on other people to help us get there; which meant we couldn't waste our time and energy doing stupid things, getting into trouble." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 27 February 2007, in an {{interview}} with thelondonpaper, Wolf raised questions about his sexuality: [...] "In the same way I don’t know if my sixth album {{is going to be a}} death-metal record or children's pop, I don’t know whether I’m destined to live my life with a horse, a woman or a man. It makes life easier." [...] In a 5 July 2007 interview with the Sydney Star Observer, he confirmed his sexuality: [...] "My sexuality is kind of liberal. I fall in love with men and women. I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> call me bisexual. I like to have sex and fall in love—I don't like giving terminology for my sexuality." [...] Later, in 2009, Wolf told The Guardian that though in the past he has had relationships with women, he currently identifies himself as gay. As an artist, Wolf reflects that he doesn't like to worry about whether he makes a record [...] "too gay or too straight or too this or too that." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{think of}} it! To think of time--of all that retrospection! To think of to-day, and the ages {{continued}} henceforward! Have <b>you</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> yourself <b>would</b> not continue? Have you dreaded these earth-beetles? Have you feared {{the future would}} be nothing to you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. My {{business}} is to <b>guess</b> what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like and carry it {{out as far as}} I can. When I'm right this saves you some trouble and gives me keen satisfaction. It makes me think I am intelligent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You need tell me nothing," [...] {{interrupted}} Joan de Tany. [...] "I have <b>guessed</b> what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> tell me, Norman of Torn. 'The {{spell of}} moonlight and adventure {{is no longer}} upon us'--those are your own words, and still I am glad to call you friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have limned a frightful picture, reverend sir," [...] said Roland Graeme; [...] "yet I <b>guess</b> not whom <b>you</b> <b>would</b> charge {{with the}} purpose of effecting a change so horrible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord, I <b>guessed</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{be walking}} in this garden which joins {{on to that}} of the palace, and--none were about, and--the door in the wall was open. Indeed, it was almost as though I were left alone and unwatched of set purpose. So I came and sought--and found, having a {{question}} to put to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very gladly will I {{show you}} my magic, Hokosa," [...] {{answered}} Owen cheerfully, [...] "since, to speak truth, though I know {{you to be}} wicked, and <b>guess</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be glad {{to be rid of}} me by fair means or foul; yet I have taken a liking for you, seeing in you one who from a sinner may grow into a saint.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, ma'am, they've just {{settled down}} and taken {{possession}} of the whole place. He says {{to me that he}} know'd you'd both want them to make themselves at home, just as if you was there, and they thought they'd better do it. He asked me did I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be home by Monday, and I said I didn't know, but I <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> So says he to his wife, 'Won't that be a jolly lark? We'll just keep house for them here till they come. And he says he would go down to the store and order some things, if there wasn't enough in the house, and he asked her to see what would be needed, which she did, and he's gone down for 'em now. And she says that, as it was Saturday, she'd see that the house was all put to rights; and after breakfast she set me to sweepin'; and it's only by way of her dustin' the parlor and givin' me the little girl to take for a walk that I got off at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> it does. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> {{have had}} to pay money down for the seed, and I'll be glad to let the thing stand over until you have thrashed out. The price doesn't count; {{you can give me}} back as many bushels as you get." ...|$|R
40|$|Wyoming Monument, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, circa 1907 - 1910. Remains of Wyoming Massacre {{victims are}} {{buried under the}} monument. Message reads: "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> thought I <b>would</b> never answer your lovely card, but I have been sick for three weeks. Hoping {{to hear from you}} soon again, I am. " Postmark date: July 9, 1910; Message included...|$|R
6000|$|... "Breakfast, if it wouldn't be {{too much}} trouble. Then, as Farquhar's out, there's {{a piece of paper}} I'd like to give <b>you.</b> <b>Guess</b> it <b>would</b> be safer out of my hands; the police troopers are after me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no; on no {{account the}} doctor. 'Tell a doctor, {{tell the whole}} ship. Besides, I've only got a touch of 'em. You'd never have <b>guessed</b> it, <b>would</b> <b>you?</b> The tooth-wash does the trick. I'll give you the prescription.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The lawyer’s face {{became very}} dark. “I do not profess to {{misunderstand}} you, Mr. Keawe,” said he, “though {{this is an}} ugly business to be stirring in. You may be sure I know nothing, but yet I have a <b>guess,</b> and if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> apply in a certain quarter I think you might have news.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Their lives, sir," [...] resumed Beresteyn more calmly, [...] "depend on the {{inviolability}} {{of their}} secret. You {{are good at}} guessing--will <b>you</b> <b>guess</b> what <b>would</b> happen to those six men if their conversation last night had been overheard and their secret betrayed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dromas," [...] {{said the}} prince impressively--"Come, now, {{my old friend}} and comrade," [...] {{interrupted}} the Greek youth lightly, [...] "don't put on such a long face. I foresee that {{you are about to}} give me a lecture, and I don't want the tone of remonstrance to be the last that I shall hear. I know that I'm a wild, good-for-nothing fellow, and can <b>guess</b> all <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say to me. Let us rather talk of your speedy return to Hellas, for, to tell you the truth, I feel as if the loss of <b>you</b> <b>would</b> leave me like a poor man who has been crippled in the wars. I shall be a mere shadow till you return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another loss of dignity, my child," [...] {{he said to}} her in French, so {{that none}} but Martin-Roget could catch what he said. [...] "I <b>guessed</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> commit some indiscretion, you see, so M. Martin-Roget and myself warned all the people at the inn the moment we arrived. We told them that I was {{travelling}} with a sick daughter who had become crazed through the death of her lover, and believed herself--like most crazed persons do--to be persecuted and oppressed. You have seen the result. They pitied you. Even the serving-maids smiled. It would have been wiser to remain silent." ...|$|R
