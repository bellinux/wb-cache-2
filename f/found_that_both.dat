5|$|AAC {{systems for}} this {{population}} generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those {{with little or no}} functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E
5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E
5|$|Geldray {{took part}} in the Normandy {{landings}} with the Prinses Irene Brigade, but was injured by a bomb blast and spent time in a military hospital. Although he did not incur long-term injuries, he suffered from recurring nightmares in the following years. After the liberation of Amsterdam, Geldray travelled to the city to find his parents who had been resident when the Germans invaded. He <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> parents and his sister Xaviere had been killed in a concentration camp by the Nazis. At the end of the war, Geldray returned to Paris and once again found work with Ray Ventura's orchestra for two years, before returning to London in 1947.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} the venom of four Sistrurus pit viper species found {{significant}} variation in the toxicity to mice. This variation {{was related to the}} proportion of small mammals in the diet of those species. The idea that Sistrurus venom had evolved to accommodate a mammal-based diet was supported by phylogenetic analysis. The researchers suggested that the basis for the difference in toxicity was the difference in muscle physiology in the various prey animals. Two lineages of elapid snakes, common sea snakes and Laticauda sea kraits, have independently colonized marine environments, and shifted to a very simple diet based on teleosts, or ray-finned fish. A 2005 study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> these lineages have a much simpler set of venom proteins than their terrestrial relatives on the Australian continent, which have a more varied and complex diet. These findings were confirmed by a 2012 study, which compared the venoms of Toxicocalamus longissimus, a terrestrial species, and Hydrophis cyanocinctus, a marine species, both within the subfamily Hydrophiinae (which is also within the Elapid family). Despite being closely related to one another, the marine species had a significantly simpler set of venom proteins. The venoms of the sea snakes are nonetheless among the most toxic venoms known. It has been argued that since sea snakes are typically unable to prevent the escape of bitten prey, their venoms have evolved to act very rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, a Spanish Learjet {{operated}} by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and {{collided with a}} van heading eastward on the A40 Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all suffered minor injuries. The ensuing investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accidents Investigation Branch <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> the crew's lack of understanding English and military air traffic control procedures had {{contributed significantly to the}} crash. Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt's redefined Runway 25. In addition, aggregate-filled safety pits were installed {{at each end of the}} runway by 21 January 1998 to protect road users in the event of another business jet or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end of the runway. The House of Commons Transport Select Committee considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible offshoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested. These suggestions were opposed by then MP for Ruislip-Northwood, John Wilkinson, and eventually progressed no further.|$|E
