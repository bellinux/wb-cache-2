50|$|Another {{important}} {{principle of}} Ghana's foreign policy involves the closest <b>possible</b> <b>cooperation</b> with neighbouring countries {{with which the}} people of Ghana share cultural history, ties of blood, and economics. The results have included various bilateral trade and economic agreements and permanent joint commissions involving Ghana and its immediate neighbours, sometimes {{in the face of}} latent ideological and political differences and mutual suspicion, as well as numerous reciprocal state visits by high-ranking officials. These measures have contributed significantly to subregional cooperation, development, and the reduction of tension.|$|R

Several types of orbital-orders were found to develop large optical second harmonic generation, signaling broken-inversion-symmetry distinct from their bulk forms and films on (100) substrates.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we survey some {{applications}} of Scarf’s Lemma. First, we introduce {{the notion of}} fractional core for NTU-games, which is always nonempty by the Lemma. Stable allocation is a general solution concept for games where both the players and their <b>possible</b> <b>cooperations</b> can have capacities. We show {{that the problem of}} finding a stable allocation, given a finitely generated NTU-game with capacities, is always solvable by a variant of Scarf’s Lemma. Finally, we describe the interpretation of these results for matching games. ...|$|R

A longer contract leads to more rent seeking at a contract assignment stage, as the firms value the contract higher. On the other hand, the contract has to be assigned less often, which of course leads to less rent seeking. Finally, a longer contract makes a <b>possible</b> <b>cooperation</b> between the firms solving the rent-seeking problem more difficult to sustain...|$|R
