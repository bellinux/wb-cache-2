Level 1 was then traced and then Level 2 and Level 3. The distance between these levels is 60m as previously the opening systems of the chimneys (raises) were complex and dangerous. With the acquisition in 1974 of a Raise Borer the distance between levels (Level 3) increased to 90m. There is a <b>drainage</b> <b>level</b> at the mine (Level 530), 30m below Level 2 where in past mining was also done. All the drainage from the mine leaves through this gallery.

50|$|Although the Third District Commissioners were {{established}} by the Act, in practice smaller areas within the District, known as <b>Drainage</b> <b>Levels,</b> obtained their own Acts of Parliament to authorise specific works. Thus there were <b>Drainage</b> <b>Levels</b> for Greetwell; Stainfield, Barlings and Fiskerton; Bardney, Southrey and Stixwold; and Tattershall. The Greetwell Drainage District was established by an Act obtained in 1861. Five Commissioners managed the Level, {{and to be a}} Commissioner, either he or his wife had to own at least 20 acre within the District, or be an occupier of at least 40 acre. Because of the increased volumes of water which would be pumped into the Witham, the Commissioners had to pay £5 per year to the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR). The GNR were the owners of the Witham Navigation, and the money was for maintenance of the banks of the river. The Greetwell Level covered an area of around 1500 acre, but the amount of water that had to be managed was disproportionate, as water from the higher ground to the north found its way into the drains, and the banks of the Witham were porous, resulting in significant seepage out of the river and into the drains.|$|R

50|$|Small scale {{coal mining}} {{had been carried}} on since the Middle Ages where coal seams outcropped in Worsley and the {{surrounding}} area. John Edgerton, the first Duke of Bridgewater, bought the Worsley estate in 1630. After inheriting the estate in 1748 the third Duke was keen to exploit the resources under his largely agricultural estate but the coal mines he inherited were small and particularly wet as water percolated through porous sandstone above the coal. The problem was solved by driving an underground level intersecting the coal seams northwards towards Walkden from the Bridgewater Canal into the rock face of an old quarry at the Delph. This level served two purposes, it drained the coal workings and provided a means of transporting coal out of the mines. The Worsley Navigable Levels developed into an extensive system of underground canals branching from the original level. The mine workings were also accessed by several shafts sunk along the main <b>drainage</b> <b>level</b> providing access for colliers and materials. These included Wood Pit, Ingles Pit and Kempnough Pit in Worsley and Edge Fold Pits and Magnall's Pit in Walkden. Workshops were built at Walkden.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Extraction of coal by {{longwall}} mining methods has improved greatly over recent years with tonnage rates per week now surpassing yearly tonnes {{of a few}} years ago. As mines go deeper and tonnage rates increase then gas emission also increases.

The input data to the model includes the gas reservoir properties relevant to underground coal seams and extraction of coal using the longwall technique to evaluate the release of gas into the mine workings. Variations in weekly production, face airflow quantities, the efficiency of gas <b>drainage</b> <b>levels</b> and differing face widths can be tested using the model.

40|$|In studies {{concerning}} rainwater lenses on {{a parcel}} scale in brackish polder areas {{it is assumed}} that infiltrated rainwater flows through the rainwater lens and seeps to the watercourses. This freshwater system is supposed to be superimposed on the brackish diffuse upward seepage system. This study investigates the influence of field drainage on the dynamic behaviour of fresh rainwater lenses and the risk of salinization of the root zone. Observations presented in this paper show that shallow water and salt movements in clayey polders are more complex and more dynamic than previously thought. On 18 parcels 2 D geo-electrical resistivity imaging profiles were measured, which give a good spatial and temporal representation of the salinity distribution of the groundwater. It appears that during wet periods upconing of brackish groundwater appears under pipe drains and ditches, which drain a mixture of fresh meteoric water and deep brackish groundwater. Between drainpipes small rainwater lenses develop. During the dry season, when the groundwater table drops below the <b>drainage</b> <b>level,</b> brackish soil moisture stays behind.

40|$|There is {{a general}} belief that high levels of arsenic are found in waters of the {{northern}} states of Mexico. In order to test this hypothesis, research was conducted {{with the objective of}} determining arsenic levels in waters of the San Pedro River located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. From October 2005 to August 2006 on a monthly basis, water samples were collected at five points along the San Pedro River. Three repetitions were collected at each point resulting in a total of 165 water samples. Total arsenic concentration was L- 1 detected in an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-POE) model 2100 by Perkin Elmer. The arsenic concentrations in waters of the San Pedro River ranged from 0. 0110 mg L- 1 to 0. 587 mg L- 1 with a mean of 0. 104 mg L- 1 ± 0. 234 mg.

40|$|Conservation {{genetics}} is {{a powerful}} tool to assess the population structure of species and provides a framework for informing management of freshwater ecosystems. As lotic habitats become fragmented, the need to assess gene flow for species of conservation management becomes a priority. The eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis) is a large, fully aquatic paedamorphic salamander. Many populations are experiencing declines throughout their geographic range, yet the genetic ramifications of these declines are currently unknown. To this end, we examined levels of genetic variation and genetic structure at both range-wide and drainage (hierarchical) scales. We collected 1, 203 individuals from 77 rivers throughout nine states from June 2007 to August 2011. Levels of genetic diversity were relatively high among all sampling locations. We detected significant genetic structure across populations (Fst values ranged from 0. 001 between rivers within a single watershed to 0. 218 between states). We identified two genetically differentiated groups at the range-wide scale: 1) the Ohio River drainage and 2) the Tennessee River drainage. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) based on landscape-scale sampling of basins within the Tennessee River drainage revealed the majority of genetic variation (, 94 – 98 %) occurs within rivers.

40|$|Diffuse {{emission}} from {{agricultural land}} is a major, persistent source of {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} in surface waters. In this contribution, we present field experiments {{of a series of}} robust options to remove nitrate and phosphorus at field <b>drainage</b> <b>level.</b> Nitrate removal was enhanced by stimulating naturally occurring denitrification by adding wood chips. The results showed that the initial removal rates were high (between 60 and 80 %). Efficiency decreases in case of periodic presence of oxygen. The concentrations of phosphate in the effluent showed peaks during the first year at high temperatures and l ow water discharge. The emission of nitrous oxide to the surface above the drains was negligible, but was increased at the ends of the drains. It is estimated that the long-term efficiency depends on good control of the water levels and flow rates in the filter beds. Phosphorus removal was enhanced by using iron-oxide coated sand as filter material. Three methods were tested: drains enveloped with iron oxide coated sand, an edge of field reactor and a slow sand filter reactor at the downstream end of the drainage canal. Results show that up to 95 % of the phosphorus can be removed. A reduction of the hydraulic conductivity during the experimental period reduced the efficiency of the edge of field reactor and the slow sand filter reactor. For all phosphorus treatment options tested, high removal efficiencies could be reached and no negative side -effects were found...|$|E
40|$|Populations of Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvierii have declined throughout their native range {{as a result}} of habitat fragmentation, overharvest, and introductions of nonnative trout that have hybridized with or displaced native populations. The degree to which these factors have impacted the current genetic population structure of Yellowstone {{cutthroat trout}} populations is of primary interest for their conservation. In this study, we examined the genetic diversity and genetic population structure of Yellowstone cutthroat trout in Idaho and Nevada with data from six polymorphic microsatellite loci. A total of 1, 392 samples were analyzed from 45 sample locations throughout 11 major river drainages. We found that levels of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation varied extensively. The Salt River drainage, which is representative of the least impacted migration corridors in Idaho, had the highest levels of genetic diversity and low levels of genetic differentiation. High levels of genetic differentiation were observed at similar or smaller geographic scales in the Portneuf River, Raft River, and Teton River drainages, which are more altered by anthropogenic disturbances. Results suggested that Yellowstone cutthroat trout are naturally structured at the major river <b>drainage</b> <b>level</b> but that habitat fragmentation has altered this structuring. Connectivity should be restored via habitat restoration whenever possible to minimize losses in genetic diversity and to preserve historical processes of gene flow, life history variation, and metapopulation dynamics.

40|$|Phreatic {{groundwater}} dynamics {{are one of}} {{the most}} important land characteristics for agriculture, nature development and other land uses. In Belgium, these dynamics are usually estimated from the natural drainage classes, indicated on the Belgian soil map. This information is however partly outdated, due to human intervention (artificial <b>drainage,</b> <b>levelling,</b> groundwater extraction) and –possibly- climate change. Moreover, these morphological classes were not based on actual groundwater measurements. Two groups of methods to update the old map using measured groundwater levels were applied at two locations in Flanders. A first group are 'relabeling' methods. These methods preserve the spatial structure of the old map, but assign new classes to it based on the new groundwater level observations. A second method 'remapping' uses areawide high-resolution digital auxiliary information to remap the area and create new mapping boundaries. These methods were applied to two different locations in Flanders: the valley of river Dijle (800 ha, south of Leuven) and an area close to the village of Kluizen (300 ha, east of Ghent).

40|$|The Westhoek {{nature reserve}} is a dune area {{situated}} along the French-Belgian border. Below the dunes a fresh-water lens is found. A particular distribution of salt-water occurring above fresh-water is found under the adjacent shore. This less known water quality distribution is in dynamic equilibrium. A 2 D density dependent groundwater flow model was made using the MOCDENS 3 D code. First, the groundwater flow {{and water quality}} evolution under the shore and in the dunes are modeled. Then the possible impact of sea level rise is simulated {{for a number of}} different scenarios. These scenarios reflect different reactions of coastal morphology and human intervention on the sea level rise. Depending on the scenario, the extent of the shore's salt-water lens can increase, decrease or even completely disappear. Simultaneously, the extent of the dune's fresh-water lens can significantly be altered. The simulations illustrate also, besides the effects of sea level rise, that changes in boundary conditions (<b>drainage</b> <b>levels,</b> shore morphology, sea water level), either natural or human induced, can importantly alter the water quality distribution.

BACKGROUND:: POPF remains the main complication after DP. METHODS:: This was a prospective, open, randomized, study in which patients undergoing elective DP were randomized to standard surgical suturing or stapling with or without TachoSil. The primary end point was the incidence of POPF according to International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula criteria. Amylase level in drainage fluid, number of days until removal of drain, and duration of hospital stay were secondary end points. RESULTS:: A total of 275 patients were enrolled at 19 centers over a 2 -year period (TachoSil, n = 145; standard, n = 130). Twenty percent of procedures were laparoscopic and 21 % were spleen-preserving resections. The incidence of POPF was not significantly different between groups (TachoSil, 62 %; standard 68 %; P = 0. 267). Grade A fistula rate was similar in both groups (TachoSil 54 %; standard 55 %), whereas the grade B + C fistula rate was 8 % with TachoSil versus 14 % without (P = 0. 139). Amylase <b>drainage</b> <b>level</b> on postoperative day 1 was significantly reduced with TachoSil (P = 0. 025).

The dual drainage approach {{is based on the}} joint analysis of both upper and lower <b>drainage</b> <b>levels,</b> and the flow transfer is one of the relevant elements to define properly this joint behaviour. This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical investigation about the inlet efficiency definition. A full scale (1 : 1) test platform located in the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) reproduces both the runoff process in streets and the water entering the inlet. Data from tests performed on this platform allow the inlet efficiency to be estimated as a function of significant hydraulic and geometrical parameters. A reproduction of these tests through a numerical three-dimensional code (Flow- 3 D) has been carried out simulating this type of flow by solving the RANS equations. The aim of the work was to reproduce the hydraulic performance of a previously tested grated inlet under several flow and geometric conditions using Flow- 3 D as a virtual laboratory. This will allow inlet efficiencies to be obtained without previous experimental tests. Moreover, the 3 D model allows {{a better understanding of the}} hydraulics of the flow interception and the flow patterns approaching the inlet. Preprin...|$|R
