In this paper, {{we examine the}} fitness {{costs and benefits of}} high mating rates, using flies with low or <b>high</b> <b>early</b> mating rates. We show that <b>high</b> <b>early</b> mating rates are beneficial as they increase the total number of matings gained by a male for a given lifespan. However, males with <b>high</b> <b>early</b> mating rates suffer a cost through lowered survival. There was no consistent effect of male mating rate on female egg production or on male fertility. As higher mating rates are associated with larger accessory gland size, we hypothesize that the extra production of accessory gland products in <b>high</b> <b>early</b> mating males is responsible for much of the cost of reduced longevity...|$|R

40|$|SummaryStreptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) causes <b>high</b> <b>early</b> {{mortality}} in pneumococcal pneumonia, which {{is characterized by}} acute lung injury (ALI). The molecular mechanisms underlying ALI and the <b>high</b> <b>early</b> mortality remain unknown. Despite recent studies that identify deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD) as a key regulator for T cell development, tumor cell proliferation, and NF-κB transcription factor signaling, its role in regulating bacteria-induced lethality, however, is unknown. Here, we showed that CYLD deficiency protected mice from S. pneumoniae pneumolysin (PLY) -induced ALI and lethality. CYLD was highly induced by PLY, and it inhibited MKK 3 -p 38 kinase-dependent expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) in lung, thereby potentiating ALI and mortality. Thus, CYLD is detrimental for host survival, thereby indicating a mechanism underlying the <b>high</b> <b>early</b> mortality of pneumococcal pneumonia...|$|R

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>early</b> vigour (plant {{dry matter}} in the early {{development}} stages) in sunflower may be a desirable character under water-limited environments as it may contribute to higher transpiration efficiency and reduced soil evaporation. However a <b>high</b> <b>early</b> vigour causes a more rapid use of soil water, which may threaten crop water supply during seed filling. This is also influenced by the seasonal pattern of rainfall and genotype season length. The objective {{of this research was}} to simulate the performance of cultivars of sunflower differing in season length and early vigour under a Mediterranean climate. A simulation model of the sunflower crop, OILCROP-SUN, was modified and used to find the optimum combination of early vigour and season length of the genotypes for different environments. Field experiments were carried out during 1992, 1993 and 1994 in Cordoba, Spain (38 °N). Sunflower populations with similar genetic background but with differences in early vigour were used to study the association of this trait with other characters and with the genetic parameters required to run the model. Changes in early vigour were simulated by modifying leaf growth rate in the model. The field experiments showed that <b>high</b> <b>early</b> vigour, as measured by stem volume 425 °Cd after emergence, is not related to reduced root growth and is not associated with season length. Simulations showed that the highest seed yield is obtained using genotypes with <b>high</b> <b>early</b> vigour, provided that their season length is long enough for the growing conditionsPeer reviewe...|$|R
