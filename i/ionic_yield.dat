40|$|Numerous {{investigators}} (1) {{have shown}} that exposure of solutions of enzymes to ionizing radiation results in loss of enzymatic activity. Dale and his coworkers (2, 3) demonstrated that the enzyme molecules are not inactivated by x-rays directly, but indirectly, through reaction with intermediate products formed {{by the action of}} the ionizing radiations on the solvent. The hypothesis of the indirect action of radiation was originally proposed and developed in great detail by Risse (4) and Fricke et al. (5 - 7), who used principally inorganic and simple organic compounds as their test materials. Such indirect reactions are usually characterized (6, 8) by a reaction yield which is independent of the concentration of the solute when this is above a certain value characteristic of the system.

Given the resonant-like behavior of the quantum yield profiles for induction of Double Strand Breaks (DSBs), Single Strand Breaks (SSBs) and loss of the supercoiled DNA form, several theoretical and experimental studies concerning dissociative electron attachment (DEA) to biological relevant molecules in the gas-phase have been performed. In the last few years, special attention has also been given to electron transfer processes in potassium-(bio) molecule collisions [2]. This dissociation mechanism represents an alternative approach to mimic electron driven dissociation reactions within the physiological medium. The scientific community has {{become more aware of}} the importance of studies on electron driven reactions in sulphur containing biomolecules, in order to further investigate the role of sulphur in redox reactions. Recent studies on DEA to sulphur containing analogues of thymine and uracil show that the main fragmentation is assigned to sulphur containing anions [3, 4]. Here we give the first set of comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis on the electron interactions with aminomethane sulphonic acid and taurine, two sulphur containing compounds.

For these purposes, experimental measurements of the <b>ionic</b> <b>yields</b> {{as a function of}} the collision energy, total cross sections corresponding to the formation of negative and positive ions, energy loss spectra and differential cross sections with energy loss selection, were performed.

The exact analytical solutions which describe the classical nuclear motion of a diatomic type system in a vibronic final state represented by a Morse potential after an electronic transition take place were obtained. Using these solutions, some analytical expressions corresponding to the total cross sections of ion-pair formation in atom-molecule collisions, were deduced. Those solutions, in some cases, can give insight into the timing of the bondstretching in comparison with the autodetachment and collision times. A special experimental remark was given to those molecular targets in which the parent ion has a long enough lifetime to be observed and there is intramolecular rearrangement before the dissociation have occurred. From time-of-flight spectra it was possible to get information on the realaxation times and kinetic energy release (KER) in the dissociation. In some aromatic targets there is even time enough to occur scrambling of energy resulting in a statistical dissociation. It was shown that in the case of collisions of potassium atoms with nitromethane, the valence electron of the alkali atom is promoted to three different states of the parent negative ion, and the dissociation of the two #pi#"* states leads to dominant formation of O"-, either by direct dissociation or by previous internal rearrangement of the parent ion. Besides, the transition of the electron to a #sigma#"* state leads predominantly to the formation of NO_ 2 _- and free electrons, these ones produced by autodetachment of the transient CH_ 3 NO_ 2 _-ion. It seems reasonable to conclude from the several targets studied that for molecules exhibiting electronic delocalization, there is always a next LUMO #pi#"* involved in the electronic transition. In which concerns positive molecular ionization it was clearly shown that ionic of the species formed in the collision are quite different from those formed by direct ionization and at collision energies of the order of few hundreds of eV, the positive ionization competes efficiently with negative ionizationAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|UCM 1612 + 1308 {{is a new}} emission-line galaxy {{identified}} {{in the context of}} the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) survey. This object was classified as Blue Compact Galaxy (BCG) from photometric data. A detailed spectroscopic study from new optical observations is presented now. The physical conditions and chemical composition are derived. The <b>ionic</b> abundances <b>yield</b> to a metallicity of 0. 23 ± 0. 01 Z_⊙ and a very low nitrogen to oxygen abundances ratio, log (N/O) = - 1. 74 ± 0. 07, supporting a primary nucleosynthesis origin for the nitrogen. The same value has been obtained for the sulfur to oxygen ratio. The comparison of the helium abundance with the oxygen and nitrogen abundances evidences a quickly enrichment of oxygen produced by massive stars. The ionizing cluster has been analyzed yielding a relatively low ionization parameter, log bar Ū=- 3, total number of stars, log N^* = 6. 18, stellar mass, log M^* = 5. 71 M_⊙, and gas mass log M_g = 7. 42 M_⊙. A lower limit of the dust mass, log M_dust = 5. 65 M_⊙, has been obtained from the IRAS fluxes. The observed data and derived parameters, when interpreted with the evolutionary synthesis models by Leitherer & Heckman (1995), point out to an instantaneous burst with an age of log t= 6. 7 yr...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of ionic liquid-methanol cosolvent system to both extract bio-oil and simultaneously pretreat the carbohydrate fraction of jatropha and safflower biomass for enzymatic hydrolysis to fermentable sugars is presented. Although pretreatment {{with either the}} cosolvent or pure <b>ionic</b> liquid <b>yielded</b> comparable hydrolysis kinetics and fermentable sugar yields on safflower whole seeds, the addition of alcohol to the ionic liquid was necessary to optimally recover both bio-oil and fermentable sugars. The ionic liquid [C 2 mim][Ac] was far more effective than [C 2 mim][MeSO 4] with optimum processing conditions occurring at a cosolvent concentration of 70 – 30 [*]wt% of [C 2 mim][Ac] to methanol and a processing temperature of 120 °C. Under these conditions, {{the majority of the}} bio-oil was extracted and 25. 4 [*]wt% (safflower) and 14. 3 [*]wt% (jatropha) of the whole seed biomass were recovered as fermentable sugars. The recovery of fermentable sugars from the carbohydrate fraction was as high as 74 % and 78 % for jatropha and safflower seeds, respectively, when using [C 2 mim][Ac] cosolvent. A preliminary theoretical analysis of two potential oil seed processing pathways using the cosolvent system suggested that the corecovery of bio-oil, fermentable sugars, and a protein rich meal can recover a majority of the energy contained in the original biomass—a result that improves upon the traditional approach of solely extracting bio-oil...|$|R
40|$|New {{materials}} for l-proline recycling have been developed. These materials {{have been applied}} to the l-proline-catalyzed aldol reaction between acetone and several aldehydes. The l-proline has been supported {{on the surface of}} modified silica gels with a monolayer of covalently attached ionic liquid with or without additional adsorbed <b>ionic</b> liquid. Good <b>yields</b> and ee values, comparable with those obtained under homogeneous conditions, have been obtained especially with imidazolinium-modified and 4 -methylpyridinium-modified silica gels. Moreover, these materials have been easily recovered by simple filtration and studies about their reuse have been carried out. These studies showed that these materials can be used at least up to seven times. Finally, in the case of imidazolinium-modified silica gel, investigations showed that this support can be regenerated giving again a recyclable material with high isolated yields and reproducible ee values up to 13 cycles...|$|R
