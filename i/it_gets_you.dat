500|$|Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald praised Webber's {{ability to}} [...] "... build {{individual}} moments [...] the crackle of a bed-sheet which has grown an ice overcoat after being hung {{out to dry}} in the wintry air ...," [...] but opined that he failed to [...] "... invest these elegant reproductions {{of the art of}} the period with the emotional charge you've been set up to expect." [...] Griet and Vermeer's relationship, Hall wrote, lacked [...] "... the sense of two people breathing easily in one another's company." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, remarked that Girl with a Pearl Earring [...] "... brings off something that few dramas about artists do. <b>It</b> <b>gets</b> <b>you</b> to see the world through new– which is to say, old– eyes." [...] Gleiberman added that while Johansson is silent for most of the film, [...] "... the interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic." [...] In Sight & Sound, David Jays wrote that [...] "Johansson's marvellous performance builds on the complex innocence of her screen presence (Ghost World, Lost in Translation)." [...] Jays concluded his review by praising Webber and Serra's ability to [...] "... deftly deploy daylight, candle and shadow, denying our desire to see clearly just as Vermeer refuses to explicate the situations in his paintings. The film's scenarios may be unsurprising, but Webber's solemn evocation of art in a grey world gives his story an apt, unspoken gravity." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Guardian {{described}} the flight as having [...] "cult status" [...] in Washington Heights, a Dominican area of Manhattan. Belkis Lora, {{a relative of}} a passenger on the crashed flight, said [...] "Every Dominican in New York has either taken that flight or knows someone who has. <b>It</b> <b>gets</b> <b>you</b> there early. At home there are songs about it." [...] Seth Kugel, writing for The New York Times, said, [...] "For many Dominicans in New York, these journeys home are the defining metaphor of their complex push-pull relationship with their homeland; they embody, vividly and poignantly, the tug between their current lives and their former selves. That fact gave Monday's tragedy a particularly horrible resonance for New York's Dominicans." [...] He also said, [...] "Even before Monday's crash, Dominicans had developed a complex love-hate relationship with American Airlines, complaining about high prices and baggage restrictions even while favoring the carrier over other airlines that used to travel the same route." [...] David Rivas, {{the owner of the}} New York City travel agency Rivas Travel, said, [...] "For the Dominican to go to Santo Domingo during Christmas and summer is like the Muslims going to Mecca." ...|$|E

And if everybody who'd got gifts and altruistic ideas gave themselves up to it, then evidently only the mean and greedy lot would breed and have the glory. They'd get everything. Every blessed thing. There wouldn't be an option they didn't hold.

6000|$|How few men, {{says the}} Oldest Member, possess the proper golfing temperament! How few indeed, {{judging by the}} sights I see here on Saturday afternoons, possess any {{qualification}} at all for golf except a pair of baggy knickerbockers and enough money {{to enable them to}} pay for the drinks {{at the end of the}} round. The ideal golfer never loses his temper. When I played, I never lost my temper. Sometimes, it is true, I may, after missing a shot, have broken my club across my knees; but I did it in a calm and judicial spirit, because the club was obviously no good and I was going to get another one anyway. To lose one's temper at golf is foolish. <b>It</b> <b>gets</b> <b>you</b> nothing, not even relief. Imitate the spirit of Marcus Aurelius. [...] "Whatever may befall thee," [...] says that great man in his [...] "Meditations", [...] "it was preordained for thee from everlasting. Nothing happens to anybody which he is not fitted by nature to bear." [...] I like to think that this noble thought came to him after he had sliced a couple of new balls into the woods, and that he jotted it down on the back of his score-card. For there can be no doubt that the man was a golfer, and a bad golfer at that. Nobody who had not had a short putt stop on the edge of the hole could possibly have written the words: [...] "That which makes the man no worse than he was makes life no worse. It has no power to harm, without or within." [...] Yes, Marcus Aurelius undoubtedly played golf, and all the evidence seems to indicate that he rarely went round in under a hundred and twenty. The niblick was his club.|$|E
6000|$|Charming and [...] "gracious" [...] your letter, {{and welcome}} sign of your {{restoration}} in more senses than one. Though I see you, alas, nowadays, at such intervals, I feel this extremely individual little island to be appreciably less its characteristic self {{when you are}} away from it, and sensibly more so, and breathing the breath of relief, when <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>you</b> back and plumps you down with a fond [...] "There!" [...] on your high hilltop, a beacon-like depository of traditions no one else so admirably embodies. Your invitation to come and share {{for a few days}} your paradise with you finds me, I am very sorry to say, in a hindered and helpless moment. I am obliged to recognise the stern fact that I can't leave home just now. I have had a complicated and quite overwhelmed summer--agreeably, interestingly, anxiously and worriedly, even; but inevitably and logically--waves of family history, a real deluge, having rolled over my bowed head and left me, as to the question of work, production, time, ease and other matters, quite high and dry. I went on Saturday last to Dover to see my sister-in-law off to the Continent--and as she took a night boat had to stop there over Sunday, at the too-familiar (and too other things) Lord Warden; after which I came back to bury (yes, bury!) my precious, my admirable little Peter, whom I think you had met. (He passed away on Sunday at St. Leonard's, fondly attended by the local [...] "canine specialist"--after three days of dreadful little dysentery.) Thus is constituted the first moment of my being by myself for about four months. It may last none too long, and is, already, to be tempered by the palpable presence of Gosse from Saturday p.m. to Monday next. So, with arrears untold, in every direction, with preoccupations but just temporarily arranged, I feel that I absolutely must sit close for a good many weeks to come; in fact till the New Year--after which I depart. I don't quite know what becomes of me then, but I don't, distinctly, for a third year, hibernate here. My London rooms are as probably as sordidly let for 1901 (though not to a certainty,) and it will (my wretched fate--not fat--fate) depend more or less upon that. My brother, ill, but thank God, better, wants me to come to Egypt with him and his wife for 12 weeks--his health demanding it, but he only going if I will accompany him. So the pistol is at my head. Will it bring me down? I've a positive terror of it. The alternatives are Rome (of which I've a still greater terror than of Egypt, for it's an equal complication and less reward,) or De Vere Gardens, or a more squalid perch in town if De V.G. are closed to me. The latter, the last-named, doom is what I really want. If I should, clingingly, clutchingly, stick to these shores, I might then, were it agreeable to you, be able to put in three days of Underbank, which I've never seen in its tragic winter mood. But these things are in the lap of the gods.|$|E
60|$|Now then we {{may come}} to Harvey himself. When you read Harvey's treatise, {{which is one of}} the most {{remarkable}} scientific monographs with which I am acquainted--it occupies between 50 and 60 pages of a small quarto in Latin, and is as terse and concise as it possibly can be--when you come to look at Harvey's work, you will find that he had long struggled with the difficulties of the accepted doctrine of the circulation. He had received from Fabricius, and from all the great authorities of the day, the current view of the circulation of the blood. But he was a man with that rarest of all qualities--intellectual honesty; and by dint of cultivating that great faculty, which is more moral than intellectual, it had become impossible for him to say he believed anything which he did not clearly believe. This is a most uncomfortable peculiarity--for <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>you</b> into all sorts of difficulties with all sorts of people--but, for scientific purposes, it is absolutely invaluable. Harvey possessed this peculiarity in the highest degree, and so it was impossible for him to accept what all the authorities told him, and he looked into the matter for himself. But he was not hasty. He worked at his new views, and he lectured about them at the College of Physicians for nine years; he did not print them until he was a man of fifty years of age; and when he did print them he accompanied them with a demonstration which has never been shaken, and which will stand till the end of time. What Harvey proved, in short, was this (see Fig. 4)--that everybody had made a mistake, for want of sufficiently accurate experimentation as to the actual existence of the fact which everybody assumed. To anybody who looks at the blood-vessels with an unprejudiced eye it seems so natural that the blood should all come out of the liver, and be distributed by the veins to the different parts of the body, that nothing can seem simpler or more plain; and consequently no one could make up his mind to dispute this apparently obvious assumption. But Harvey did dispute it; and when he came to investigate the matter he discovered that it was a profound mistake, and that, all this time, the blood had been moving in just the opposite direction, namely, from the small ramifications of the veins towards the right side of the heart. Harvey further found that, in the arteries, the blood, as had previously been known, was travelling from the greater trunks towards the ramifications. Moreover, referring to the ideas of Columbus and of Galen (for he was a great student of literature, and did justice to all his predecessors), Harvey accepts and strengthens their view of the course of the blood through the lungs, and he shows how it fitted into his general scheme. If you will follow the course of the arrows in Fig. 4 you will see at once that--in accordance with the views of Columbus--the blood passes from the right side of the heart, through the lungs, to the left side. Then, adds Harvey, with abundant proof, it passes through the arteries to all parts of the body; and then, at the extremities of their branches in the different parts of the body, it passes (in what way he could not tell, for his means of investigation did not allow him to say) into the roots of the vents--then from the roots of the veins it goes into the trunk and veins--then to the right side of the heart--and then to the lungs, and so on.|$|E

That, you will observe, makes a complete circuit; and it was precisely here that the originality of Harvey lay. There never yet has been produced, and I do not believe there can be produced, a tittle of evidence to show that, before his time, any one had the slightest suspicion that a single drop of blood, starting in the left ventricle of the heart, passes through the whole arterial system, comes back through the venous system, goes through the lungs, and comes back to the place whence it started. But that is the circulation of the blood, and it was exactly this which Harvey was the first man to suspect, to discover, and to demonstrate.|$|E
