40|$|The {{maximum tolerated dose}} of {{paclitaxel}} {{administered by}} 24 -hour continuous infusion in children is known. Short infusion might offer equivalent antitumour efficacy and reduced haematological toxicity, without increasing the allergic risk. Our aims were to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in children when administered in 3 -h infusion every 3 weeks. Patients older than 6 months, younger than 20 years with refractory malignant solid tumours were eligible when they satisfied standard haematological, renal, hepatic and cardiologic inclusion criteria with life expectancy exceeding 8 weeks. Paclitaxel was administered as a 3 -hour infusion after premedication (dexamethasone, dexchlorpheniramine). Pharmacokinetic analysis and solvent assays (ethanol, cremophor) were performed during the first course. 20 courses were studied in 17 patients; 4 dosage levels were investigated (240 to 420  mg/m 2). No dose-limiting haematological toxicity was observed. Severe acute neurological and allergic toxicity was encountered. One treatment-related death occurred just after the infusion at the highest dosage. <b>Delayed</b> peripheral <b>neurotoxicity</b> and moderate allergic reactions were also encountered. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed dose-dependent clearance of paclitaxel and elevated blood ethanol and Cremophor EL levels.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{follow-up of}} the RTOG 9802 trial that compared 54 Gy of radiotherapy (RT) {{with the same}} RT followed by adjuvant procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy in high-risk low-grade glioma shows a major increase in survival after adjuvant PCV chemotherapy. Median overall survival increased from 7. 8 years to 13. 3 years, with a hazard ratio of death of 0. 59 (log rank: P =. 002). This increase in survival was observed {{despite the fact that}} 77 % of patients who progressed after RT alone received salvage chemotherapy. With this outcome, RT + PCV is now to be considered standard of care for low-grade glioma requiring postsurgical adjuvant treatment. Unfortunately, studies on molecular correlates associated with response are still lacking. This is now the third trial showing benefit from the addition of PCV to RT in grade II or III diffuse glioma. The optimal parameter for selecting patients for adjuvant PCV has not yet been fully elucidated, but several candidate markers have so far emerged. It is still unclear whether temozolomide can replace PCV and whether initial management with chemotherapy only is a safe initial treatment. Potentially, that may adversely affect overall survival, but concerns for <b>delayed</b> RT-induced <b>neurotoxicity</b> may limit acceptance of early RT in patients with expected long term survival.

Di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate was found to phosphorylate all three of these proteins at rates similar to the rate at which neurotoxic esterase is inhibited by di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate. Varying the concentration of di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate or the time of incubation produced similar increases in binding to each of the labelled proteins. This suggests that the reaction rates of di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate with proteins may be described by first-order kinetics, and the concentration of the Michael is complex formed during binding is minimal for all the phosphorylated proteins.

40|$|Hen {{brain and}} spinal cord contain {{a number of}} esterases that hydrolyze phenyl {{valerate}} (PV). Most of this activity is sensitive to inhibition by micromolar concentrations of paraoxon.

40|$|N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated {{neurotoxicity}} may depend, in part, on {{the generation}} of nitric oxide (NO.) and superoxide anion (O 2. -), which react to form peroxynitrite (OONO-). This form of neurotoxicity is thought {{to contribute to a}} final common pathway of injury {{in a wide variety of}} acute and chronic neurologic disorders, including focal ischemia, trauma, epilepsy, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral scelerosis, AIDS dementia, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report that exposure of cortical neurons to relatively short durations or low concentrations of NMDA, S-nitrosocysteine, or 3 -morpholinosydnonimine, which generate low levels of peroxynitrite, induces a <b>delayed</b> form of <b>neurotoxicity</b> predominated by apoptotic features. Pretreatment with superoxide dismutase and catalase to scavenge O 2. - partially prevents the apoptotic process triggered by S-nitrosocysteine or 3 -morpholinosydnonimine. In contrast, intense exposure to high concentrations of NMDA or peroxynitrite induces necrotic cell damage characterized by acute swelling and lysis, which cannot be ameliorated by superoxide dismutase and catalase.

40|$|Acrylamide, 2, 5 -hexanedione, Tri-o-tolyl {{phosphate}} and leptophos {{belong to}} three fundamentally different chemical classes but all four chemicals cause central-peripheral distal axonopathy. Some of these compounds {{have been shown}} to alter brain steady state levels of neurotransmitters or to inhibit the activities of adenosine triphosphatases which are involved in the uptake and storage of biogenic amines. Tests were performed to determine alterations in steady state levels of rat brain norepinephrine and dopamine in response to doses of the above chemicals and of the central nervous system toxin, methyl mercuric chloride sufficient to cause ataxia. Catecholamine synthesis rate constant estimations were performed. Specific activities of tyrosine in brains of control and treatment groups following intravenous injection of labelled tyrosine were compared to determine if passage of tyrosine across the blood-brain barrier were affected by treatments. Levels of the dopamine metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were assayed in all cases. Levels of the norepinephrine metabolite, 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxymethylethyleneglycol sulfate, were assayed in response to acrylamide administration. Animal weights were recorded {{at the beginning and end}} of the treatment period. Rats treated with a cumulative dose of 250 mg/kg acrylamide had significantly lower norepinephrine levels than controls. 2, 5 -hexanedione administration significantly increased the dopamine synthesis rate constant at a cumulative dose of 210 mg/kg. Cumulative doses of 700 and 2100 mg/kg also appeared to elevate norepinephrine and dopamine synthesis rate constants, but values were not statistically significant. Leptophos caused a slight but significant increase in dopamine levels in rats administered a cumulative dose of 75 mg/kg. Methyl mercuric chloride caused variable effects to norephinephrine synthesis rate and lowered dopamine synthesis rate constant at cumulative doses of 5 to 50 mg/kg. No other alterations were seen in levels of catecholamines or of their metabolites, nor in synthesis rate constants of the catecholamines in response to administration of the five neurotoxic compounds. No evidence of altered blood-brain transport of tyrosine was observed at any level of neurotoxins administered. Rats given the highest cumulative doses of all neurotoxins except tri-o-tolyl phosphate gained significantly less weight than control animals.

40|$|<b>Delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> {{induced by}} leptophos, an organophosphorus insecticide, was {{intensified}} in hens when phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at dose of 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg body weight was administered at different time intervals (24 hr, 3 days, and 5 days) for each dose of PMSF after the hens {{were exposed to}} 30 mg/kg (i. v.) of leptophos. The scores for organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) in all groups treated with 120 mg/kg PMSF {{were significantly higher than}} those in the group treated with leptophos only (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01) and the initial signs of OPIDN appeared 2 or 3 days earlier in the former groups than in the latter group. Further, the greater the PMSF post-treatment dose, the more severe were the signs of OPIDN. These findings indicate that post-treatment with PMSF promotes leptophosinduced OPIDN and reduces the period to OPIDN onset. We also examined the effects of various time intervals between PMSF administration and exposure to leptophos on the development of OPIDN. The OPIDN scores in the two groups of hen treated with PMSF on days 3 and 5 after leptophos exposure were high, especially the score of the 5 days treated group became significantly higher on the 18 th and 19 th day after leptophos administration than even that of the 24 hr treated group with PMSF (P< 0. 05). These findings suggest that variations in both the dose of PMSF and the time intervals of PMSF post-treatment may affect the <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> induced by leptophos.

Concomitant application of neuropeptide with PrP(106 – 126) (5 × 10 − 5 M) inhibited the delayed death of neuron-like PC 12 cells. In particular, PACAP 27 inhibited the neurotoxicity of PrP(106 – 126) at low concentrations (> 10 − 15 M), characterized by the deactivation of PrP(106 – 126) -stimulated caspase- 3. The neuroprotective effect of PACAP 27 was antagonized by the selective PKA inhibitor, H 89, or the MAP kinase inhibitor, U 0126.

40|$|The spatio-temporal {{spread of}} axonal {{degeneration}} in organophosphorous neuropathy {{has been studied}} {{by means of the}} teased-fiber technique. Young adult cats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of di-isopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and were killed 14, 18, 20, 21, and 28 days later by intracardiac perfusion with aldehydes. The cats developed clinical signs of <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> 16 to 18 days after DFP injection. A histologic survey of the central and peripheral nervous systems revealed that the topographic distribution of axonal degeneration was characteristic of a dying-back neuropathy. In teased-fiber preparations from the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, we found that the axonal degeneration was initially focal and nonterminal but that the axonal degeneration subsequently spread in a somatofugal direction to involve the entire distal axon. Nerve fibre varicosities and paranodal demyelination preceded the axonal degeneration. It is concluded that neurotoxic organophosphates induce a focal, distal but not terminal axonal degeneration. This "chemical transection" of the axon then precipitates wallerian degeneration of the more distal axon.

This study assesses the occurrence of the necrotizing myopathy in rats in relation to the clinical course and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition after poisoning with organophosphates representative for each of the major types of organophosphate-related neurotoxicity. Marked differences are noted in the duration of cholinergic symptoms and of AChE inhibition after either paraoxon and mipafox, or fenthion poisoning. The necrotizing myopathy begins shortly after the initial decline in AChE activity with all organophosphates studied. Maximal muscle involvement occurs within the first 2 days of the poisoning with all organophosphates studied. The myopathy is not aggravated by a further decline in AChE activity in fenthion poisoning.

Richardson, R. J., Moore, T. B., Kayyali, U. S., and Randall, J. C. (1993). Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 21, 89 - 96. Previous {{work has}} shown that acute {{exposures}} to chlorpyrifos (CPS; diethyl 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridyl phosphorothionate) cannot produce > 70 % inhibition of brain neurotoxic esterase (NTE) and cause organophosphorus compound-induced <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> (OPIDN) unless the dose is well {{in excess of the}} LD 50, necessitating aggressive therapy for cholinergic toxicity. The present study was carried out to determine if repeated doses of CPS at the maximum tolerated daily dose without prophylaxis against cholinergic toxicity could cause cumulative inhibition of NTE and OPIDN. Adult hens were dosed daily for 20 days with CPS (10 mg/kg/day po in 2 ml/kg corn oil) or corn oil (vehicle control) (2 ml/kg/day po) and observed for an additional 4 weeks. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE), brain and lymphocyte NTE, and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities were assayed on Days 0 (control only), 4, 10, 15, 20, and 48. During Days 4 - 20, brain AChE and plasma BuChE activities from CPS-treated hens were inhibited 58 - 70 % and 49 - 80 % of contemporaneous controls, respectively. At 4 weeks after the end of dosing, brain AChE activity in treated birds had recovered to 86 % of control and plasma BuChE activity was 134 % of control. Brain and lymphocyte NTE activities of treated animals throughout the study were 82 - 99 % and 85 - 128 % of control, respectively. Neither brain nor lymphocyte NTE activities in treated hens exhibited cumulative inhibition. The 18 % inhibition of brain NTE seen on days 10 and 20 was significantly, but substantially below the putative threshold for OPIDN. Body weight of treated hens decreased 10 - 25 % during Days 4 - 20 and recovered to 87 % of control {{by the end of the}} study. Some treated hens developed a slight staggering gait during the first week of dosing, which disappeared by the second week. Throughout the 4 -week observation period, all hens appeared normal and were able to perch on a horizontal rod. The results indicate that daily dosing with CPS at a level sufficient to cause significant loss of body weight as well as marked inhibition of brain AChE and plasma BuChE resulted in no significant change in lymphocyte NTE activity, a maximum inhibition of brain NTE of 18 %, no cumulative inhibition of lymphocyte or brain NTE, and no clinical signs of OPIDN...|$|E

Thirty-nine patients with a median age of 43 (range, 18 – 67) and a median KPS of 100 (range, 70 – 100) were treated. Surviving patients now have a median follow-up of 80. 5 months (range, 44 – 142). The median progression-free survival is 78 months, and median overall survival has not been reached. Eighteen patients (46 %) have relapsed. Neither histology nor prior low-grade oligodendroglioma correlated with risk of relapse. Persistent nonenhancing tumor at transplant was identified in our initial report as a significant risk factor for relapse; however, long-term follow-up has not confirmed this finding. Long-term neurotoxicity has developed only in those patients whose disease relapsed and required additional therapy; no patient in continuous remission has developed a delayed neurologic injury. This treatment strategy affords long-term disease control to a subset of patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendroglioma without evidence of <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> or myelodysplasia...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to see if oxidative damage is involved in organophosphorus-induced <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> (OPIDN) and its subsequent alleviation through antioxidants. A total of 72 hens aged 56 weeks were divided into 4 groups (n= 18). Group 1 sham, Groups 2, 3 and 4 were administered chlorpyrifos (CPS) @ 350 mg/kg BW s. c. in divided doses over a period of 24 hrs. To prevent death due to cholinergic toxicity, atropine and 2 -PAM were administered. In group 3, vit. E was administered @ 50 mg/kg p. o 10 days prior to administration of CPS and in group 4 phenytoin @ 50 mg /kg p. o. was administered for 5 days prior to CPS. Signs of OPIDN were scored. Acetyl cholinesterase (AchE) activity in distal spinal cord served as a biomarker of exposure. Sciatic nerve total calcium was estimated, since Ca 2 + is implicated in generation of ROS and in phosphorylation of proteins. Thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase were estimated to assess lipid peroxidation. CPS produced signs of OPIDN that were reversed on 10 th day. There was a decline in AChE activity. Oxidative stress with CPS was manifested by a significant rise i...|$|E
40|$|The {{extracellular}} neurochemistry determines normal {{brain function}} and {{the faith of}} neurons after insults such as stroke. This thesis concerns the effect of extracellular events related to intense neuronal stimulation and stroke, i. e. over-activation of glutamate-receptors and dramatically decreased extracellular Ca 2 +-concentrations, on efflux of neurotoxic and neuroprotective substances. The use of cultured slices of rat hippocampus enabled parallel analysis of efflux in combination with determination of delayed nerve cell death after brief (5 min) overactivation of NMDA-receptors or omission of extracellular Ca 2 + for 15 min. Efflux by NMDA-receptor stimulation was selective and dominated by N-acetylaspartate, the antioxidant glutathione, phosphoethanolamine, taurine and hypotaurine. The efflux induced by concentration at and above 60 ÝM NMDA was paralleled by <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> 24 h later. The efflux pathway is still unknown but {{does not appear to}} involve hemichannels, the Ca 2 +-calmodulin dependent kinase II or NO-synthesis. Efflux activated by omission of extracellular Ca 2 + for 15 min caused an efflux pattern from cultured slices that was dominated by glutathione but lacked N-acetylaspartate, indicating efflux originating from glial cells. This efflux was blocked by gap junction blockers, carbenoxolone, flufenamic acid and endothelin- 1, which indicated efflux from activated so called hemichannels (half gap junctions). The involvement of hemichannels was further strengthened by the inhibitory effect of a mimetic/blocking peptide for Cx 43, the major connexin-protein in astroglial cells. Inhibitors of other putative channels, the P 2 X 7 -receptor and pannexin hemichannels, were without effect. Volume regulated channels were probably not involved as hypertonic medium did not reduce the efflux stimulated by omission of extracellular Ca 2 +. The efflux was mainly of glial origin as cultured slices in which neurons had been degenerated showed similar efflux pattern by omission of Ca 2 +. These results together showed that omission of extracellular Ca 2 + activate opening of glial connexin hemichannels. Omission of extracellular Ca 2 + did not induce delayed nerve cell death as long as glutamate uptake was intact. However, using glutamate uptake blockers revealed that opening of glial hemichannels resulted in glutamate efflux which caused <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> and efflux of N-acetylaspartate, i. e. effects similar to that induced by NMDA-receptor overactivation. In another set of experiments the efflux induced by Ca 2 +-omission from primary astroglial cultures was characterized. Using inhibitors for P 2 X 7 -receptors, gap junctions and connexin hemichannels demonstrated efflux of the neuroprotective substance adenosine via connexin hemichannels. It was also shown that curcumin, an agent which activate a transcription factor which in turn induce transcription of a multi-fold of antioxidant genes, dramatically increase both efflux and intracellular levels of glutathione. The main finding of the work is that opening of astroglial connexin hemichannel cause efflux of neuroprotective substances. However, opening of hemichannels in conditions with reduced capacity for glutamate uptake, such as stroke, can cause additional neurotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum oxyhydroxide (alum) is a crystaline {{compound}} {{widely used}} as an immunologic adjuvant of vaccines. Concerns linked {{to the use of}} alum particles emerged following recognition of their causative role in the so-called macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) lesion detected in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue/syndrome. MMF revealed an unexpectedly long-lasting biopersistence of alum within immune cells in presumably susceptible individuals, stressing the previous fundamental misconception of its biodisposition. We previously showed that poorly biodegradable aluminum-coated particles injected into muscle are promptly phagocytozed in muscle and the draining lymph nodes, and can disseminate within phagocytic cells throughout the body and slowly accumulate in brain. This strongly suggests that long-term adjuvant biopersistence within phagocytic cells is a prerequisite for slow brain translocation and <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity.</b> The understanding of basic mechanisms of particle biopersistence and brain translocation represents a major health challenge, since it could help to define susceptibility factors to develop chronic neurotoxic damage. Biopersistence of alum may be linked to its lysosome-destabilizing effect, which is likely due to direct crystal-induced rupture of phagolysosomal membranes. Macrophages that continuously perceive foreign particles in their cytosol will likely reiterate, with variable interindividual efficiency, a dedicated form of autophagy (xenophagy) until they dispose of alien materials. Successful compartmentalization of particles within double membrane autophagosomes and subsequent fusion with repaired and re-acidified lysosomes will expose alum to lysosomal acidic pH, the sole factor that can solubilize alum particles. Brain translocation of alum particles is linked to a Trojan horse mechanism previously described for infectious particles (HIV, HCV), that obeys to CCL 2 signaling the major inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant...|$|E
40|$|Glutamate-induced <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> after abusive and paroxismal {{activation}} of its receptors {{has been proposed}} to depend upon a sustained increase in intracellular free Ca 2 + [(Ca 2 +]i). To elucidate the temporal and causal relationship between glutamate-induced changes in [Ca 2 +]i and neuronal death, we simultaneously studied the dynamics of [Ca 2 +]i changes in single neurons with the acetoxymethyl ester of fura- 2 and the cell viability by imaging the nuclear penetration of propidium iodide. The main difference between toxic (50 microM) and nontoxic (5 microM) doses of glutamate {{is the lack of}} regulation in [Ca 2 +]i 20 min after glutamate is removed. This protracted rise in [Ca 2 +]i in a single cell is correlated with (r = 0. 87, P less than 0. 01, Spearman's test), and consequently predictive of, the time of appearance of neuronal death, as measured by propidium iodide fluorescence. In addition, the glutamate receptor antagonists dibenzocyclohepteneimine (MK- 801) and 3, 3 -(2 -carboxypiperazine- 4 -yl) propyl 1 -phosphate reduce the acute increase of [Ca 2 +]i induced by glutamate but fail to revert the protracted increase of [Ca 2 +]i, elicited by toxic doses of glutamate. In contrast, the ganglioside GM 1 and the semisynthetic lysoGM 1 with N-acetylsphingosine (LIGA- 4) and lysoGM 1 with N-dichloroacetylsphingosine (LIGA- 20) failed to change the immediate rise of [Ca 2 +]i elicited by glutamate but prevented the protracted increase in [Ca 2 +]i after toxic doses of glutamate. Voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channel blockers (nifedipine, etc.) did not change the initial or protracted responses to glutamate...|$|E
40|$|Reduction in GluR 2 subunit {{expression}} and subsequent increases in AMPA receptor mediated Ca 2 + currents were postulated to exacerbate glutamate neurotoxicity following seizures or global ischemia. To directly test {{the effects of}} shifting the GluR 1 /GluR 2 subunit ratio on excitotoxicity, GluR 2 antisense deoxyoligonucleotides (AS-ODNs) were applied to dissociated hippocampal cultures for 1 – 8 days. The GluR 1 /GluR 2 protein ratio was examined immunohistochemically and by Western blotting. [Ca 2 +]i concentrations were determined by ratiometric imaging of Fura 2 -loaded cells. The cultures were exposed to glutamate, AMPA, NMDA or kainic acid (KA) 3 days after GluR 2 knockdown and cell viability was determined 1 day later by MTT reduction assay or Trypan blue exclusion. Although GluR 2 AS-ODNs increased the GluR 1 /GluR 2 protein ratio in a time dependent manner, neurons and glia appeared healthy and MTT reduction values were similar to untreated and sense controls. Basal [Ca 2 +]i levels were unchanged but [Ca 2 +]i was selectively increased by agonist stimulation of AMPA receptors. Unexpectedly, <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> was attenuated at saturating doses of glutamate while little difference in cell viability was observed at lower doses or with the other excitotoxins at any concentration. Therefore, there was a dissociation between rises in AMPA receptor-mediated Ca 2 + influx and neurotoxicity despite marked decreases in GluR 2 but not GluR 1 immunoreactivity. It is proposed that a modification of AMPA receptor stochiometry that raises agonist-stimulated Ca 2 + influx during an excitotoxic insult may have eventual neuroprotective effects...|$|E
40|$|The current Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) {{guidelines}} for evaluating organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) require {{the observation of}} dosed animals over several days and the sacrifice of 48 hens. Adhering to these protocols in tests with enantiomers is difficult because large quantities of the compound are needed and many animals must be utilized. Thus, developing an in vitro screening protocol to evaluate chiral organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) that can induce delayed neuropathy is important. This work aimed to evaluate, in blood and brain samples from hens, human blood, and human cell culture samples, {{the potential of the}} enantiomeric forms of methamidophos to induce acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and/or <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Calpain activation was also evaluated in the hen brain and SH-SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cells. The ratio between the inhibition of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) and AChE activities by the methamidophos enantiomers was evaluated as a possible indicator of the enantiomers' abilities to induce OPIDN. The (-) -methamidophos exhibited an IC 50 value approximately 6 times greater than that of the (+) -methamidophos for the lymphocyte NTE (LNTE) of hens, and (+) -methamidophos exhibited an IC 50 value approximately 7 times larger than that of the (-) -methamidophos for the hen brain AChE. The IC 50 values were 7 times higher for the human erythrocyte AChE and 5 times higher for AChE in the SH-SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cells. Considering the esterases inhibition and calpain results, (+) -methamidophos would be expected to have a greater ability to induce OPIDN than the (-) -methamidophos in humans and in hens.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} and toxicity of chemotherapy alone in patients older than 60 years with primary CNS lymphoma. Patients and Methods: Fifty {{patients with a}} median age of 72 years and a median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) of 50 were eligible for this multicenter phase II study. The protocol consisted of high-dose methotrexate (MTX), lomustine, procarbazine, methylprednisolone, and intrathecal chemotherapy with MTX and cytarabine. The patients received one induction cycle; if objective response was achieved, five additional maintenance cycles were administered every 6 weeks. The median follow-up of patients was 3 years. Results: Twenty four patients (48 %) achieved an objective response (compete response [CR], 42 %; partial response, 6 %), with a median duration of CR of 27 months (range, 3 to 47 + months). Overall median survival time was 14. 3 months, and 1 -year progression-free survival was 40 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 26 % to 53 %). Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect, with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia in 19 % of patients. One patient died during chemotherapy, {{as a result of}} pulmonary embolism. Most patients improved or preserved their cognitive functions (47 % and 45 % of the patients, respectively) and KPS (36 % and 52 % of the patients, respectively) until relapse, whereas cognitive and KPS decline attributed to delayed treatment neurotoxicity occurred in 8 % and 12 % patients, respectively. Conclusion: In the elderly, this chemotherapy regimen compares favorably with radiotherapy (RT) alone and reduces considerably the risk of <b>delayed</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> associated with combined chemoradiotherapy. Chemotherapy alone is an appropriate strategy in older patients to delay or avoid RT. © 2003 by American Society of Clinical Oncology. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

TOCP treatment enhanced the Ca 2 +- and calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of tubulin in crude chicken brain cytosol (160 % for alpha-tubulin and 140 % for beta-tubulin) and cold-stable microtubules (165 % and 155 % for alpha- and beta-tubulin, respectively). Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP- 2) phosphorylation was also increased in brain fractions studied [...] i. e., brain cytosol (145 %), cold-stable microtubules (133 %), and cold-labile microtubules (328 %). There was significant increase in phosphorylation of a 70 -kDa protein in the brain cytosol and in the cold-stable microtubule fractions. TOCP also stimulated the phosphorylation of spinal cord proteins of 70 kDa (119 %) and 160 kDa (129 %) in a Mg 2 +-dependent manner. Addition of Ca 2 + and calmodulin further enhanced the phosphorylation of these 70 -kDa (563 %) and 160 -kDa (221 %) proteins {{as well as of}} 52 -, 59 -, and 210 -kDa proteins by as much as 126 %, 160 %, and 196 %, respectively. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out to identify these proteins. They were confirmed as alpha- and beta-tubulin (52 and 59 kDa) in brain and spinal cord preparations and the neurofilament triplet proteins (70, 160, and 210 kDa) in the spinal cord preparation. The 70 -kDa protein in brain was not neurofilament in origin. Peptide mapping using Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease showed the brain and spinal cord cytoskeletal proteins have identical phosphopeptide patterns in control and TOCP-treated hens, indicating that it was unlikely that the phosphorylation sites were altered by TOCP treatment...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition {{and aging}} of {{neuropathy}} target esterase (NTE) by neuropathic organophosphorus (OP) compounds triggers OP compound‐induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN), whereas inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) produces cholinergic toxicity. The neuropathic potential of an OP compound is defined by its relative inhibitory potency toward NTE vs. AChE assessed by enzyme assays following dosing in vivo or after incubations of direct‐acting compounds or active metabolites with enzymes in vitro. The standard animal model of OPIDN is the adult hen, but its large size and high husbandry costs make this species a burdensome model for assessing neuropathic potential. Although the mouse does not readily exhibit clinical signs of OPIDN, it displays axonal lesions and expresses brain AChE and NTE. Therefore, the present research was performed as a further test of the hypothesis that inhibition of mouse brain AChE and NTE {{could be used to}} assess neuropathic potential using mouse brain preparations in vitro or employing mouse brain assays following dosing of OP compounds in vivo. Excellent correlations were obtained for inhibition kinetics in vitro of mouse brain enzymes vs. hen brain and human recombinant enzymes. Furthermore, inhibition of mouse brain AChE and NTE after dosing with OP compounds afforded ED 50 ratios that agreed with relative inhibitory potencies assessed in vitro. Taken together, results with mouse brain enzymes demonstrated consistent correspondence between in vitro and in vivo predictors of neuropathic potential, thus adding to previous studies supporting the validity of a mouse model for biochemical assessment of the ability of OP compounds to produce OPIDN.
