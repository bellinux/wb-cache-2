5|$|Iron {{plays an}} {{important}} role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. A human male of average height has about 4 grams of iron in his body, a female about 3.5 grams. This iron is distributed throughout the body in hemoglobin, tissues, muscles, bone marrow, blood proteins, enzymes, <b>ferritin,</b> hemosiderin, and transport in plasma.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ferritins</b> are a {{superfamily}} of iron oxidation, {{storage and}} mineralization proteins {{found throughout the}} animal, plant, and microbial kingdoms. The majority of <b>ferritins</b> consist of 24 subunits that individually fold into 4 -α-helix bundles and assemble in a highly symmetric manner to form an approximately spherical protein coat around a central cavity into which an iron-containing mineral can be formed. Channels through the coat at inter-subunit contact points facilitate passage of iron ions {{to and from the}} central cavity, and intrasubunit catalytic sites, called ferroxidase centers, drive Fe 2 + oxidation and O 2 reduction. Though the different members of the superfamily share a common structure, there is often little amino acid sequence identity between them. Even where there is a high degree of sequence identity between two <b>ferritins</b> there can be major differences in how the proteins handle iron. In this review we describe some of the important structural features of <b>ferritins</b> and their mineralized iron cores and examine in detail how three selected <b>ferritins</b> oxidise Fe 2 + in order to explore the mechanistic variations that exist amongst <b>ferritins.</b> We suggest that the mechanistic differences reflect differing evolutionary pressures on amino acid sequences, and that these differing pressures are a consequence of different primary functions for different <b>ferritins...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Ferritins</b> {{constitute}} a broad superfamily of iron storage proteins, widespread in all domains of life, in aerobic or anaerobic organisms. <b>Ferritins</b> isolated from bacteria may be haem-free or contain a haem. In {{the latter case}} they are called bacterioferritins. The primary function of <b>ferritins</b> inside cells is to store iron in the ferric form. A secondary function may be detoxification of iron or protection against O 2 and its radical products. Indeed, for bacterioferritins {{this is likely to}} be their primary function. <b>Ferritins</b> and bacteroferritins have essentially the same architecture, assembling in a 24 mer cluster to form a hollow, roughly spherical construction. In this review, special emphasis is given to the structure of the ferroxidase centres with native iron-containing sites, since oxidation of ferrous iron by molecular oxygen takes place in these sites. Although present in other <b>ferritins,</b> a specific entry route for iron, coupled with the ferroxidase reaction, has been proposed and described in some structural studies.

40|$|<b>Ferritins</b> are iron-storage {{proteins}} that accumulate in plastids during seed formation, {{and also in}} leaves during senescence or iron overload. Iron release from <b>ferritins</b> occurs during growth of seedlings and greening of plastids. Depending on the concentration of the reducing agent ascorbate, either an overall iron release or uptake by <b>ferritins</b> from iron(III) citrate may occur. We have designed methods to measure these simultaneous and independent uptake and release fluxes. Each individual step of the exchange was studied using different iron chelates and an excess of ligand. It is shown that: (i) the chelated form of iron, and not ionic Fe 3 +, is the substrate for iron reduction, which controls the subsequent uptake by ferritin; (ii) iron uptake by <b>ferritins</b> is faster at pH 8. 4 than at pH 7 or 6 and is inhibited by an excess of strongly binding free ligands; and (iii) strongly binding free ligands are inhibitory during iron release by ascorbate.

All amino acids involved in chelation of inorganic iron by <b>ferritins</b> from humans and other higher species are conserved in the H. pylori protein. Consistent with the structural data indicating an iron-binding function, E. coli overexpressing the H. pylori ferritin-like protein accumulates almost 10 times more nonheme iron than vector controls, and the iron-binding activity copurifies with the 19. 3 -kDa protein. Immunoelectron microscopy of H. pylori, as well as of E. coli overexpressing the H. pylori gene, demonstrates that the gene product has a cytoplasmic location where it forms paracrystalline inclusions. On the basis of these structural and functional data, we propose that the H. pylori gene product (termed Pfr) forms the basis for a second class of bacterial <b>ferritins</b> designed to store nonheme iron...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} quantitatively the charge-selective permeability of {{the basement}} membrane (BM) of the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ), tracer experiments using anionic and cationic <b>ferritins</b> were performed on an epidermal sheet, whose lamina densa was exposed on the dermal surface; its dermis was removed with forceps after the treatment of newborn rat skin with 10 mM dithiothreitol. The lamina densa and epidermal components of the sheets were electron microscopically well preserved, and anionic sites were ultrastructurally demonstrated on both the dermal and epidermal aspects of the lamina densa in the DEJ as clusters of cationic <b>ferritins</b> (CF) [isoelectric point (pI) > 9. 5] or polyethyleneimine particles, indicating that the epidermal sheets were suitable for study of permeability. In tracer experiments, {{a large number of}} CF (pI 8. 0 - 9. 4) passed the lamina densa and formed clusters on both aspects of the lamina densa and in the intercellular space. The number of native anionic <b>ferritins</b> (NF) (pI 4. 1 - 4. 6) passing it was apparently much smaller than that of CF. When the epidermal sheets were pre-treated with protamine sulfate to neutralize the negative charges in the tissue, the number of NF penetrating the lamina densa was significantly larger than the number of those in the untreated sheet. These results indicate that the BM of the DEJ plays a role in a charge-selective filtration, although it is not as selective a barrier as the glomerular basement membrane...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ferritins</b> are iron storage {{proteins}} that overcome problems of toxicity and poor bioavailability of iron by catalysing iron oxidation and mineralization {{through the activity}} of a diiron ferroxidase site. Unlike in other <b>ferritins,</b> the oxidized di-Fe 3 + site of Escherichia coli bacterioferritin (EcBFR) is stable and therefore does not function as a conduit for the transfer of Fe 3 + into the storage cavity, but instead acts as a true catalytic cofactor that cycles its oxidation state while driving Fe 2 + oxidation in the cavity. Here we demonstrate that EcBFR mineralization depends on three near-diiron site aromatic residues, Tyr 25, Tyr 58 and Trp 133, and that a transient radical is formed on Tyr 25. The data indicate that the aromatic residues, together with a previously identified inner surface iron site, promote mineralization by ensuring the simultaneous delivery of two electrons, derived from Fe 2 + oxidation in the BFR cavity, to the di-ferric catalytic site for safe reduction of O 2...|$|R
40|$|At {{least three}} <b>ferritins</b> {{are found in}} the {{bacterium}} Escherichia coli, the heme-containing bacterioferritin (EcBFR) and two non-heme bacterial <b>ferritins</b> (EcFtnA and EcFtnB). In addition to the conserved A- and B-sites of the diiron ferroxidase center, EcFtnA has a third iron-binding site (the C-site) of unknown function that is nearby the diiron site. In the present work, the complex chemistry of iron oxidation and deposition in EcFtnA has been further defined through a combination of oximetry, pH stat, stopped-flow and conventional kinetics, UV-visible, fluorescence and EPR spectroscopic measurements on the wildtype protein and site-directed variants of the A-, B- and C-sites. The data reveal that, while H 2 O 2 is a product of dioxygen reduction in EcFtnA and oxidation occurs with a stoichiometry of Fe(II) /O 2 3 : 1, most of the H 2 O 2 produced is consumed in subsequent reactions with a 2 : 1 Fe(II) /H 2 O 2 stoichiometry, thus suppressing hydroxyl radical formation. While the A- and B-sites are essential for rapid iron oxidation, the C-site slows oxidation and suppresses iron turnover at the ferroxidase center. A tyrosyl radical, assigned to Tyr 24 near the ferroxidase center, is formed during iron oxidation and its possible significance to the function of the protein is discussed. Taken as a whole, the data indicate that there are multiple iron-oxidation pathways in EcFtnA with O 2 and H 2 O 2 as oxidants. Furthermore, the data are inconsistent with the C-site being a transit site, providing iron to the A- and B-sites, and does not support a universal mechanism for iron oxidation in all <b>ferritins</b> as recently proposed...|$|R
