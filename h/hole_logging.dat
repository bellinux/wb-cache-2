It took another five years for competitors to introduce a comparable service. Beginning in 1948, Well Surveys Inc. physicist Arthur Youmans led the team of engineers and scientists to develop this technology. The highly complex instrument included a miniaturized particle generator and sensors to detect and analyze sub-atomic particles. Mr. Youmans {{went on to become}} Vice President of Research and Engineering for Dresser Atlas.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Lane-Wells and the Pan Geo Atlas Corporation (PGAC) merged to form Dresser Atlas, a name {{chosen to}} “position” {{the company as}} more than a {{perforating}} provider and as part parent company of Dresser Industries. A competitor with Lane-Wells but possessing deeper expertise and an international reputation in open <b>hole</b> <b>logging,</b> PGAC was the perfect merger partner to form an integrated wireline services company. Since its inception, Lane-Wells had generated most of its income from perforating services, but log interpretation had narrowed down producing zones, resulting in fewer perforations and less revenue. During the oil slump of the 1999, Western Atlas was acquired by Baker Hughes and the wireline division was created within the company rebranded as Baker Atlas. Western Geophysical was meanwhile allied with GecoPrakla of Schlumberger and later combined into a separate business entity called WesternGeco.|$|E

An additional benefit of baryte is that it is non-magnetic and thus does not interfere with magnetic measurements taken in the borehole, either during logging-while-drilling or in separate drill <b>hole</b> <b>logging.</b> Baryte used for drilling petroleum wells can be black, blue, brown or gray depending on the ore body. The baryte is finely ground so that at least 97% of the material, by weight, can pass through a 200-mesh (75 μm) screen, and no more than 30%, by weight, can be less than 6 μm diameter. The ground baryte also must be dense enough so that its specific gravity is 4.2 or greater, soft enough to not damage the bearings of a tricone drill bit, chemically inert, and containing no more than 250 milligrams per kilogram of soluble alkaline salts.

30|$|The {{frequency}} domain electromagnetic method {{has already been}} widely used for tomographic imaging or electromagnetic well logging. However, different from open <b>hole</b> <b>logging,</b> the metal casing existing in production well logging has a strong shielding effect on the electromagnetic waves, thus bringing some difficulties to {{the application of the}} {{frequency domain}} electromagnetic method in production well logging. According to the relation of the field source geometry to the ring around the mandrel, the general expressions of frequency domain electromagnetic responses in axially symmetrical layered conductive medium are deduced. The propagation effects caused by the low-frequency electromagnetic waves in cased hole are also analyzed. The distribution curves of eddy current density and magnetic flux density along the radial direction in the mandrel indicate that the eddy loss within the mandrel is proportional to the transmission signal frequency and the mandrel conductivity. The secondary field responses of different casing materials show that the transmission frequency has an important effect on the ability of electromagnetic waves penetrating the metal casing. The transmission frequency should be ultra-low in order to enable the electromagnetic signal to penetrate the casing easily. The numerical results of frequency responses for different casing physical parameters show that the casing thickness has {{a significant impact on the}} choice of the transmission frequency. It is also found that the effect of the casing radius on the transmission frequency can be neglected.|$|E

40|$|The Zeit Bay field {{reservoir}} units {{consist of}} sandstone and carbonates, partially overlaying a tilted block of fractured basement reservoir with a complex drive mechanism. A secondary recovery scheme of gas re-injection into the original gas cap was initiated to maintain reservoir energy and to overcome pressure decline. Hence accurate detection of gas movement is very critical. Several difficulties to monitor gas-oil contacts were encountered in {{a considerable number}} of wells. Some of these difficulties were, gas channelling behind the casing, gas coning, wellbore fluid changes, porosity and lithology changes, wellbore fluid invasion into the reservoir and the presence of formation stimulation fluid. The application of conventional methods using the response of gas indicator curves could result in a false indication of formation gas-oil contacts. This paper discusses the approach adopted {{in order to determine the}} gas-oil contact in wells where such problems occur. A database was established including more than 70 TDT runs, open <b>hole</b> <b>log</b> and pressure data of 12 infill wells, and production performance records of all Zeit Bay wells. The approach follows the Polyachenko model of functional relationship between count rates and gas saturation. Several crossplots for the same range of porosity and connate water saturation, e. g. formation capture cross section (SIGM), total selected near detector counts (TSCN), total selected far detector counts (TSCF), the capture cross section of the borehole (SIBH), and inelastic far detector counts (INFD). Each crossplot gives a definite diagnostic shape around the depth of the formation gas-oil contact By using these crossplots it will be possible to calculate gas saturation from a stand alone run. The model was validated by RFT and open <b>hole</b> <b>log</b> data from infill wells. Also it was successfully applied in wells which showed an ambiguity in the detected formation gas-oil contact. The field gas-oil contact in Zeit Bay was revised using the results of the model.

A reconstruction of the fault’s Late Quaternary deformation, paleoseismicity and current hazard potential have been created which indicate at least three ruptures in the last ~ 60, 000 years, each with ~ 1 m of vertical displacement and an average dip slip rate of 0. 15 ± 0. 05 mm/yr.

A computer simulation model was built to predict the cable tension force applied on conveyed wireline string so as to assess and analyze the effect of the different conveyance accessories, such as centralizers, bottom-nose tools, and wireline coating, on wireline penetration rates. A numerical computing approach was then utilized to represent and analyze the simulation studies output results in a friendly graphical form. Improving the wireline logging performance, especially in highly deviated rugose openhole wells, could increase the percentage of successful logging operations, reducing time, cost and improving data quality with the increased wellbore coverage. The second part discusses the possible violent drillstring vibrations encountered during drilling and its effect on the overall rate of penetration and sustainability. This entails a complete identification and modeling of the drillstring dynamics and the sources of vibrations excitation that include stick-slip, bit-bounce, and whirling with its two forward and backward types to better control its functional operation and improve its performance.

40|$|Depletion of {{the near}} surface mineral {{deposits}} has created a need to develop new, innovative deep exploration tools. Seismic reflection soundings have been successfully used for hydrocarbon exploration over a century, but method s applications in the hardrock environment have been limited until recently. Strongly 3 -dimensional and discontinuous geological structures are typical for the crystalline bedrock and especially for mining camps. This causes challenges to the seismic data acquisition and processing {{as well as to}} the interpretation. In this thesis, seismic reflection profiling is applied to the exploration of massive sulfide deposits in the Pyhäsalmi, Vihanti and Outokumpu area. Study areas belong to the Raahe-Ladoga belt containing 90 % of the known sulfide deposits of Finland. In each of the study sites a network of seismic reflection profiles was acquired during the HIRE (HIgh REsolution reflection seismics for ore exploration 2007 - 2010) project by the Geological Survey of Finland. The multiphase deformation history of the study areas is demonstrated by folding, faulting and shearing that cause the complex subsurface reflectivity patters observed in the seismic data. These data enable thorough discussion on the applicability of the reflection seismic profiling for massive sulfide exploration in a geological environment that is highly deformed and metamorphosed. Careful static corrections and velocity analysis are the most important steps in the processing of the seismic reflection data acquired in hardrock terrains. Steeply dipping structures are not uncommon in the study sites and proper stacking of these structures require use of unrealistically high NMO velocities. Steep and horizontal features are best interpreted from separate stacks using 3 D-visualization and modeling software. Results of velocity analysis can also be utilized in the seismic interpretation. For example in Vihanti low NMO velocities correlated with the known wide fracture zone. Difference in the acoustic impedance of the rocks defines the strength of a reflection originating from the rock contact. Geophysical drill <b>hole</b> <b>logging</b> shows that in addition to the massive sulfides, the hosting rock sequences are also strongly reflective in Vihanti, Pyhäsalmi and Outokumpu. Reflecting hosting lithology enables the determination of favorable exploration environments. In Pyhäsalmi, the known massive sulfide deposit could not be reliably identified from the seismic section because of the crooked acquisition lines, noise caused by the functioning mine and lithologically heterogeneous and strongly 3 -dimensional geological background of the deposit. Based on the drill <b>hole</b> <b>logging</b> data, most reflections originate from contacts between mafic volcanic and other rocks in the Pyhäsalmi area. Mineralizations typically occur at the transition from the felsic to mafic volcanism. Reflectivity in the Pyhäsalmi area indicates continuation of the ore-critical bimodal volcanic sequence underneath wide, but shallow, granite intrusions, which has not been explored previously. Moreover, amplitude enhancement of this interpreted contact was proved to be caused by the uneconomic zinc mineralization. Amplitude enhancement inside of the reflective units interpreted as ore hosting lithology was also used as an exploration criteria in the Outokumpu area. Because sulfide ores are small compared to the typical seismic wavelength, they cause diffractions instead of reflections. Diffraction analysis was used for seismic deep exploration in Outokumpu and Vihanti. Good seismic interpretation employs the structural geology of the study area. In Pyhäsalmi, only hinges of the subvertical folds were imaged while steep limbs could not be directly imaged by seismic profiling. Gentle open folding is typical for Vihanti region and was shown as undulating reflectivity in the seismic profiles. Reverse faults interpreted in all study regions are most prominent in the Vihanti area where strong reflectors are cut by faults. Knowledge of the fault locations is important for exploration because they might have acted as pathways for fluids carrying sulfide minerals during deformation. Seismic reflection data provides an insight to the deep continuation of the fault zones. Research presented in this thesis shows that seismic reflection profiling is a useful tool for deep ore exploration. The depth resolution of the method is excellent and interpretation of the crossing seismic profiles enables the 3 D geological modeling of the subsurface structures and lithological contacts. Successful modeling requires the use of other available geophysical and geological data. A geological 3 D-model combines the knowledge acquired by different methods making strategic planning of exploration possible, in particular by facilitating the decisions of expensive deep drill holes. Seismic reflection profiles create the framework on which the geological model is built on. Tunnettujen, lähellä maanpintaa sijaitsevien mineraalivarojen ehtymisen takia on tarpeen kehittää uusia, innovatiivisia syvämalminetsintämenetelmiä. Seismistä heijastusluotausta on käytetty öljynetsinnässä menestyksellisesti jo lähes vuosisadan ajan, mutta menetelmää on toistaiseksi sovellettu kiteisen kallioperän malminetsintään vain rajoitetusti. Pyhäsalmen, Vihannin ja Outokummun kaivosalueet kuuluvat Raahe-Laatokka vyöhykkeeseen, jossa sijaitsee 90 % Suomen tunnetuista sulfidimalmivaroista. Alueilla uskotaan edelleen olevan ennestään tuntemattomia malmeja erityisesti yli 500 metrin syvyydessä, mihin perinteisten geofysikaalisten malminetsintämenetelmien syvyysulottuvuus ei riitä. Seismistä heijastusluotausprofilointia testattiin syvällä sijaitsevien malmien etsintään. Sulfidimalmit ovat pieniä verrattuna seismisiin aallonpituuksiin malminetsintäsyvyyksillä, joten niiden suora havaitseminen seismisissä profiileissa on epätodennäköistä. Tämän takia seismisessä malminetsinnässä kannattaa keskittyä tunnistamaan malmien isäntäkiviä sekä malmiesintyymiä kontrolloivia geologisia rakenteita. Pyhäsalmella, Vihannissa ja Outokummussa sulfidimalmit liittyvät tyypillisesti tiettyihin kivilajisekvensseihin, joiden todettiin kairarei issä tehtyjen geofysiikan mittausten perusteella olevan heijastavia kaikilla tutkimusalueilla. Geologiset prosessit ovat poimuttaneet, siirrostaneet ja hiertäneet tutkimusalueiden alunperin vaaka-asentoiset kerrostumat monimutkaisiksi, kolmiulotteisiksi rakenteiksi. Pyhäsalmella kairareiässä haivattu malmin isäntäkivisekvenssi pystyttiin korreloimaan seismiseen heijastajaan, jota seurattiin seismiseltä heijastusluotauslinjalta toiselle aiemmin malminetsinnän ulkopuolelle jätetyn graniitti-intruusion alle.

Either way, measurements are available relatively soon after pouring (6 to 72 hours), typically earlier than when other integrity testing methods such as cross <b>hole</b> sonic <b>logging</b> and low strain integrity testing can be performed.|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{discussed}} for using 6 band thermal imagery to locate subsurface gravel deposits in vegetated areas. Geologic history is reviewed to select potential areas of study. An overflight was made using a thermal scanner. The data were processed with a computerized system to delineate areas showing a quartz signature radiated by a gravel deposit. The method was developed during {{a search for}} gravel on National Forest land in Louisiana. Processed data from thermal imagery was compared with known gravel deposits and exploratory drill <b>hole</b> <b>logs.</b> A high correlation was noted {{for a wide range}} of deposits, from commercial pits to trace deposits only a foot thick. Overburden at these sites varied from zero to sixty feet, near the maximum annual penetration by the thermal wave. It was concluded that the method can be used to locate buried gravel deposits and that more time and effort are needed to verify the usefulness for developing gravel pits adjacent to proposed construction sites...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{continuation}} of an earlier work which can be viewed here: [URL] report and associated databases are updates on many of the holes that have been recently logged by the Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI) in the Keweenawan Duluth Complex, the Paleoproterozoic Biwabik Iron Formation of the Mesabi Iron Range, and the Archean Deer Lake Complex of northeastern Itasca County, Minnesota. The main emphasis of this project was to update some of the databases that were presented in an earlier NRRI report (Patelke, 2003) with regard to lithologies in Duluth Complex drill <b>holes</b> that were <b>logged</b> by the NRRI since 2003 (and discussed in Severson and Hauck, 2008). To date, all of the publically available drill holes (except for around 30 drill holes) have now been logged in the Duluth Complex by the NRRI. These 30 holes are all that are missing from either the databases in this report or the databases in Patelke (2003). It is strongly suggested that the databases herein be combined, at the user’s discretion, with corresponding databases in Patelke (2003) in order to make an all- encompassing database for lithologies for all NRRI <b>logged</b> drill <b>holes</b> in the Duluth Complex. A secondary goal of this project was to present a header file database for all the holes that were recently drilled in the Duluth Complex (post- 2003). Most of these holes are not yet publically available, but data regarding drill hole locations can be gleaned from abandonment files. Combining Duluth Complex header files in this report with the similar header file in Patelke (2003) could provide an all-encompassing database of locations for all of the holes drilled to date in the Duluth Complex (pre- 2010 data). This combining of the data is left to the user’s discretion. Lastly, additional goals of this project (time permitting) were to present lithologic databases for all <b>holes</b> <b>logged</b> by the NRRI in the Mesabi Iron Range and, to a much lesser extent, <b>holes</b> <b>logged</b> by the NRRI in the Deer Lake Complex. The database for the Mesabi Iron Range contains information for almost 300 drill holes (over 5, 947 lines of lithologic data) in regard to the lithologic picks pertaining to informal members and submembers of the iron-formation. The data in this file is about 80 % complete in that not all of the iron-formation submembers are presented for holes drilled at the Keetac Taconite mine or in the Coleraine, MN, area (the latter holes are discussed in Zanko et al., 2003) ...|$|R
