40|$|A single-step most-probable-number {{method for}} {{enumerating}} fecal coliforms in {{sewage treatment plant}} effluents is described. The method {{requires the use of}} only one lactose-based medium and a single incubation temperature of 44. 5 degrees C, and it can be completed in 18 h or less, as compared with up to 72 h for the standard most-probable-number method. The appearance of growth is the sole criterion used for designating positives, which can be determined either by increases in the electrical impedance ratio of <b>inoculated</b> <b>medium,</b> as compared to an uninoculated control using a Bactometer model 32, or by visual examination of <b>inoculated</b> <b>medium</b> for turbidity.

The results showed that MPG had significantly higher antioxidant activity than PDB, MP, and PDBG at all fermentation time points. Moreover, the fermentation process significantly increased the antioxidant activities of MPG.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the cytogenetic effects induced by some growth inhibitors (daminozide, mannitol, and sorbitol) on cell division on five local varieties of potato from in vitro collection maintained by the Gene Bank of Suceava. We used four different culture media: medium of micromultiplication (control medium) - M 14, medium with 30 mg/l daminozide - C 22, the medium with 40 g/l mannitol - C 23, the medium with 40 g/l sorbitol - C 24. The effect of three substances on root meristems of genotypes analyzed was expressed as mitotic index, which ranged from 16, 46 % limits, the plantlets <b>inoculated</b> on <b>medium</b> with mannitol and 24, 74 % for the seedlings <b>inoculated</b> with daminozide <b>medium.</b> We observed a decrease in mitotic index in all five genotypes on mannitol and sorbitol medium and increase its on medium with daminozide. The studies showed that in most cells, regardless of culture medium used were normal mitosis. Were also found abnormal cell division, which included delayed, expelled and picnotic chromosomes, bridges and chromosomal fragments and micronuclei, but their percentage was lower in all genotypes, in all medium variations experienced...|$|R
