40|$|Surfactant {{nebulization}} improves {{lung function}} at low alveolar doses of surfactant. However, <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>nebulization</b> is low, and lung deposition seems {{to depend on}} lung aeration. High frequency ventilation (HFV) {{has been shown to}} improve lung aeration. We hypothesize that the combination of HFV and surfactant nebulization may benefit lung deposition of surfactant and consequently, lung function. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effect of surfactant nebulization versus instillation during HFV on lung function, surfactant distribution, and cerebral blood flow. Therefore, severe respiratory failure was induced by lung lavages in 18 rabbits. HFV was applied: frequency = 8 Hz, mean airway pressure = 12 cm H 2 O, amplitude = 100 %, fraction of inspired O- 2 = 1. 0. Technetium- 99 m-labeled surfactant (Alveofact, 100 mg/kg of BW) was nebulized or instilled (n = 6 each). Six other rabbits did not receive surfactant (control, HFV only). We found that after instillation partial arterial O- 2 tension increased from 7. 0 kPa (95 % confidence interval, 6. 3 - 8. 0 kPa) to 34 kPa (16 - 51 kPa), and during nebulization from 7. 0 kPa (6. 0 - 9. 0 kPa) to 46 kPa (27 - 58 kPa). Partial arterial CO, tension decreased after instillation from 6. 1 kPa (5. 3 - 7. 1 kPa) to 4. 8 kPa (3. 9 - 5. 6 kPa), and during nebulization, after an initial rise, it decreased from 6. 3 kPa (5. 3 - 7. 4 kPa) to 4. 9 kPa (4. 4 - 5. 6 kPa). Both treatments resulted in nonuniform distribution. Surfactant deposition after nebulization was 9. 8 %, Instillation resulted in a drop of mean arterial blood pressure of 17 % (8 - 31 %), and an even more pronounced drop in cerebral blood flow of 39 % (18 - 57 %). Nebulization did not affect blood pressure. Cerebral blood flow decreased with a maximum of 27 % (10 - 37 %). We conclude that surfactant nebulization during HFV improves lung function in rabbits with severe respiratory failure, without improving distribution, but with less effects on blood pressure and cerebral blood flow, when compared with surfactant instillation...|$|E

For unvented jet nebulizers, a physical and mathematical model {{based on the}} <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nebulization</b> process is presented for this phenomenon.

Aims and Objectives: The present study was conducted to compare the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> preoperative <b>nebulization</b> <b>of</b> normal saline and magnesium sulfate in reducing the incidence of POST following GA. Materials and Methods: Following institutional ethical committee approval and written informed consent, a prospective randomized double-blinded study was conducted in 100 cases divided into two equal groups. Patients included in the study were of either gender belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) status 1 or 2 undergoing elective surgery of approximately 2 h or more duration requiring tracheal intubation. Patients in Group A are nebulized with 3 ml of normal saline and the patients in Group B are nebulized with 3 ml of 225 mg isotonic nebulized magnesium sulfate for 15 min, 5 min before induction of anesthesia. The incidence of POST at rest and on swallowing and any undue complaints at 0, 2, 4, and 24 h in the postoperative period are evaluated. Results: There is no significant difference in POST at rest during 0 th, 2 nd and 4 th h between normal saline and MgSO 4. Significant difference is seen at 24 th h, where MgSO 4 lessens POST. There is no significant difference in POST “on swallowing” during 0 th and 2 nd h between normal saline and MgSO 4.

40|$|Introduction: Acute {{respiratory}} syncytial virus bronchiolitis is {{the most}} common cause of lower respiratory infections in infants and young children and the leading cause of admission in infants younger than one year. Recent studies show a positive effect <b>of</b> <b>nebulization</b> with hypertonic saline. Nebulization with hypertonic saline resulted in a shorter mean length of hospital stay and a lower clinical respiratory score. Nevertheless the immediate effect of nebuliztion with hypertonic saline on lung sounds and breathingpattern has never been studied. In this study, the immediate effect <b>of</b> <b>nebulization</b> with hypertonic saline will be evaluated by analyzing the lungsounds and breathingpattern before and after nebulization. Materials and method: It was an observational pilot study. Children from 0 - 36 months, admitted with RSV bronchiolitis were included. Lungsounds and breathing patterns were registered with the PulmoTrack®, before and fifteen minutes after nebulization with hypertonic saline. Also the validated clinical respiratory score, (RDAI-score) and the clinical and demographic data were registered for every patient. Results: The lungsounds and breathing patterns of 27 patients with RSV bronchiolitis were analyzed before and after nebulization with hypertonic saline. There was no significant decrease of percentage of wheeze and no change in I/E ratio. However there was a trend in a decrease in percentage of wheezing after a single nebulization with hypertonic saline. There was a significant increase in episodes of coughing. There was a positive correlation between the percentage <b>of</b> wheezing before <b>nebulization</b> and the decrease in percentage <b>of</b> wheezing after <b>nebulization.</b> Conclusion: A single nebulization with hypertonic saline in patients with RSV bronchiolitis showed no significant decrease of percentage wheeze and had no significant effect on the expiration time. ...|$|R
