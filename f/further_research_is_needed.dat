5|$|Meanwhile, former Ohio Works {{players in}} Zanesville quickly regained their momentum. In March 1907, the new club was {{admitted}} into the Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League, a Division D league. By {{the close of}} the 1907 season, the club had seized the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, the team was christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to determine the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at {{the close of the}} 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.|$|E

5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to fully establish {{the function of the}} luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E

5000|$|Children between {{zero and}} {{fourteen}} years living within a radius of 15 kilometres {{to the nuclear}} area in the Belgian Mol-Dessel, have {{two to three times}} more frequently than average leukemia. These findings were published by the scientific journal European Journal of Cancer Prevention. The study was carried out in the period 2002 to 2008. There were also indications that there was a connection between the wind direction and the leukemia. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> to confirm this.

25|$|Although {{there have}} been {{reported}} fatalities due to GHB withdrawal, reports are inconclusive and <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> A common problem is that GHB does not leave traces in the body after {{a short period of}} time, complicating diagnosis and research. Addiction occurs when repeated drug use disrupts the normal balance of brain circuits that control rewards, memory and cognition, ultimately leading to compulsive drug taking.|$|E
25|$|Weidemeyer's admiral {{butterfly}} (Limenitis weidemeyerii) is {{only known}} {{to exist in}} Canada within the Milk River watershed, {{as well as the}} yucca moth mentioned previously. An estimated population of 3000 adult Weidemeyer's admiral adults exist in a total approximate total occupied area of less than one square kilometer, and are susceptible to extreme natural weather events or drought.

25|$|The {{function}} of the mirror neuron system is still unclear. Some scientists speculate that mirror neurons {{may play a role}} in understanding the actions of others, imitation, theory of mind and language acquisition, though there is currently insufficient neurophysiological evidence in support of these theories. Specifically regarding birds, it is possible that the mirror neuron system serves as a general mechanism underlying vocal learning, but <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> In addition to the implications for song learning, the mirror neuron system could also play a role in territorial behaviors such as song-type matching and countersinging.|$|E
25|$|According to Dr. Chris Ford, former {{clinical}} {{director of}} Substance Misuse Management in General Practice, among drugs of abuse, benzodiazepines are {{often seen as}} the 'bad guys' by drug and alcohol workers. Illicit users of benzodiazepines {{have been found to}} take higher methadone doses, as well as showing more HIV/HCV risk-taking behavior, greater poly-drug use, higher levels of psychopathology and social dysfunction. However, there is only limited research into the adverse effects of benzodiazepines in drug misusers and <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to demonstrate whether this is the result of cause or effect.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in size {{has been}} proposed as {{an explanation for the}} widespread nature of sexual cannibalism across distantly related arthropods. Typically, male birds and mammals are larger as they participate in male-male competition. However, in arthropods this size dimorphism ratio is reversed, with females commonly larger than males. Sexual cannibalism may have led to selection for larger, stronger, females in invertebrates. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to evaluate the explanation. To date, studies have been done on wolf spiders such as Zyuzicosa (Lycosidae), where the female is much larger than the male.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the polychaete, Hermodice carunculata, to prey on a sea anemone, Anemonia viridis, was {{investigated}} under controlled aquarium conditions. Upon contacting, the polychaete everted its pharynx over part of the anemone and sucked its tissues. All the attacked anemones were fully consumed. H. carunculata did not seem affected by the anemones nematocysts. <b>Further</b> <b>researches</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to assess the effects of H. carunculata on sessile and sedentary species of the Mediterranean habitat...|$|R
50|$|The {{theory has}} been the subject of protests in the {{transsexual}} and larger LGBT community, although it has its supporters.

25|$|Flumazenil {{has been}} found to stimulate the {{reversal}} of tolerance and the normalization of receptor function. However, <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> in the form of randomised trials to demonstrate its role in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Flumazenil stimulates the up-regulation and reverses the uncoupling of benzodiazepine receptors to the GABAA receptor, thereby reversing tolerance and reducing withdrawal symptoms and relapse rates. Limited research and experience and possible risks involved, the flumazenil detoxification method is controversial and can only be done as an inpatient procedure under medical supervision.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{research}} suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings {{open the door to}} the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much effort}} {{has gone into}} {{restoring}} salt marshes worldwide, <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that requires careful long-term monitoring. Information on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species. Once {{we have a better}} understanding of these processes and not just locally, but over a global scale, we can then suggest more sound and practical management and restoration efforts that can be used to preserve our valuable marshes and put them back to their original state.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this review was to systematically identify and evaluate all known studies testing empirically the efficacy of psychosocial intervention programmes for adults with visible differences.
