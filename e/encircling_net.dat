Meanwhile, longlines, stow nets, scrape gears are also important. The private sector covers a large proportion in the total production output. Cost structure and profitability depend on fishing types, scales and sectors. The study also presents recommendtions for further development of the industry. Particular emphasis is placed on gaining knowledge of resource management and fishing technology. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Seabirds {{are known}} to make {{extensive}} use of fishery waste, a phenomenon that has been particularly well studied in relation to demersal fisheries, especially when operating during daylight hours. Contrarily, very {{little is known about}} the importance of predominantly nocturnal fisheries in providing feeding opportunities to seabirds. We considered the particular case of purse seining for small pelagic fish, which takes place basically at night, and assessed the significance of this fishing practice for seabirds off the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean). Fieldwork was conducted on board commercial purse seiners (nocturnal activity) in 1997 - 1998, and was complemented with observations performed on board both commercial bottom trawlers (diurnal activity; 1997 - 1998) and a research vessel (1999 - 2000). The purse seine fleet targets small clupeoids, which are attracted and concentrated by the light of a powerful lamp, and then captured using an <b>encircling</b> <b>net.</b> Purse seiners frequently changed fishing area, took very variable catches, and were strongly influenced by the weather. This made the fishery unattractive to most seabird species, which primarily attended purse seiners during the discarding process. This process took place on the way back to port after dawn (i. e. with daylight) during daylight and was quite irregular, thus attracting lower numbers of seabirds than did trawlers. The threatened Audouin's gull Larus audouinii was the only species attending purse seiners regularly at night, capturing live fish concentrated at the sea surface during the hauling process. This is in accordance with the specialisation of this gull in the capture of epipelagic fish at night, which seems facilitated by purse seiners. Indeed, the vessels would favour the direct capture of fish (illumination of the sea surface, concentration of the fish), as well as the location of the shoals (light signalling). The purse seining fishery was especially important for Audouin's gull during trawling moratoria (when trawling discards were not available) and in the non-breeding season. A simple bioenergetic model estimated that individual Audouin's gulls could obtain a mean of 669 kJ haul- 1, which would represent far more than hall of the daily energy requirements of breeding birds. Provided that Audouin's gulls feeding in a given area could attend more than one haul in a short time, birds attending purse seiners at night could easily meet their energy requirements. However, there was strong variability in our estimate (from 0 to 1659 kJ bird- 1 haul- 1, 95 % CI), and feeding at purse seiners would only sometimes be profitable for Audouin's gulls. Purse seine fisheries could be of importance for other nocturnal seabirds in other regions such as the SE Pacific, and this deserves further research. It is important to note that purse seiners could also be detrimental for many seabirds, through direct competition and eventual depletion of fish stocks.

40|$|Kairampani, the {{traditional}} shore seine of coastal Karnataka in South India, {{is an effective}} indigenous fi shing operation, still practiced along coastal Karnataka. A larger version of this shore seine, namely Rampani has become obsolete {{with the advent of}} mechanization in craft and gear. The following study {{on the use of the}} mini shore seine, which is on the verge of extinction, revealed that Kairampani is now being used sporadically across coastal Karnataka and the number has dwindled to few units from hundreds during ancient times. It is used mainly during the monsoon months of June–August. It is a labor-intensive operation involving 40 – 50 fi shermen pulling the nets from the shore with their hands, as the dhoni (a traditional boat), with its crew fi shes at sea with the <b>encircling</b> <b>nets.</b> Hence the name “Kairampani” where ‘kai’ in the local Tulu dialect has dual meaning, i. e., ‘hand’ or ‘small’.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, small pelagic {{fisheries}} have shown an increasing development in Senegal, especially those targeting Sardinella aurita and S. maderensis. Their landing and fishing effort quickly increase for both species, {{from less than}} 100, 000 tons with 35, 035 trips in the early 80 's to a peak of over 400, 000 tons with 86, 427 trips in 2008. The Senegalese small scale pelagic fisheries, targeting both species, {{accounts for more than}} 86 % of the artisanal fishery landing in biomass. We investigated the effects of small scale fishing over ten years (2004 - 2013) with generalized additive model fitting techniques using landings vs. fishing effort per gear and type of fishing gears in the Northern and southern parts of Senegal. The study revealed that these effects are more pronounced in the Northern area for S. aurita while they are more significant in the Southern area for S. maderensis. The purse seine, i. e the main Senegalese fishing gear targeting Sardinella, provides the most significant effects on S. aurita landings in both areas, while for S. maderensis, the most significant effects are shared between two fishing gears: purse seine in the Northern area and <b>encircling</b> gill <b>nets</b> in the Southern area.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of human activities is endangering megafauna in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. While large marine vertebrates are often vulnerable and emblematic species, many {{are considered to}} be declining, primarily due to fisheries activities. In the open ocean, certain fisheries improve their efficiency of detecting tuna schools by locating and fishing close to some macro-organisms, such as whale sharks or marine mammals. However, collecting accurate data on the accidental capture and mortality of these organisms is a complex process. We analyzed a large database of logbooks from 65 industrial vessels with and without scientific observers on board (487, 272 and 16, 096 fishing sets since 1980 and 1995 respectively) in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Distribution maps of Sightings Per Unit of Effort highlights major hotspots of interactions between the fishery and whale sharks in the coastal area from Gabon to Angola in the Atlantic from April to September, and in the Mozambique Channel in the Indian Ocean between April and May. The incidence of apparent whale shark mortality due to fishery interaction is extremely low (two of the 145 whale sharks <b>encircled</b> by the <b>net</b> died, i. e. 1. 38 %). However, these two hotspots presented a relatively high rate of incidental whale shark capture.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the present state}} of marine resources in several coastal barangays of Ibajay and Tangalan, Aklan (Philippines). Field data were obtained from rapid surveys conducted from July to September 1998. Recommendations based on analyses of the data will guide fisherfolk and other stakeholders, particularly the local government units, in their development plans for these neighboring municipalities. Both land and marine products in the area are mainly harvested for the local market. All coastal barangays are dependent on fishing for their livelihood. The medium-scale municipal fishery of Tangalan employs several passive (<b>encircling</b> gill <b>net,</b> bag net, fish corral) and active gears (baby purse seine) compared with the traditional fishing methods employed by Ibajay fishers. Pond aquaculture in mangrove areas is well-developed in Ibajay West (barangays Aquino and Ondoy) and in Tangalan. However, ownership of these ponds is limited to a few individuals and families, unlike in Barangay Bugtong Bato where informal ownership distributed among families has been the traditional rule. Nonetheless, the introduction of so-called environment-friendly methods of utilizing mangroves (e. g., aquasilviculture) and other shared coastal resources may seriously undermine the informal rights-based social structures in the barangays. Without proper rules and enforcement, the application of these methods may be misused, aggravating the already poor overall state of their coastal resources. Major problems affecting their fishing livelihood include siltation of nearshore waters due to illegal deforestation upland, encroachment of municipal fishing grounds by commercial and other fishers elsewhere, and the lack of capital to finance the fishery. Weak inter-organizational links among government and non-government organizations have hampered the implementation of solutions to these common problems in coastal barangays. For instance, a conflict between fishers from these neighboring municipalities over territorial boundaries of common fishing grounds in Pangayawan and Pungtod reefs has not been resolved over the years. Likewise, the introduction of aquasilviculture in mangrove areas may become a potent source of conflict among resource-users who maintain informal rights over the mangrove resource. The overall state of coastal resources in these municipalities is in immediate need of a unified plan to promote both their preservation and conservation. To achieve this end, a joint resource management council representing all resource-users from both municipalities must be organized and convened. To address the presently weak inter-organizational links among existing organizations, this joint council may provide a legitimate forum to identify, resolve, integrate, implement, and enforce guidelines on the common use of resources, both marine and inland. Low estimated yields from the reef fishery, conversion of mangroves for aquaculture beyond the allowable limit, a persistent conflict over fishing rights in several reefs offshore, the limited resources for seaweed and fish mariculture, and threats on existing traditional social structures by progressive resource-users are several issues that require thorough discussions to formulate popularly approved and acceptable management strategies. These strategies include community-based approaches of co-managing resources such as "no-take zones" (sanctuaries), ecotourism development, and livelihood schemes to mitigate, in part, the pressure of over-exploitation of fishery resources...|$|R
