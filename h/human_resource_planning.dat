Specifically, the study aimed in finding answers to four objectives. It assessed the extent of <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> succession <b>planning</b> activities in Tanzania work organizations; it also examined the challenges facing <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> succession <b>planning</b> in the Tanzania work organizations. Furthermore, the study assessed the positive factors influencing <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> succession <b>planning</b> in Tanzania work organizations. Finally, the study looked at strategies used for enhancing the application of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> succession <b>planning</b> in Tanzania work organizations. The study employed questionnaire, key informants, FGDs as well as documentations were used during this study. The study findings indicate that {{majority of the respondents}} did not have knowledge on the concept of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> succession <b>planning</b> and how it works in their organizations. Few organizations surveyed conducted succession planning but how effective and regularly done in the organizations remained questionable. The study finding showed that <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> succession <b>planning</b> played an important role for the organization development. Hence, all organizations should understand the paramount role played by <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> succession <b>planning</b> for their survival. Moreover, various strategies of enhancing <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> succession <b>plans</b> were identified during this study and included attracting and recruiting potential employees, Effective leadership and management development and improving budget was among the strategies identified in enhancing effective <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> succession <b>planning</b> in the surveyed organizations.

40|$|This study {{provides}} current, comprehensive {{information about the}} formal <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic <b>planning</b> practices of major U. S. corporations and examines {{the impact of this}} planning on organization performance. ^ The research in this study was carried out in two phases. Phase one consisted of a mail survey to identify firms using formal <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic <b>planning</b> processes. Questionnaires were mailed to the Vice President of Personnel/Human Resources in each firm listed in the 1981 Fortune 500 Directory. ^ The second part of this study consisted of a comparison between the performance of the sample firms using formal <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic <b>planning</b> processes and non-users of such systems. The performance measures used in the study were sales growth, earnings growth, earnings/sales ratio, return on investment, earnings/employee, assets/employees, earnings/labor costs, and labor costs/employees. Data from the Standard and Poor 2 ̆ 7 s 1981 Compustat Tapes were used to calculate these measures. ^ Two approaches to data analysis were undertaken. The first analysis consisted of a two-way multivariate analysis of variance, using industry groupings and formal <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic planners versus non-human resource strategic planners as the independent variables, and five-year average on the eight performance measures as the dependent variables. The second analysis consisted of a comparison of five-year performance prior to the introduction of formal <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic <b>planning</b> with both five-year and ten-year post <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic <b>planning</b> performance. The results of these two analyses indicated {{no significant differences between the}} performance of firms using formal <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic <b>planning</b> and firms that do not. ^ Formal <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic <b>planning</b> is still in its infancy. Few firms have developed the fully-integrated processes outlined in the literature. Fifty-five percent of the respondent firms initiated <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic <b>planning</b> after 1976. The results show that larger firms are more likely to engage in formal <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategic <b>planning.</b> While the trend appears to be toward greater adoption of formal processes, the results presented in this study suggest that organizations have yet to reap the benefits of such planning. ...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to health <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> <b>planning</b> emphasize {{the role of}} demographic change on the needs for health <b>human</b> <b>resources.</b> Conceptual frameworks have been presented that recognize the limited role of demographic change and the broader determinants of health <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> requirements. Nevertheless, practical applications of health <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> <b>planning</b> continue to base plans on the size and demographic mix of the population applied to simple population-provider or population-utilization ratios. In this paper an analytical framework is developed based on the production of health care services and the multiple determinants of health <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> requirements. In this framework {{attention is focused on}} estimating the ‘flow’ of services required {{to meet the needs of}} the population that is then translated into the required ‘stock’ of providers to deliver this ‘flow’ of services. The requirements for <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> in the future is shown to depend on four elements: the size and demographic mix of the population (demography), the levels of risks to health and morbidity in the population (epidemiology), the services deemed appropriate to address the levels of risks to health and morbidity (standards of care), and the rate of service delivery by providers (productivity).

40|$|This article {{takes up}} the {{relatively}} neglected issue of gender in <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> policy and <b>planning</b> (HRPP), with particular reference to the health sector in developing countries. Current approaches to <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> lack any reference to gender issues. Meeting the health needs of women as major users and potential beneficiaries of health services is a key international concern. This article argues {{that in order to}} do this, attention must also be paid to both equal opportunities and efficiency issues in the health sector workforce, given the highly gender segregated nature of occupations in the health sector and the potential for both gender inequity and inefficiency in the use of <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> which this poses. Taking gender seriously in HRPP entails developing appropriate methodologies for data collection, monitoring and evaluation.
