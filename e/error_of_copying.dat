The general case, when the copying machine has as input a fixed number of identically prepared particles, is considered. A copying transformation and dimension of state space are not specified. Only the unitarity of quantum mechanical transformations is used. The proposed approach {{is based on}} the notion of the angle between two states. Firstly, the notion of the angle between two states is discussed, and some useful inequalities are in passing considered. The upper bound on the mean global fidelity of copying of two-state set is derived. The lower bounds on the absolute <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> with multiple copies are then examined. For the case, in which the copying machine has as input one original particle, this question was first considered by Hillery and Buzek.

Finally, the case of the mixed initial state of the copying machine is considered...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Determination of {{rejections}} of {{tooth profile}} of the arched gear-wheels from involute at their cutting by butt-end heads by the method <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> in different cuts, perpendicular to axis of wheel. Approach. At shaping of the cylindrical arched gear-wheels by butt-end chisel heads by a method a copying involute profile will get only in a central cut on the width of wheel. In other cuts, perpendicular to axis of wheel, a profile will be different from involute. The shown out analytical dependences for the calculation of type of hollow of tooth in any crossing, perpendicular to axis of gear-wheel, enable to define the <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> profile at cutting of these wheels. On {{the basis of the}} conducted calculations influence of parameters of gear-wheel and chisel head is shown on the <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> profile. Hooking of the arched gear-wheels, cut by a butt-end chisel head by the method <b>of</b> <b>copying</b> and solution <b>of</b> problem of the mutual crossing of profiles of two gear-wheels is offered is investigational. Conclusion. Profile of tooth of the arched gear-wheel at his shaping by a butt-end chisel head in cuts, perpendicular to axis of wheel(except for middle), characterized by the rejection of profile (by a certain error). It is in-process shown that the size <b>of</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> profile depends on the radius of chisel head, distance from a middle cut, module, amount of teeth, corner of hooking and offset ratio. Importance. The shown out analytical dependences enable to forecast the size <b>of</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> {{profile of the}} arched wheels at cutting butt-end chisel heads. ? ?????? ??????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ??????? ???????? ????? ????????? ????????? ?????????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ??????? ??????? ???? ? ???????? ???????????????? ??? ????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ??? ????????? ??????? ????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????????. ???????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ?????? ? ???????? ??????? ?? ??????????? ???????. ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????????...|$|R

40|$|The FCGR 3 locus {{encoding}} the low affinity activating receptor FcγRIII, plays a {{vital role}} in immunity triggered by cellular effector and regulatory functions. <b>Copy</b> number <b>of</b> the genes FCGR 3 A and FCGR 3 B has previously been reported to affect susceptibility to several autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions. However, such genetic association studies often yield inconsistent results; hence require assays that are robust with low error rate. We investigated the accuracy and efficiency in estimating FCGR 3 CNV by comparing Sequenom MassARRAY and paralogue ratio test-restriction enzyme digest variant ratio (PRT-REDVR). In addition, since many genetic association studies of FCGR 3 B CNV were carried out using real-time quantitative PCR, we have also included the evaluation of that method's performance in estimating the multi-allelic CNV of FCGR 3 B. The qPCR assay exhibited a considerably broader distribution of signal intensity, potentially introducing <b>error</b> in estimation <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> number and higher false positive rates. Both Sequenom and PRT-REDVR showed lesser systematic bias, but Sequenom skewed towards copy number normal (CN = 2). The discrepancy between Sequenom and PRT-REDVR might be attributed either to batch effects noise in individual measurements. Our study suggests that PRT-REDVR is more robust and accurate in genotyping the CNV of FCGR 3, but highlights the needs of multiple independent assays for extensive validation when performing a genetic association study with multi-allelic CNVs.

40|$|A {{key idea}} in Lashley's {{formulation}} {{of the problem of}} serial order in behavior is the postulated neural representation of all serial elements before the action begins. We studied this question by recording the activity of individual neurons simultaneously in small ensembles in prefrontal cortex while monkeys copied geometrical shapes shown on a screen. Monkeys drew the shapes as sequences of movement segments, and these segments were associated with distinct patterns of neuronal ensemble activity. Here we show that these patterns were present during the time preceding the actual drawing. The rank of the strength of representation of a segment in the neuronal population during this time, as assessed by discriminant analysis, predicted the serial position of the segment in the motor sequence. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> in <b>copying</b> and their neural correlates supplied additional evidence for this code and provided a neural basis for Lashley's hypothesis that errors in motor sequences would be most likely to occur when executing elements that had prior representations of nearly equal strength...|$|R
