5|$|The {{movement}} of electric charge {{is known as}} an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> some things, electrical conductors, but will not <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> an electrical insulator.|$|E

5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morré and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was {{made as a}} way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through lipid flow from the sites of lipid synthesis. The idea of lipid <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{process by}} which {{electric}} current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies {{with that of the}} charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.|$|E
5|$|Tubular veins {{run through}} the two-layered {{membranous}} wing. Veins {{are connected to the}} haemocoel and in theory allow haemolymph to <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> them. In addition, a nerve and trachea may pass through the veins.|$|E

5|$|After sharing {{multiple}} stadia across Greater Manchester between 2005 and 2015, F.C. United {{opened their}} own ground, Broadhurst Park in north-east Manchester, in May 2015. The {{team has been}} managed by former professional footballer Karl Marginson since its formation. The club's regular kit colours are red shirts, white shorts and black socks.

5|$|Between one of Stafford Meadow Brook's {{reservoirs}} {{and southern}} Scranton, the watershed {{of the stream}} is glacially deformed. At a saddle in this reach, the stream was once able to <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> Rocky Glen into Spring Brook during high flow conditions. There is an inner ridge between the gorge of Stafford Meadow Brook and that or Roaring Brook.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is popular}} in the park. Some of the finest fly fishing in North America {{can be found in}} the streams that <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> Glacier National Park. Though the park {{requires}} that those fishing understand the regulations, no permit is required to fish the waters within the park boundary. The threatened bull trout must be released immediately back to the water if caught; otherwise, the regulations on limits of catch per day are liberal.|$|E

5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood <b>flow</b> (<b>through</b> a severely narrowed vessel) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
5|$|In Fischer v. United States (2000), the Court {{held that}} the {{jurisdictional}} requirement of $10,000 in federal funds can be satisfied by any funds that <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> the organization, for example Medicaid reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the patients. The only requirement is that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation, and that their receipt be in furtherance of a federal policy.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the five}} major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions {{in the past}} 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes {{generate}} magma of dacitic origin, the viscous magma builds up since it cannot <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> the eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating in an explosion that ejects materials such as tephra, which in its simplest form, is ash.|$|E
