5|$|<b>Epithelial</b> <b>tissue</b> is {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|Adenocarcinoma is {{a cancer}} of <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue</b> that has glandular characteristics. Several {{head and neck}} cancers are adenocarcinomas (either of {{intestinal}} or non-intestinal cell-type).|$|E
25|$|Fibroadenomas, are benign breast tumours {{characterized}} by an admixture of stromal and <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue.</b> Breasts are made of lobules (milk producing glands) and ducts (tubes that carry the milk to the nipple). These are surrounded by glandular, fibrous and fatty tissues. Fibroadenomas develop from the lobules. The glandular tissue and ducts grow over the lobule to form a solid lump.|$|E

25|$|The dermis is {{the layer}} of skin beneath the {{epidermis}} that consists of <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue</b> and cushions the body from stress and strain. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane. It also harbors many nerve endings that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains the hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. The {{blood vessels in the}} dermis provide nourishment and waste removal from its own cells {{as well as from the}} Stratum basale of the epidermis.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} ostariophysan fishes, the swim bladder has two chambers. The {{anterior}} chamber {{is connected to}} the inner ear by a series of small bones derived from neck vertebrae called the Weberian apparatus, which greatly enhances its hearing capability. The posterior chamber extends along the whole length of the body and maintains the fish's buoyancy. E. electricus has a well-developed sense of hearing. This fish has a vascularized respiratory system with gas exchange occurring through <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue</b> in its buccal cavity. As obligate air-breathers, electric eels must rise to the surface every ten minutes or so to inhale before returning to the bottom. Nearly eighty percent of the oxygen used by the fish is obtained in this way.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls of}} the hollow cochlea are made of bone, with a thin, {{delicate}} lining of <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue.</b> This coiled tube is divided through most of its length by an inner membranous partition. Two fluid-filled outer spaces (ducts or scalae) are formed by this dividing membrane. At {{the top of the}} snailshell-like coiling tubes, there is a reversal of the direction of the fluid, thus changing the vestibular duct to the tympanic duct. This area is called the helicotrema. This continuation at the helicotrema allows fluid being pushed into the vestibular duct by the oval window to move back out via movement in the tympanic duct and deflection of the round window; since the fluid is nearly incompressible and the bony walls are rigid, it is essential for the conserved fluid volume to exit somewhere.|$|E

2500|$|Cryptosporidium is the {{organism}} most commonly isolated in HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhea. Despite not being identified until 1976, {{it is one}} of the most common waterborne diseases and is found worldwide. [...] The parasite is transmitted by environmentally hardy microbial cysts (oocysts) that, once ingested, sporozoites within oocysts excyst (i.e., are released) and result in an infection of intestinal <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} {{carcinogens}} {{are most often}} related to human exposures but mammals {{are not the only}} species that can be affected by cancer-causing toxicants. [...] Many studies have shown that cancer can develop in fish species as well. Neoplasms occurring in <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue</b> such as the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the pancreas have been linked to various environmental toxicants. Carcinogens preferentially target the liver in fish and develop hepatocellular and biliary lesions.|$|E
2500|$|In the embryo, the {{formation}} of the neural folds originates from the area where the neural plate and the surrounding ectoderm converge. This region of the embryo is formed after gastrulation, and consists of <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue.</b> [...] Here, the epithelial cells elongate by means of microtubule polymerization, increasing their height. [...] The thumbnail below shows this process, as well as the subsequent formation of the neural crest cells and the neural tube, which arise from the joining of the neural folds.|$|E
40|$|Mucosal <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissues</b> {{are exposed}} to high numbers of microbes, {{including}} commensal fungi, {{and are able to}} distinguish between those that are avirulent and those that cause disease. Epithelial cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to defend against colonization and invasion by Candida species. The interplay between mucosal <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissues</b> and immune cells is key for control and clearance of fungal infections. Our understanding of the mucosal innate host defense system has expanded recently with new studies bringing to light the importance of epithelial cell responses, innate T cells, neutrophils, and other phagocytes during Candida infections. <b>Epithelial</b> <b>tissues</b> release cytokines, host defense peptides, and alarmins during Candida invasion that act in concert to limit fungal proliferation and recruit immune effector cells. The innate T cell/IL- 17 axis and recruitment of neutrophils are of central importance in controlling mucosal fungal infections. Here, we review current knowledge of the innate immunity at sites of mucosal Candida infection, with a focus on infections caused by C. albicans...|$|R

2500|$|Corneal epithelium: an {{exceedingly}} thin multicellular <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue</b> layer (non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium) of fast-growing and easily regenerated cells, kept moist with tears. [...] Irregularity or edema of the corneal epithelium disrupts the smoothness of the air/tear-film interface, {{the most significant}} component of the total refractive power of the eye, thereby reducing visual acuity. [...] It is continuous with the conjunctival epithelium, and is composed of about 6 layers of cells which are shed constantly on the exposed layer and are regenerated by multiplication in the basal layer.|$|E
2500|$|An ulcer ( [...] ; from Latin ulcus, [...] "ulcer, sore") is a {{break in}} the skin or mucous {{membrane}} with loss of surface tissue and the disintegration and necrosis of <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue.</b> A mucosal ulcer is an ulcer which specifically occurs on a mucous membrane. An ulcer is a tissue defect which has penetrated the epithelial-connective tissue border, with its base at a deep level in the submucosa, or even within muscle or periosteum. An ulcer is a deeper breach of the epithelium than an erosion or an excoriation, and involves damage to both epithelium and lamina propria.|$|E
2500|$|Research by NCAR radiochemist Ed Martell {{suggested}} that radioactive compounds in cigarette smoke are deposited in [...] "hot spots" [...] where bronchial tubes branch, that tar from cigarette smoke is resistant to dissolving in lung fluid and that radioactive compounds {{have a great}} deal of time to undergo radioactive decay before being cleared by natural processes. Indoors, these radioactive compounds can linger in secondhand smoke, and greater exposure would occur when these radioactive compounds are inhaled during normal breathing, which is deeper and longer than when inhaling cigarettes. Damage to the protective <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue</b> from smoking only increases the prolonged retention of insoluble polonium-210 compounds produced from burning tobacco. Martell estimated that a carcinogenic radiation dose of 80–100 rads is delivered to the lung tissue of most smokers who die of lung cancer.|$|E

50|$|In general, simple <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissues</b> are {{classified}} by {{the shape of}} their cells. The four major classes of simple epithelium are: (1) simple squamous; (2) simple cuboidal; (3) simple columnar; (4) pseudostratified.|$|R
5000|$|Stage Six: The cat's body is {{overwhelmed}} by infection and mucosal and glandular <b>epithelial</b> cells (<b>tissue</b> that forms a thin protective layer on exposed bodily surfaces and forms {{the lining of}} internal cavities, ducts, and organs) become infected. The virus replicates in <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissues</b> including salivary glands, oropharynx, stomach, esophagus, intestines, trachea, nasopharynx, renal tubules, bladder, pancreas, alveolar ducts, and sebaceous ducts from the muzzle.|$|R
2500|$|The {{formation}} of the neural fold is initiated by the release of calcium from within the cells. [...] The released calcium interacts with proteins that can modify the actin filaments in the outer <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue,</b> or ectoderm, in order to induce the dynamic cell movements necessary to create the fold. [...] These cells are held together by cadherins (specifically E and N-cadherin), types of intercellular binding protein. [...] When the cells at the peaks of the neural folds come in proximity with each other, it is the affinity for similar cadherin molecules (N-cadherins) that allows these cells to bind to each other. [...] Thus, when the neural tube precursor cells begin expressing N-cadherin {{in the place of}} E-cadherin, this causes the neural tube to form and separate from the ectoderm and settle inside the embryo. [...] When the cells fail to associate {{in a manner that is}} not part of the normal course of development, severe diseases can occur.|$|E
2500|$|The {{digestive}} tract begins slightly behind the head, the mouth {{lying on the}} underside a little way from the frontmost point of the body. Here, prey can be mechanically dismembered by the mandibles with their covering of fine toothlets. Two salivary glands discharge via a common conductor into the subsequent [...] "throat", which makes up {{the first part of}} the front intestine. The saliva that they produce contains mucus and hydrolytic enzymes, which initiate in and outside the mouth digestion. Historically, the salivary glands probably evolved from the waste-elimination organs known as nephridia, which are found homologously in the other body segments. The throat itself is very muscular, serving to absorb the partially liquified food and to pump it, via the oesophagus, which forms the rear part of the front intestine, into the central intestine. Unlike the front intestine, this is not lined with a cuticula but instead consists only of a single layer of <b>epithelial</b> <b>tissue,</b> which does not exhibit conspicuous indentation as is found in other animals. On entering the central intestine, food particles are coated with a mucus-based peritrophic membrane, which serves to protect the lining of the intestine from damage by sharp-edged particles. The intestinal epithelium secretes further digestive enzymes and absorbs the released nutrients, although the majority of digestion has already taken place externally or in the mouth. Indigestible remnants arrive in the rear intestine, or rectum, which is once again lined with a cuticula and which opens at the anus, located on the underside near to the rear end.|$|E
