An increase of one degree Celsius produces a two- to three-fold increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of malaria. In 2010, the incidence in British tawny owls was 60%, compared to 2–3% in 1996.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 1950 Census showed {{growth in}} Teaneck (33.6%) pacing Bergen County overall (31.6%). Starting in 1960, a {{substantial}} decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached {{the limits of}} developable land, and the township neared its peak population. Population growth in the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census showed recovery in Teaneck's population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) was smaller than in Bergen County overall (7.1%).|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant variability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight {{and reduced the}} solar energy reaching {{the surface of the}} Earth. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E

5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. Sea levels may fall because of increased glaciation. The rate of surface weathering can rise, resulting in an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures {{and an increase in}} atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in more rapid biological evolution as new niches emerge.|$|E

5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force. As stars are not solid bodies, they can also undergo differential rotation. Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes. These differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of rotation within a star may have {{a significant role in}} the generation of a stellar magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{wealth of}} galaxies at {{different}} stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of star formation over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies are somewhat crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8–10 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{variation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> {{and extent of}} recovery. The prognosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome is determined mainly by age (those over 40 may have a poorer outcome), and by the severity of symptoms after two weeks. Furthermore, those who experienced diarrhea {{before the onset of}} disease have a worse prognosis. On the nerve conduction study, the presence of conduction block predicts poorer outcome at 6 months. In those who have received intravenous immunoglobulins, a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially. If the disease continues to progress beyond four weeks, or there are multiple fluctuations in the severity (more than two in eight weeks), the diagnosis may be chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which is treated differently.|$|E

5|$|The Sun {{is about}} halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion {{reactions}} in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star. The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the inverse-square law. This stronger force increases {{the pressure on the}} core, which is resisted by a gradual increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.|$|E
5|$|The crocodilian {{has perhaps}} the most complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have heart valves that direct blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary oedema, or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|Virginia has a mixed health record, and {{is ranked}} as the 26th overall healthiest state {{according}} to the 2013 United Health Foundation's Health Rankings.

In 2008, Virginia reached its lowest ever rate of infant mortality, at 6.7 deaths per1,000. There are however racial and social health disparities, in 2010 African Americans experienced 28% more premature deaths than whites, while 13% of Virginians lack any health insurance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2009 survey, 26% of Virginians are obese and another 35% are overweight. 78% of residents claim to have exercised {{at least once in}} the past three months. About 30% of Virginia's 10- to 17-year-olds are overweight or obese. Virginia banned smoking in bars and restaurants in January 2010. 19% of Virginians smoke tobacco. Residents of Virginia's 8th congressional district share the longest average life expectancy rate in the nation, over 83 years.|$|E
