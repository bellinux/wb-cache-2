50|$|The five <b>finger</b> <b>drains</b> or box drains at Smith's Cove on Oak Island, {{which have}} {{traditionally}} been assumed to feed seawater into the alleged flood tunnel, have in recent times been argued to be the remains of an early salt works, and accordingly there is no connection between the five <b>finger</b> <b>drains</b> and any flooding of the Pit.|$|E

60|$|The inmates drew away as {{he leaned}} {{back for a moment}} against the door that closed behind him. Then dimly, but instinctively, discerning the glass of liquor which Wingate still {{mechanically}} held in his hand, he reached forward eagerly, took it from Wingate's surprised and unresisting <b>fingers,</b> and <b>drained</b> it at a gulp. The four men laughed vaguely, but not as cheerfully as they might.|$|R
50|$|After two weeks, {{the owner}} {{will start to}} hear sounds {{coming out of the}} bottle. It is the sound of crying. By then he should cut his <b>finger</b> and <b>drain</b> the blood into the bottle to feed the demon. This is the sign of {{allegiance}} and of loyalty to serve the master. The blood which feeds the demon is said to have tied both parties together: one as Master and the other as the servant.|$|R
50|$|While {{the other}} {{waterways}} of Chemung County {{are part of}} the Susquehanna River basin, Catharine Creek is part of the St. Lawrence River basin. It flows into Seneca Lake, the largest of the <b>Finger</b> Lakes, which <b>drains</b> into Lake Ontario via the Seneca and Oswego rivers.|$|R
5000|$|North of Lamoka Lake {{is another}} lake called Waneta Lake, {{previously}} known as [...] "Little Lake", which {{is linked to}} Lamoka Lake by a short channel. Both Lamoka Lake and Waneta Lake are east of Keuka Lake, one of the Finger Lakes, however they {{are not part of}} the Finger Lakes drainage system. While the <b>Finger</b> Lakes <b>drain</b> north into the St. Lawrence River system, Lamoka and Waneta Lakes drain south into Mill Pond, then Mud Creek, and then to the Cohocton River in the Susquehanna River system.|$|R
5000|$|Ice Formations (IF) - Encompass the {{following}} features: Horizontal layers, resulting from rain or meltwater {{from the surface}} percolating into cold snow and refreezing along layer barriers. Vertical <b>fingers</b> of frozen <b>drained</b> water. A basal crust resurgent from melt water ponding above a substrate and freezes. A glaze of ice on the snow surface, resulting from freezing rain on snow. A sun crust from melt water at the surface snow refreezes at the surface due to radiative cooling.|$|R
50|$|The {{electrophorus}} {{consists of}} a dielectric plate (originally a 'cake' of resinous material such as pitch or wax, but in modern versions plastic is used) and a metal plate with an insulating handle. The dielectric plate is first charged through the triboelectric effect by rubbing it with fur or cloth. For this discussion, imagine the dielectric gains negative charge by rubbing, as in the illustration below. The metal plate is then placed onto the dielectric plate. The dielectric does not transfer a significant fraction of its surface charge to the metal because the microscopic contact is poor. Instead the electrostatic field of the charged dielectric causes the charges in the metal plate to separate. It develops two regions of charge — the positive charges in the plate are attracted to the side facing down toward the dielectric, charging it positively, while the negative charges are repelled to the side facing up, charging it negatively, with the plate remaining electrically neutral as a whole. Then, the side facing up is momentarily grounded (which {{can be done by}} touching it with a <b>finger),</b> <b>draining</b> off the negative charge. Finally, the metal plate, now carrying only one sign of charge (positive in our example), is lifted.Since the charge on the dielectric is not depleted in this process, the charge on the metal plate can be used for experiments, for example by touching it to metal conductors allowing the charge to drain away, and the uncharged metal plate can be placed back on the dielectric and the process repeated to get another charge. This can be repeated as often as desired, so in principle an unlimited amount of induced charge can be obtained from a single charge on the dielectric. For this reason Volta called it elettroforo perpetuo (the perpetual electricity bearer). In actual use the charge on the dielectric will eventually (within a few days at most) leak off through the surface of the cake or the atmosphere to recombine with opposite charges around to restore neutrality.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of metamorphic high electron mobility transistor stability at cryogenic temperature {{is presented in}} this paper. Unlike {{in the case of}} two-finger transistors, the measurements of cooled four-finger devices with large gate widths exhibit unstable behavior in the form of steps in the current voltage characteristics, discontinuities in the transconductance, and reduced gain. This unstable behavior has hampered the reliable realization of low-noise amplifiers for cryogenic applications. We study different gate-width devices with a multiport transistor model, allowing the separation of gate and drain feeder structures from the active part of the transistor. The simulation reveals the presence of resonances in the frequency region of several hundreds of gigahertz. We demonstrate that the resonances disappear when an air bridge is placed across the <b>fingers</b> of the <b>drain</b> feeder structure, and confirm the stabilizing effect of the air bridge both on device and circuit level by cryogenic measurements...|$|R
50|$|Powerlock {{connectors}} {{are designated}} as source or drain. The source connectors {{are intended to}} have their permanent connection {{in the direction of}} the source of electrical energy, and the drain connectors are intended to have their permanent connection in the direction of equipment receiving power. The role of male and female connectors is opposite to traditional usage in other designs of power connector - the Powerlock source connector has a male pin and the drain connector has a female receptacle. This does not however compromise safety because the gap between the plastic insulating cap on the male pin of the source connector and the surrounding plastic housing is too small to insert a human <b>finger.</b> The female <b>drain</b> connector also has a spring-loaded plastic cap to prevent casual contact with the electrical contact; however with sufficient pressure this can be displaced with a finger.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{origin of}} subparallel, regularly-spaced {{longitudinal}} ridges often observed {{at the surface}} of volcanic and other rock avalanche deposits remains unclear. We addressed this issue through analogue laboratory experiments on flows of bi-disperse granular mixtures, because this type of flow is known to exhibit granular fingering that causes elongated structures resembling the ridges observed in nature. We considered four different mixtures of fine (300 – 400 μm) glass beads and coarse (600 – 710 μm to 900 – 1000 μm) angular crushed fruit stones, with particle size ratios of 1. 9 – 2. 7 and mass fractions of the coarse component of 5 – 50 wt%. The coarse particles segregated at the flow surface and accumulated at the front where flow instabilities with a well-defined wavelength grew. These formed granular fingers made of coarse-rich static margins delimiting fines-rich central channels. Coalescence of adjacent finger margins created regular spaced longitudinal ridges, which became topographic highs as <b>finger</b> channels <b>drained</b> at final emplacement stages. Three distinct deposit morphologies were observed: 1) Joined fingers with ridges were formed at low (≤ 1. 9) size ratio and moderate (10 – 20 wt%) coarse fraction whereas 2) separate fingers or 3) poorly developed fingers, forming series of frontal lobes, were created at larger size ratios and/or higher coarse contents. Similar ridges and lobes are observed at the debris avalanche deposits of Tutupaca volcano, Peru, suggesting that the processes operating in the experiments can also occur in nature. This implies that volcanic (and non-volcanic) debris avalanches can behave as granular flows, which {{has important implications for}} interpretation of deposits and for modeling. Such behaviour may be acquired as the collapsing material disaggregates and forms a granular mixture composed by a right grain size distribution in which particle segregation can occur. Limited fragmentation and block sliding, or grain size distributions inappropriate for promoting granular fingering can explain why ridges are absent in many deposits...|$|R
