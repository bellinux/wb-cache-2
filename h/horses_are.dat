5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E
5|$|Although the Thoroughbred is {{primarily}} bred for racing, the breed {{is also used}} for show jumping and combined training because of its athleticism, and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses, dressage horses, and youth show horses. The larger <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> sought after for hunter/jumper and dressage competitions, whereas the smaller <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> in demand as polo ponies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{training}} a guide <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> rigorous and takes about eight months for each horse. [...] Initially, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in basic lead work, {{in which the}} <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> taught to move at the speed that the handler commands and to navigate common obstacles. Next, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in voice command recognition, and taught to respond to 23 voice commands. The <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> then taught to maneuver around both stationary and moving obstacles. After this, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained to signal to the handler {{when there is a}} step or ramp. Finally, the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> housebroken, generally an easy process because of horses’ natural aversion to depositing fecal waste indoors. Intelligent disobedience is a crucial part of the training of the guide horse, as the <b>horse</b> must <b>be</b> able to disregard any commands that would be unsafe to the horse and the handler.|$|R
5000|$|In other words, the {{expression}} [...] "a white <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> not a horse" [...] is ambiguous between [...] "a white <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> not identical with a horse" [...] (true, because [...] "white horse" [...] is more specific than [...] "horse"), and [...] "a white <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{not a member}} of the set of horses" [...] (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting that [...] "a white <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> not with a horse," [...] while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as [...] "a white <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> not member of the group of horses." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Quarter <b>Horse</b> <b>were</b> prevalent in America in the early 17th century. These <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> a blend of Colonial Spanish horses crossed with English <b>horses</b> that <b>were</b> brought over in the 1700s. The native horse and the English <b>horse</b> <b>were</b> bred together, resulting in a compact, muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The American Quarter <b>Horse</b> <b>was</b> not recognized as an official breed until {{the formation of the}} American Quarter Horse Association in 1940.|$|R
5|$|Auxois <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> usually bay or bay roan in color, {{although}} {{they can also}} be chestnut or red roan, similar to the Ardennais. gray and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings) are also accepted for registration; all other colors are excluded. The Auxois is known for its power and docility, having a calm and gentle temperament. Like the Ardennais, it is an easy keeper, able to survive outdoors in all seasons, even in the harsh climatic conditions sometimes seen in Morvan and Nievre.|$|E
5|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>are</b> {{also used}} in many {{historical}} reenactments. Reenactors try to recreate {{the conditions of the}} battle or tournament with equipment that is as authentic as possible.|$|E
5|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>are</b> raw {{material}} for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses.|$|E
50|$|The Azerbaijan <b>horse</b> (Azərbaycan atı) <b>is</b> a mountain-steppe {{racing and}} riding <b>horse.</b> It <b>is</b> {{named after the}} {{geographic}} region where the <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> originally developed, Azerbaijan in the Caucasus. The average speed by running of Azerbaijan <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> 1600 metres in 2 minute, 66 seconds.|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war ended, the division's <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> taken to the Imperial Remount Depot at Moascar in Egypt. The riding <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{eventually}} reissued, when required, to units of the British Empire. The heavier pack and draught <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> now redundant, so these were shipped to France and sold.|$|R
5000|$|For example: The assertion: [...] "This cow <b>is</b> blue. That <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> orange {{but this}} <b>horse</b> here <b>is</b> purple." [...] is {{actually}} a compound proposition linked by [...] "AND"s: ( [...] ("This cow is blue" [...] AND [...] "that <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> orange") AND [...] "this <b>horse</b> here <b>is</b> purple" [...] ) [...]|$|R
5|$|Modern <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> {{often used}} to reenact many of their {{historical}} work purposes. <b>Horses</b> <b>are</b> used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. <b>Horses</b> <b>are</b> also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon {{similar to that used}} before the invention of the modern motorized truck.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{overpopulation}} and inbreeding, and {{to protect}} their habitat from being overgrazed, the <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> managed by the National Park Service, the state of North Carolina, and several private organizations. The <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> monitored for diseases, such as equine infectious anemia, an outbreak of which was discovered and subsequently eliminated on Shackleford in 1996. They are safeguarded from traffic on North Carolina Highway 12. Island populations are limited by adoptions and by birth control. Bankers taken from the wild and trained {{have been used for}} trail riding, driving, and occasionally for mounted patrols.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island. As of 2010, 121 horses were counted on the island during the yearly census. Censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses. Not all <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> counted during the census, and park management estimates that approximately 50 <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> missed in the counts each year, bringing the 2010 total to around 170 horses. The life span of horses on Cumberland Island is approximately half that of their ancestors, due to infestations of parasites and disease. They also suffer from digestive issues linked to the ingestion of {{a great amount of}} sand, which causes intestinal blockages and abdominal distension.|$|E
50|$|White <b>Horse</b> <b>is</b> a blended whisky, {{as opposed}} to the single malt style. White <b>Horse</b> <b>is</b> {{particularly}} noted for its use of the Lagavulin.|$|R
50|$|A <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> {{put down}} during {{the making of}} the movie which led to a Victorian {{government}} inquiry, which ruled the <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> killed needlessly.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered}} on Takarajima by Shigeyuki Hayashida, {{a professor of}} Kagoshima University, and designated the Tokara <b>horse.</b> It <b>was</b> theorized that the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> brought to Takarajima from Kikaijima around 1900. In 1953, the Tokara <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> designated a natural monument of Kagoshima. When Professor Hayashida first discovered the horses, he counted 43. Their numbers gradually declined during the 1960s because of agricultural mechanization, however, and {{it was difficult to}} monitor the population on Takarajima. Therefore, some of the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> transferred to the Mt. Kaimon Natural Park and Iriki Farm, part of the agricultural department of Kagoshima University.|$|R
5|$|Feral <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> {{born and}} live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist {{throughout}} the world. Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses, as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>are</b> {{frequently}} seen in television, {{films and}} literature. They are sometimes featured {{as a major}} character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories. Both live horses and iconic images of <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> used in advertising to promote a variety of products. The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, {{in a variety of}} poses and equipment. The mythologies of many cultures, including Greco-Roman, Hindu, Islamic, and Norse, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun. The horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar.|$|E
5|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>are</b> prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E
500|$|The {{value of}} <b>horses</b> <b>was</b> known to all. In 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, {{men at the}} front {{understood}} that [...] "at this stage to lose a <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> worse than losing a man because after all, men <b>were</b> replaceable while <b>horses</b> weren't." [...] For Britain, <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> considered so valuable that if a soldier's <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> killed or died he was required to cut off a hoof {{and bring it back}} to his commanding officer to prove that the two had not simply become separated.|$|R
50|$|The Regiment {{started the}} war as {{reconnaissance}} mounted cavalry. However, the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> withdrawn at Dunkeld and, after a brief wait. the Scottish <b>Horse</b> <b>was</b> formally dismounted.|$|R

50|$|In early years, <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{incredibly}} important to {{farmers in the}} Montmartre area, as they were the primary work animals on a farm. As farms became larger, more land was broken for raising crops. <b>Horses</b> <b>were</b> instrumental in {{the breaking of the}} land, as well as the subsequent farming activities. Steel plows were used by farmers, and required the strength of horses to pull them as they turned up the soil for planting. As plows became larger and more complex, more <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> required. <b>Horses</b> <b>were</b> also required to pull seeding and harvest equipment.|$|R
50|$|The tombs had {{all been}} robbed, but enough {{remained}} to determine that the <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> all buried in an upright position. The <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> buried with all their trappings.|$|R
50|$|Where <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> used {{they were}} worked in shifts and changed {{several times a}} day. The {{nature of the work}} was such that the typical working life of a tramway <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> about four years. Though Christchurch’s flat terrain was {{favourable}} to the operation of tramways the task of the tramway <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> made more difficult upon occasion by the overloading of tramcars.|$|R
5|$|The Icelandic {{horse is}} a breed of horse {{developed}} in Iceland. Although the <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> small, at times pony-sized, most registries for the Icelandic {{refer to it}} as a horse. Icelandic <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> long-lived and hardy. In their native country they have few diseases; Icelandic law prevents horses from being imported into the country and exported animals are not allowed to return. The Icelandic displays two gaits in addition to the typical walk, trot, and canter/gallop commonly displayed by other breeds. The only breed of horse in Iceland, they are also popular internationally, and sizable populations exist in Europe and North America. The breed is still used for traditional sheepherding work in its native country, as well as for leisure, showing, and racing.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} jobs that horses do very well, and no {{technology}} has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> still effective for {{certain types of}} patrol duties and crowd control. Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses {{can also be used}} in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. <b>Horses</b> <b>are</b> quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.|$|E
5|$|Arabians are {{involved}} {{in a wide variety of}} activities, including fairs, movies, parades, circuses and other places where <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> showcased. They have been popular in movies, dating back to the silent film era when Rudolph Valentino rode the Kellogg Arabian stallion Jadaan in 1926's Son of the Sheik, and have been seen in many other films, including The Black Stallion featuring the stallion Cass Ole, The Young Black Stallion, which used over 40 Arabians during filming, as well as Hidalgo and the 1959 version of Ben-Hur.|$|E
2500|$|A riderless <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> {{named in}} honor of Pershing, [...] "Black Jack". This <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> used for many years in {{funerals}} for heads of state, including President John F. Kennedy.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{the rider}} should use half-halts as the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> raising {{its head and}} neck upward (during the {{suspension}} phase), because this <b>is</b> when the <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> engaging its hindquarters.|$|R
