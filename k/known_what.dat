If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E

5|$|A {{skeleton}} of the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens {{has been described}} from Montana with healed tyrannosaur-inflicted damage on its tail vertebrae. The fact that the damage seems to have healed suggests that the Edmontosaurus survived a tyrannosaur's attack on a living target, i.e. the tyrannosaur had attempted active predation. There is also evidence for an aggressive interaction between a Triceratops and a Tyrannosaurus {{in the form of}} partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal (a bone of the neck frill); the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. It is not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> the exact nature of the interaction was, though: either animal could have been the aggressor. Since the Triceratops wounds healed, it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the Tyrannosaurus. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always <b>known</b> <b>what</b> they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{frequent}} mentioning of the Diolkos {{in connection with}} military operations, modern scholarship assumes that the prime purpose of the trackway {{must have been the}} transport of cargo, considering that warships cannot have needed transporting very often, and ancient historiography was always more interested in war than commerce. Comments by Pliny the Elder and Strabo, which described the Diolkos as being in regular service during times of peace, also imply a commercial use of the trackway. Coinciding with the rise of monumental architecture in Greece, the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like marble, monoliths and timber to points west and east. It is not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> tolls Corinth could extract from the Diolkos on its territory, {{but the fact that the}} trackway was used and maintained long after its construction indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity.|$|E

5|$|It is not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> the {{function}} of the oral setae in extant species is, other than the long sensory hairs seen in some genera such as Anochetus and Odontomachus. In Zigrasimecia, the similar structures most likely did not act as trigger-hairs because they are stout and shorter. Instead, they were probably used for mechanical interactions with their food. The setae may have allowed the manipulation of liquid food, and the unification of the mandibles with other body parts such as the clypeus and labral indicates that they served as a trap for potential arthropod prey, particularly mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} <b>known</b> <b>what</b> {{specific}} {{agent in}} the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E

5|$|The glyphs are stylized human, animal, {{vegetable}} and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those with heads are oriented {{head up and}} are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction of}} writing. It is not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{astronomer}} from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived {{a century after}} Aristarchus. According to Plutarch, Seleucus {{was the first to}} prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what Nicolaus Copernicus later did in the 16th century. During the Middle Ages, heliocentric models were also proposed by the Indian astronomer Aryabhata, and by the Persian astronomers Albumasar and Al-Sijzi.|$|E
5|$|A {{rapprochement}} {{between the}} two men was achieved in the winter of 1384, when Carrouges and Le Gris were both invited to the estate of a mutual friend, Jean Crespin, to celebrate the birth of his son. For the first time, Carrouges brought his wife Marguerite into society and it was at this party that she made her first acquaintance with Le Gris. Despite the tension between them, Carrouges and Le Gris shook hands and drank together, putting their quarrel behind them before their peers and neighbours. A few months later Jean de Carrouges departed on campaign to Scotland and Le Gris took the opportunity to increase his influence with the Count, making substantial financial and territorial gains in the his rival's absence. Carrouges returned a year later, now a knight but bankrupt, ill and suffering the aftermath of a long and unsuccessful campaign. When Carrouges appeared at Argentan in January 1386 he was involved in a confrontation with his erstwhile friend. Although it is not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> was said, the two men separated on poor terms and Carrouges departed for Paris in a state of agitation.|$|E
