25|$|On April 14, 2010, McDonnell {{proposed}} 96 budget {{amendments to}} the two-year 2010–2012 budget resulting in $42.1 million in spending increases and $51 million in additional budget cuts, tax increases, and court fees for criminals. He proposed to increase spending by $15 million to give incentives for SRI International and Bank of America to keep offices in Virginia. To boost revenue, McDonnell proposed raising $7.2 million by increasing the fines on motorists who exceed the speed limit. He proposed to cut an additional $9.9 million from state funded programs for at-risk and troubled children and proposed cutting $600,000 from state grants to public radio and television stations. McDonnell also issued amendatory vetoes on non-budget legislation. For example, although Virginia has provided free <b>electronic</b> <b>filing</b> of tax returns for years, his veto outsourced <b>electronic</b> <b>filing</b> to firms that charge a fee for that service. McDonnell also amended a bill to prohibit Planned Parenthood from spending funds raised from its affinity license plates on abortions. The Legislature met {{to vote on the}} Governor's amendments on April 21. A bipartisan majority accepted some of McDonnell's proposed cuts while rejecting others including those to public broadcasting, the funding for at-risk and troubled children, and the shifting of Virginia Medicaid mental health program to a managed-care plan.|$|E
25|$|Many {{counties}} use the New York State Courts <b>Electronic</b> <b>Filing</b> System {{for electronic}} court filing (e-filing, like the federal PACER system). The New York State Reporter of the New York State Law Reporting Bureau {{is the official}} reporter of decisions and is required to publish every opinion, memorandum, and motion sent to it by the Court of Appeals and the Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court in the New York Reports and Appellate Division Reports, respectively. The appellate term and trial court opinions are published selectively in the Miscellaneous Reports. The State Reporter is appointed by the Court of Appeals. The current versions are the New York Reports 3d (cited as N.Y.3d), the Appellate Division Reports 3d (cited as A.D.3d) and the Miscellaneous Reports 3d (cited as Misc.3d).|$|E
500|$|In 1988, the Singapore courts {{undertook}} {{the enormous}} task of clearing their extremely large backlogs {{in order to}} facilitate Singapore's future development as an international business and finance centre. A multifaceted approach was adopted to dispose of cases expeditiously, including, among other things, the appointment of more judges and judicial commissioners, the use of information technology, <b>electronic</b> <b>filing</b> of documents and promoting the use of alternative dispute resolution. Such efforts significantly expedited the management of cases, both in the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts. In particular, specialized courts such as small claims tribunals, the Family Court and the Night Court were set up for better distribution of cases and have also helped to significantly reduce court fees. Over and above increasing the institutional capacity and efficiency of the courts, improving access to justice in Singapore has also meant a need for a corresponding increase in the quality of justice administered. Efforts to achieve this goal centre mainly on the appointment of the [...] "best and brightest officers" [...] and in particular, the constant upgrading of their skills and knowledge for judicial excellence. For this purpose, the Judicial Education Board was set up to provide guidance, training programmes and workshops for members of the judiciary, and is supported by a training unit within the Strategic Planning and Training Division of the Subordinate Courts. Such efforts aim to upgrade the competence of judges and equip them with the requisite knowledge for handling increasingly complex cases.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} the impact of <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> sharing system on production and profit of mining and mineral processing industries. Dangote cement industry was chosen {{as a case study}} due to the company recent adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> sharing system in the delivery of the company services. The primary data for the study were obtained through questionnaires and supported with participant observation which gave the researcher an opportunity to explore, watch and study the effects of <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> sharing in daily activities of each of the sections/departments of the company. The result showed that <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> sharing system has positive impacts on more than 75 % of the staff of the company which enhance better delivery of company activities to their customers. The company uses customized applications in their distributed file sharing system which made the system more effective. Power failure, inadequate training, slow connectivity (local and internet), obsolete equipment and virus are the identified factors militating against the efficiency of files sharing system in service delivery of the company activities to their customers. The study concluded that the adoption of <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> sharing system in Dangote cement industry has ensured good services delivery to their customers, files integrity and security. This has also improved staff and organization productivity with reasonable profit which place the company as one the world class cement industry in the world...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Surety LLC {{provides}} digital time-stamping {{services with}} AbsoluteProof SM that allow customers to digitally notarize <b>electronic</b> <b>files.</b> Registration provides a customer {{with the ability}} to prove that an <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> was created at a specific time and has not been altered. This service is provided by registering the <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> fingerprint, a hash value, in Surety’s Universal Registry. The integrity of the notarization process requires the need for third-party verification of the entire process. To accomplish this Surety publishes in The New York Times a hash value on a weekly basis that is calculated using each record that has been registered. Each registered <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> has an associated Evidentiary Record that contains the data required to calculate the published value that is associated with the file. An independent utility does not currently exist to perform this verification and we demonstrate that such a utility can be built. In addition we provide a security analysis of the Surety service as its integrity is key to providing a trust-worthy time-stamping solution...|$|R

These descriptions have been placed on <b>electronic</b> <b>files,</b> the contents of which are described in this paper They are intended for use in wave drag and sonic boom calculations. Included in the <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> and in the present paper are photographs and 3 -view drawings of the two airplanes, tabulated geometric descriptions of each vehicle and its components, and comparisons of the <b>electronic</b> <b>file</b> outputs with existing data. The comparisons include a pictorial of the two airplanes based on the present geometric descriptions, and cross-sectional area distributions for both the normal Mach cuts and oblique Mach cuts {{above and below the}} vehicles. Good correlation exists between the area distributions generated in the late 1950 s and 1960 s and the present files.
