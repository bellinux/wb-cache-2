Much consideration {{has been given}} {{to the extent to which}} strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), in the limit of increased bandwidth and reduced electron correlation, drives the formation of novel electronic states, as manifested through the existence of metal-insulator transitions (MITs). SOC is believed to play a dominant role in 5 d 5 systems such as iridates (Ir 4 +), undergoing MITs which may or may not be intimately connected to magnetic order, with pyrochlore and perovksite systems being examples of the former and latter, respectively. However, the role of SOC for other 5 d configurations is less clear. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> 5 <b>d</b> 3 (<b>e.</b> g Os 5 +) systems are expected to have an orbital singlet and consequently a reduced effect of SOC in the groundstate. The pyrochlore osmate Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 nonetheless exhibits a MIT intimately entwined with magnetic order with phenomena similar to pyrochlore iridates. Here we report the first resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on an osmium compound, allowing us to determine the salient electronic and magnetic energy scales controlling the MIT in Cd 2 Os 2 O 7, which we benchmark against detailed quantum chemistry calculations. In particular, we reveal the emergence at the MIT of a magnetic excitation corresponding to a superposition of multiple spin-flip processes from an Ising-like all-in/all-out magnetic groundstate.
