40|$|A sliding mode <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is {{developed}} for over-actuated, hover-capable AUVs operating over {{a range of}} forward speeds. A simplified switching function is introduced, and simulation studies are proposed accordingly. The results with this novel switching function show a significant improvement in the chattering problem {{when compared to other}} conventional switching function candidates. Studies on sensitivities to a range of hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties are presented, and the parameters that have major influences on the sliding mode control performance are highlighted. The proposed <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is also proven in the field trials to enhance vehicle response, yielding consistent and robust performance over the entire range of vehicle's speeds, even when subjected to external disturbance. It also shows superior heading tracking performance when compared to a P-D approach implemented on the same vehicle. However, this improved performance requires intense control actions as a trade-o_, causing the AUV to expend more energy than with the P-D approach. Path following trials, where the AUV is demanded to follow a set of GPS coordinates at the water surface, are presented. These demonstrate the applicability of the proposed <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> in a practical operation. The presented SMC scheme can be applied to any vehicle straightforwardly, but the control allocation part may need to be modified regarding the actuator configuration of that vehicle. <br/...|$|R

He regarded the album as less like the [...] "standard-issue epic metal" [...] of the first album and more like [...] "Evanescence's gothy metal-pop crossed with late-era Radiohead's fondness for electronic interference". He considered the songwriting as [...] "catchy enough that it's not unthinkable that unadventurous rock radio programmers could take a shine to the title track or 'Go'", although noted that [...] "Fates Warning and Dream Theater fans might be less impressed". Rosenberg considers Free as musically [...] "a more progressive version of Nine Inch Nails. Instead of creating their darkness with angst and depression, OSI creates their darkness with sheer indifference." [...] Begrand compared the album to <b>Head</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System,</b> [...] "in that it tends to stray from the typical metal template in an attempt at something a little more electronic influenced". Although not considering Free to be as [...] "enthralling" [...] as <b>Head</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System,</b> he noted that the album [...] "still has its moments".|$|R

40|$|Biomimetic {{swimming}} {{devices that}} employ compliant mechanisms have shown promise {{as an alternative}} to current biomimetic design approaches that involve the use of complex mechanisms. The additional stealth, ruggedness, and efficiency of this approach means that such devices could perform important tasks such as reconnaissance and underwater mapping. Many of these applications also require high levels of maneuverability and closed-loop control. However, maneuverability and <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> are two areas that are relatively unexplored with regard to such devices. Therefore, in order to study maneuverability and control, this thesis outlines a simple dynamic model to predict the maneuvering behavior of compliant biomimetic swimming devices.

40|$|Abstract: Aimed at the {{submarine}} uncertainties and model’s impreciseness, an integrated RS-Chaos-LSSVM model is put forward because of nonlinearity and time-variability of AUV <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The LSSVM {{is a typical}} nonlinear regression modeling based on small sample. Its parameters are optimized by Chaos algorithm. It is to gain the optimal model and get the higher accurate. By using Rough theory the monitor data attribute of AUV is reduced to eliminate the redundant information to improve efficiency. Taken a certain typed AUV as an example, the two controller compare results. The results show the RS-Chaos-LSSVM controller markedly reduce the time. And the <b>heading</b> error and <b>control</b> rudder are simulated in the ideal and ocean current environment. In the ideal environment the two controllers all have good performances. But in the ocean current environment the simulation results show the integrated controller improve the model’s stability and accuracy. The overshoot, the rise and adjust time reduced greatly. In a word the integrated RS-Chaos-LSSVM heading predictive controller has better performances especially strong anti-interfere capability. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{activities}} in ice-covered waters are gaining increased attention nowadays. Such operations as crew change, lifting, installation, drilling, etc. may require keeping the vessel {{on a fixed}} location during long time periods. The use of dynamic positioning systems appears therefore to be an attractive solution, being much more flexible than mooring operations. However, the ice environment is significantly different from open water conditions. As known from several full-scale experiments, systems developed for open water purpose do not answer all ice challenges. Nevertheless, recent R&D projects have demonstrated the feasibility of DP in ice. During the DYPIC project, a European collaborative program, large amount of ice model basin tests have been performed at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin. Those tests have not only spotlighted stationkeeping possibilities under certain challenging conditions, but have also brought out several important aspects of ice forces on the hull. In this paper, the DYPIC outcomes are used to build an automatic <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> for a DP vessel {{in order to improve}} its stationkeeping abilities in ice. The system with automatic heading is then compared in a numerical simulation framework to a system with fixed heading. The results show that in selected scenarios the DP <b>system</b> with automatic <b>heading</b> <b>control</b> outperforms clearly the one with fixed <b>heading</b> <b>control.</b> Specifically, the ice loads and the power consumption are reduced considerably. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recently, many reseraches {{on active}} <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> of {{building}} structures are preformed based on {{modern control theory}} and are installed real buildings. The authors have already proposed intelligent fuzzy optimal active <b>control</b> (IFOAC) <b>systems.</b> IFOAC systems imitate intelligent activities of human brains such as prediction, adaptation, decision-kaking and so on. In IFOAC systems, objective and subjective judgements on the active control can be taken into account. However, IFOAC systems {{are considered to be}} suitable for far-field erathquake and control effect becomes small in case of near-field earthqaukes which include a few velosity pules with large amplitudes. To improve control effect in case of near-souece earthquakes, the authors have also proposed hybrid <b>control</b> (<b>HC)</b> <b>systems,</b> in which IFOAC <b>systems</b> and fuzzy <b>control</b> <b>system</b> are combined. In <b>HC</b> <b>systems,</b> the fuzzy <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> are introduced as a reflective fuzzy active <b>control</b> (RFAC) <b>system</b> and imitates spinal reflection of human. In <b>HC</b> <b>systems,</b> active <b>control</b> forces are activated to buildings in accordance with switching rules on active control forces. In this paper, optimizations on fuzzy control rules in RFAC system and switching rules of active <b>control</b> forces in <b>HC</b> <b>system</b> are performed by Parameter-Free Genetic Algorithms (PfGAs). Here, the optimization is performed by using different earthquake inputs. The results of digital simulations show that the <b>HC</b> <b>system</b> can reduce maximal response displacements under restrictions on strokes of the actuator effectively in case of a near-source earthquake and the effectiveness of the proposed <b>HC</b> <b>system</b> is discussed and clarified. ...|$|R
