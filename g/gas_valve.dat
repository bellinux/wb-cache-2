5|$|In the hotel, when Selma retires {{to watch}} MacGyver, Sideshow Bob enjoys a drink downstairs. The hotel room explodes behind him. He {{goes back to}} the wrecked room, {{assuming}} Selma is dead, but she is unscathed and the Simpsons are waiting for him along with the police. Bart explains how he deduced Sideshow Bob's plot: Sideshow Bob opened the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> in the room knowing Selma would not smell the leak, then left while she watched MacGyver, knowing that Selma would light a cigarette afterwards and cause an explosion. Sideshow Bob asks why the room still exploded if Bart foiled his plot, to which Chief Wiggum explains that he absent-mindedly threw a match into the room after smoking a celebratory cigar. Sideshow Bob is taken away by the police, vowing revenge.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E

25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot <b>gas</b> <b>valve,</b> it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E
25|$|As {{illustrated}} {{in the use of}} the thermostat above, all of the power for the control system is provided by a thermopile which is a combination of many stacked thermocouples, heated by the pilot light. The thermopile produces sufficient electrical power to drive a low-power <b>gas</b> <b>valve,</b> which under control of one or more thermostat switches, in turn controls the input of fuel to the burner.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven {{long-stroke}} operating system {{derived from the}} SIG SG 540 series of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in the piston head and are directed forward towards the <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b> The pressure build-up {{in front of the}} piston head pushes the piston and bolt carrier rearward. As the piston is driven back, the gas port and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder. This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|E

25|$|The {{illustration}} is {{the interior}} of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a gas-fired heater via an electric <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b> Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler zone valves, electric attic fans, electric furnaces, electric baseboard heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers. The power through the thermostat is provided by the heating device and may range from millivolts to 240 volts in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems). Due to the variety of possible voltages and currents available at the thermostat, caution must be taken when selecting a replacement device.|$|E
25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{combined}} {{main burner}} and pilot gas valves (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to {{within the range}} of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the [...] "press and hold for x minutes" [...] in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Use of a pilot {{generator}} or a thermocouple in {{the flame}} provides heating appliance safety as it generates enough electric current {{from the burning}} flame to hold the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> open.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to the pilot light is a system to create a high voltage electrical arc or spark between two electrodes, in order to light the gas flowing to the burner. Fail-safe design for such a system requires the burner flame to be detected by passing an electric current through the flame, which is received by the flame rectification circuit inside an ignition controller connected to the <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b> Flame rectification occurs when electrons flow through the flame burning, which the ignition controller senses and knows the flame is there, keeping the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> open.
