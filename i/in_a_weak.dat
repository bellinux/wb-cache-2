5|$|Hurricane Gabrielle {{originated}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> low- to mid-level trough {{that was}} nearly stationary {{a short distance}} off the southeastern coastline of the United States. A cut off low formed over Florida on September 9, and an associated surface low pressure system formed, that was soon designated Tropical Depression Eight. The storm gradually intensified, and made landfall on Florida before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean and accelerating northeastward, as it reached peak intensity as a minimal hurricane.|$|E
5|$|According to a NASA document, Laika {{was placed}} in the capsule of the {{satellite}} on 31 October 1957—three days {{before the start of the}} mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> alcohol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the offseason}} problems, New York contended {{for its first}} {{division}} title <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> AFL East during the 1963 season. By early December, the Jets had compiled a record of 5–5–1, and faced a game in Buffalo with the Bills only a half game ahead. The Jets lost the game, 45–14, {{as well as their}} other two remaining games, and finished 5–8–1. Although the Jets drew just over 100,000 fans to the Polo Grounds in seven home games, they quickly sold 17,500season tickets for the first season in Shea Stadium. Running back Matt Snell was drafted by both New York teams, and the Jets were able to sign him.|$|E
5|$|Haumea is a plutoid, a dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center, but no longer. The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, {{which would make it}} a resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit will be required to verify its dynamic status.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, Jeanne {{weakened}} to a Category 1 hurricane. It {{entered the}} western Gulf of Mexico, and its forward motion diminished as the ridge moved east. Later, Jeanne diminished to a 65mph (105km/h) tropical storm. A developing trough remained west of Jeanne, and the cyclone was embedded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> pressure gradient. Although Jeanne briefly re-intensified to 70mph (110km/h), an advancing frontal boundary brought dry air over the western Gulf of Mexico. Jeanne weakened to a depression on November 14. It executed a clockwise loop, and it {{merged with the}} frontal boundary on November 16.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{stood to}} benefit from the Republican electorate's {{tendency}} to nominate candidates who had previously run for president, and thus appeared to be next in line to be chosen. The early stages of the race found him as the apparent front-runner <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> field, especially in terms of fundraising prowess and organization. Perhaps his greatest hurdle in gaining the Republican nomination was party opposition to the Massachusetts health care reform law that he had shepherded five years earlier. As many potential Republican candidates with star power and fundraising ability decided not to run (including Mike Pence, John Thune, Haley Barbour, Mike Huckabee, and Mitch Daniels), Republican party figures searched for plausible alternatives to Romney.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Magda {{originated}} from a tropical low that was first {{identified by the}} Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) on 18 January 2010 near the Indonesian island of Roti. Initially situated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> steering environment, the low drifted towards the southwest and gradually gained intensity. The following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began monitoring the system. Throughout 19 January, a developing low-level circulation showed improved organisation, feature deep convection over its centre. Atmospheric conditions in the region favoured further development, featuring low to moderate wind shear. A trough situated near the coast of Western Australia aided in improving the low's outflow. Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system; they expected the low to intensify into a tropical cyclone within the following 24hours.|$|E
5|$|The December 1960 nor'easter was a {{significant}} early-season winter storm that impacted the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States. Moderate to heavy snowfall fell from West Virginia to eastern Maine, amounting to 10in (25cm) or more in parts of 13states and peaking at 21.4in (54.4cm) at Newark, New Jersey. The storm was accompanied by strong winds, gusting to over 90mph (145km/h) in coastal New England, and left in its wake a dangerously cold air mass. The storm originated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> low pressure area which formed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December 10. A secondary low developed over South Carolina on the next day, supported by the merger of two troughs aloft. Sliding southeast of New England, the new storm explosively deepened to become a full-fledged nor'easter, with a minimum central air pressure of 966 mbar. It began to weaken over the Canadian Maritimes.|$|E

5|$|The {{tropical}} depression originated {{from an area}} of low pressure in the South China Sea on September1. Scattered convection was associated with the system, with the center devoid of showers and thunderstorms, as the low slowly tracked westward <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> steering environment. Weak outflow had formed along the northern edge of the system; however, intensification was not anticipated. The following day, convection began to form around the center of circulation and weak diffluence was noted around the system due to an anticyclone to the north. With low wind shear, convective banding features began to develop and the possibility of the system becoming a tropical cyclone increased. Early on September3, the JMA began issuing advisories on the cyclone, classifying it as a {{tropical depression}}, the twentieth depression to be monitored by the JMA during the season.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Cromwell in 1658, Monck {{remained}} aloof from the political manoeuvring in London {{that led to the}} brief establishment of a regime under the protector's son Richard Cromwell and after its fall the subsequent contest for power between the army leaders. When this proved incapable of producing a stable government in 1659 Monk opened negotiations with Charles II and began a slow march south with his army. After reaching London he restored the English Long Parliament that had existed {{at the beginning of the}} civil wars. This body, having received some assurances from Charles II, voted for a restoration of the monarchy in England and then dissolved itself. This created a de facto restoration of the monarchy in Scotland, but without any safeguards as to the constitutional position in the country. Scottish notables were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> position in negotiations with the crown as to what the settlement would be.|$|E
5|$|From Ancyra, the Abbasid army {{turned to}} Amorium, {{to which they}} laid siege on 1 August. Al-Afshin, Itakh, and Ashinas all took turns assaulting the city with their troops, but the siege was {{fiercely}} contested, even after the Abbasids, informed by a defector, effected a breach <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> spot of the wall. After two weeks, however, {{taking advantage of a}} short truce for negotiations requested by one of the Byzantine commanders of the breach, the Abbasid army stormed the city. The city was thoroughly plundered and its walls razed, while the populace, numbering into the tens of thousands, was carried off to be sold into slavery. According to al-Tabari, al-Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when the conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas, was uncovered. Al-Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, without bothering with Theophilos and his forces, encamped in nearby Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, al-Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E

5|$|Hammond toured South Africa in {{the winter}} of 1930–31, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>weak</b> M.C.C. side without some of the best English players. The {{tourists}} were short of opening batsmen, frequently forcing Hammond into the role. Although successful, he brought a more wary approach than usual to his unaccustomed position. In all first-class cricket, he scored 1,045 runs (average 61.47). In the five-Test series, which South Africa won 1–0, he scored 517 runs (average 64.62), passing fifty five times in nine innings. A very cautious approach batting at number three saw Hammond score 49 and 63 in the first Test. Opening the batting in the second Test, he scored two fifties to save the game; he also kept wicket for a time following an injury to the regular wicketkeeper. Hammond continued to open in the third Test, playing more aggressively for 136 not out, before returning to number three and making 75 in the fourth Test. In the final Test, he opened both the batting and the bowling.|$|E
