500|$|In 1928 Olivier {{created the}} role of Stanhope in R.C. Sherriff's Journey's End, in which he scored a great success at its single Sunday night premiere. He was offered the part in the West End {{production}} the following year, but turned it down in favour of the more glamorous role of Beau Geste in a stage adaptation of P. C. Wren's 1929 novel of the same name. Journey's End became a long-running success; Beau Geste failed. The Manchester Guardian commented, [...] "Mr.Laurence Olivier did his best as Beau, but he deserves and will get better parts. Mr.Olivier <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> big name for himself". For the rest of 1929 Olivier appeared in seven plays, {{all of which were}} short-lived. Billington ascribes this failure rate to poor choices by Olivier rather than mere bad luck.|$|E
