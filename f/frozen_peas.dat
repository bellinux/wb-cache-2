The aim of {{undertaken}} {{research was}} to determine possibilities of usage of mathe-matical description of <b>frozen</b> green <b>pea</b> quality changes in its durability prognosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND : The {{acceptability}} of <b>frozen</b> green <b>peas</b> {{depends on their}} sensory quality. There {{is a need to}} relate physico-chemical parameters to sensory quality. In this research, six brands of <b>frozen</b> green <b>peas</b> representing product sold for retail and caterer’s markets were purchased and subjected to descriptive sensory evaluation and physico-chemical analyses (including dry matter content, alcohol insoluble solids content, starch content, °Brix, residual peroxidase activity, size sorting, hardness using texture analysis and colour measurements) to assess and explain product quality. RESULTS : The sensory quality of <b>frozen</b> green <b>peas,</b> particularly texture properties, were well explained using physico-chemical methods of analysis notably alcohol insoluble solids, starch content, hardness and °Brix. Generally, retail class peas were of superior sensory quality to caterer’s class peas although one caterer’s brand was comparable to the retail brands. Retail class peas were sweeter, smaller, greener, more moist and more tender than the caterer’s peas. Retail class peas also had higher °Brix, a*, hue and chroma values; lower starch, alcohol insoluble solids, dry matter content and hardness measured. CONCLUSIONS : The sensory quality of <b>frozen</b> green <b>peas</b> can be partially predicted by measuring physico-chemical parameters particularly °Brix {{and to a lesser extent}} hardness by texture analyser, alcohol insoluble solids, dry matter and starch content.

40|$|The {{formation}} of inner pictures- an overview Inner pictures arise from experience; {{they are always}} connected to emotions and closely linked to interactions. The ability to "image " is innate and begins in babyhood. Hence television {{does not have the}} power to "out-image " children, but it does have a high level of responsibility for providing supportive and not obstructive images. Does television have the power, the negative potential to "out-image " children? Before adding a number of further considerations on the subject, it is worth looking at the way inner pictures actually come about and how they can be influenced by television (in both the positive and the negative sense). To begin with, I would like to invite you to create as many vivid and colourful inner pictures of your own as possible while you are reading this. Allow me to start off with a little quiz question: "What has a darker shade of green- a <b>frozen</b> <b>pea</b> or a branch from a fir tree in winter?" This {{is by no means a}} general knowledge question. It is more a suggestion how to become aware of the way we usually answer such non-memorizable questions in daily life: absolutely naturally and spontaneously we form an image in our imagination- you have raised the pea and the fir branch to the surface before your mind's eye-, drawing on a specifically human ability...|$|R

40|$|This was a {{study of}} the effect on quality {{parameters}} of reprocessing (blanching at 97 °C during increasing times + freezing) prior to domestic cooking (boiling or stir-frying) of <b>frozen</b> green <b>peas</b> (cv. Mastim) and beans (cvs. Paloma and Moncayo). Results were compared with frozen control samples directly boiled or stir-fried. Kramer shear was the most suitable mechanical test for evaluating the effect of reprocessing on mechanical behaviour in both boiled and stir-fried frozen vegetables. Reprocessing significantly affected mechanical behaviour of both green bean varieties with both cooking methods. Reprocessed products were softer than those supplied by the industry, and softening was significantly greater the longer the blanching time. The colour was more uniform and homogenous in boiled than in stir-fried reprocessed vegetables; colour parameters showed that reprocessing affected the colour of stir-fried samples more significantly than that of boiled samples. In all the studied vegetables, less chlorophyll and more ascorbic acid were retained when samples were stir-fried than when they were boiled, although chlorophyll and ascorbic acid decreased with increasing reprocessing time in both cooking methods. In the two frozen green bean varieties in particular, SEM microphotographs confirmed the results of mechanical tests, indicating that with both cooking methods, mechanical parameters were lower in the reprocessed samples in the controls. The shortest reprocessing procedure (blanching at 97 °C for 2, 3 min + freezing), as a compromise among quality parameters, could shorten the time required for domestic stir-frying of <b>frozen</b> green <b>peas</b> and boiling or stir-frying of frozen green beans...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{nutritional}} values of fresh and frozen meats, seafood, and vegetables. Is the consumption of frozen products detrimental to one’s health? Previous studies have shown that there was no change in vitamin C concentration in clementines and carrots after one year of <b>frozen</b> storage. <b>Peas,</b> whole green beans, and broccoli lost 10 to 20 percent of vitamin C content during subsequent frozen storage (Philips et al. 2010). For frozen oysters, the study has shown that neither the freezing method or antioxidant treatment demonstrated significant changes in moisture, crude protein, crude fat, and pH. On the other hand, oysters became more yellow in color, but were more firm than fresh oysters (Songsaenga et al. 2010). The focus of this research is to investigate the protein, fat, mineral, and vitamin content of frozen name brand pizza and cheaper store brand pizzas with fresh ingredients.

40|$|The {{size of the}} indigestible {{fraction}} of, and {{the availability}} of starch in, commercial <b>frozen</b> and canned <b>peas</b> was studied in vitro. The total dietary fibre content, as determined by chemical analysis, was similar in both samples (27 %); nevertheless, appreciable amounts of resistant starch (4. 4 - 6. 9 %) and resistant protein (4. 7 - 5. 4 %) were found in the insoluble dietary fibre gravimetric residue. Other indigestible components of the pea were an additional fraction of resistant starch, not associated with insoluble dietary fibre, and the oligosaccharides inulin and stachyose. The total amount of starch (25. 8 - 36. 1 %) was very different between frozen and canned samples, and was inversely correlated with their sucrose contents (14. 2 - 6. 7 %). Our results indicate that 35 - 40 % of the dry weight of peas is not digested in vitro and that the relative rate of glucose release by α-amylase hydrolysis seems to be decreased in the presence of resistant starch. © Springer-Verlag 1997.

40|$|Dietary {{antioxidants}} (AO) {{are believed}} {{to contribute to the}} overall health benefits seen from fruit and vegetables. Despite increased public awareness of the health benefits of fruit and vegetables through campaigns such as 5 A DAY, consumption remains low. Freezing is usually regarded as destructive to AO and ascorbic acid (AA) and this has fostered a belief that fresh vegetables are nutritionally superior to frozen. In this study, AO and AA activity in commercially bought fresh and frozen vegetables were investigated and compared after a typical home cooking practice (boiling). Five different vegetables were examined: carrots, broccoli, green beans, peas and spinach. Each vegetable was bought four times from a selection of local supermarkets and green grocers in the Wirral, United Kingdom to account for variation. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay and 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) assay were utilised to measure total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and AA content respectively. The results showed both fresh and frozen vegetables to contain AO and AA after cooking. Cooked fresh spinach and peas contained significantly (p<. 05) higher levels of total AO than cooked <b>frozen</b> spinach and <b>peas.</b> However the remaining fresh and frozen vegetables (broccoli, carrots and green beans) did not appear to differ in AO content after cooking. Furthermore {{there was no difference between}} AA content in fresh and frozen cooked vegetables. The current study provides evidence against the misconception that fresh is always nutritionally superior to frozen at the point of consumption. Frozen vegetable promotion may be the way forward to increase fruit and vegetable consumption as they are generally nutritionally comparable to fresh but, cheaper, result in less waste, are more convenient and, if packaged correctly, taste the same as fresh. Further work, on a larger scale, is needed, to measure AO and AA content of fresh and frozen vegetables bought and cooked by the consumer...|$|R
