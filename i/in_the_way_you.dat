You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E

[...] Bernthal applauded the writers for such changes, and felt that the storyline never devitalized. [...] "The people that Shane loved {{more than anyone else}} in the world before the apocalypse are still very much alive and still very much with him, but he'll never be with them in the way he wants to and the way he once was. Every relationship—Shane/Carl, Shane/Lori and Shane/Rick—it's tainted and fractured. When you suffer from that kind of loneliness, it brings out the worst in you." ...|$|E

Washington had the Declaration read to his troops in New York City on July 9, with thousands of British troops on ships in the harbor. Washington and Congress hoped that the Declaration would inspire the soldiers, and encourage others to join the army. After hearing the Declaration, crowds in many cities tore down and destroyed signs or statues representing royal authority. An equestrian statue of King George in New York City was pulled down and the lead used to make musket balls.|$|E

500|$|SFX Magazine Jordan Farley {{gave the}} episode 3 {{and a half}} out of 5 stars, saying the {{direction}} [...] "never quite [...] the right balance between absurdist humour and sinister nightmare" [...] and the camera was [...] "a little flat" [...] with a strange angle. He was displeased with the discovery that {{it had all been}} a hallucination and stated that Rory's death and other instances of horror [...] "never shock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> might expect". However, he praised Smith for being [...] "on blindingly good form" [...] while portraying the Doctor's quirkier traits, considered that Gillan and Darvill were [...] "fast becoming the most likeable companion couple in Doctor Who history", and said Jones was [...] "a lot of fun to watch" [...] despite not seeming to be completely the Doctor's dark side.|$|E
500|$|Although it was {{originally}} thought that Darren Criss would be missing [...] "one and a half episodes", and therefore might return in time to appear in this episode after missing the twelfth one, co-star Chris Colfer initially stated that Criss would not be appearing: [...] "You'll find out how [...] leaves {{for a little bit}} and then comes back, but it’s nothing too bad or serious". He later said that Blaine [...] "is in the episode, it's not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> might think"; Criss did return in time to appear in the musical finale. Recurring guest stars who are appearing in the episode include glee club members Sam Evans (Overstreet), Rory Flanagan (McGinty) and Sugar Motta (Lengies), Principal Figgins (Theba), Finn's mother Carole Hudson-Hummel (Rosemont) and stepfather Burt Hummel (O'Malley), former McKinley student Dave Karofsky (Adler) and McKinley football player Shane Tinsley (Tinker).|$|E
500|$|Sam Richards of NME {{described}} A Moon Shaped Pool as [...] "an {{album of}} eerie, elusive beauty that is strange, shimmering and uncertain {{all at the}} same time." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote for AllMusic that [...] "there's a melancholic comfort to its ebb and flow, a gentle rocking motion that feels comforting; it's a tonic to the cloistered, scattered King of Limbs and even the sleek alienation of Kid A." [...] Pitchfork editor Jayson Greene felt the album was coloured by Yorke's separation: [...] "The impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> can only be after a tragedy." [...] At the end of the year, Pitchfork named [...] "Daydreaming" [...] and [...] "True Love Waits" [...] the 24th and 9th best songs of 2016 respectively.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of {{the series}} premiere on Australian Network ABC the Sydney Morning Heralds Robin Oliver {{predicted}} that older viewers [...] "will find Eccleston easily the best time lord since Tom Baker." [...] However Harry Venning of The Stage, whilst enthusiastic about {{the revival of the}} show, labelled Eccleston as the [...] "show's biggest disappointment" [...] following the premiere episode, stating he looked uncomfortable in a fantasy role. The Guardian Stephen Kelly felt that Eccleston's Ninth Doctor had many faults, two of which he felt to be [...] "looking like an EastEnders extra and bellowing [...] "fantastic" [...] at every opportunity". However, he felt that he [...] "brought warmth, wit and promise" [...] and a [...] "formidable presence". Kelly believed that Eccleston was believable as a man who had destroyed two civilisations and was dealing with the repercussions and could have brought more to the show had Eccleston stayed for a second series. Seventh Doctor actor Sylvester McCoy praised Eccleston as being [...] "quite alien" [...] as the Doctor and that [...] "we were not sure if he was on the edge of insanity or not, which was rather good." [...] Peter Davison, who played the Fifth Doctor, criticised Eccleston's decision to quit after a single series stating [...] "I don't think you can engage with the new Doctor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> should be able to." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Borderline" [...] is {{a sentimental}} track, {{talking about a}} love that is never quite fulfilled. According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández and his book Madonna's drowned worlds, the lyrics of the song like [...] "Something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your {{prisoner}} so baby won't you set me free" [...] depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism. Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's instrumentation. It opens with a keyboard rich intro and a catchy synth melody provided by Fred Zarr. Bass player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture. The chords in the song were inspired by Seventies disco sound in Philadelphia as well as Elton John's musical style during the mid-seventies. The chord sequences cite from Bachman–Turner Overdrive's song [...] "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" [...] while the synth phases display her typical musical style. The third track [...] "Burning Up" [...] has a starker arrangement, brought about by bass, single guitar and Linn drum machine. The drum beats used in the song were reminiscent to the records of singer Phil Collins. It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time. The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines, while the bridge consists {{of a series of}} double entendres; the lyrics describing what Madonna is prepared to do for her lover, and that she is individualistic and shameless.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} version of [...] "Grenade" [...] had an [...] "uptempo 1960's surf-style sound with jangle pop" [...] and before a live show in New York, Mars [...] "slowed and stripped it down". The reworked song {{was the last}} track added to the album. In an interview with Sound on Sound, engineer Ari Levine from The Smeezingtons, who carried out the recording and instrumentation on [...] "Grenade", explained that the song was original recorded with [...] "a more guitar‑based arrangement", 15bpm faster. According to Mars, the record was much happier. Mars ended up by playing the song live in showcase for the label and to several booking agents in a slower tempo. The singer and his bandmates rehearsed a lot to that show, yet [...] "Grenade" [...] "sounded terrible". Mars decided to do a [...] "stripped down" [...] version by playing the guitar, while Brody Brown played the piano. The single received praise from the label. The song was reproduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> hear it. To do so, [...] The Smeezingtons completely rearranged and re‑recorded t, including the vocals, [...] "two days before the album {{was supposed to be}} handed in". Levine, added [...] "There was quite a bit of deadline stress involved in that." [...] Despite the time that Grenade took to produce, the writing was among the most difficult songs in album since it took several months to complete. Later, on April 21, 2012, the team said that the last line of the song was the conflict, since it took two months for them to come up with [...] "but you won't do the same". Levine explained which instruments and software was involved in the song: ...|$|E

The lyrics revolve around [...] "failing to resist true love", according to Dan Martin for NME, as Rihanna sings [...] "Funny, you're the broken one/ But I'm {{the only one who}} needed saving." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena for MTV, Rihanna [...] "punctuates the emotions of the track" [...] on the lyric [...] "It's not much of a life you're living/ It's not just something you take [...] given." [...] Rihanna also makes a plea to her lover, singing [...] "'Round and around and around and around we go/ Now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know/ Not really sure how to feel about it/ Something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> move/ Makes me feel like I can't live without you/ it takes me all the way/ I want you to stay." [...] Lewis Corner for Digital Spy wrote that Rihanna's vocals glow over the simple yet effective piano riffs.|$|E
