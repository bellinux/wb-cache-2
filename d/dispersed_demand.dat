40|$|In {{logistics}} networks involving one {{supply point}} (depot) and several geographically <b>dispersed</b> <b>demand</b> points (e. g., retail stores), delivery shortages will result if {{the design of}} delivery routes ignores random period-to-period fluctuations in customer demands.

Accurate distance prediction models are developed to help satisfy this prerequisite for the transportation cost element.

Works of individual handicraft possess the most advantageous economic and organizational conditions especially {{in the sphere of}} services under conditions of <b>dispersed</b> <b>demand.</b> Handicraft can favour a better satisfaction of population needs in definite spheres of economic activity in a socialist economy, too.

It was decided in 1976, basing on decisions of political and administrative authorities, to accelerate the development of handicraft using its potential above all for living services as well as for individualized production. Realizing the tasks, however, it is necessary to increase material and technical equipment, to render place accessible and to gain new cadres. Therefore, a closer handicrafts integration with the whole social economy in a horizontal structure is advisable.

40|$|Abstract. If its {{prospects}} were doubted in {{the early}} 1990 s, London is now the preeminent international financial centre. It dominates its European rivals, and is joined with New York in a non-stop reciprocal global embrace. Whereas some analysts approach this topic concentrating on the nature and quality of market relationships in London and between London {{and the rest of}} the world, others emphasise the role that government regulation has played in promoting the growth of the City of London with respect to its European rivals. Here, I elaborate the logic whereby financial products and services are produced at a particular point in space (given geographically <b>dispersed</b> <b>demand).</b> In doing so, my supply-side model emphasises the competitive dynamics of the financial services industry, the distinctive qualities of financial products, and the peculiar place of London in corporate global transactions systems. I mean to show that the production of financial products has been brought to ground (so to speak) in London for a variety of (perhaps non-replicable) reasons. In this regard, my argument is clearly at odds with those analysts of information and communication technology who proclaim the end of geography; I contend that history and geography are important when accounting for the place of London in the world of finance. However, my argument also sits uncomfortably with those who insist upon the persistence and co-existence of different national financial systems. My argument has significant implications for the role of London in the evolving integrated European market for financial services, and for the future of continental European financial centres...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} whether the {{geography}} of bank services has been converging toward the market since banking geographic deregulation. We use Illinois as a study area and examine changes in various market segments such as metro and non-metro markets, and regional markets. We adopt the Spatial Concentration Index (SCI) and the related supply and demand SCI deviations to measure changing supply-demand mismatch. We find that supply distribution was more <b>dispersed</b> than <b>demand</b> distribution in most market segments in the early 1980 s when geographic restrictions on banking were in place. However, discrepancies in supply-demand distribution declined during the geographic deregulation and banking consolidations {{of the last two}} decades, especially in the 1990 s. In the Chicago market, bank offices were more dispersed, but deposit distribution more concentrated, than demand distribution before deregulation. Since deregulation, both office and deposit distributions have become more aligned with the demand distribution. In Northern Illinois metro markets, and to a certain extent in the Central and Southern Illinois non-metro markets, supply-demand distribution discrepancies have declined only in the period of 1992 to 2002. In Central Illinois metro markets, while bank office distribution has become more in line with that of demand, deposit distribution has become more <b>dispersed</b> than <b>demand</b> distribution during the 1990 s. We also find a reduction of the average bank office size, particularly in larger markets, which provides further support to the hypothesis of bank market convergence.

Die vorliegende Studie wertet Literatur dazu aus, welchen Beitrag bedarfsgesteuerte Bedienformen des ÖPNV leisten können, um ein Grundangebot von Mobilität in ländlichen Räumen aufrechtzuerhalten. Als das größte Hemmnis für die Einführung bedarfsgesteuerter Bedienformen stellt sich der niedrige Kostendeckungsgrad heraus. Die Kosten pro Fahrgast reichen teilweise an die Kosten einer Taxibenutzung heran. Da der Besetzungsgrad pro Fahrt meist kaum höher als im MIV ist, weist diese Form des ÖPNV keinen ökologischen Vorteil auf. Wegen der begrenzten Potentiale bedarfsgesteuerter Bedienformen werden in der Studie weitere Ansätze jenseits des sowohl traditionellen als auch bedarfsgesteuerten ÖPNV näher betrachtet. [...] In {{transport}} policy debates, demand responsive transport {{is often seen}} as feasible to deal with quality deficiencies compared to individual motor car traffic, demographic transition and more flexible demand of mobility. These alternative services could supplement the decreasing supply of traditional public transport and assure a basic mobility service in areas with a low and <b>disperse</b> <b>demand.</b> Based on a review of scientific literature, in this study, it is analysed, how demand responsive transport can contribute to a basic provision of mobility in rural areas. The results indicate a low potential of demand responsive transport, mainly due to the low revenue-to-cost ratio of such services. The costs per passenger can even approximate the fees of a taxi ride. Since the number of passengers per ride is often not higher then in individual motor car traffic, the ecological advantage of this public transport system is doubtful. Due to the limited potential of demand responsive transport, the study deals with further alternatives beyond traditional and demand responsive public transport.

We {{assume that there}} is a central depot which houses a number of different types of items. There is a finite number of geographically <b>dispersed</b> <b>demand</b> points which place orders for these items on a daily basis. The demand of these demand points should be satisfied from this central depot. We assume that a finite number of identical trucks with predetermined destinations are used for the distribution of the items from the central depot to each demand point. The demand of each demand point can be split among several trucks and a single truck is allowed to visit several demand points. Our objective is to satisfy the demand of each demand point with the minimum total distribution cost while respecting the capacity of each truck. The cost structure is dictated by the final destinations of trucks used in the distribution of the items and the set of demand points visited by each truck. We propose two different solution approaches. The first approach, called the Direct Approach, is aimed at solving the problem directly using a mixed integer linear programming formulation. Since the Direct Approach becomes computationally infeasible for real-life problems, we propose a so-called Hierarchical Approach that is aimed at solving the problem in two stages using an aggregation followed by a disaggregation scheme. We study the properties of the solutions computed with the Hierarchical Approach.

40|$|The Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) {{consists}} in designing an optimal set of routes for {{a fleet of}} vehicles in order to serve a number of geographically <b>dispersed</b> <b>demands</b> in an urban network. In general {{the objective of the}} VRP’s is to serve a set of demand locations on minimum-cost vehicle routes. The VRP’s belong to the class of NP-Hard problems implying that the computational effort required to solve these problems increases exponentially with the problem size. Therefore, in real-life practical cases such problems are confronted by developing heuristic methods. Variations of VRP’s appear depending on the imposed side restrictions and/or on the optimality objective. A prevalent variation of the VRP called the capacitated VRP (CVRP) assumes that vehicle capacity is limited and that the sum of demands in a route served by a vehicle should not surpass its capacity. The CVRP investigated here consider the optimality objective that find a set of vehicle tours in order to complete the service of all the demands in a minimum possible time in the framework of attaining a maximum uniform vehicle utilization, simultaneously taking into account a smooth vehicle loading throughout the vehicle fleet. Regarding this problem two new heuristic algorithm BRL (Balance Routing Loading) and BRL-W are developed. The BRL-W algorithm additionally deals the case where a subset of demands require to be served within a specific time window. An extensive computational experiment on BRL and on generated data that meets real-world situation is performed for networks with sizes that vary from 50 to 1000 demands with a 50 -demand step. Furthermore, both algorithm were tested on the network that enclose {{the center of the city}} of Thessaloniki comprising 103 demand points. The quality of the obtained computational results regarding the service completion time as well as vehicle utilization and loading balance seems to be quite encouraging, while the needed computational time is negligible, since the execution of BRL for 500 demands required one second and for 1000 demands 9 seconds respectively. Concerning the Thessaloniki center network the execution time for both algorithms needed a fraction of a second. The last chapter is dedicated to proposals for further research.

It demonstrates that hourly design load factor is a useful method of modeling a route segment’s capacity and QoS time history across the study weekday. This analysis method is readily adaptable to different passenger load standards by adjusting design percentile, reflecting either a more relaxed or more stringent condition.

According to Choniates, John resented the fact that, although formally less powerful than John, who was logothetes tou dromou, Styppeiotes' office allowed him immediate access to and therefore influence on the emperor. Consequently, Styppeiotes managed to have his own ideas promoted, while John [...] "saw his <b>demands</b> <b>dispersed</b> {{in the air like}} dreams". Frustrated, John forged a correspondence between Styppeiotes and the Norman king of Sicily, William II (r. 1166-89), which he hid so that it could be discovered easily. Styppeiotes was then charged with treason, lost his offices, was blinded and his tongue was severed. Other authors give different reasons for Styppeiotes' downfall, and the details of Choniates' version have been proven to be inaccurate, at least in their chronology, by the historian Otto Kresten. Nevertheless, as Choniates {{was a member of the}} Constantinopolitan bureaucracy and well-informed about its recent history, it is very likely that his information that John succeeded Styppeiotes as mesazon (chief minister), before being replaced as both logothetes tou dromou and mesazon by Michael Hagiotheodorites, is correct.|$|R

A sensitivity analysis was first performed to determine which nodes had the greatest impact on successful completion of RDD acquisition. These results detail which portions of the acquisition pathways are most vulnerable to law enforcement intervention. Next, a series of case studies was analyzed that modeled specific adversarial organizations. The analysis demonstrates various features of the constructed Bayesian RDD acquisition network and provides examples of how this tool can be utilized by intelligence analysts and law enforcement agencies. Finally, extreme cases were studied in which the adversary was given the maximum and minimum amount of resources in order to determine the limitations of this model. The aggregated results show that successful RDD acquisition is mostly dependent on the adversary?s resources. Furthermore, the network suggests that securing radiological materials has the greatest effect on interdicting possible RDD plots. Limitations of this work include a heavy dependence on conditional probabilities that were derived from intuition, as opposed to actual historical data which does not exist.

Internet Art is inherently process based, ubiquitous, ephemeral and dynamic in nature. This challenges the traditional role of the curator in a gallery and museum structure. The curator is increasingly expected to create platforms of exchange of ideas between the viewer of the artwork and the project itself. Additional the curator also has to provide some insight in the decision making process regarding maintenance, support, contracts and documentation. Internet Art questions the principles in which galleries and museum structures are based; these include objectification, not touching objects and authorship of Internet Art projects. These projects are collaborative in nature and created {{by more than one}} artist, normally geographically <b>dispersed.</b> Internet Art <b>demand</b> for new modes of presentation, documentation and preservation that are more suited for online art. These new modes of presentation fundamentally change the role of the curator. If galleries and museums want to start or continue growing their Internet Art collections, they need to start understanding challenges facing the Internet as a medium, develop appropriate presentation and preservation strategies that seek to address identified challenges...|$|R
40|$|Consider a {{city with}} a highly compact central {{business}} district (CBD) in which commuters' origins are continuously <b>dispersed.</b> The travel <b>demand</b> is dependent on the total travel cost to the CBD. The transportation system is divided into two layers: major freeways and dense surface streets. Whereas the major freeway network is modeled according to the conventional discrete network approach, the dense surface streets are approximated as a continuum. Travelers to the CBD either travel on the continuum (surface streets) and then exchange to the discrete network (freeways) at an interchange (ramp) before moving to the CBD on the discrete network, or they travel directly to the CBD on the continuum. Specific travel cost-flow relationships for the two layers of transportation facilities are considered. A traffic equilibrium model is developed for this discrete-continuous transportation system in which for a particular origin no traveler can reduce his or her individual travel cost to the CBD by unilaterally changing routes. The problem is formulated as a simultaneous optimization program with two subproblems. One subproblem is a traffic assignment problem from the interchanges to the CBD in the discrete network, and the other is a traffic assignment problem with multiple centers (i. e., the interchange points and the CBD) in the continuous system. A Newtonian algorithm based on the sensitivity analyses of the two subproblems is proposed to solve the resultant simultaneous optimization program. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{areas are}} {{becoming}} more desert from day to day, leading to complex <b>dispersed</b> and scarce <b>demand</b> patterns for public transport. As a consequence, conventional transport services are becoming less frequent, reducing levels of service (e. g., low occupancy rates, usage of old vehicles). With rigid predefined routes and schedules, they are inappropriate to operate in such environments. Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) systems {{have been seen as}} an interesting alternative solution, providing flexible transport services to meet trip requests. This solution has already been adopted in several countries as a way to increase user’s mobility and mitigate social exclusion. There are however some issues concerning DRT scheme design and evaluation requiring further developments. Namely, there is still a lack of adequate tools to support some of the strategic and tactic level decisions that must be made at the design phase. In this research, we propose an Integrated Decision Support System (IDSS) and general action methodology that will allow achieving better planning decisions and allowing the evaluation of alternative scheme designs prior to its implementation. The IDSS and methodology are based on an event-driven simulation framework which emulates real-world customers’ behavior and vehicles movements. The paper will concentrate its analysis on this framework. An illustrative numerical experiment is presented and briefly discussed.

5000|$|Once {{the rescue}} had been completed, {{fighting}} in the DRC capital ensued, and on August 22, two DRC army tanks were reported to be heading toward the latest area of fighting. The EU began sending more peacekeeping troops to Kinsasha and MONUC chief Swing called for an immediate ceasefire. Later on August 22, {{the third day of}} fighting, the two sides signed a tentative ceasefire agreement to withdraw from the centre of Kinshasa. AFP reported that [...] "the deal was signed by representatives of Kabila and Bemba, DRC army, the UN mission MONUC, European force EUFOR and European police mission EUROPOL, meeting as a [...] "working group" [...] at MONUC's Kinshasa headquarters." [...] At least three people died during Tuesday's fighting. Sixteen people were reported killed in the fighting which saw heavy artillery and machine gun fire, with police reporting more bodies found and the death toll expected to rise considerably. Later in the day, Interior Minister Theophile Mbemba Fundu placed the death toll for the week at 23 killed, 43 injured. As of August 24, the ceasefire remained in effect, with army forces loyal to the two candidates remaining in barracks, but the situation remained unstable. Later in the day, police fired shots in the air to <b>disperse</b> angry crowds <b>demanding</b> that two of Bemba's television stations be reopened. South African Airways announced that flights to Kinshasa would be resumed on August 25 after being suspended since the fighting began.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an analytical {{model of the}} interaction between urban form and the demand for transit travel, in which residential location, transit demand, and the spatial dispersion of non-work activities are endogenously determined. In this model, travel demand is considered a derived demand brought about by the necessity to engage in out-ofhome activities whose geographical extent is affected by urban form. In a departure from the urban monocentric model, residential location is defined as a job-residence pair in an urban area in which jobs, residences, and non-work activities are <b>dispersed.</b> Transit <b>demand</b> is then determined by residential location, work trips, non-work trip chains, and goods consumption. Theoretically derived hypotheses are empirically tested using a dataset that integrates travel and land-use data. There is evidence of a significant influence of land-use patterns on transit patronage. In turn, transit demand affects consumption and non-work travel. Although much reliance has been placed on population density as a determinant of transit demand, it is found here that population density does not have a large impact on transit demand and, moreover, that the effect decreases when residential location is endogenous. To increase transit use, urban planners have advocated a mix of residential and commercial uses in proximity to transit stations. In this study, it is found that the importance of transit-station proximity is weakened by idiosyncratic preferences for residential location. In addition, when population density and residential location are jointly endogenous, the elasticity of transit demand with respect to walking distance to a transit station decreases by about 33 percent over the case in which these variables are treated an exogenous. The research reported here is the first empirical work that explicitly relates residential location to trip chaining in a context in which individuals jointly decide residential location and the trip chain. If is found that households living farther from work use less transit and that trip-chaining behavior explains this finding. Households living far from work engage in complex trip chains and have, on average, a more dispersed activity space, which requires reliance on more flexible modes of transportation. Therefore, reducing the spatial allocation of non-work activities and improving transit accessibility at and around subcenters would increase transit demand. Similar effects can be obtained by increasing the presence of retail locations in proximity to transit-oriented households. Although focused on transit demand, the framework can be easily generalized to study other forms of travel...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{consider}} {{a city with}} several highly compact central business districts (CBDs). The commuters’ origins are continuously <b>dispersed.</b> The travel <b>demand</b> to each CBD, which is considered as a distinct commodity of traffic movements, {{is dependent on the}} total travel cost to that CBD. The transportation system is divided into two layers: major freeways and dense surface streets. Whereas the major freeway network is modeled according to the conventional discrete network approach, the dense surface streets are approximated as a continuum. Travelers to each CBD can either travel in the continuum (surface streets) and then exchange to the discrete network (freeways) at an interchange (ramp) before moving to the CBD on the discrete network, or travel directly to the CBD in the continuum. Specific travel cost-flow relationships for the two layers of transportation facilities are considered. The paper will develop a traffic equilibrium model for this discrete/continuum transportation system, in which for each origin-destination pair no traveler can reduce their individual travel cost by unilaterally changing routes. The problem is formulated as a simultaneous optimization program with two sub-problems. One sub-problem is a traffic assignment problem from the interchanges to the CBD in the discrete network, and the other is a traffic assignment problem in the continuum system with multiple centers (i. e. the interchange points and the CBDs).

40|$|In an {{era when}} {{political}} consensus is failing {{in a host of}} policy areas, {{it is not surprising that}} there are fundamental disagreements about transportation policy. But it was not always this way, and it need not be so in the future. In the heyday of the old economy from the 1940 s to the early 1970 s, transportation technologies, the spatial order of the economy, and political and institutional arrangements all worked together to create an effective transportation system. Most Americans agreed on what to do (invest in building highways, airports, and seaports) and how to do it (federal leadership and funding combined with technocratic planning and administration at the local level). America was confident it could build the world’s best transpor-tation system. However, as the old economy broke down in the 1970 s, and the problems of the transportation system began to be seen (at least by many) as producing more problems than solutions, that consensus eroded. The car (and to a lesser extent planes and ships and their supporting infrastructures) became a source of problems. The excesses of technocratic and myopic public highway and infrastructure departments led to a backlash and the imposition of a host of procedural and environmental rules and regulations governing transportation agencies. The old central-city dominated metropolis gave way to the devel-opment of <b>dispersed</b> urban cores. <b>Demand</b> for transportation grew rapidly while the cost of supplying infrastructure rose dramatically. At the same time, the rise of what Montgomery County, Maryland Executive Doug Duncan calls the “congestion coalition ” (a small, but extremely influential anti-highway—and seaport and airport—anti-car, and anti-suburban coalition) has changed the focus of transportation policy from one expanding supply to one restraining demand and getting people out of cars (and planes) ...|$|R
