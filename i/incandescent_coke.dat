It also produces specialised wagons for <b>incandescent</b> <b>coke</b> and hot metal billets, and bunker cars for asphalt.|$|E
5000|$|The first reaction, between <b>incandescent</b> <b>coke</b> and steam, is {{strongly}} endothermic, producing carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen [...] (water gas in older terminology). When the coke bed has cooled to a temperature {{at which the}} endothermic reaction can no longer proceed, the steam is then replaced by a blast of air.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{integrated}} {{coke dry quenching}} combined gasification system using coke oven gas and steam to quench the <b>incandescent</b> <b>coke</b> is proposed. The distinct advantages of the system include energy conservation, pollution reduction, coke quality improvement and full use of resources. Based on the minimization of the Gibbs free energy, the flow rate and composition of the syngas are predicted. At the same time, {{the effects of the}} coke oven gas flow rate and the steam consumption on the flow rate and composition of the syngas as well as exergy efficiency is analyzed by using PRO/II simulator. Finally, the effects of the coke oven gas flow rate and the steam consumption remarkably on flow rate and composition of the syngas and exergy efficiency are investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} coke {{quenching}} is to quench the <b>incandescent</b> <b>coke</b> {{in the hot}} car using intense water sprays covering entire cross-section of the red hot coke bed and preventing it from burning, {{at the same time}} to obtain coke of uniform and minimum deviations in coke moisture. This case study presents a simple approach of developing a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to reduce the variation in moisture in Coke by analyzing past data and using Cause and Effect diagram and critically analyzing the contribution of different factors in introducing variation in moisture. The pre and post SOP implementation results are analyzed statistically to ensure that the difference in variance of moisture content is statistically significant. After implementing the action plan for one quarter, overwhelming results were noticed. The standard deviation of moisture on day to day basis has reduced from 2. 5 % to 1. 0 %...|$|E
