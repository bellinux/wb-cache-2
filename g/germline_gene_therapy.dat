Proper assignment of sequences to <b>germline</b> <b>genes</b> are important for many such processes, for instance in the analysis of somatic hypermutation. <b>Germline</b> <b>gene</b> inference from antibody-encoding transcriptomes, by using tools such as TIgGER or IgDiscover, has a potential to enhance the quality of such analyses. These tools may also be used to identify <b>germline</b> <b>genes</b> not previously known. In this study, we exploited such software for <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> inference and define aspects of analysis settings and pre-existing knowledge of <b>germline</b> <b>genes</b> that affect the outcome of gene inference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capacity of IGHJ and IGHD haplotype inference, whenever subjects are heterozygous with respect to such genes, to lend support to IGHV gene inference in general, and to the identification of novel alleles presently not recognized by <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> reference directories.

40|$|In plants, the {{germline}} lineages {{arise in}} later {{stages of life}} cycle as opposed to animals where {{both male and female}} germlines are set aside early in development. This developmental divergence is associated with germline specific or preferential expression of a subset of genes that are normally repressed for the rest of plant life cycle. The gene regulatory mechanisms involved in such long-term suppression and short-term activation in plant germline remain vague. Thus, we explored the nature of epigenetic marks that are likely associated with long-term gene repression in the non-germline cells. We accessed available Arabidopsis genome-wide DNA methylation and histone modification data and queried it for epigenetic marks associated with <b>germline</b> genes: <b>genes</b> preferentially expressed in sperm cells, egg cells, synergid cells, central cells, antipodal cells or embryo sac or genes that are with enriched expression in two or more of female germline tissues. The vast majority of <b>germline</b> <b>genes</b> are associated with repression-related epigenetic histone modifications in one or more non-germline tissues, among which H 3 K 9 me 2 and H 3 K 27 me 3 are the most widespread repression-related marks. Interestingly, we show here that the repressive epigenetic mechanisms differ between male and female <b>germline</b> <b>genes.</b> We also highlight the diverse states of epigenetic marks in different non-germline tissues.

40|$|Gene {{therapy is}} the process of {{introducing}} foreign genomic materials into host cells to elicit a therapeutic benefit. Although initially the main focus of gene therapy was on special genetic disorders, now diverse diseases with different patterns of inheritance and acquired diseases are targets of gene therapy. There are 2 major categories of gene therapy, including <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> and somatic gene therapy. Although <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> may have great potential, because it is currently ethically forbidden, it cannot be used; however, to date human gene therapy has been limited to somatic cells.

40|$|Mammalian one—cell embryos can be genetically altered, {{implanted}} {{into the}} female 2 ̆ 7 s uterus, and subsequently develop into biologically mature organisms {{in the usual}} manner.

In humans, the procedure is known alternatively as 2 ̆ 2 human genetic engineering 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 human <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Bioethicists distinguish between genetic engineering intended for the prevention or treatment of disease (2 ̆ 2 treatment <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> 2 ̆ 2) and genetic engineering intended for non—medical enhancement of certain characteristics (2 ̆ 2 enhancement <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> 2 ̆ 2). Human genetic engineering has the potential to effectively replace deleterious genes such as the gene for cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease — with a normal gene. Thus, not only is disease avoided in the next generation, but all future generations are spared the effects of the disease—causing gene as well. The current public policy consensus is that human genetic engineering, whether intended for treatment or enhancement, is ethically impermissible. The primary reason is that present genetic engineering technology carries an unacceptable level of risk for use in humans. There is, however, good reason to believe that genetic engineering will become acceptably safe for use in humans, thereby eliminating the major ethical barrier to the technology. In fact, several policy statements already have suggested that, once safe, treatment genetic engineering ought to be permitted while enhancement genetic engineering ought not to be permitted. Part of the concern surrounding genetic enhancement is that bad consequences — such as morally objectionable eugenics practices — might ensue. But another objection is that human genetic enhancement is intrinsically problematic. In other words, at least very radical genetic enhancements violate what it is that makes human beings intrinsically valuable. Drawing on a Wittgensteinian view of human beings, the present work proposes a conception of ethically significant humanness — 2 ̆ 2 human beingness 2 ̆ 2 — that is potentially threatened by certain kinds or degrees of human genetic enhancement.

40|$|SummaryThe Caenorhabditis elegans MES {{proteins}} are key chromatin regulators of the germline. MES- 2, MES- 3, and MES- 6 {{form the}} C.  elegans Polycomb repressive complex 2 and generate repressive H 3 K 27 me 3. MES- 4 generates H 3 K 36 me 3 on germline-expressed genes. Transcript profiling of dissected mutant germlines revealed that MES- 2 / 3 / 6 and MES- 4 cooperate {{to promote the}} expression of <b>germline</b> <b>genes</b> and repress the X chromosomes and somatic genes. Results from genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that H 3 K 27 me 3 and H 3 K 36 me 3 occupy mutually exclusive domains on the autosomes and that H 3 K 27 me 3 is enriched on the X. Loss of MES- 4 from <b>germline</b> <b>genes</b> causes H 3 K 27 me 3 to spread to <b>germline</b> <b>genes,</b> resulting in reduced H 3 K 27 me 3 elsewhere on the autosomes and especially on the X.

Testis-specific <b>germline</b> development-associated <b>genes</b> can become activated in cancer cells and can potentially drive the oncogenic process and serve as therapeutic/biomarker targets; such <b>germline</b> <b>genes</b> {{are referred to as}} cancer/testis genes. Many cancer/testis genes are silenced via hypermethylation of CpG islands in their associated transcriptional control regions and become activated upon treatment with DNA hypomethylating agents; such hypomethylation-induced activation of cancer/testis genes provides a potential combination approach to augment immunotherapeutics. Thus, understanding cancer/testis gene regulation is of increasing clinical importance. Previously studied cancer/testis gene activation has focused on X chromosome encoded cancer/testis genes. Here we find that a sub-set of non-X encoded cancer/testis genes are silenced in non-germline cells via a mechanism that is refractory to epigenetic dysregulation, including treatment with the hypomethylating agent 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor tricostatin A. These findings formally indicate that there is a sub-group of the clinically important cancer/testis genes that are unlikely to be activated in clinical therapeutic approaches using hypomethylating agents and it indicates a unique transcriptional silencing mechanism for <b>germline</b> <b>genes</b> in non-germline cells that might provide a target mechanism for new clinical therapies...|$|R

Comparative {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis {{of a large number of}} Ig gene loci from autoimmune and normal mice indicated that (a) lupus can develop in different Ig heavy and kappa light chain variable region gene haplotypes, and (b) the Ig <b>germline</b> <b>genes</b> in lupus mice might be normal.

A large variety of Ig variable, diversity, and joining gene segments encoded these autoantibodies with different specificities. Hence, the overall murine lupus-associated anti-self response may be essentially unrestricted.

40|$|The {{light chain}} of an IgA kappa {{rheumatoid}} factor (RF) {{produced by a}} hybridoma derived from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{has been shown to}} belong to the V kappa IV family. This RF light chain has 31 nucleotide differences compared with the single V kappa IV <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> reported for the human genome. The patient's V kappa IV <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> was sequenced, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and shown to be identical to that previously reported. This demonstrates that the RF light chain {{is the product of a}} somatically mutated gene. A comparison with other known V kappa IV sequences shows that the RF light chain has more replacement mutations than most of the known V kappa IV light chains...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To isolate and {{characterize}} monoclonal autoantibodies (Mab) {{directed to}} citrullinated antigens from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Using lymphocytes from bone marrow or peripheral blood from RA patients, we constructed antibody fragment libraries representing the antibody repertoire of these individuals. Antibody fragments recognizing a citrulline-containing peptide {{were selected from}} these patient libraries. Individual antibody clones were analyzed for <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> usage and reactivity toward citrullinated (auto) -antigens. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of the cDNA encoding the 21 distinct antibody fragments that were obtained revealed a restricted <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> usage. Individual antibody clones were positive in both antiperinuclear factor (APF) and antikeratin antibody (AKA) tests, stained citrullinated filaggrin and fibrinogen on Western blots, and reacted with subsets of citrulline-containing peptides in ELISA, but not with noncitrullinated peptides. CONCLUSION: Our report describes the first recombinant human Mab fragments reactive with citrulline-containing peptides. The restricted <b>germline</b> <b>gene</b> usage of these antibodies, {{and the fact that}} the VH alleles used are not present in all individuals, may indicate the existence of a genetic predisposition for the development of anticitrulline antibodies in individuals with these germline alleles. The selected antibody clones may facilitate studies on the role of these autoantibodies and their target antigens in the development of RA...|$|R
