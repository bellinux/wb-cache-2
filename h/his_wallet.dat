5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase.

For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
