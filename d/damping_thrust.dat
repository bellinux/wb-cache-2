50|$|Jet <b>damping</b> or <b>thrust</b> <b>damping</b> is {{the effect}} of rocket exhaust {{removing}} energy from the transverse angular motion of a rocket. If a rocket has pitch or yaw motion then the exhaust must be accelerated laterally as it flows down the exhaust tube and nozzle. Once the exhaust leaves the nozzle this lateral momentum is lost to the vehicle and thus serves to damp the lateral oscillations. The jet damping is stabilizing as long as the distance from the instantaneous spacecraft center of mass to the nozzle exit plane exceeds the instantaneous transverse radius of gyration. Most rocket or missile configurations meet this criteria and the jet damping has a dynamic stabilizing effect. The jet damping torque rotates at nutation frequency in the spacecraft frame.|$|R

The {{closed-loop}} {{performance of}} a ball-screw drive is usually limited by a resonance in which the carriage oscillates {{in the direction of}} motion as the screw undergoes longitudinal and torsional deformation. By means of the finite element method (FEM), a model of ball-screw system dynamics is presented by taking into account the distributed inertia of the screw and the compliance and <b>damping</b> of <b>thrust</b> bearings, nut and coupling. Transmission ratio is modeled using DOFs (degree of freedoms) constraint equation. The model is found to accurately predict the transfer function from motor torque to carriage position. Comparing the predicted responses with experiments performed on a pair of ball-screw drives, the resonance frequency is misestimated as much as 5 % in the worst case...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} many {{cases in which the}} crew of a multi-engine {{airplane}} had to use engine thrust for emergency flight control. Such a procedure is very difficult, because the propulsive control forces are small, the engine response is slow, and airplane dynamics such as the phugoid and dutch roll are difficult to <b>damp</b> with <b>thrust.</b> In general, thrust increases are used to climb, thrust decreases to descend, and differential thrust is used to turn. Average speed is not significantly affected by changes in throttle setting. Pitch control is achieved because of pitching moments due to speed changes, from thrust offset, and from the vertical component of thrust. Roll control is achieved by using differential thrust to develop yaw, which, through the normal dihedral effect, causes a roll. Control power in pitch and roll tends to increase as speed decreases. Although speed is not controlled by the throttles, configuration changes are often available (lowering gear, flaps, moving center-of-gravity) to change the speed. The airplane basic stability is also a significant factor. Fuel slosh and gyroscopic moments are small influences on throttles-only control. The background and principles of throttles-only flight control are described...|$|R

40|$|An {{electric}} propulsion thrust stand capable of supporting testing of thrusters having a total mass {{of up to}} 125 kg and producing thrust levels between 100 microN to 1 N has been developed and tested. The design features a conventional hanging pendulum arm attached to a balance mechanism that converts horizontal deflections produced by the operating thruster into amplified vertical motion of a secondary arm. The level of amplification is changed through adjustment of the location {{of one of the}} pivot points linking the system. Response of the system depends on the relative magnitudes of the restoring moments applied by the displaced thruster mass and the twisting torsional pivots connecting the members of the balance mechanism. Displacement is measured using a non-contact, optical linear gap displacement transducer and balance oscillatory motion is attenuated using a passive, eddy-current <b>damper.</b> The <b>thrust</b> stand employs an automated leveling and thermal control system. Pools of liquid gallium are used to deliver power to the thruster without using solid wire connections, which can exert undesirable time-varying forces on the balance. These systems serve to eliminate sources of zero-drift that can occur as the stand thermally or mechanically shifts during the course of an experiment. An in-situ calibration rig allows for steady-state calibration before, during and after thruster operation. Thrust measurements were carried out on a cylindrical Hall thruster that produces mN-level thrust. The measurements were very repeatable, producing results that compare favorably with previously published performance data, but with considerably smaller uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|URL] audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a numerical simulation and an experimental study in order to assess stiffness and <b>damping</b> characteristics of <b>thrust</b> air bearings with multiple orifices. Finite element modeling is used to solve the non-linear Reynolds equation while taking into account the movement equation for the bearing. The numerical results obtained show that performance characteristics are related to bearing design type. An experimental investigation allows us to analyze the behavior of thrust air bearings with several orifices as well as that of groove or porous material bearings. Frequency response measurements have been realized in order to compare the dynamic properties of the different bearings. The frequency responses obtained demonstrate that air bearings with multiple orifices have a damping higher than the other types in certain conditions. Air bearings with multiple orifices offer many advantages from a dynamic point of view. Their performance may be characterized not only by flow conditions but also by the number or diameter of the orifices in the bearing surface...|$|R

The {{character of the}} longitudinal low frequency (phugoid) motion of a rigid airplane with controls fixed is investigated for the flight Mach number range from 1. 25 to 8. 0 using the physical and aerodynamic data of the North American X- 15 research airplane. The validity of the simplifying assumptions made in most low speed airplane stability investigations (symmetry of the airplane and of the air flow, small perturbations) is established for the problem under consideration. The equations of longitudinal motion have been solved for the flight altitudes: sea level, 20, 000 ft., 40, 000 ft., and 60, 000 ft.; and in, addition {{the roots of the}} simplified equations resulting from the phugoid approximation have been calculated for the same flight situations. It is found that the deviation of these approximate solutions from the solutions of the complete longitudinal equations is below 5 per cent throughout the considered range of flight conditions, and for most calculated points is less than 2 per cent. The phugoid roots are complex at 60, 000 ft. altitude and real at sea level, with transition from one mode to the other at the intermediate flight altitudes. The real part of the roots is always negative, i. e., there is no divergence of the motion. Using the phugoid approximation, a criterion for the de-generation of the periodic phugoid mode into aperiodic modes is derived in form of a critical value of the lift to drag ratio [ [...] . ]. In an appendix, the influence of an additional <b>damping</b> force (<b>thrust</b> control by the auto-pilot) on the character of the phugoid roots is shown...|$|R

The flying height of the HDD spindle system is determined by using the static analysis of the FDBs. The stiffness and damping coefficients are calculated by using the dynamic analysis of the FDBs. The free vibration characteristics and shock response of the HDD spindle system are analyzed by using the finite element method and the mode superposition method. An experimental modal test is also performed to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. This research shows that the shaft diameter changes the rocking frequencies in wider range than the groove depth of FDBs and that the shock response of a HDD spindle system is affected by the groove depth of FDBs. It also shows that the stiffness coefficients of journal bearing affect the rocking frequencies because their magnitudes are within the range of the stiffness of the supporting structure and that the <b>damping</b> coefficients of <b>thrust</b> bearing affect the axial frequency because the stiffness of thrust bearing is much smaller than that of the supporting structure.

40|$|The {{offshore}} wind industry {{is growing at}} high pace and is already {{one of the major}} renewable energy sources in Europe. To support this growth, costs must be further decreased, amongst others by efficiently designing the support structure of the {{offshore wind}} turbines (OWT). This requires accurate prediction of environmental loading such as dynamic ice-structure interaction. From industry practice it is known, that current phenomenological models show results that are highly sensitive to the used input parameters. It is investigated if the methodology used in industry practice, can be improved by coupled phenomenological modeling of dynamic ice-structure interaction. The phenomenological model proposed by Hendrikse and Metrikine (2015) is implemented and extended with the creep and buckling failure modes. The input parameters of the model are derived from reference data that is obtained from full-scale measurements. A verification study is performed to demonstrate that the reference data is matched. Furthermore, a qualitative verification is performed on the failure modes and ice-induced vibration regimes. The phenomenological model is applied to a structural model of an OWT and investigated in two case studies. For the implementation of the structural model, firstly the phenomenological model for ice-structure interaction is adjusted for cylindrical structures. Aerodynamic <b>damping</b> and <b>thrust</b> are included to enable simulations of the ice-structure interaction during the production of electrical energy. The coupled model is applied in two cases. The first case considers an offshore wind turbine model with ice loading as the only subjected load to the structure. The second case considers the combination of ice and wind loading. A comparison is made between coupled and uncoupled models for ice-structure interaction. The uncoupled models use an external ice load series to represent the ice-structure interaction and are therefore based on methodology used in industry practice. In case of ice-only loading, it is concluded that the uncoupled model is not capable of capturing intermittent crushing and frequency lock-in behavior due to inconsistency between the load signal and the response. In case of combined ice and wind loading, it is concluded that the uncoupled model is incapable of capturing intermittent crushing behavior and ice-induced damping. The same inconsistency is used as an explanation. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringOffshore and dredging engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 59 This {{tutorial}} {{will present}} {{an overview of}} the operation and design of steam turbines used for driving reactor and boiler feed pumps, called a boiler feed pump turbine (BFPT). Overall, these turbines are designed {{in much the same way}} as other mechanical drive turbines; however, there are characteristics to these units that make them unique to this application. A feed pump turbine must be integrated and completely compatible with the pump and the main turbine generator (TG) unit because these pieces of equipment are so interrelated. One of the most unique features of these turbines is their ability to operate from two separate and very different steam supplies. To accommodate these steam sources, two separate inlets must be used, each with its own special characteristics. The high pressure (HP) inlet has a separate steam chest designed to accept the boiler pressure. This inlet will feed a nozzle block that has an arc of admission of 25 percent or less. The low pressure (LP) inlet generally utilizes approximately 50 percent of the arc and has a much larger flow passing area. This type of turbine varies in output across the operating range of the plant. There are two basic operating cycles. The two pump operating cycle usually runs between 40 percent and 110 percent main unit load (MUL), this operation is achieved by using all LP steam. The one pump operating cycle, startup to approximately 65 percent MUL, uses both steam sources. The percent of each is determined by the load required, as well as the LP steam conditions. As the load increases on the TG main unit, the LP pressure supply to the BFPT increases, the HP steam is used to start up the BFPT unit and supplemented by the LP steam source to achieve the required load. There are numerous other factors beside modes of operation to consider when designing a boiler feed pump turbine. These include the speed and power requirements of the pump, steam characteristics from the main unit and boiler, and exhaust pressure. From a mechanical perspective there are a number of design features available on the style turbine to consider for maintaining reliability. The most obvious design feature is the single flow versus double flow design. The rotating component of the turbine, the rotor, is the key for maintaining reliability. It consists of an integrally forged shaft, blades with various styles of fastening, and shrouds or blade covers. The blades have either an axial or radial entry design root to secure them to the disk portion of the shaft. Shrouding also has multiple variations. It can be riveted, integral, integral with wire, or an integral interlocking design. Stationary elements consist of the diaphragms and labyrinth seals. The diaphragms direct the flow between the rotating blade rows. All boiler feed pump turbines have two journal bearings and a thrust bearing. In most cases tilting pad journal bearings are used because of their inherent stability and <b>damping</b> characteristics. <b>Thrust</b> bearings are mostly the standard double acting type. Controlling the steam flow to the turbine is done with the valve operating gear assembly. This assembly consists of simple linkage arrangement that controls the lift of the diffuser valves feeding the low pressure chest and the high pressure valve. The entire assembly is raised and lowered by an oil controlled servo motor. There are various other peripherals such as turning gears, probes, and rounding brushes that may or may not be used, which will also be discussed...|$|R
