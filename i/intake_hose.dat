2500|$|... 1976 {{brought about}} a few changes on the Electra. The {{front-end}} was reworked, including the grille and bumper. The new plastic grille featured 17 vertical bars and covered much of the radiator. The grille did not extend under the headlights in 1976, but instead Buick moved the running lights and turn signal lights underneath the headlights, where the 1975 grille had once been. The bumper no longer housed running lights. [...] There were also some minor interior differences. The brake release handle was black instead of chrome, the seat material was slightly different, on the limited, notch-back diamond pattern seating. The 1975 material appeared in a [...] "corduroy" [...] form, but the actual material was not corduroy. The 1976 diamond pattern seating material did not have this appearance. [...] The engine air cleaner {{did not have a}} [...] "cold-air" [...] ram air <b>intake</b> <b>hose</b> like the 1975 model did, and there were some carburetor changes and camshaft changes to meet EPA standards. The rear end ratio also was higher than the 1975 standard, at 2.56:1 instead of 2.73:1. The Park Avenue and leather seating in 1975 and 1976 were the same. Once again, there was the base 225, the Limited, and the luxurious Park Avenue. The Park Avenue Deluxe vanished for 1976 due to poor sales. The 1976 Electra is about {{the same size as the}} 1975 at , making them among the biggest Buicks ever.|$|E
50|$|An airbox is {{an empty}} chamber on the inlet of most {{combustion}} engines. It collects air from outside and feeds {{it to the}} <b>intake</b> <b>hoses</b> of each cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|... 1950/51: Cosmos {{started making}} {{a type of}} small [...] "chariot"-type wetsub called Ippocampo (Italian for [...] "seahorse") for tourist and sports use. Some had a petrol engine with a long <b>intake</b> air <b>hose</b> to a float; some had a battery-electric engine.|$|R
50|$|All {{standard}} 1968 4-4-2 {{engines are}} painted a bronze-copper color, {{as with the}} 1967s, topped with a fire-red air cleaner. W-30 option cars were equipped with Ram Air <b>intake</b> <b>hoses</b> leading from a chrome-topped dual snorkel black air cleaner to special under-bumper air scoops and set off by bright red plastic fender wells. In addition, a Turnpike Cruiser option was made available with a two-barrel carburetor; this was previously available on the Cutlass Supreme for 1967. 1968 was the first year for side marker lights and front outboard shoulder belts, and {{the last year for}} vent windows on hardtops and convertibles. 4-4-2s for '68 had unique rear bumpers, with exhaust cutouts and special exhaust tips.|$|R
500|$|It uses suction gaskets. [...] Gaskets in {{standard}} fire hose ("pressure gaskets") {{are designed to}} minimize the water leaking out between couplings. [...] The gaskets connecting hard suction hose sections, pump, and strainer must instead prevent air from entering at the coupling, since that would spoil the vacuum and allow air into the pump intake. Large diameter ( [...] or greater) hard suction hose will typically use Storz fittings, which are genderless. [...] or smaller hard suction hose will typically use threaded fittings. [...] In each case, the hard suction hose connection will match the fittings of the pump <b>intake</b> and supply <b>hose,</b> so that hard suction hose {{can be used in}} place of supply hose as appropriate.|$|R
