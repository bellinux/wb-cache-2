5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value <b>in</b> <b>operations,</b> leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence to support this view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E

Eventually, he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany, culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden.|$|E
5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation.

5|$|During the war, Italy stopped {{building}} cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, {{and smaller}} patrol vessels were more useful <b>in</b> <b>operations</b> against the Austro-Hungarians.

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of 1917 and {{the first half of}} 1918 the 5th Division mainly undertook a reserve role and as a result the 32nd Battalion had little involvement during the German Spring Offensive; after the winter of 1917–18, the battalion had re-entered the trenches in the Messines sector, occupying positions near Warneton in January 1918, remaining there until March. In April, the 8th Brigade had been moved to the Somme, taking up defensive positions around the canal between Corbie and Vaux. After the German advance stalled the 32nd Battalion was involved in a series of minor advances along the Bray–Corbie Road throughout July, taking part <b>in</b> <b>operations</b> around Morlancourt and the Morcourt Valley as the Allies sought to regain the initiative. Later, the Allies launched their own offensive around Amiens beginning on 8 August 1918. During this offensive the 32nd Battalion took part <b>in</b> <b>operations</b> in the Peronne area throughout August and September as the Allies sought to breach the Hindenburg Line, fighting its final engagement of the war between 29 September and 1 October 1918 as part of a joint Australian and American attack along the St Quentin Canal.|$|E
