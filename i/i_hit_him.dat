500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when he looked up and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{reportedly}} {{trained in}} several martial art styles in his youth, primarily in Tai Chi and either boxing or kickboxing. He abandoned boxing because of two incidents: one with his boxing coach {{and one with}} Ip Man. The first incident apparently occurred because Wong accidentally struck his boxing coach during sparring. The angry coach attacked in earnest, only to be eventually knocked out by Wong; the incident caused Wong to leave boxing. In another account, however, Wong said he had defeated his boxing coach with wing chun techniques: [...] "I was sparring with my instructor and <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> very hard, he got real mad and came at me very hard. I fought back with wing chun {{and he ended up}} bleeding. Boxing was over for me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{giving a}} {{teleconference}} interview with NBA.com, Nocioni {{spoke about the}} hard fouls and his suspension, [...] "First, the one with Wade was completely my fault. It was a bad reaction on my part. If I had received any penalties because of it, {{it would be a}} fair sanction, but it was not given. However, the sanction set after the game against the Pistons is totally unfair. I see it as a totally real play taken out of context in the game — absolutely nothing happened. It was an accidental blow. Without purposely trying to, <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him.</b> I apologized on the court. I also asked Carlos Delfino to give my apologies to him, so I don't understand why there is a sanction for something totally normal in a game." [...] In Nocioni's first NBA playoff game, he scored 25 points and grabbed 18 rebounds while playing all 48minutes. Due to his outstanding play, the sold-out United Center crowd in Chicago chanted his name. This game solidified Nocioni's status as a Chicago favorite.|$|E

2500|$|Ali {{opened the}} fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman's head. Then, {{beginning}} in the second round—and {{to the consternation of}} his corner—Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the [...] "Rope-a-dope", so violated conventional boxing wisdom—letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will—that at ringside writer George Plimpton thought the fight had to be fixed. Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. In reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: [...] "I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: 'That all you got, George?' I realized that this ain't what I thought it was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hatton {{agreed to}} terms on 27 July for an 8 December 2007 welterweight fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. which was {{considered}} to be the biggest welterweight fight since the 1999 clash between Oscar De La Hoya and Puerto Rican legend Tito Trinidad. The MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue on 17 August 2007. The fight was agreed to less than three months after Mayweather had said he planned to retire following a victory over Oscar De La Hoya. Hatton was able to bring the fight to Mayweather in the early rounds. In the 1st round, Hatton caught Mayweather with a left jab which knocked Mayweather off balance. His constant pressure appeared to make Mayweather uncomfortable at first. In the third round, Mayweather landed a right that cut Hatton above the right eye. In round six, referee Joe Cortez took a point away from Hatton after he appeared to hit Mayweather {{on the back of the}} head while Mayweather was rested between the ropes. However, the punch was revealed to have hit the rope rather than Mayweather's head, but Hatton was warned for punching behind the head on numerous occasions before the deduction. Hatton became angry at the referee's decision to deduct a point and turned his back on him. Hatton later claimed he was angered by the referee, which caused him to lose his calm and contributed to his downfall. Hatton was able to hold his own until round eight, when Mayweather began to adapt to Hatton and started counterattacking. Mayweather knocked Hatton down to the mat in round ten. Hatton got up, but Mayweather quickly resumed his attack, resulting in Joe Cortez putting a stop to the fight and Hatton's corner threw in the towel. Mayweather commented post-match that [...] "Ricky Hatton is one tough fighter. He is still a champion in my eyes and I'd love to see him fight again... Ricky Hatton is probably one of toughest competitors I've faced. <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> with some big ones but he kept coming and I can see why they call him the 'Hitman'." [...] The fight received large amounts of publicity, with both fighters promoting the fight heavily.|$|E
6000|$|Presently, {{she looked}} up rejoiced, for a few notes of a bugle-horn were sounded; there was a {{clattering}} of feet, {{and in a few}} moments there bounded into the hall, a boy of about eight years old, his cheeks and large blue eyes bright with air and exercise, and his long light-brown hair streaming behind him, as he ran forward flourishing a bow in his hand, and crying out, [...] "I hit him, <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him!</b> Dame Astrida, do you hear?

60|$|Afore I {{could put}} my 'ands up he 'it me {{hard in the}} mouth, and the next moment we was at it as 'ard as we could go.

6000|$|... "For his sister's sake," [...] Colonel Ray said softly, [...] "I want to {{keep him}} out of it if I can. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> a little harder than was necessary. He should be hors de combat for some time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{see him at}} all," [...] {{answered}} Sam. [...] "Some of {{the fellows}} rushed behind the bushes and I simply let drive along {{with a number of}} others.

6000|$|... "I had {{my eye on}} it, all {{the time}} he was speaking," [...] Ryan replied. [...] "I saw that, if I were to move to get round the table at him, the little man would have time to shout; but that if <b>I</b> could <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> in the wind, it would be all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was but tit for tat," [...] the {{man said}} coolly; [...] "he murdered me, body and soul, when he sent me to the hulks. I told him I would be even with him. I did not think <b>I</b> had <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> at the time, for I thought that if I had you would have stopped with him, {{and would not have}} chased me across the fields." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ask him, with my best compliments," [...] I said, [...] "whether he [...] {{remembers the}} blow <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> in the face. Tell him I can [...] hit {{much harder than}} that; {{tell him that he}} will never [...] find me unprepared, for a moment." ...|$|E

5000|$|David Bowie {{refused to}} co-operate during an impromptu {{interview}} following {{a performance by}} his band Tin Machine. As Wogan put it: [...] "David Bowie, well he probably wasn't at his best when I interviewed him.

For some reason best known to him he came on the show unwilling to talk." ...|$|R
5000|$|Teammate Jim Northrup {{told the}} story as follows: [...] "In his last at-bat, Norm {{walked up to the}} plate with a table leg from the locker room. The plate umpire, Ron Luciano, says, `You can't use that up here.' Cash says, `Why not, <b>I</b> won't <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> anyway.' He then gets a bat, then hit a popup to shortstop to end the game. As he was walking away he says to Luciano, `See, I told ya.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, so did I. The 'ole thing there, as Dawkins 'ud say, was, I {{knocked him}} out. It's {{the sort of}} thing that's always happening.

First round, <b>I</b> didn't <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> once. He was better than I thought he'd be, and I knew from {{experience}} he was pretty good.' ...|$|R
60|$|At {{about twenty}} paces I fired and hit--not Jana but the lame priest who was {{fulfilling}} {{the office of}} mahout, perched upon his shoulders many feet above {{the point at which}} I had aimed.

6000|$|He went on, {{as though}} not hearing her. [...] "He came {{at me with}} both hands clenched, and <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> under the chin.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{replied the}} man, [...] "he hit me and <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>him,</b> and perhaps {{presently}} {{we shall be}} talking it over together. No, don't trouble, {{it is through the}} body and mortal. Well, I expected nothing less, so I can't complain. Now, listen, while my strength holds.

5000|$|The {{following}} dialogue by the band's roadie, Roger [...] "The Hat" [...] Manifold, {{one of his}} two spoken segments on the album, {{is heard}} before the second saxophone solo: Well I mean, they're not gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again. Dig it? I mean he got off light, 'cause I coulda given 'im a thrashin' but <b>I</b> only <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> once. It's only {{the difference between right}} and wrong innit?

60|$|I {{remember}} another night, in {{that part}} of the country, when I just missed another bull. If <b>I</b> had <b>hit</b> <b>him,</b> I'd have telescoped him, for I was coming down from above, all holds free, with several other bulls one jump behind and reaching for me. This is how it happened. I had been lodging in a livery stable in Washington. I had a box-stall and unnumbered horse-blankets all to myself. In return for such sumptuous accommodation I took care of a string of horses each morning. I might have been there yet, if it hadn't been for the bulls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It {{seemed to}} me that the chance was too good to be missed. Of course, I might have had a pot at him from the bank, but the chances were <b>I</b> wouldn't have <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> in a vital place. So I swam across to the sandbank, put the muzzle of my gun in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. I have rarely seen a {{crocodile}} so taken aback." ...|$|R
