We also compared the acclimatization pattern of <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> with hybrid aspen (Populus tremula ×Populus tremuloides) trees. LT 50 values indicated that short day and long day conditions did not alter the cold hardiness of <b>cherry</b> <b>trees.</b> Under the same experimental conditions hybrid aspen trees were affected from different photoperiods. Aspen trees exposed to short day conditions were hardier than the trees exposed to long day conditions.
