25|$|The masks used {{by these}} dancers vary, with deep lines present in masks from Tabasco and Michoacán. In Guerrero, Puebla and Veracruz, where the {{depiction}} is more comical, the masks {{tend to have}} <b>glossier</b> <b>skin</b> tones.|$|R
5|$|In midsummer the strigs {{of green}} fruit ripen to edible berries, very dark purple in colour, almost black, with <b>glossy</b> <b>skins</b> and {{persistent}} calyxes at the apex, each containing many seeds. An established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) of fruit each year.|$|R
60|$|Beyond {{the neat}} lawn and the {{flowering}} shrubs, Jane Clayton saw the glistening bodies of her Waziri. The sun glanced from {{the tips of}} their metal-shod spears, picked out the gorgeous colors in the feathers of their war bonnets, and reflected the high-lights from the <b>glossy</b> <b>skins</b> of their broad shoulders and high cheek bones.|$|R
60|$|And indeed, in his striped Guernsey frock, dark <b>glossy</b> <b>skin</b> and hair, Harry Bolton, {{mingling}} with the Highlander's crew, looked not unlike the soft, silken quadruped-creole, that, pursued by wild Bushmen, bounds through Caffrarian woods.|$|E
60|$|The {{answer was}} a {{perfectly}} indescribable hiss, and Mowgli kicked up his feet behind, clapped his hands together to applaud himself, and jumped on to Bagheera's back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on the <b>glossy</b> <b>skin</b> and making the worst faces {{he could think of}} at Baloo.|$|E
6000|$|Hark, their quick tramp! First six, {{and then}} three, {{galloping}} with ungodly glee. And a marten-cat came rushing {{down from the}} woods; but the jackals, fierce in their number, drove her away, and there she stood without the circle, panting, beautiful, and baffled, with her white teeth and <b>glossy</b> <b>skin,</b> and sparkling eyes of rabid rage.[7] ...|$|E

5000|$|Terminal {{clusters}} of small urn-shaped flowers bloom from May to June. The perfect flowers are white to pink, and bear round, fleshy or mealy, bright red to pink fruits called drupes. This smooth, <b>glossy</b> <b>skinned</b> fruit will range from [...] to [...] inch in diameter. The fruit will persist {{on the plant}} into early winter. Each drupe contains 1 to 5 hard seeds, which need to be scarified and stratified prior to germination to reduce the seed coat and break embryo dormancy. There is an average of 40,900 cleaned seeds per pound.|$|R

60|$|The {{news was}} told {{at once to}} Iliane, who ran down {{directly}} and called them to her one by one, each mare by its name. And at the first sight of her the wounded animal shook itself quickly, {{and in a moment}} its wounds were healed, and there was not even a mark on its <b>glossy</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{ascended the}} stair, and paid his greetings to them {{both with the}} air {{of a man who was}} as shy as a wild deer, and yet who had steeled himself to carry a thing through. He walked with them to the sitting-room, and then in an instant was gone again, and they heard his feet thudding upon the stairs. Presently he was back, with a lovely <b>glossy</b> <b>skin</b> in his hands. [...] "The bear is for your father, mademoiselle," [...] said he. [...] "This little skin I have brought from America for you. It is but a trifle, and yet it may serve to make a pair of mocassins or a pouch." ...|$|E

5000|$|... 'Lula' fruit has a <b>glossy</b> green <b>skin</b> and is pear-shaped. The flesh {{has high}} oil content, around 12-16%. The fruit matures from October to February in Florida. 'Lula' {{produces}} A-type flowers.|$|R
60|$|All of Wildfire {{was white}} except {{where he was}} red, and that red was not now his <b>glossy,</b> flaming <b>skin.</b> A terrible muscular {{convulsion}} as of internal collapse grew slower and slower. Yet choked, blinded, dying, killed on his feet, Wildfire heard Lucy's voice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have the}} jolliest little fellows this time--about seven of them-- fellows {{scarcely}} {{too big to}} take on my knee, and talk to about God, and Heaven, and Jesus Christ; and I feel almost as if I {{had a kind of}} instinct of love towards them, as they look up wonderingly with their deep deep eyes, and smooth and <b>glossy</b> <b>skins,</b> and warm soft cheeks, and ask their simple questions. I wish you could have seen the twenty Banks Islanders as I told them that most excellent of all tales--the story of Joseph. How their eyes glistened! and they pushed out their heads to hear the sequel of his making himself known to his brethren, and asking once more about [...] "the old man of whom ye spake, is he yet alive?" ...|$|R
60|$|Beauty. That {{was the key}} to the riddle. All Nature: its golden sunsets and its silvery dawns; {{the glory}} of piled-up clouds, the mystery of moonlit glades; its rivers winding through the meadows; the calling of its restless seas; the tender witchery of Spring; the blazonry of autumn woods; its purple moors and the wonder of its silent mountains; its cobwebs {{glittering}} with a thousand jewels; the pageantry of starry nights. Form, colour, music! The feathered choristers of bush and brake raising their matin and their evensong, the whispering of the leaves, the singing of the waters, the voices of the winds. Beauty and grace in every living thing, but man. The leaping of the hares, the grouping of cattle, the flight of swallows, the dainty loveliness of insects' wings, the <b>glossy</b> <b>skin</b> of horses rising and falling to the play of mighty muscles. Was it not seeking to make plain to us that God's language was beauty. Man must learn beauty that he may understand God.|$|E
60|$|But {{he was a}} very {{different}} figure from the confused mass of white and black that had appeared for an instant in the doorway. He was buttoned and buckled up to his bursting eyeballs in the most brilliant fashion. A tall black hat was tilted on his broad black head--a hat of the sort that the French wit has compared to eight mirrors. But somehow the black man was like the black hat. He also was black, and yet his <b>glossy</b> <b>skin</b> flung back the light at eight angles or more. It is needless to say that he wore white spats and a white slip inside his waistcoat. The red flower stood up in his buttonhole aggressively, as if it had suddenly grown there. And in the way he carried his cane in one hand and his cigar in the other there was a certain attitude--an attitude we must always remember when we talk of racial prejudices: something innocent and insolent--the cake walk.|$|E
6000|$|Here, {{as among}} most savage people I have dwelt among, I was {{delighted with the}} beauty of the human form-a beauty of which stay-at-home civilized people can {{scarcely}} have any conception. What are the finest Grecian statues to the living, moving, breathing men I saw daily around me? The unrestrained grace of the naked savage as he goes about his daily occupations, or lounges at his ease, must be seen to be understood; and a youth bending his bow is the perfection of manly beauty. The women, however, except in extreme youth, are by no means so pleasant to look at as the men. Their strongly-marked features are very unfeminine, and hard work, privations, and very early marriages soon destroy whatever of beauty or grace they may for a short time possess. Their toilet is very simple, but also, I am sorry to say, very coarse, and disgusting. It consists solely of a mat of plaited strips of palm leaves, worn tight round the body, and reaching from the hips to the knees. It seems not to be changed till worn out, is seldom washed, and is generally very dirty. This is the universal dress, except in a few cases where Malay [...] "sarongs" [...] have come into use. Their frizzly hair is tied in a bench {{at the back of the}} head. They delight in combing, or rather forking it, using for that purpose a large wooden fork with four diverging prongs, which answers the purpose of separating and arranging the long tangled, frizzly mass of cranial vegetation much better than any comb could do. The only ornaments of the women are earrings and necklaces, which they arrange in various tasteful ways. The ends of a necklace are often attached to the earrings, and then looped on to the hair-knot behind. This has really an elegant appearance, the beads hanging gracefully on each side of the head, and by establishing a connexion with the earrings give an appearance of utility to those barbarous ornaments. We recommend this style to the consideration of those of the fair sex who still bore holes in their ears and hang rings thereto. Another style of necklace among these Papuan belles is to wear two, each hanging on one side of the neck and under the opposite arm, so as to cross each other. This has a very pretty appearance, in part due to the contrast of the white beads or kangaroo teeth of which they are composed with the dark <b>glossy</b> <b>skin.</b> The earrings themselves are formed of a bar of copper or silver, twisted so that the ends cross. The men, as usual among savages, adorn themselves more than the women. They wear necklaces, earrings, and finger rings, and delight in a band of plaited grass tight round the arm just below the shoulder, to which they attach a bunch of hair or bright coloured feathers by way of ornament. The teeth of small animals, either alone, or alternately with black or white beads, form their necklaces, and sometimes bracelets also. For these latter, however, they prefer brass wire, or the black, horny, wing-spines of the cassowary, which they consider a charm. Anklets of brass or shell, and tight plaited garters below the knee, complete their ordinary decorations.|$|E
50|$|Its {{leaves are}} {{leathery}} and entire. Petioles and young leaves {{are covered in}} short rusty red hairs. Small amounts of latex {{can be seen on}} bruised leaves or petioles. The ripe yellow fruits have a <b>glossy,</b> brittle <b>skin</b> and are sweet and edible, floury in texture and slightly astringent. The wood is reddish-brown in colour, hard and tough, and was traditionally used in the making of wagons. Clusters of fragrant white flowers appear from October to January.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit is}} very large, {{averaging}} 30-40 ounces (850-1100 grams) in weight, with an oval shape is <b>glossy,</b> smooth, green <b>skin.</b> Oil {{content of the}} fruit is approximately 13%. In Florida, the fruit mature from October to January. 'Choquette' trees produce A-type flowers.|$|R
60|$|The countenance the boy {{worked with}} a feeling {{that it was not}} usual for an Indian to betray. He bent his look, with concern, on the mild eyes of the anxious Ruth; then drawing a hand slowly from beneath the light robe that partly covered his body, he cast {{at the feet of the}} {{stranger}} a bundle of arrows, wrapped in the <b>glossy</b> and striped <b>skin</b> of the rattlesnake.|$|R

50|$|Their {{very smooth}} and <b>glossy</b> <b>skin</b> {{is said to}} be highly {{iridescent}} and is functional in warding off debris during burrowing. They are typically fossorial and nocturnal, becoming active during rainy nights.|$|E
50|$|They are {{shades of}} tan, brown, and gray with spotted {{patterns}} on their smooth, <b>glossy</b> <b>skin,</b> {{and a white}} or cream-colored unmarked ventral surface. Coloration often varies {{in relation to the}} color of the soil in a snake's native habitat.|$|E
40|$|Some {{degree of}} mild {{superficial}} desquamation {{is a very}} common feature {{during the first week}} of life: it occurs in small flakes, sometimes affecting the entire body and especially the trunk. But, in the case to be described, the dorsum of the hands and feet was covered at birth by a layer of <b>glossy,</b> collodion-like <b>skin</b> which soon desquamated. This condition is of considerable rarity. Perez (1880), in Chile, described an infant whom he had seen on the day after birth and whose skin was replaced by a cornified substance of uniform consistency except in the region of the flexures where it was much thinner. This gave the whole body a varnished appearance, and the armour-like covering limited the movement of most of th...|$|R
50|$|Eilistraee {{appears as}} a drow female of {{extraordinary}} beauty. She is 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall, with long, strong, graceful limbs and a <b>glossy,</b> obsidian-dark <b>skin.</b> Her face is like that of her mother, Lolth, with delicately sculpted features and shape, save for her large eyes and ankle-length hair, which are of a glowing silvery hue. She usually appears unclad, cloaked only by her hair and silvery radiances that are ever-moving about her body. Her appearance inspires utter awe and astonishment (as expected from a goddess), as well as deeper emotions: those who contemplate her {{feel as if they}} have found the answer to all that their soul longs for, but upon her leaving, they experience a feeling of deep loss, or even desolation, though only for a brief time (as Sharlario Moonflower and his son felt when the Dark Dancer manifested to them, warning them of the dangers of Ilythiir).|$|R
5000|$|Fairies {{are portrayed}} in the series as beautiful, with pointed ears and <b>glossy,</b> thin <b>skin.</b> Physically, fairies are super-humanly strong and durable. They are tough, ferocious, and {{incredibly}} long-lived, but not immortal. The Shreveport werewolf packmaster says, [...] "They love to flirt with disaster, they love to role-play." [...] In this universe, fairies are extremely attractive to humans {{as well as to}} vampires. Vampires have a hard time resisting fairies because of their smell and taste; fairy blood is intoxicating to vampires. A fairy, Claudine, is first introduced in Dead to the World. Watching vampires react to her, Sookie thinks that “it was like watching cats that'd suddenly spotted something skittering along the baseboards.” This makes face to face interactions between them all but impossible. However some individuals, such as Sookie's great-grandfather Niall Brigant, are able to [...] "suppress their essence", effectively masking their scent and making such contact safer.|$|R

50|$|The {{shape and}} size of the fruit is highly variable, {{depending}} on the cultivar. The better selections consistently produce large ovate fruit with <b>glossy</b> <b>skin</b> weighing upwards of 14 ounces. The flesh is somewhat pasty, although the best varieties have a creamy mousse-like texture. The flavor is rich and is reminiscent of an egg-custard. The fruit may contain between one and six large brown seeds.|$|E
60|$|How {{many times}} have I changed hands? I think it is twelve times--I cannot remember; and each time it was down a step lower, and each time I got a harder master. They have been cruel, every one; they have worked me night and day in {{degraded}} employments, and beaten me; they have fed me ill, and some days not at all. And so I am but bones, now, with a rough and frowsy skin humped and cornered upon my shrunken body--that skin which was once so <b>glossy,</b> that <b>skin</b> which she loved to stroke with her hand. I was {{the pride of the}} mountains and the Great Plains; now I am a scarecrow and despised. These piteous wrecks that are my comrades here say we have reached the bottom of the scale, the final humiliation; they say that when a horse is no longer worth the weeds and discarded rubbish they feed to him, they sell him to the bull-ring for a glass of brandy, to make sport for the people and perish for their pleasure.|$|R
60|$|He was {{a slight}} lad, with sloping shoulders, a slim brown neck, and a head set on it with stag-like grace and uplift. His hair, cut {{straight}} across his brow and falling over his ears, after some caprice of Janet Andrews, the minister's housekeeper, was a <b>glossy</b> blue-black. The <b>skin</b> {{of his face and}} hands was like ivory; his eyes were large and beautifully tinted--gray, with dilating pupils; his features had the outlines of a cameo. Carmody mothers considered him delicate, and had long foretold that the minister would never bring him up; but old Abel pulled his grizzled moustache when he heard such forebodings and smiled.|$|R
60|$|Advancing {{towards the}} children, {{who were so}} {{numerous}} that I began to think {{this must be the}} general playground of the village, I sat down on a grassy bank under the shade of a plantain-tree to watch them. And a happier or more noisy crew I have never seen. There were at least two hundred of them, both boys and girls, all of whom were clad in no other garments than their own <b>glossy</b> little black <b>skins,</b> except the maro, or strip of cloth, round the loins of the boys, and a very short petticoat or kilt on the girls. They did not all play at the same game, but amused themselves in different groups.|$|R
