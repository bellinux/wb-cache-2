500|$|The [...] "Burnside Burn" [...] was {{organized}} by Portland NORML, the {{local chapter of the}} National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, in celebration of the legalization of recreational marijuana use in Oregon and to circumnavigate a temporary limit on recreational sales. According to Russ Belville, the chapter's executive director, the event began with the idea of taking a photograph in front of the White Stag sign. He recalled: [...] "It evolved from me saying that when legalization happens, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a photo under the Portland, Oregon sign. Other people said, 'Can we give marijuana away?' [...] I said, 'I can't stop you!'" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Alan Douglas, {{who managed}} Hendrix's {{recording}} catalogue, {{reached an agreement}} with MCA Records for the future releases of Hendrix material. [...] He also announced plans for new reissues of the three Experience albums: [...] "Everything in the present catalogue is a budget release... They're all 25-year-old packages. [...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it high-level... with all these new elements".

500|$|In 1992, Madonna founded her own {{multi-media}} entertainment company, Maverick, {{consisting of}} a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was {{a joint venture with}} Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. Madonna said that she envisioned the company as an [...] "artistic think tank" [...] and likened it to a cross between the Bauhaus, the innovative German arts institute formed in Weimar in 1919, and Andy Warhol's New York-based Factory of artists and assistants. She stated: [...] "It started as a desire to have more control. There's a group of writers, photographers, directors and editors that I've met along the way in my career who <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> with me everywhere I go. I want to incorporate them into my little factory of ideas. I also come in contact with a lot of young talent that I feel entrepreneurial about." [...] The first two projects from the venture were her fifth studio album, Erotica, and a coffee table book of photographs featuring Madonna, entitled Sex.|$|E

2500|$|On October 2, 2008, Bloomberg {{announced}} he would seek to extend the city's term limits law and run for a third mayoral term in 2009, arguing a leader of his field was needed following the financial crisis of 2007–08. [...] "Handling this financial crisis while strengthening essential services... is a challenge <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on," [...] Bloomberg {{said at a news}} conference.

2500|$|Sociologist Susie Scott {{challenged}} the interpretation {{and treatment of}} shyness as being pathological. [...] "By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... we forget that {{this is also a}} socially oriented state of mind that is socially produced and managed." [...] She explores the idea that [...] "shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual", and concludes that, to some extent, [...] "we are all impostors, faking our way through social life". One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my cue from the militant disabled lobbyists and say, 'hey, it's not MY problem, it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'. I shouldn't have to change: society should adapt to meet my needs." ...|$|E

[...] In the interview he also warned other young gay men against unprotected sex. He stated, [...] "there are no guarantees, even with testing" [...] and reiterated that barebacking was risky and stated [...] "the message it sends is not one I {{want to be a}} part of anymore!" [...] During the interview he stated [...] "I would like to stand up for young men who are/were put in similar, compromising positions as I was at Cobra Video. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a stand for HIV awareness."

She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a decent vacation rather than get paid." [...] She continued, [...] "Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. There are times when I think it's hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!" [...] A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.|$|E

Ever since the Rihanna song did well, {{a lot of people want}} to do some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time.
