40|$|Bacteriophage Mu {{in vitro}} {{transposition}} constitutes a versatile tool in molecular biology, with applications ranging from engineering of single genes or proteins to modification of genome segments or entire genomes. A new strategy was devised {{on the basis}} of Mu transposition that via a few manipulation steps simultaneously generates a nested set of <b>gene</b> <b>constructions</b> encoding deletion variants of proteins. C-terminal deletions are produced using a mini-Mu transposon that carries translation stop signals close to each transposon end. Similarly, N-terminal deletions are generated using a transposon with appropriate restriction sites, which allows deletion of the 5 ′-distal part of the gene. As a proof of principle, we produced a set of plasmid constructions encoding both C- and N-terminally truncated variants of yeast Mso 1 p and mapped its Sec 1 p-interacting region. The most important amino acids for the interaction in Mso 1 p are located between residues T 46 and N 78, with some weaker interactions possibly within the region E 79 –N 105. This general-purpose gene truncation strategy is highly efficient and produces, in a single reaction series, a comprehensive repertoire of <b>gene</b> <b>constructions</b> encoding protein deletion variants, valuable in many types of functional studies.

40|$|We {{describe}} a metagenomic DNA shuffling process by combining protein engineering process mutation generator {{and the high}} potential diversity of metagenomic DNA derived from the environment. Numerous previous shuffling processes attempted to recombine more or less related parental sequences. At the same time, metagenomic approaches unveiled a huge diversity of DNA sequences and genomes, which {{have not yet been}} identified to date. In this study, we attempted to combine these two approaches in order to regenerate a novel gene. Here, we present the possibility that DNA fragments from an entire microbial community (metagenome) might be available for the creation of novel genes capable of degrading pollutants. Metagenomic DNA extracted from non-polluted soil was shuffled in vitro to recreate the linA gene responsible for the first steps of lindane degradation. In this work, 74 % of the ORF came from separate subsets of the metagenomic pool from a lindane-free and linA-free soil. Our results demonstrate that microbial community genetic diversity can serve as a source for novel <b>gene</b> <b>construction</b> during in vitro manipulation.

40|$|With the {{sequencing}} of genomes from many organisms now complete {{and the development}} of high-throughput sequencing, life science research has entered the functional post-genome era. Therefore, deciphering the function of genes and how they interact is in greater demand. To study an unknown gene, the basic methods are either overexpression or gene knockout by creating transgenic plants, and <b>gene</b> <b>construction</b> is usually the first step. Although traditional cloning techniques using restriction enzymes or a site-specific recombination system (Gateway or Clontech cloning technology) are highly useful for efficiently transferring DNA fragments into destination plasmids, the process is time consuming and expensive. To facilitate the procedure of <b>gene</b> <b>construction,</b> we designed a TA-based cloning system in which only one step was needed to subclone a DNA fragment into vectors. Such a cloning system was developed from the pGreen binary vector, which has a minimal size and facilitates construction manipulation, combined with the negative selection marker gene ccdB, which has the advantages of eliminating the self-ligation background and directly enabling high-efficiency TA cloning technology.

40|$|Four {{different}} actinidin <b>gene</b> <b>constructions</b> {{have been}} created, each consisting of different functional {{parts of the}} actinidin gene: (1) the mature actinidin-coding DNA, (2) the amino-terminal extension, but without the secretion signal, plus the mature actinidin-coding DNA, (3) the mature actinidin plus the carboxy-terminal extension-coding DNA, and (4) the full-length precursor actinidin-coding DNA. The first three constructions were fused to the yeast MFa 1 promoter and secretion leader sequence, while the fourth was coupled to the CYC 1 -GAL UAS promoter. Upon expression in yeast, no protein product was detected in the culture supernatant. Analysis of intracellular proteins showed that actinidin protein was detected only from the actinidin <b>gene</b> <b>constructions</b> which have the carboxy-terminal extensions, suggesting that the carboxy-terminal extension {{is required for the}} stability of the protein. Comparison of the actinidin proteins produced in protease-proficient and protease-deficient strains suggests that the processing of the protein requires the activity of vacuolar protease(s) and indicates that the actinidin was translocated into the yeast vacuole. Examination of the amino acid sequence suggested that actinidin possesses potential vacuolar and peroxisomal targeting signals. Since the actinidin precursor was glycosylated it must have entered the secretory pathway before being translocated into a specific cellular compartment.

This construction was injected into fertilized mouse ova, and its expression was analyzed in peripheral blood, brain, and liver samples of 13. 5 day transgenic fetuses. Fetuses carrying intact copies of the transgene expressed human epsilon-globin mRNA in their peripheral blood. Levels of expression of human epsilon-globin mRNA in these transgenic mice ranged from 2 % to 26 % per gene copy of the endogenous mouse embryonic epsilon y-globin mRNA level. Furthermore, the human epsilon-globin transgene was expressed specifically in peripheral blood but not in brain or in liver which is an adult erythroid tissue at this stage.
