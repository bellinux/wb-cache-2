In {{the case of}} high-temperature geothermal fluids, precipitation of amorphous silica from solution to form silica scales is the main obstacle for efficient heat extraction. The silica scale formation causes operational problems and may even clog pipelines and <b>injection</b> <b>drill</b> <b>holes.</b> The rate of silica scale formation can be reduced by aging amorphous silica over-saturated waters, which allows the aqueous silica in excess of saturation to polymerize. Polymeric silica has lesser tendency to precipitate from solution than monomeric silica.

40|$|Rock is a {{heterogeneous}} geological material. When rock {{is subjected to}} internal hydraulic pressure and external mechanical loading, the fluid flow properties will be altered by closing, opening, or other interaction of preexisting weaknesses or by induced new fractures. Meanwhile, the pore pressure can influence the fracture behavior on both a local and global scale. A finite element model that can consider the coupled effects of seepage, damage and stress field in heterogeneous rock is described. First, two series of numerical tests in relatively homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks were performed to investigate the influence of pore pressure magnitude and gradient on initiation and propagation of tensile fractures. Second, to examine the initiation of hydraulic fractures and their subsequent propagation, a series of numerical simulations {{of the behavior of}} two <b>injection</b> <b>holes</b> inside a saturated rock mass are carried out. The rock is subjected to different initial in situ stress ratios and to an internal injection (pore) pressure at the two <b>injection</b> <b>holes.</b> Numerically, simulated results indicate that tensile fracture is strongly influenced by both pore pressure magnitude and pore pressure gradient. In addition, the heterogeneity of rock, the initial in situ stress ratio (K), the distance between two <b>injection</b> <b>holes,</b> and the difference of the pore pressure in the two <b>injection</b> <b>holes</b> all play important roles in the initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures.

To achieve {{transient}} flow characteristics at exit of nozzle orifice on {{gasoline direct injection}} engine, two phase Euler-Euler schemes was used to simulate the internal flow of the swirl nozzle. Different flow characteristics were calculated in the simulation. Different kinds of nozzle configuration were studied.

For <b>injection</b> <b>hole</b> geometries with similar cross-sectional areas and similar mass flow rates, the jet configuration with the larger aspect ratio experienced a greater deflection. Entrainment arises from lateral shearing forces {{on the sides of the}} jet, which set up a dual vortex motion within the jet and thereby cause some of the main-stream fluid momentum to be swept into the jet flow. This additional momentum forces the jet nearer the surface. Of the jet configurations, the oblong, CDS, and CUS configurations exhibited the largest deflections.

Interactions of wall jets and vortices embedded in turbulent boundary layers commonly occur near gas turbine blades and endwalls where film cooling is employed. These interactions frequently result in undesirable heat transfer effects at blade and endwall surfaces.

The vortex is generated using a half-delta-wing vortex generator mounted at 12 degrees with respect to a 10 m. 's mean velocity flow over a flat plate. A single <b>injection</b> <b>hole,.</b> 95 cm in diameter, inclined 30 degrees to the horizontal, is located under the vortex downwash, 58 cm downstream from the vortex generator. Baseline measurements were made at one streamwise location downstream of the <b>injection</b> <b>hole</b> for the cases: (1) boundary layer only, (2) boundary layer with vortex, and (3) boundary layer with wall jet. Measurement of the interaction between the boundary layer, vortex and 2. 5 blowing ratio wall jet was also made at this location. The 1. 5 blowing ratio wall jet interaction was measured at three additional streamwise locations. Reynolds stress tensor components, vorticity distributions and mean velocities show that the vortex significantlv alters the turbulence structure of the 1. 5 blowing ratio wall jet at all lour streamwise locations.

Attention is focussed on the changes resulting as circulation magnitudes of the vortices are varied from 0. 0 to 0. 144 m 2 /s. Mean temperature results are presented which show how injectant is distorted and redistributed by vortices, along with heat transfer measurements and mean velocity surveys. <b>Injection</b> <b>hole</b> diameter is 0. 952 cm to give a ratio of vortex core diameter to hole diameter of about 1. 5 - 1. 6. The freestream velocity is maintained at 10 m/s, and the blowing ratio is approximately 0. 5. Film-cooling holes are oriented 30 degrees {{with respect to the}} test surface. Stanton numbers are measured on a constant heat flux surface with a nondimensional temperature parameter of about 1. 5. The situation studied is one where the middle <b>injection</b> <b>hole</b> is beneath the vortex upwash. For all results, vortex centers pass well within 2. 9 vortex core diameters of the middle <b>injection</b> <b>hole.</b> To quantify the influences of the vortices on the injectant, the parameter S is introduced, defined as the ratio of vortex circulation to <b>injection</b> <b>hole</b> diameter times mean injection velocity. The perturbation to film injectant and local heat transfer is determined by the magnitude of S. When S is greater than 1. 0 - 1. 5, injectant is swept into the vortex upwash and above the vortex core by secondary flows, and Stanton number data show little evidence of injectant beneath the vortex core and downwash near the wall for x/d only up to about 17. 5. For large x/d, local hot spots are present, and the vortices cause local Stanton numbers to be augmented by as much as 25 percent in the film-cooled boundary layers. When S is less than 1. 0, some injectant remains near the wall beneath the vortex core and downwash where it continue to provide some thermal protection. In some cases, the protection provided by film cooling is augmented because of vortex secondary flows which cause extra injectant to accumulate near upwash regions.

Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of metabolites derived from (14) C-glyphosate also revealed that about 70 % of the radioactivity recovered in the phloem of the lower part comprised the unknown metabolites M 1 (retention factor [Rf] : 0. 83) and M 2 (Rf: 0. 94), with nearly 28 % of the radioactivity from sarcosine (Rf: 0. 76), and less than 2 % of the radioactivity from aminomethylphosphoric acid (AMPA) (Rf: 0. 49) and glyphosate (Pf: 0. 36). It is concluded that active metabolism of glyphosate in this 90 -d simulation experiment occurred mainly from 45 to 90 DAT, and the primary metabolism was modulated by C-P lyase...|$|R

The mass transfer measurements were conducted {{in a range of}} blowing ratios from 0. 6 to 1. 2 at two different mainstream turbulence levels (0. 4 % and 6. 0 %) while keeping the exit Reynolds number, Re⁡ 2, at a constant value of 397, 000...|$|R
40|$|The {{electro-optical}} {{characteristics of}} a polymer light-emitting diode with a strongly reduced <b>hole</b> <b>injection</b> have been investigated. A silver contact on poly-dialkoxy-p-phenylene vinylene decreases the <b>hole</b> <b>injection</b> by five orders of magnitude, resulting in both a highly reduced light output and current. However, at high applied voltages, the current and light output strongly exceed the predictions based on the reduced <b>hole</b> <b>injection,</b> which is explained by an enhanced electric field near the hole-injection contact due to trapped electrons.
