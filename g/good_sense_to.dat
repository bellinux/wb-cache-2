On the other hand, it makes no sense to speak of the internal energy at a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, it makes <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
500|$|Feynman {{nominally}} held {{an appointment}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison {{as an assistant}} professor of physics, but was on unpaid leave during his involvement in the Manhattan project. In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, [...] "It's great to be back at the only university that ever had the <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> fire me." ...|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{claimed that}} Chapman {{was not a}} subtle captain and lacked {{tactical}} astuteness. Even so, his record is better than most others who led England during Chapman's career. Pelham Warner believed that Chapman started well, but that in the later stages of 1930, his tactical sense markedly deteriorated. On the other hand, several of Chapman's contemporaries believed him {{to be one of}} the best captains. Arthur Gilligan, one of Chapman's predecessors, considered him to be a model for the role, and Bert Oldfield, who played against Chapman as Australia's wicket-keeper, thought that Chapman possessed an [...] "aptitude" [...] for leadership. Chapman's teams were usually harmonious and his sympathetic handling of his players often brought out the best in them. Writing in 1943, Robertson-Glasgow said: [...] "He knew his men as perhaps no other captain of modern times has known them." [...] Cricket writer E. W. Swanton believes that Chapman's cavalier reputation was misleading in assessing his effectiveness, and that [...] "underlying the boyish facade was both a shrewd cricket brain and the <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> ask advice from those of greater experience." ...|$|E

500|$|Varietys Cynthia Littleton [...] "loved seeing Bernard in Grizzly Adams mode" [...] in {{the season}} five finale, while Ryan McGee from Zap2it {{compared}} Bernard's appearance to both Moses and the Gorton's Fisherman. McGee said [...] "It’s a gorgeous, gorgeous scene, even if it stands as a meta-criticism of the angst and turmoil of the show’s major characters". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger called it [...] "one of the best, most moving scenes of the finale". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club thought the scene was useful as it allowed the characters to leave the show, but also it caused him to question whether opting out was the right or wrong thing to do. The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought their decision not to participate [...] "all but solidified them as the 'Adam and Eve' [...] from the caves", although this was shown {{not to be the}} case in season six. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the pair amongst her favourite characters of the series, commenting [...] "Few things made [...] happier than seeing them comfortably ensconced in their retirement cabin with Walt's dog, Vincent. They had the <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> give up the whole island rat race, and their optimistic, straightforward attitudes and down-to-earth humor grounded Lost and gave us a window into normalcy, which, goodness knows, we needed sometimes".|$|E
2500|$|Back in Romania, Tzigara unsuccessfully {{applied for}} the Archeology Chair created at the University of Iași, but lost; {{according}} to scholar and diarist Teohari Antonescu, who emerged as the victor, the competition was rigged in his own favor, even though Tzigara [...] "had the <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> come prepared." [...] From 1899, he was librarian of the Carol I Academic Foundation and Professor of Aesthetics and Art History at the National School of Fine Arts. As Tzigara later acknowledged, his introduction to royalty came through {{a relationship with the}} Kremnitzes, his neighbors on Polonă Street, Dorobanți. This period saw the start of Tzigara's close relationship with Carol, whom the art historian later called [...] "my most generous protector" [...] and [...] "the sovereign [...] ". Received into royal circles, he was a confidant of the Queen Consort and cultural patron, Elisabeth of Wied, whom he called [...] "the animator of Romanian art". For a while, he was her private secretary, helping her fulfill her literary ambitions under the Carmen Sylva signature. Tzigara's recollections speak with enthusiasm about Elisabeth's works, as well as about the king's dislike for her interests in spiritism or philosophy, and discuss Carol's enduring affection for Mite Kremnitz.|$|E
