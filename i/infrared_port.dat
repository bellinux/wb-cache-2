5|$|On October 20, 2009, Apple {{released}} a MacBook that {{introduced a new}} polycarbonate (plastic) unibody design, faster DDR3 memory, a multi-touch trackpad, an LED-backlit display, and a built-in seven-hour battery. The polycarbonate unibody MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks FireWire and, like the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined audio in/out port. There is no <b>infrared</b> <b>port</b> and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, {{and the ability to}} pass audio through the Mini DisplayPort connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases, but was still available to educational institutions until February 2012.|$|E
25|$|The system {{includes}} 1GB {{of internal}} flash memory manufactured by Toshiba, {{but it is}} mostly used by the operating system and its pre-installed applications. The system's memory can be expanded via an SD memory card slot, which supports SD and SDHC memory cards. All Nintendo 3DS systems come packaged with a 2GB SD card while Nintendo 3DS XL systems include a 4GB SDHC card. The system uses 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g wireless network connectivity with enhanced WPA2 security. There is also an <b>infrared</b> <b>port</b> {{on the back of}} the console, which allows the system to connect with certain peripherals such as the Circle Pad Pro and the amiibo reader/writer.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{iteration}} of the iMac G3 {{featured a}} 15-inch (13.8-inch viewable) CRT display, 233MHz processor, ATI Rage IIc graphics, 4 GB hard drive, tray-loading CD-ROM drive, two USB ports, a 56 kbit/s Modem, built-in Ethernet, [...] <b>infrared</b> <b>port,</b> built-in stereo speakers, and two headphone ports. The CPU and memory were {{located on the}} same 'Daughter Card', which installed directly onto the motherboard. It came exclusively in a translucent [...] "Bondi Blue" [...] plastic, and [...] was known as Revision A. On October 17, the iMac was updated with ATI Rage Pro graphics. This updated Revision B model maintained its predecessor's original price of $1299. The iMac had its infrared and mezzanine features removed {{with the introduction of}} the Revision C model on January 5, 1999, dropping in price to US$1199. Hard drive capacity increased and a faster processor was added. The Bondi Blue color was discontinued and replaced by five new colors: Strawberry, Blueberry, Lime, Grape, and Tangerine. A final update, Revision D, was released on April 14, 1999, which maintained its previous specifications save a faster processor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Infrared</b> <b>ports</b> are {{employed}} {{in a wide variety}} of devices ranging from personal computers, printers to mobile phones. <b>Infrared</b> <b>ports</b> comply to specifications defined by Infrared Data Association (IrDA). The performance of IrDA links may be measured at IrLAP data link layer, which controls IrDA hardware. In this work a simple equation to calculate the throughput from different link parameters is derived by employing a mathematical model making use the concept of “window transmission time”. Simple equations, for the optimum values for window size and packet length can be derived, for different BER values. Optimum values for window and packet sizes for 16 Mbps are calculated, which result in maximum throughput and make the link less vulnerable to BER. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Consumer IR, {{consumer}} infrared, or CIR, {{refers to}} a wide variety of devices employing the infrared electromagnetic spectrum for wireless communications. Most commonly found in television remote controls, <b>infrared</b> <b>ports</b> are equally ubiquitous in consumer electronics, such as PDAs, laptops, and computers. The functionality of CIR is as broad as the consumer electronics that carry it. For instance, a television remote control can convey a [...] "channel up" [...] command to the television, while a computer might be able to surf the internet solely via CIR. The type, speed, bandwidth, and power of the transmitted information depends on the particular CIR protocol employed.|$|R

It comes in seven different colors; Clear purple, purple, red, blue, green, yellow and silver for the Pokemon edition. Like the Game Boy Light, the Game Boy Color takes on two AA batteries. It was the final handheld to have 8-bit graphics.|$|R
