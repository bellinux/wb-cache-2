The results showed that the addition of 5. 0 wt% HSS in the RTVSR matrix noticeably improved the tensile strength. The volume resistivity of RTVSR nearly increased by one order of magnitude and the DC breakdown strength of RTVSR almost doubled when 5. 0 wt% HSS were added. In contrast, commercial fumed silica (FS) with nanometre size showed relatively weak enhancing effects on RTVSR both in mechanical and <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> performances at the same loading.

40|$|Introduction Safe {{hands-on}} defibrillation (HOD) {{will allow}} uninterrupted chest compression during defibrillation and may improve resuscitation success. We tested {{the ability of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> gloves to protect the rescuer during HOD using a ‘worst case’ electrical scenario. Materials and method Leakage current flowing from the patient to the ‘rescuer’ during antero-lateral defibrillation of patients undergoing elective cardioversion was measured. The ‘rescuer’ maintained firm (20 kgf) contact with the patient during defibrillation, wearing Class 1 <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> gloves while simulating an inadvertent contact with the patient, through an additional wired contact between ‘rescuer’ and patient. Results Data from 61 shocks from 43 different patients were recorded. The median leakage current from all defibrillations was 20. 0 ?A, (range: 2. 0 – 38. 5). In total, 18 of the shocks were delivered at 360 J and had a median leakage current of 27. 0 ?A (range: 14. 3 – 38. 5). Conclusion When using Class 1 <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> gloves for hands-on defibrillation, rescuer leakage current is significantly below the 1 mA safe threshold, allowing safe hands-on defibrillation if the rescuer makes only one other point of contact with the patient...|$|R
