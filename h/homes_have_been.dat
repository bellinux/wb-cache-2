5|$|The {{neighborhood}} once contained {{many public}} housing complexes including {{about a third}} of the nation's largest, the Robert Taylor Homes. The Taylor <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> demolished because of the socioeconomic problems that they perpetuated. The area has minimal industry or commerce at the current time. The other property on the NRHP in the area is the Schulze Baking Company Plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{was founded}} in 1970 by Brother Jerome Kelly and students of Presentation Brothers College, Cork, {{to deal with the}} social issues of the time. As it gathered momentum, other schools in Cork joined, and today students from 18 secondary schools collaborate in organising every aspect of the charity. Since its founding, over 200 custom-built <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> provided by the organisation.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment is {{underway}} {{for some of}} the abandoned industrial facilities, with the abandoned Oliver Corporation buildings being the most recent example of reclaimed property. The city also faced programs with large swaths of vacant housing after the decline of the manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant or abandoned. However, the city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairing, or some other satisfactory means. As of June 2015, 828 <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners.|$|E
50|$|By early 2006, only {{a handful}} of <b>homes</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> restored. Some two-story <b>homes</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> reoccupied on the second floor while the first floor was gutted and renovated.|$|R
25|$|By 5 July, an {{estimated}} 35,000 people in streets containing 17,000 <b>homes</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> affected by flooding in Hull {{and by the}} next day more than 10,000 <b>homes</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> evacuated. Hull City Council estimated repair costs at £200million.|$|R

5|$|In 1916, mining {{operations}} in Silver Reef resumed {{under the direction}} of Alex Colbath, who organized the area's mines into the Silver Reef Consolidated Mining Company. These mines were purchased by American Smelting and Refining Company in 1928, but the company did minimal work {{as a result of the}} Great Depression. The Western Gold & Uranium Corporation purchased Silver Reef's mines in 1948, and in 1951, they began mining uranium in the area. These operations did not last long either, and the Western Gold & Uranium Corporation sold their mines to the 5M Corporation in 1979. Today, the Wells Fargo office, the Cosmopolitan Restaurant, the Rice Building, and numerous foundations and walls remain in the town site, and a few dozen <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> constructed in the area.|$|E
5|$|Poorly {{developed}} handicraft {{and limited}} resources for metal working {{are characteristic of}} the communities of all early Slavic cultures. There were no major iron production centers, but metal founding techniques were known; among the metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks, as well as bronze decorative items (as {{can be found in}} 7th-century finds in Haćki, Bielsk Podlaski County, a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements). The inventories of the typical small open settlements also normally include various utensils made of stone, horn and clay (including weights used for weaving). The settlements were arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys, but above their flood levels, they were usually irregular and typically faced south. The wooden frame or pillar-supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each sides of 2.5 to 4.5 meters in length. Fertile lowlands were sought, but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional sustenance. The settlements were self-sufficient; the early Slavs functioned without significant long-distance trade. Potter's wheels were used from the turn of the 7th century on. Some villages larger than a few <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> discovered in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region from the 6th to 9th century, for example a complex of 11 settlements on the left bank of the Vistula in the direction of Igołomia. The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine, because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood, leather or fabrics. Free- standing clay dome stoves for bread baking have been found on some locations. Another large 6th– to 9th-century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of Głogów in Silesia.|$|E
25|$|Sears homes can {{be found}} across the {{continental}} United States. While sold primarily to East Coast and Midwest states, Sears <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> located {{as far south as}} Florida and as far west as California.

60|$|The first {{paper of}} the Chimney-Corner, as was most meet and fitting, {{was given to}} those homes made sacred and venerable by the cross of martyrdom,--by the chrism of a great sorrow. That Chimney-Corner made bright by home firelight seemed a fitting place for a solemn act of reverent sympathy for the homes by whose {{darkness}} our <b>homes</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> preserved bright, by whose emptiness our <b>homes</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> kept full, by whose losses our <b>homes</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> enriched; and so we ventured with trembling to utter these words of sympathy and cheer to those whom God had chosen to this great sacrifice of sorrow.|$|R

25|$|It {{should be}} noted however that due to Telstra's {{extensive}} use of pair-gain technology for connecting home landlines from 1994 to 2000, some <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> excluded from ADSL and are limited to a dialup speed of 28.8 kbit/s.|$|E
25|$|Four {{of these}} homes were turned into The Inn on Ferry Street, a {{successful}} bed and breakfast, others are now residential.

25|$|Similar {{to a plan}} in Detroit, Flint is in {{the process}} of tearing down {{thousands}} of abandoned homes in order to create available real estate. As of June 2009, approximately 1,100 <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> demolished in Flint, with one official estimating another 3,000 more will have to be torn down.|$|E

25|$|Before courtyards, open {{fires were}} kept burning {{in a central}} place within a home, with only a small hole in the ceiling {{overhead}} to allow smoke to escape. Over time, these small openings were enlarged and {{eventually led to the}} development of the centralized open courtyard we know today. Courtyard <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> designed and built throughout the world with many variations.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the recent}} {{building}} development (1980 and onwards) on the island does fit as nicely in the landscape as the earlier style of whitewashed raised gable cottages. Many holiday <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> built {{but many of these}} houses have been built in prominent scenic areas and have damaged traditional views of the island while lying empty for most of the year.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{approximately}} 150 homes initially built by Walter L.

25|$|Originating in 1991 with a Charlotte, North Carolina home built {{entirely by}} {{a crew of}} female volunteers, Habitat's Women Build program {{encourages}} women {{to make a difference}} by building homes and communities.

Globally, more than1,400 <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> completed by Women Build volunteers.|$|E
25|$|The {{housing stock}} in the area is {{substantially}} constructed before 1914. Of these, the original single- family <b>homes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> substantially demolished {{to make way for}} the waves of redevelopment as multi-unit structures, commercial structures, and cultural and educational-related structures were erected. Some pockets of single-family homes remain, notably in the eastern section with the East Ferry Avenue Historic District, the homes near Dunbar Hospital, and just south of the University-Cultural Center (but within Midtown), Brush Park. In the west, the West Canfield Historic District stands as the single contiguous block of early homes in the area. Other single-family homes exist individually.|$|E
