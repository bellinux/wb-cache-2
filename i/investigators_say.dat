50|$|A {{fighting}} doctor from Seoul, Korea, {{holding her}} head {{while on a}} plane thinking, why me? Her left hand trembles and {{is said to be}} able to kill anyone who touches it. When her hand trembles in the operating room, patients often plead for their lives. Because of this, she has the misfortune of being called a quack, even though she is a skilled surgeon. Due to her bold, free-spirited nature, she did not get along with her conservative parents and left to study abroad: she has not returned to her homeland. Mihee's an avid traveler, but when she wnet to visit some relatives in Japan, their dojo was closed and they were in prison...

5000|$|In February 2011, the {{findings}} of a 10-month-long study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), aimed to identify the main cause of sudden acceleration in Toyota and Lexus models. The study was requested by the U.S. Congress and [...] "enlisted NASA engineers with expertise in areas such as computer controlled electronic systems, electromagnetic interference and software integrity". The most common problem was drivers hitting the accelerator pedal when they thought they were hitting the brake, which the NHTSA called [...] "pedal misapplication.” Of the 58 cases reported, 18 were dismissed out of hand. Of the remaining 40, 39 of them were found to have no cause; the remainder being an instance of “pedal entrapment.” One <b>investigator</b> <b>says</b> most of the cases involved “pedal misapplication” - that is, “the driver stepped on the gas rather than the brake or in addition to the brake.” The report concluded that the two mechanical safety defects that were originally identified by NHTSA are known causes of dangerous unintended acceleration.|$|R
5000|$|Part Three {{describes}} {{the invention of}} the neuroleptic drug chlorpromazine (Thorazine) by Rhône-Poulenc in France, and its purchase by Smith, Kline & French (today known as GlaxoSmithKline).

5000|$|Perfect {{crime is}} a colloquial term used {{in law and}} fiction (especially crime fiction) to {{characterize}} crimes that are undetected, unattributed to a perpetrator, or else unsolved {{as a kind of}} technical achievement {{on the part of the}} perpetrator. In certain contexts, the concept of perfect crime is limited to just undetected crimes; if an event is ever identified as a crime, some <b>investigators</b> <b>say</b> it cannot be called [...] "perfect".|$|E
60|$|Students of metaphysics have of late years {{defined the}} abuse of their science as the {{morphology}} of common opinion. Contemporary <b>investigators,</b> they <b>say,</b> have been too much occupied with introspection; their labors have become merely physiologico-biographical, and they have greatly neglected the study of averages. For, says La Rochefoucauld, Il est plus aisé de connoître lhomme en général que de connoître un homme en particulier; and on so wide a subject all views must be one-sided.|$|R
50|$|In July 2007, {{the investigative}} weekly Tehelka {{reported}} that in a confession by militant Talwinder Singh Parmar to the Punjab police days before his death on October 15, 1992, he had identified Lakhbir as the mastermind behind the Air India 182 (Kanishka) bombing on June 23, 1985.

50|$|On March 15, 2008, a crane {{owned by}} New York Crane & Equipment {{collapsed}} during construction. Seven {{people were killed}} and 24 others were injured. It was a luffing-jib tower crane manufactured by Favco that was 200 feet tall {{at the time of the}} collapse. The accident occurred when workers were attaching a new steel collar to anchor it to the building at the 18th floor, as part of an operation to extend the crane upwards. <b>Investigators</b> <b>say</b> the prime suspect is a $50 piece of nylon that broke while lifting a six-ton piece of steel.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, an Australian anarchist {{claimed to}} be acting on the 'Part 10' part of [...] "Assassination Politics".

This story was written by Jim Hughes.|$|R
5000|$|Psychical {{researcher}} Frank Podmore {{proposed the}} 'naughty little girl' theory for poltergeist cases (many {{of which have}} seemed to centre around an adolescent, usually a girl). He found that {{the centre of the}} disturbance was often a child who was throwing objects around to fool or scare people for attention. Skeptical <b>investigator</b> Joe Nickell <b>says</b> that claimed poltergeist incidents typically originate from [...] "an individual who is motivated to cause mischief". According to Nickell: ...|$|R
500|$|A {{civil lawsuit}} was filed by Jordan Chandler {{and his parents}} on September 14, 1993. In late 1993, {{district}} attorneys in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties both convened grand juries to assess whether criminal charges should be filed against Jackson. By January 1, 1994, $2 million had been spent by prosecution departments in California and the grand juries had questioned 200 witnesses, but Jordan's allegations could not be corroborated. On January 4, 1994, Chandler's attorney, Larry Feldman, filed a motion for the photos from Jackson's December 1993 body search from <b>investigators,</b> <b>saying</b> Jackson's attorneys and the L.A. district attorney had refused to give him copies. A few weeks later, Feldman petitioned the court {{that he should be}} allowed access to Jackson's finances over concerns that the singer's wealth would give him an unfair advantage in court. One adviser to Jackson stated, [...] "You can take pictures of Michael's dick and he's not gonna like it, but once you start {{trying to figure out how}} much money he has, that's where he stops playing around." [...] Initially Jackson and his lawyers filed a motion for Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman to postpone the civil case until the criminal investigation was concluded. Feldman filed a counter-motion, saying the delay would hurt Jordan's chances for recovery and make it more difficult to gather evidence. It is legal to postpone a civil lawsuit past the criminal statute of limitations as a lawsuit can still be filed past that date, such as the case of Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court. Also, the constitutional right to a [...] "speedy trial" [...] only applies to criminal cases according to the Sixth Amendment, not civil cases.|$|R
