2500|$|Another {{old design}} is the {{shoulder}} vise. The {{best thing about}} this design {{is that it allows}} clamping directly behind the screw. This yields unobstructed vertical clamping for cutting dovetails and similar operations. There is also typically a little play in the screw/jaw attachment that provides for clamping of tapered work. This is one vise that should be designed into the bench from the beginning, as it is difficult to retrofit into an existing bench. The primary drawback of the shoulder vise is its fragility, unless the [...] "arm" [...] is attached to the [...] "end cap" [...] using a dovetail or <b>finger</b> <b>joint,</b> usually glued or [...] "pinned" [...] to eliminate rotative movement about the joint, otherwise it is fairly easy to break it with a big steel bench screw. But one should never really have to put that much force on it. Some woodworkers say that the big vise {{gets in the way of}} some jobs, others find it unobtrusive. Implicit in a shoulder vise is an integral planing stop, formed by the intersection of the jaw and the jaw spacer, and which allows the shoulder vise to perform multiple duties, such as jointing long boards with a [...] "bench slave" [...] to hold the opposite end. In earlier times, a crochet and a holdfast would perform the same function.|$|E

40|$|SummaryA {{total of}} 119 {{patients}} {{were included in}} a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial {{in order to assess}} the S/DMOAD properties in OA of chondroitin sulfate (CS 4 & 6, 3 × 400 mg/day, CondrosulfR IBSA, Lugano, CH). Posteranterior roentgenographies of the interphalangeal (IP) joints were carried out {{at the start of the}} study and at yearly intervals. This enabled the investigators to document the radiological progression of the anatomical lesions in the pathological <b>finger</b> <b>joints</b> over a 3 -year period. It was shown that the progression of OA in the IP <b>finger</b> <b>joints</b> in an individual can be determined by the evolution of his <b>finger</b> <b>joints</b> through previously described anatomical phases: ‘N’ (not affected), ‘S’ (classical OA), ‘J’ (loss of joint space), ‘E’ (erosive OA) and ‘R’ (remodeled joint). Structure/disease-modifying anti-OA drug (S/DMOAD) properties were searched for by assaying the number of patients developing OA in previously normal IP joints (‘N’>‘S’), or progressing through the described anatomical phases of the disease (‘S’>‘J’, ‘S’>‘E’, ‘J’>‘E’, ‘S’>‘R’, ‘J’>‘R’, ‘E’>‘R’). In the CS 4 & 6 group we observed a significant decrease in the number of patients with new ‘erosive’ OA <b>finger</b> <b>joints.</b> This result is particularly important since OA of the <b>finger</b> <b>joints</b> becomes a clinical problem (pain, functional loss) when ‘S’ joints progress to ‘J’ and especially ‘E’ phases During and after these ‘E’ phases, joints will remodel and show the nodular deformities characteristic of Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes.

Each hand configuration generates a set ofimages through the detection of the borders of the occlusion of the finger’s joint. The estimation of eachimage is calculated by finding the state vector that better fits to the measured characteristics.The finger joints have the added 21 states more than the rigid body movement of the palms; this meansthat the cost computational of the estimation is increased.

5000|$|Pruning, as a {{silvicultural}} practice, {{refers to}} {{the removal of the}} lower branches of the young trees (also giving the shape to the tree) so clear knot-free wood can subsequently grow over the branch stubs. Clear knot-free lumber has a higher value. Pruning has been extensively carried out in the Radiata pine plantations of New Zealand and Chile, however the development of <b>Finger</b> <b>joint</b> technology in the production of lumber and mouldings has led to many forestry companies reconsidering their pruning practices. [...] "Brashing" [...] is an alternative name for the same process.Pruning can be done to all trees, or more cost effectively to a limited number of trees. There are two types of pruning: natural or self-pruning and artificial pruning. Most cases of self-pruning happen when branches do not receive enough sunlight and die. Wind can also take part in natural pruning which can break branches. Artificial pruning is where people are paid to come and cut the branches. Or it can be natural, where trees are planted close enough that the effect is to cause self-pruning of low branches as energy is put into growing up for light reasons and not branchiness.|$|E
