5|$|In 431 BC, while peace {{already was}} precarious, ArchidamusII, Sparta's king, sent a new {{delegation}} to Athens, {{demanding that the}} Athenians submit to Sparta's demands. This <b>deputation</b> {{was not allowed to}} enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan <b>deputation</b> would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded Attica, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.|$|E
5|$|Kruger and the volksraad {{resolved}} to send yet another <b>deputation</b> to London to renegotiate the Pretoria Convention and settle the western border issue. The third <b>deputation,</b> comprising Kruger, Smit and Du Toit with Jan Eloff as secretary, left the Transvaal in August 1883 and sailed from Cape Town two months later. Kruger {{spent part of}} the voyage to Britain studying the English language with a Bible printed in Dutch and English side by side. Talks with the new Colonial Secretary Lord Derby and Robinson progressed smoothly—apart from an incident when Kruger, thinking himself insulted, nearly punched Robinson—and on 27 February 1884 the London Convention, superseding that of Pretoria, was concluded. Britain ended its suzerainty, reduced the Transvaal's national debt and once again recognised the country as the South African Republic. The western border question remained unresolved, but Kruger still considered the convention a triumph.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his term}} in office Lang led a <b>deputation</b> from several church groups to the Ministry of Education, to present a five-point plan for the {{teaching}} of religion in state schools. These points were eventually embodied in the 1944 Education Act.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>deputations</b> were {{indirectly}} {{elected by}} local councillors from municipalities in each judicial district. Seats were allocated to provincial <b>deputations</b> {{based on the}} following scale: ...|$|R
50|$|There are provincial <b>deputations</b> in {{the provinces}} of the {{autonomous}} communities of Galicia, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencian Community, Castile and León, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, and Andalusia. Basque Country have {{what are known as}} diputaciones forales (chartered <b>deputations),</b> while in the Canary and Balearic Islands there are cabildos (councils) and consejos insulares (island councils) which perform functions similar to those of provincial <b>deputations.</b> Autonomous communities with only one province (Asturias, Cantabria, Community of Madrid, Murcia and La Rioja) and the Foral Community of Navarre, do not have <b>deputations</b> as the government of the region handles all such functions.|$|R
50|$|Provincial <b>deputations</b> {{were the}} {{governing}} bodies of provinces in Spain, having an administration role of municipal activities and {{composed of a}} provincial president, an administrative body, and a plenary. Basque provinces had foral <b>deputations</b> instead—called Juntas Generales—, whereas <b>deputations</b> for single-province autonomous communities were abolished: their functions transferred to the corresponding regional parliaments. For insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, <b>deputations</b> were replaced by island councils {{in each of the}} islands or group of islands. For Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza-Formentera this figure was referred to in Spanish as consejo insular (consell insular, whereas for Gran Canaria, Tenerife, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma its name was cabildo insular.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, the workhouse {{proposal}} was seen, by the City of London Lord Mayor's <b>deputation</b> and the City Lands Committee (Taylor {{was a member of}} both), as impractical and alternate schemes were proposed. In 1832, Warren Stormes Hale, who believed that the Workhouse proposal was not the best use of Carpenter's legacy, was appointed to the City Lands Committee. He became chairman of the committee in 1833, and would come to be considered the second founder of the City of London School, after Carpenter.|$|E
5|$|Recruitment itself {{continued}} {{at a steady}} pace, and the Romanian General Staff created Biroul A. B ("T and B Bureau") to keep evidence of Austro-Hungarian abjurers, on and behind the front. Its founding members were three Sub-lieutenants: Deleu, Vasile Osvadă, Leonte Silion. Biroul A. B. was assisted by a Consultative Commission of intellectuals and politicians of Transylvanian or Bukovinan backgrounds (Goga, Ion Nistor, Leonte Moldovan) and represented in Russia itself by a <b>deputation</b> of Transylvanian officers—Elie Bufnea, Victor Cădere.|$|E
5|$|According to Meintjes, Kruger {{was still}} not {{particularly}} anti-British; he thought the British {{had made a mistake}} and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second <b>deputation</b> to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E

5000|$|On July 28-29, 2011, the {{executive}} committee of Toronto City Council heard <b>deputations</b> by 169 Torontonians on {{the hundreds of millions}} of dollars in budget cuts suggested by KPMG consultants. Mammoliti claimed there were [...] "very few" [...] worthwhile <b>deputations</b> and described the event as a [...] "socialist party".|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy not. Already several <b>deputations</b> {{have come}} in from the tribesmen, some of them {{bringing}} in the fines imposed upon them; and all seem {{to say that there is}} a general desire among the Afridis for peace, and that <b>deputations</b> from other tribes will shortly follow them." ...|$|R
5|$|At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, {{many of them}} {{bearing the}} republic's vierkleur ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, {{independent}} republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first <b>deputation</b> in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Athens orchestrated the {{creation}} of an alliance with Euboea, Megara, Achaea, Corinth, Acarnania and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a <b>deputation,</b> but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes's allegiance.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 284–285; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42. Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes's control of Boeotia was recognised, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, a <b>deputation</b> led by Lord Shaftesbury {{was made}} to the Great Eastern Railway and Great Northern Railway, proposing that for trains due to arrive in central London prior to 8am, third class tickets should be sold at a fare of 3d {{providing}} the return journey was not made before 4pm. By May 1885 both railways had adopted this policy. However, the delays and uncertainty caused by the fares dispute had discouraged prospective tenants, leaving large numbers of properties vacant and causing further building work to slow considerably. In 1887, construction work was temporarily suspended altogether, {{in response to the}} large backlog of un-let properties.|$|E

5|$|In April 1903 a {{petition}} objecting to {{the renewal of}} alcohol licences for local inns, signed by 450 people, {{was presented to the}} Brewsters sessions (magistrates court meetings in England where pub licences were renewed or granted). A <b>deputation</b> sent to the session explained that the number of licensed houses was too large in proportion to the population. In 1917, the cattle market moved from the Higher Bullring to a field near the station. The first cinema was opened in the Victoria Hall in 1918 by Bill Terry and in 1977 the town was twinned with Ploudalmézeau in Brittany, France.|$|E
5|$|In May 1162, Hilary {{was part}} of the <b>deputation</b> sent to the monks of Christ Church Priory by King Henry II to secure the {{election}} of Thomas Becket as the next Archbishop of Canterbury. When Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of Hereford, objected to Becket's candidacy, Hilary took the position that the king desired the election, so the bishops and electors should elect the king's choice. When it was suggested that a monk should hold Canterbury, as had been the custom previously, Hilary asked if the questioners thought that only one way of life was satisfactory to God.|$|E
5|$|In late 1164 Roger led a <b>deputation</b> from Henry II that {{visited the}} papal court, or curia, {{to try to}} persuade Alexander III that any {{decision}} on the deposition of Becket should take place in England under a papal legate, rather than in Rome. While Becket was in exile, Roger also managed to secure papal permission for archbishops of York to carry their cross in front of them anywhere in England, a right that had long been a bone of contention between Canterbury and York. Later, the pope rescinded the permission, but consistently refused to give primacy to either Canterbury or York in their struggles.|$|E

50|$|The 1983 Spanish local {{elections}} were held on Sunday, 8 May 1983, to elect all 67,505 councillors in the 7,781 municipalities of Spain and all 1,024 seats in 38 provincial <b>deputations,</b> {{as well as}} 153 seats in the 3 foral <b>deputations</b> of the Basque Country and 191 seats in the 10 island councils in the Balearic and Canary Islands.|$|R
5|$|In late 1859 Pretorius {{was invited}} to stand for President in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly {{as a means to}} {{overcome}} the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year's leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for Bloemfontein, appointing Johannes Hermanus Grobler to be Acting President in his absence. Pretorius was sworn in as President of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a <b>deputation</b> to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day.|$|E
5|$|Kruger was {{appointed}} Vice-President in March 1877, {{shortly before the}} South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. Over {{the next three years}} he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned and became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the First Boer War of 1880–81. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President. In 1884 he headed a third <b>deputation</b> that brokered the London Convention, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a fully independent state.|$|E
5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's claims that he had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria and responded to this insult by slaughtering the <b>deputation</b> of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E

50|$|The 1979 Spanish local {{elections}} were held on Tuesday, 3 April 1979, to elect all 67,505 councillors in the 7,870 municipalities of Spain and all 1,152 seats in 43 provincial <b>deputations,</b> {{as well as}} 298 seats in the 4 foral <b>deputations</b> of the Basque Country and Navarre and 186 seats in the 10 island councils in the Balearic and Canary Islands.|$|R
5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a <b>deputation</b> of market-women into the palace to see the king. A group of six women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women {{to the point that}} one of them fainted at his feet. After this brief but pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse some food from the royal stores, with more promised, and some in the crowd felt that their goals had been satisfactorily met. As rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), many Poles {{believed}} that revolutionary France, whose public opinion was very {{sympathetic to the}} ideals of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, would come to Poland's aid. France's enemies included Poland's partitioners, Prussia, Austria and Imperial Russia. Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the claim to be the Polish government-in-exile, the <b>Deputation</b> (Deputacja) of Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski and the Agency (Agencja) of Józef Wybicki. Many Polish soldiers, officers and volunteers therefore emigrated, especially to Italy and to France. Eventually, the Agency was successful in convincing the French government (the Directory) to organize a Polish military unit. As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil, the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy, the Cisalpine Republic.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January 1275 Burnell {{was elected}} to the see of Bath and Wells. He {{received}} the temporalities of the see on 19 March 1275 and was consecrated on 7 April 1275. Three years later Edward once more tried to secure the see of Canterbury for his favourite. Burnell {{was elected to}} the archbishopric in June or July 1278, but the election was quashed by Pope Nicholas III in January 1279. King Edward sent a <b>deputation,</b> including the eventual appointee, John Peckham, to secure Nicholas' confirmation of the election. The pope named three cardinals as investigators, and then appointed Peckham instead. The bishop's second failure to obtain the archbishopric was probably a consequence of his lifestyle, which included keeping a mistress. Edward made one final attempt to promote his friend to a wealthier see in early 1280, when Burnell was nominated to become Bishop of Winchester, but Pope Nicholas III quashed the election on 28 June 1280.|$|E
