Mr George Rohrs, secretary to the Clock Tower trustees, 3 October 1836 On the opening day of the Clock Tower, 2 October 1837, there was a festival, followed by annual commemoration festivals which may also have been funded by Mrs Thwaytes. There is a blue plaque, recording that she funded the Clock Tower, at Central Parade, Herne Bay.|$|E

[...] The reviewer judges that [...] "Probably we shall not wrong the cultivated annalist of Selborne by giving {{the first place to}} Bewick." [...] However, comparing them as people, [...] "Bewick has not the slightest claim to rank with Gilbert White as a naturalist. White was what Bewick never was, a man of science; but, if no naturalist, Bewick was a lover of nature, a careful observer, and a faithful copier of her ever-varying forms. In this, and in this alone, lies his charm." ...|$|E

6000|$|If I {{should go}} {{about to tell}} the reader by what {{accident}} I became master of these papers, it would, in this unbelieving age, pass for {{little more than the}} cant or jargon of the trade. I therefore gladly spare both him and myself so unnecessary a trouble. There yet remains a difficult question--why I published them no sooner? I forbore upon two accounts. First, because I thought I had better work upon my hands; and secondly, because I was not without some hope of hearing from the Author and receiving his directions. But I have been lately alarmed with intelligence of a surreptitious copy which a certain great wit had new polished and refined, or, as our present writers express themselves, [...] "fitted to the humour of the age," [...] as they have already done with great felicity to Don Quixote, Boccalini, La Bruyere, and other authors. However, I thought it fairer dealing to offer the whole work in its naturals.

60|$|P. 52 I {{find him}} express it thus: 'These natural notions {{are not so}} {{imprinted}} upon the soul as that they naturally and necessarily exert themselves (even in children and idiots) without any assistance from the outward senses, or {{without the help of}} some previous cultivation.' Here, he says, they 'exert themselves,' as p. 78, that the 'soul exerts them.' When he has explained to himself or others what he means by 'the soul's exerting innate notions,' or their 'exerting themselves;' and what that 'previous cultivation and circumstances' in order to their being exerted are--he will I suppose find there is so little of controversy between him and me on the point, bating that he calls that 'exerting of notions' which I in a more vulgar style call 'knowing,' that I have reason to think he brought in my name on this occasion only out of the pleasure he has to speak civilly of me; which I must <b>gratefully</b> <b>acknowledge</b> he has done everywhere he mentions me, not without conferring on me, as some others have done, a title I have no right to.|$|E

6000|$|... "You smile? It {{would have}} been more kind to spare my blushes. But {{as a matter of fact}} I need not blush. This is not vanity; it is analysis. We'll let sagacity stand. But we must also note what sagacity in this {{connection}} stands for. When you see this you shall see also that there was nothing in it to alarm my modesty. I don't think Mrs Fyne credited me with the possession of wisdom tempered by common sense. And had I had the wisdom of the Seven Sages of Antiquity, she would not have been moved to confidence or admiration. The secret scorn of women for the capacity to consider judiciously and to express profoundly a meditated conclusion is unbounded. They have no use for these lofty exercises which they look upon as a sort of purely masculine game--game meaning a respectable occupation devised to kill time in this man-arranged life which must be got through somehow. What women's acuteness really respects are the inept `ideas' and the sheep-like impulses by which our actions and opinions are determined in matters of real importance. For if women are not rational they are indeed acute. Even Mrs Fyne was acute. The good woman was making up to her husband's chess-player simply because she had scented in him that small portion of `femininity,' that drop of superior essence of which I am myself aware; which, I <b>gratefully</b> <b>acknowledge,</b> has saved me from one or two misadventures in my life either ridiculous or lamentable, I am not very certain which. It matters very little. Anyhow misadventures. Observe that I say `femininity,' a privilege--not `feminism,' an attitude. I am not a feminist. It was Fyne who on certain solemn grounds had adopted that mental attitude; but it was enough to glance at him sitting on one side, to see that he was purely masculine to his finger-tips, masculine solidly, densely, amusingly,--hopelessly." ...|$|E
6000|$|There is a {{diversion}} in this City, which usually begins among the butchers, but is often continued by {{a succession of}} other people, through many streets. It is called the COSSING of a dog; and I may justly number it among our corruptions. The ceremony is this: A strange dog happens to pass through a flesh-market; whereupon an expert butcher immediately cries in a loud voice, and the proper tone, [...] "Coss, coss," [...] several times: The same word is repeated by the people. The dog, who perfectly understands the terms of art, and consequently the danger he is in, immediately flies. The people, and even his own brother animals pursue; the pursuit and cry attend him perhaps half a mile; he is well worried in his flight, and sometimes hardly escapes. This, our ill-wishers of the Jacobite kind, are pleased to call a persecution; and affirm, that it always falls upon dogs of the Tory principle. But, we can well defend ourselves, by justly alleging that when they were uppermost, they treated our dogs full as inhumanly: As to my own part, who have in former times often attended these processions, although I can very well distinguish between a Whig and Tory dog, yet I never carried my resentments very far upon a party principle, except it were against certain malicious dogs, who most discovered their malice against us in the worst of times.[176] And, I remember too well, that in the wicked ministry of the Earl of Oxford, a large mastiff of our party being unmercifully cossed, ran, without thinking, between my legs, as I was coming up Fishamble Street; and, as I am of low stature, with very short legs, bore me riding backwards down the hill, for above two hundred yards: And, although I made use of his tail for a bridle, holding it fast with both my hands, and clung my legs as close to his sides as I could, yet we both came down together {{into the middle of}} the kennel; where after rolling three or four times over each other, I got up with much ado, amid the shouts and huzzas of a thousand malicious Jacobites: I cannot, indeed, but <b>gratefully</b> <b>acknowledge,</b> that for this and many other services and sufferings, I have been since more than over-paid.|$|E
