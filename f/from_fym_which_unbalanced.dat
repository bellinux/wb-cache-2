40|$|Predicting N {{mineralization}} from {{organic manures}} like farmyard manure (FYM) {{is more difficult}} than from fresh organic materials like crop residues, as the manures vary greatly in composition. A laboratory incubation experiment was carried out for 98 days at 30 °C under aerobic conditions to study the effects on N dynamics of Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium, Jacquin) and FYM application to soil at 5 and 10 gkg. Application of Gliricidia induced N mineralization {{from the start of}} incubation period, with the amount of N mineralized increasing with rate of application. In contrast, application of FYM resulted in immobilization of mineral N in soil, irrespective of the rate of application. The initial net immobilization <b>from</b> <b>FYM</b> was limited by availability of N in the soil for the higher rate of application. We used the APSIM SoilN module to simulate these contrasting patterns of mineralization of N from Gliricidia and <b>from</b> <b>FYM.</b> The prediction of N mineralized from Gliricidia was better than FYM. The default model parameters specify that the fresh organic matter pools (FPOOL 1, FPOOL 2 and FPOOL 3) have the same C:N ratio and this assumption was ineffective in predicting N mineralized <b>from</b> <b>FYM.</b> The predictive ability of the model improved when this default assumption was modified based {{on the size of the}} individual pools (FPOOL 1, FPOOL 2 and FPOOL 3), and the pool 2 ̆ 7 s C:N ratios. The modelling efficiency, a measure of goodness of fit between the simulated and observed data, improved markedly for the modified model. The discrepancy between the modelled and observed data was a tendency for the model to underestimate the rate of re-mineralization at the lower rate of application of FYM in the later part of incubation. Unfortunately the appropriate modification to the size and C:N ratios of the FPOOLs could not be determined on the basis of chemical analysis alone. Thus, a true predictive application of the model to a new FYM material is not yet possible...|$|R

30|$|In this study, the {{combined}} application organic and mineral fertilizers resulted in similar yields to the RNP from mineral fertilizers. The yield of malting barley and its components were substantially improved with all integrated uses of mineral and organic amendments. Combined applications of mineral and organic fertilizers from either compost or FYM at {{a ratio of}} 1 : 1 or 1 : 1 : 1 gave superior grain and biomass yield advantages as compared to sole application of organic amendments, either <b>from</b> compost or <b>FYM</b> or their combinations (Tables  5 and 6).

The corresponding increments in biomass yields were 17 (1613), 17 (1645) and 51 % (3770  kg ha− 1), respectively. Similarly, application of 50 % RNP from mineral fertilizers +  50 % <b>from</b> <b>FYM</b> resulted in grain yield advantages of 15 (566), 12 (465) and 32 % (1034  kg ha− 1) as compared to application of RNP <b>from</b> <b>FYM,</b> 1 : 1 ratio of compost and FYM, and the control treatment, respectively. The corresponding increments in biomass yields were 28 (2382), 14 (1364) and 47 % (3489  kg ha− 1), respectively. This implied that the integrated use of organic and mineral fertilizers resulted in yield benefits greater than using them alone. Similar results were also reported on barley (Agegnehu et al. 2016 a; Assefa 2015), wheat (Demelash et al. 2014; Getachew et al. 2014 b), teff (Getachew et al. 2014 b), maize (Mahmood et al. 2017; Wakene et al. 2005), Okra (Afe and Oluleye 2017) and tomato (Rajaie and Tavakoly 2016).

Wheat (variety: Ghaznavi) was planted in rows. Data on biological, grain and straw yields of wheat were recorded. Samples of grain and straw were also analyzed for total N to determine its uptake by the crop.

The next higher yield was obtained in treatment receiving N from the two sources in 50 : 50 ratio.

Similarly, the N uptake in grain (47. 66 kg ha- 1) and straw (19. 28 kg ha- 1) was also significantly (P< 0. 05) greater in treatments receiving 75 or 50 % N from urea and 25 or 50 % <b>from</b> <b>FYM.</b> The data on crop yields and N uptake in response to integrated use of urea and FYM supported each other.

Treatments were farmyard manure (FYM) applied at rates of between 6 and 24 tonne ha? 1 annually or every third year, inorganic fertilizers giving equivalent amounts of N, P and K, and lime applied either alone or with FYM applied annually or three-yearly. Annual FYM at 24 tonne ha? 1 reduced species-richness and the richness of positive indicator species at all sites and increased the proportional cover of nutrient-demanding species, whilst liming in conjunction with 12 tonne ha? 1 annual FYM application was equally detrimental at the unimproved site in Wales but not in Cumbria.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} influence of soil organic amendments on the sorption properties of the fungicide thiram. The organic amendments studied were organic household compost (COM), sewage sludge from municipal water treatment facilities (SLU) and farmyard manure (<b>FYM),</b> <b>which</b> were compared to mineral fertilizer application (MIN). Sorption-desorption experiments were performed using the batch method and the results indicated that the adsorption isotherms were non-linear and were found to conform to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model, suggesting multilayer adsorption and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions after the saturation of the surface layer. In general, distribution coefficient values, K(D), are dependent on, but not proportional to, the initial concentration of thiram. For a fixed thiram initial concentration, a significant correlation (r(2) > 0. 851 : p < 0. 001) between K(D) values and the soil organic carbon content (OC) was observed. The highest value of K(D) was observed for the soil amended with compost, which is the one with the highest organic carbon content. K(D) values were divided by the soil organic carbon contents in order to obtain organic carbon partition coefficients K(oc). Comparing Koc means from 3 (initial concentrations) x 4 (soil organic matter compositions) x 3 (replicates) factorial ANOVA allow us to conclude that there is a significant but not proportional influence of the initial concentration of thiram on those values, but changes in the soil organic matter composition, associated to different soil amendments, have no significant influence on adsorption of thiram. To evaluate the reversibility of thiram adsorption, two consecutive desorption cycles were performed with CaCI(2) 0. 01 mol L(- 1). The desorption K(D) values were consistently higher (approximately twice) than those for adsorption at the same equilibrium concentrations for all soil samples supporting the existence of hysteresis in the adsorption-desorption behavior of thiram. Despite the fact that the adsorption K(D) values were proportionally increased with increasing total organic carbon content, {{this was not the case}} for the desorption K(D) values.

Specially designed small-size MOSFETs in <b>which</b> the <b>unbalanced</b> behavior is enhanced by adjusting the geometrical gate structures were fabricated, and their switching characteristics were evaluated. It {{was found that the}} same switching characteristics can be obtained by regarding them as MOSFETs with high inner gate resistances. A 1 -cm 2 SiC-MOSFET was fabricated, and high dV/dt switching and high turn-off endurance were demonstrated...|$|R

In many cases, {{malnutrition}} is associated with diarrhoea and intestinal inflammation, further contributing to morbidity and death. The mechanisms by <b>which</b> <b>unbalanced</b> dietary nutrients affect intestinal homeostasis are largely unknown. Here we report that deficiency in murine angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 2 (Ace 2), which encodes a key regulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), results in highly increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation induced by epithelial damage. The RAS is known to be involved in acute lung failure, cardiovascular functions and SARS infections. Mechanistically, ACE 2 has a RAS-independent function, regulating intestinal amino acid homeostasis, expression of antimicrobial peptides, and the ecology of the gut microbiome. Transplantation of the altered microbiota from Ace 2 mutant mice into germ-free wild-type hosts was able to transmit the increased propensity to develop severe colitis. ACE 2 -dependent changes in epithelial immunity and the gut microbiota can be directly regulated by the dietary amino acid tryptophan. Our results identify ACE 2 as a key regulator of dietary amino acid homeostasis, innate immunity, gut microbial ecology, and transmissible susceptibility to colitis. These results provide a molecular explanation for how amino acid malnutrition can cause intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea...|$|R
