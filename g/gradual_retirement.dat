5|$|In {{the nearly}} three decades since passage of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the annual demand for silver bullion rose {{steadily}} from roughly 11 million ounces (1933) to 110 million ounces (1962). The Acts of 1939 and 1946 established floor prices for silver of 71 cents and 90.5 cents (respectively) per ounce. Predicated by an anticipated shortage of silver bullion, Public Law 88-36 (PL88-36) was enacted on 4 June 1963 which repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, and the Acts of 6 July 1939 and 31 July 1946, while providing specific instruction regarding the disposition of silver held as reserves against issued certificates and the price at which silver may be sold. It also amended the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the issue of lower denomination notes (i.e., $1 and $2), allowing for the <b>gradual</b> <b>retirement</b> (or swapping out process) of $1 silver certificates and releasing silver bullion from reserve. In repealing the earlier laws, PL88-36 also repealed {{the authority of the}} Secretary of the Treasury to control the issue of silver certificates. By issuing Executive Order 11110, President John F. Kennedy was able to continue the Secretary’s authority.

40|$|The {{policy agenda}} of {{extending}} working lives requires a holistic understanding of factors underlying {{the decision of}} older workers to withdraw from work and to retire. This brief paper presents employment patterns and trends of older people across EU Member States and identifies policy initiatives that would encourage more flexible and later retirement. The descriptive empirical evidence (from the EU Labour Force Survey) indicates {{that there are a}} broad range of experiences in EU countries with respect to the employment of older workers (those aged 50 and over). Strikingly, in the majority of EU 15 countries, close to one-half of those of 50 and over are either unemployed or inactive, with reliance either on early retirement pensions or on social assistance benefits. The recent pension reforms in a number of these countries have increased the retirement age and this is likely to induce older workers to work longer. There is already some evidence that the effective retirement age is on the increase. Results suggest that the increase in older workers' employment is stronger for women than for men, and also for more highly educated. In most instances older workers either tend to be in full-time employment or inactive with very few occupying intermediate positions. Although there is some evidence of a <b>gradual</b> transition towards <b>retirement,</b> there is still a relatively minor proportion of the work force taking advantage of this, as well over 70 % of men and around 55 % of women in employment in their early 60 s worked 35 hours a week or more. The policy aim should therefore be to encourage 'flexible and later retirement'. Additional incentives need to be provided so that people are not only able to move between jobs in later working life but also able to work part-time, without losing their entitlement to benefits (such as early retirement pensions). Such policy incentives will enable workers to avoid the phenomenon of a 'cliff-edge' fall into retirement that many of them often face.

40|$|Retirement is a {{critical}} life event {{in the process of}} transition from mature adulthood into old age. Occupational scientists study how retirees experience change throughout an occupational career (Russel, 2001). The personal meaning of the experience of occupational transition between worker and retiree are of interest to this researcher. In Japan, 94 % of employers have mandatory retirement, 86 % at 60 -yearsold. 63 % of people 58 - 61 yrs. would like to continue to work even beyond the age of 65. After mandatory retirement, 40 % of employers offer some employees irregular, temporary status positions (Shigegaki, 2009). Purpose: The purpose of this in-process sub-study, part of a larger project to investigate the retirement experience and find strategies to aid occupational adaptation to the new stage in one’s life course, is to analyze the experience of retirement occupational transitions of five professionals. Methods: Four women and one man, 61 - 70 years old, participated in this research in Shizuoka, Japan. All were professionals who had experienced mandatory retirement. The participants had two to five individual interviews, totaling 5 - 10 hours. They were asked about their life history, life before and after retirement, and the experience of work and retirement. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A phenomenological approach was used to explore their occupational experience. Triangulation occurred through discussing findings with participants and interpretation with peers. Results: Retirement from work did not occur with mandatory retirement from their professional job. Four participants had post-retirement full-time jobs and one had a part time job. Their retirement experience began as workers with new, but frequently related jobs through which they recreated their identity, investing time and energy. The meaning of work had changed for them over their life. When young, work meant challenge, becoming an adult, occupational identity and social responsibility. Later, meanings of work changed to responsibility, stress, fatigue, but satisfaction. After mandatory retirement they adapted to new jobs, and experienced less stress, more enjoyment in work. They advise younger employees on how to work in and for society, using accumulated skills and wisdom in occupations as work mentors, not yet those of a traditional retiree. The continuity of their occupational careers provides a <b>gradual</b> transition in <b>retirement,</b> reducing the crisis of this life event. Limitations: This sub-study does not include non-professional retirees. Discussion Question: I describe retirement experience about my participants. Is it different from people in your society...|$|R
40|$|A decade {{into the}} Howard era, {{the battle of}} ideas was far from over, report DAVID DENEMARK, SHAUN WILSON and GABRIELLE MEAGHER in this extract from Australian Social Attitudes 2 : Citizenship, Work and Aspirations, a {{collection}} of essays based on the Australian Survey of Social Attitudes 2005 IN October 2004 John Howard’s Liberal-National government won a surprising victory over the Labor Party led by Mark Latham. The government was returned with almost 53 per cent of the two-party preferred vote, capitalising on very low unemployment and low job insecurity, a new opposition leader, and the Coalition’s claims to be the most experienced at economic management. Both leaders campaigned strongly on the theme of aspirations. Though Latham claimed that Labor best represented the aspirations and values of suburban Australia, low interest rates, a housing bubble and strong job prospects for many of Labor’s traditional working-class supporters meant it was the prime minister who secured the suburban vote. Speaking about the Liberal victory in the traditionally Labor seat centred on Blacktown in suburban Sydney, John Howard said “there is no greater metaphor for the result on 9 October 2004 than the victory that Louise Markus secured here in Greenway. ” Economic optimism had reached a record high among Australian voters; pride in Australia’s economic achievements rose from 48 per cent in 1995 (Labor’s last full year in office) to 80 per cent in 2003. The government claimed that Labor, with its preference for unionised workplaces and old industrial values, had lost all connection to the economic aspirations of middle Australia. Latham countered, offering a “ladder of opportunity” - supported by the steps of good health care and education - as an alternative way of understanding aspirations that went beyond shares, investment, and property prices. While much has been claimed about the identity - and even the existence - of an aspirational class, there has been little research into this group’s defining characteristics. Are aspirational voters disaffected Labor voters? Are they Howard’s battlers? Do they live in the outer suburbs? Fortunately, the Australian Survey of Social Social Attitudes 2005 offers the first major quantitative insight into the “aspirationals,” their identity and, most importantly, their political affiliations. Murray Goot and Ian Watson in chapter 10 of our book reach some surprising findings: on both measures of class identification and personal motivations, those who could be sensibly described as aspirational remain Labor voters. Aspirations - understood as “getting ahead” and “achieving a good standard of living” - inevitably involve our activities at work. Although unemployment is currently at a 30 -year low in Australia (less than 5 per cent), there are some significant problems in the labour market: long-term unemployment persists, working hours are too long for many, and the costs of getting training and education to improve job prospects are rising. In recent years, some new problems have emerged, including skills shortages in some industries, and competition among employers to retain skilled workers. But the most significant recent developments in Australia’s workplaces are the sweeping changes to the industrial relations system. The new WorkChoices legislation was introduced in December 2005 after the government unexpectedly won enough Senate votes to pass these laws without the need for opposition party support. Both Senate control and WorkChoices, implemented in April 2006, have proved contentious. In chapter 8 of our book Brigid van Wanrooy offers a comprehensive evaluation of public opinion towards WorkChoices. Her results suggest that although some Australians are not aware of the reforms, among those who are, the Australian Council of Trade Unions’ determined campaign appears to have won the battle of public opinion: opposition to the changes outweighs support by two to one. Van Wanrooy reveals that unfair dismissal changes and the prospect of lower minimum wages are the most unpopular elements of the reforms. Echoing commercial opinion polls, van Wanrooy finds that public opinion against WorkChoices may well prove costly to the government at the 2007 elections. One element of WorkChoices is the move towards further restricting the rights of workers to bargain collectively, and to be represented by a union in negotiations over pay and conditions. The government justifies these changes by citing declining union membership as evidence of the declining relevance of unions to Australian workers. However, claims of union irrelevance may be overstated: in chapter 9 Gabrielle Meagher and Shaun Wilson show that there is qualified but widespread support for unions among Australian workers, even among those who do not belong to them. Nearly half of those respondents who said they were not a union member (and did not want to be) agree that, without trade unions, working conditions for employees would be much worse (46 per cent) and nearly a third agree that trade unions are very important for the job security of employees (30 per cent). A minority of non-members agree that unions should have less say in how wages and conditions are set (31 per cent), and at 38 per cent, the proportion who believe unions have too much power is at the lowest level recorded in nearly 40 years of opinion surveys on the question. AuSSA data also show that a significant number of employees who are not union members would prefer to be (13 per cent), suggesting that lack of representation rather than lack of relevance is the problem. WorkChoices is part of a broader policy thrust to establish the values of individual initiative, competition and reward for effort, which we associate with the private sector, across all Australian workplaces, including the public sector. In chapter 6, Bill Martin uses the International Social Survey Program Work Orientations module fielded with the Australian Survey of Social Social Attitudes 2005 to assess whether Australian workers in different kinds of jobs and workplaces have equally taken up these competitive values. He finds that workplace cultures in the private and public sectors have not converged around a new set of norms, as measured by employees’ attitudes to their jobs and organisations. Among managers and professionals, for example, those in the public sector are more likely than those in the private sector to say that their job is useful to society and gives them the opportunity to help people, and more likely to value the intrinsic, or non-material, rewards of their work. Private sector workers overall are more likely than those in the public sector to report good relationships between management and employees, while public sector workers overall are more likely than private sector workers to be proud to work for their employing organisation. Interestingly, job security and interesting work were the most important attributes of a job for a majority of employees in all kinds of jobs and across both private and public sectors; a high income was the least important. Indeed, a majority of employees reported that they would enjoy a paid job even if they didn’t need the money. These findings suggest that work means much more to Australians than a simple, materialistic view of “aspirations” would have it. Now that most Australians undertake paid work during their adult lives, most Australians also face decisions about their retirement. In recent years, policy-makers have become anxious about population ageing, while structural change in the economy and the emergence of new technologies have changed the kinds of jobs available and the workers required to fill them. These developments have created conflicting pressures for both individual retirement plans and government policy. In chapter 7 Christine Millward and Libby Brooke examine how Australians think about retirement, and find that attitudes are shifting as economic and policy environments evolve. A majority of Australians, particularly younger people, see a <b>gradual</b> transition to <b>retirement</b> as ideal, and one in ten expects never to retire. These attitudes may be conditioned by a sense of inevitability: nearly half of all respondents think “the government wants us to work until we drop. ” Australians are willing to continue working as they age, and believe that good physical health, earning a decent income, flexible work time options, and being valued or challenged at work are most important for enabling them to do so once they reach 55 years of age. Clearly, retirement incomes are a particularly crucial concern for both individuals and governments, and Millward and Brooke find that Australians strongly support a role for the public pension system. Lack of confidence in superannuation funds might be part of the explanation here - fully 40 per cent believe that they cannot be trusted to look after contributors’ money safely. One reason why trust in superannuation funds might be low is that few Australians have the knowledge necessary to understand how financial markets work. In chapter 13 Jocelyn Pixley reports that a large majority of respondents to AuSSA 2005 report knowing little or nothing about major financial processes and institutions such as how monetary policy is set, how the share market works {{and the role of the}} Reserve Bank of Australia. Given these and other economic uncertainties, then, a large minority worry about their financial future. But this sense of foreboding does not seem to translate into risk aversion, especially among the young. Although they are more likely to worry about their future, younger respondents are also more likely to agree that they “enjoy having a wide range of choices to search constantly for the best fi nancial gain’, and that borrowing and taking financial risks are hard to avoid these days. Money is one resource Australians must acquire and manage; time is another that can seem particularly scarce in families with children. In chapter 11 Mark Western, Janeen Baxter and Jenny Chesters assess how Australian families are managing the competing demands of paid work and family life. They find that time pressures are acute, particularly as women’s commitments to paid work outside the home grow. In many families, whether mothers are working full-time or part-time, there is a sense that the obligations of paid work and/or housework impinge on family time and leisure. And there is evidence that these obligations are affecting happiness - respondents who say they would prefer to spend less time in paid work are more likely to be unhappy. Families make decisions about how they will manage their obligations in a context shaped by government policies on industrial relations, on income support, and on social service provision. As we already discussed, the Howard government has made some profound changes to industrial relations policy. Developments in social policy have not been quite so extensive, but are significant nevertheless. Some programs, most notably assistance to families through the Family Tax Benefits schemes, have been increased. Other programs, such as the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, have been axed. Still other programs have changed to reduce access to benefits for particular groups, such as immigrants, or have increased work requirements under a broader shift in income support programs towards “workfare. ” In chapter 12 Shaun Wilson and Gabrielle Meagher examine how Australians are responding to welfare changes under the Coalition. On family assistance, they find that support for payments to all families to help with the costs of children is generally higher than support for payments to single mothers to be at home to raise their children, even though single mothers are more likely to suffer poverty. It seems, then, that single mothers are still viewed as relatively undeserving by some. Even less deserving in the eyes of the Australian public are new migrants; nearly three-quarters support the current policy that migrants wait two years before becoming eligible for welfare benefits. Wilson and Meagher also report on the latest trends in support for social spending. Preferences for social spending continue to outstrip preferences for lower income taxes by around 12 per cent, confirming an ongoing trend away from tax cuts as the public’s main fiscal priority. • Australian Social Attitudes 2 : Citizenship, Work and Aspirations > Australian Survey of Social Attitudes >...|$|R

50|$|There {{had been}} much {{speculation}} that with the <b>gradual</b> <b>retirement</b> of John Hume from politics, the SDLP vote might collapse. In the 2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election, the SDLP lost 11.5% of the vote and were only narrowly ahead of Sinn Féin.

However, {{the attention of the}} Geneva Association has focused above all on a 4th pillar i.e. the future need for a flexible extension of work-life, mainly on a part-time basis, in order to supplement income from the three existing pillars.
