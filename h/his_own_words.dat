Blythe, who according to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop.

Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E
