5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E
5|$|During season 2, it is {{revealed}} that Pope {{had been involved}} in an electoral fraud scheme that had ensured Fitz's election. During a break in her relationship with Fitz, Pope develops an emotional and physical attachment to Fitz's Navy colleague Jake Ballard (Scott Foley). Fitz' affair with Pope caused him to become estranged from his wife, Mellie (Bellamy Young), and led to his romantic gesture to move Pope into the White House. However, the season ended with Pope telling Fitz <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> back to his wife and run for reelection after Fitz and Pope were driven apart by White House Chief of Staff Cyrus Beene (Jeff Perry). The season ends with a mysterious relationship with her father, Rowan Pope (Joe Morton), coming to the surface.|$|E

5|$|After the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, the French {{scientists}} {{wanted to}} go home. Auger had already returned to London to join the French Scientific Mission in April 1944. Halban returned {{on a visit to}} London and Paris in November 1944, where he saw Frédéric Joliot-Curie {{for the first time since}} leaving France. While he maintained that he did not divulge any nuclear secrets to his previous boss (although he had discussed patent rights), Halban was not allowed to work or to leave North America for a year, although he left the Montreal Laboratory in April 1945. In 1946 he settled in England. B. W. Sargent then became Head of the nuclear physics division. Cockcroft arranged for Goldschmidt, Guéron and Kowarski to remain until June 1945, later extended until the end of 1945. Goldschmidt was willing to stay longer, and Cockcroft wanted to keep him, but Groves insisted that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go,</b> and, in the interest of Allied harmony, he did. All the French scientists had left by January 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Dmowski, {{increasingly}} {{convinced of}} Russia's impending defeat, decided that {{to support the}} cause of Polish independence <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> abroad to campaign on behalf of Poland in the capitals of the western Allies. During his lobbying efforts, his friends included such opinion makers as the British journalist Wickham Steed. In particular, Dmowski was very successful in France, where he made a very favorable impression on public opinion. He gave a series of lecture at Cambridge University, which impressed the local faculty enough that {{he was given a}} honorary doctorate. In August 1917, in Paris, he created a new Polish National Committee aimed at rebuilding a Polish state. That year he also published, at his own expense, Problems of Central and Eastern Europe, that he soon distributed among numerous English speaking diplomats. He was a vocal critic of Austro-Hungary, and campaigned {{for the creation of a}} number of Slavic states (including for the Czechs, Hungarians and Romanians) in its place. Within the Polish political community, he opposed those who supported allying themselves with Germany and Austria-Hungary, including supporters of a vague German proposal for a Regency Kingdom of Poland, with undefined borders, that Germany promised to create after World War I (while in secret, actually planning to strip it of up to 30,000 square kilometers for German colonization after the removal of its Polish population).|$|E
5|$|The {{dampening}} {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> on tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E

25|$|Churchill {{was on his}} way to Dunkirk on {{the night}} of 2 October when his train was halted and he was taken back to London for a meeting with Kitchener, Sir Edward Grey (Foreign Secretary), Admiral Battenberg (First Sea Lord) and Sir William Tyrrell, Grey's {{secretary}} (Asquith was away making a recruiting speech in Cardiff). They warned that King Albert of the Belgians planned to evacuate Antwerp. Churchill later claimed that it has been a collective decision that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to Antwerp but Sir Edward Grey later wrote, more plausibly in historian John Charmley’s view, that it was very much Churchill’s idea.|$|E

Around 1978, when João first {{performed}} healings there, he just sat outdoors in a chair near the main road where people began to arrive seeking cures for their various illnesses and conditions. Gradually the numbers increased to thousands per day and he developed his centre, Casa de Dom Inácio de Loyola. The Casa de Dom Inácio de Loyola has since been visited by millions of people seeking healing. He also owns a nearby cattle ranch, which covers about 1,000 acres and is valued over 2 million reais.|$|E
25|$|After Japan's {{defeat in}} the Pacific and {{subsequent}} surrender, Shimazaki is conflicted in his loyalties, wondering if <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> back to Japan, or stay in the newly proclaimed Republic of Indonesia and fight to defend its sovereignty. At first, he does not abandon his duties to Japan, and refuses to give PETA weapons to the Indonesian guerillas, said weapons having been earmarked for surrender to the Allies. Armed only with bambu runcing (sharpened bamboo spears), these guerillas are easily killed by the returning Dutch forces and their allies. Finally, a group of former PETA soldiers– led by Nurhadi, Parto and Asep– go to the Japanese headquarters to force Shimizaki {{to give them the}} weapons. After a lengthy stand-off, he agrees to surrender the weapons and to accompany the guerrillas in fighting, saying goodbye to his friend Lieutenant Miyata (Naoki Hosaka).|$|E

25|$|In early 2006 Yunus, {{along with}} other members of the civil society {{including}} Professor Rehman Sobhan, Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman, Dr Kamal Hossain, Matiur Rahman, Mahfuz Anam and Debapriya Bhattacharya, participated in a campaign for honest and clean candidates in national elections. He considered entering politics in the later part of that year. On 11 February 2007, Yunus wrote an open letter, published in the Bangladeshi newspaper Daily Star, where he asked citizens for views on his plan to float a political party to establish political goodwill, proper leadership and good governance. In the letter, he called on everyone to briefly outline how <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> about the task and how they can contribute to it. Yunus finally announced that he is willing to launch a political party tentatively called Citizens' Power (Nagorik Shakti) on 18 February 2007. There was speculation that the army supported a move by Yunus into politics. On 3 May, however, Yunus declared that he had decided to abandon his political plans following a meeting with the head of the interim government, Fakhruddin Ahmed.|$|E
25|$|The two men {{returned}} to Bradley's flat, where Ireland {{suggested that he}} tie Bradley up; Bradley expressed his displeasure at the idea. In order to get Bradley to comply, Ireland {{told him that he}} was unable to perform sexually without elements of bondage. Bradley hesitantly cooperated and was soon trussed up on his own bed, face down, with a noose around his neck. After Ireland had secured Bradley, he demanded money and a PIN number under the threat of torture. Ireland assured Bradley that he was merely a thief and would leave after stealing Bradley's money. After Bradley gave Ireland his PIN, which Ireland later used to steal £200, along with £100 in cash stolen from Bradley's flat, Ireland told him that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to sleep, as he wouldn't be leaving his flat for hours. Bradley eventually did fall asleep and Ireland momentarily thought of leaving Bradley unharmed. Ireland then realised that Bradley could identify him and used the noose, which he had earlier attached around Bradley's neck, to strangle him. Before leaving Bradley's flat, he placed a doll on top of the dead man's body.|$|E
25|$|Michelle (now {{played by}} Jenna Russell) returns to Walford on Christmas Eve and reunites with Sharon, staying with Martin (now played by James Bye) {{and his second}} wife Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner). Sharon {{suspects}} something is wrong as Michelle has left Mark and Tim behind, but Michelle refuses to talk about it. Michelle and Martin reminisce about their family but Stacey is annoyed by Michelle's presence. Michelle announces she {{is going back to}} Florida but Stacey overhears her breaking down on the phone to Tim. Michelle confides in Sharon that Mark has left home with his girlfriend and that she and Tim have not had sex for almost two years. She then tells Sharon that back in Florida she had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student, Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor). Sharon allows Michelle to stay with her and Michelle starts drinking alcohol on her own. Sharon and Phil go on holiday, leaving Michelle to look after the home and their children Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) and Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau). On Valentine's Day, Preston turns up and he and Michelle kiss passionately. Michelle goes for a job interview at a teaching agency, but fails to get the job as they find out from her references about her relationship with Preston. Michelle insists that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> home but he tries to win her back, though she is adamant their relationship is over. Michelle then sees Preston with her niece, Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), and Preston manipulates Michelle into catching him in bed with Bex, and she realises he is using Bex to make her jealous. The plan apparently works as Michelle and Preston have sex again. Dennis then discovers Michelle and Preston's relationship and starts blackmailing Michelle into buying him trainers and allowing him time off school.|$|E
