40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment</b> of two anatomical ontologies through a reference ontology and {{to compare it}} to direct alignment between these two ontologies. The ontologies under investigation are the Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary (MA) and the NCI Thesaurus (NCI). The Foundational Model of Anatomy serves as reference ontology. Methods: The direct alignment employs a combination of lexical and structural similarity. The <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment</b> simply derives mappings from direct alignments to the reference ontology. Results: The indirect MA-NCI alignment yielded 703 mappings and the direct alignment 715, 654 of which are common to both. The mappings specific to one approach were analyzed. Conclusions: When a reference ontology exists, <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment</b> of multiple ontologies through a reference represents a valid, cost-effective alternative to pairwise alignment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{ontology}} is {{a formal}} {{representation of a}} domain modeling the entities in the domain and their relations. When a domain is represented by multiple ontologies, {{there is a need}} for creating mappings among these ontologies in order to facilitate the integration of data annotated with and reasoning across these ontologies. The objective of this paper is to present our experience in aligning two medium-size anatomical ontologies and to reflect on some of the issues and challenges encountered along the way. The anatomical ontologies under investigation are the Adult Mouse Anatomy (MA) and the anatomy subset of the NCI Thesaurus (NCI). We also use the Foundational Model of Anatomy as a reference ontology. We present a hybrid alignment strategy for anatomical entities, combining direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment</b> techniques, both supported by the NLM Anatomy Ontology Alignment System (AOAS). Overall, the hybrid strategy combining direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment</b> techniques identified 1, 338 matches between MA and NCI, accounting for about 49 % of all MA concepts and 41 % of all NCI concepts. 1, 007 matches are shared by both alignments, leaving 277 matches specific to the direct alignment and 54 specific to the <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment.</b> 1 Presentation of the system An ontology is a formal representation of a domain modeling the entities in the domain and their relations. Many domains, including anatomy, are represented by multiple ontologies, with variable overlap among them. There is a need for creating mappings among these ontologies in order to facilitate the integration of data annotated with and reasoning across these ontologies [1]. 1. ...|$|E

T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct alignment of the pair with <b>indirect</b> <b>alignments</b> that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 208 - 222) Archaeoastronomical investigations at LAn- 357, Burro Flats (sites Ven- 551 -Ven 561), and Bell Canyon (sites LAn- 413 and LAn- 511) revealed evidence strongly {{suggesting that}} these sites were astronomically significant {{for both the}} Chumash and Fernandeno groups which occupied the west San Fernando Valley {{at the time of}} historic contact. Field research conducted at these sites during the winter and summer solstices of 1979 - 1980 revealed sunrise and sunset alignments which are believed to be ritually significant, as well as perhaps calendrically important. Two types of astronomical solstitial alignments were discovered within the study area: (1) direct alignments, documented for LAn- 357, Burro Flats and Bell Canyon, and (2) <b>indirect</b> <b>alignments,</b> documented at Burro Flats. LAn- 357 and Burro Flats are village/habitation sites which consist of numerous rock art loci [...] pictographs and petroglyphs. Bell Canyon consists of an historic village (Huwam - LAn- 413) and an ethnohistoric shrine (Tswaya tsuqele - LAn- 511) used for the Winter Solstice Ceremony. This thesis combines archaeoastronomical data, rock art interpretation and an intensive review of the ethnographic/ ethnohistoric literature in an attempt to analyze the significance of these alignments in reference to Chumash and Fernandeno ceremonialism...|$|R
40|$|Ontology {{matching}} {{consists of}} generating {{a set of}} correspondences between the entities of two ontologies. This process {{is seen as a}} solution to data heterogeneity in ontology-based applications, enabling the interoperability between them. However, existing matching systems are designed by assuming that the entities of both source and target ontologies are written in the same languages (English, for instance). Multi-lingual ontology matching is an open research issue. This paper describes an API for multi-lingual matching that implements two strategies, direct translation-based and indirect. The first strategy considers direct matching between two ontologies (i. e., without intermediary ontologies), with the help of external resources, i. e., translations. The <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment</b> strategy, proposed by (Jung et al., 2009), is based on composition of alignments. We evaluate these strategies using simple string similarity based matchers and three ontologies written in English, French, and Portuguese, an extension of the OAEI benchmark test 206. 1...|$|E
40|$|Nanowires and {{nanotubes}} were synthesized from {{metals and}} metal oxides using templated cathodic electrodeposition. With templated electrodeposition, small structures are electrodeposited using a template {{that is the}} inverse of the final desired shape. Dielectrophoresis {{was used for the}} alignment of the as-formed nanowires and nanotubes between prepatterned electrodes. For reproducible nanowire alignment, a universal set of dielectrophoresis parameters to align any arbitrary nanowire material was determined. The parameters include peak-to-peak potential and frequency, thickness of the silicon oxide layer, grounding of the silicon substrate, and nature of the solvent medium used. It involves applying a field with a frequency > 10 (5) Hz, an insulating silicon oxide layer with a thickness of 2. 5 mu m or more, grounding of the underlying silicon substrate, and the use of a solvent medium with a low dielectric constant. In our experiments, we obtained good results by using a peak-to-peak potential of 2. 1 V at a frequency of 1. 2 x 10 (5) Hz. Furthermore, an <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment</b> technique is proposed that prevents short circuiting of nanowires after contacting both electrodes. After alignment, a considerably lower resistivity was found for ZnO nanowires made by templated electrodeposition (2. 2 - 3. 4 x 10 (- 3) Omega m) compared to ZnO nanorods synthesized by electrodeposition (10 Omega m) or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) (500 Omega m).

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} current {{approach}} to remuneration {{policy in the}} financial sector {{through the lens of}} the history of pay proposals. This history {{can be seen as a}} series of attempts to align interests of financial firms ’ insiders with interests of a varying range of outsiders. Even though interests were getting aligned, excessive risk taking remained, because each proposal overlooked an important group of outsiders. The history offers two lessons relevant for the current debate. First, modern banking involves an important group of outsiders overlooked by the current pay policy – ultimate asset holders. Their interests could be taken into account by separating remuneration policy for commercial and investment banking and by linking pay in investment banking to performance of securities originated, floated and traded. Second, the persistent problem of overlooked outsiders suggests that the very approach to pay in commercial banking should be changed. Instead of searching for an <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment,</b> remuneration could be linked directly to leverage-adjusted profitability of commercial banking operations, making the remuneration policy a tool of countercyclical macro-prudential regulation. The proposed measures could supplement and strengthen the current remuneration policy focusing on the bonus cap and deferred compensation subject to malus and clawback. The paper makes particular reference to the current UK remuneration policy, the core arguments and conclusions, however, apply to a broad range of countries...|$|E

40|$|Inspired by the {{incremental}} TER alignment, we re-designed the <b>Indirect</b> HMM (IHMM) <b>alignment,</b> {{which is one}} of the best hypothesis alignment methods for conventional MT system combination, in an incremental manner. One crucial problem of incremental alignment is to align a hypothesis to a confusion network (CN). Our incremental IHMM alignment is implemented in three different ways: 1) treat CN spans as HMM states and define state transition as distortion over covered n-grams between two spans; 2) treat CN spans as HMM states and define state transition as distortion over words in component translations in the CN; and 3) use a consensus decoding algorithm over one hypothesis and multiple IHMMs, each of which corresponds to a component translation in the CN. All these three approaches of incremental alignment based on IHMM are shown to be superior to both incremental TER alignment and conventional IHMM alignment in the setting of the Chinese-to-English track of the 2008 NIST Open MT evaluation. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMouse {{hepatitis}} virus (MHV), a coronavirus, generates defective-interfering (DI) RNAs {{of different}} sizes during passages at high multiplicities of infection. All MHV DI RNAs characterized so far contain an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a fused viral protein; in addition, DI RNAs with a long ORF have a competitive advantage over those with a shorter ORF. These findings suggest that DI RNA replication may require an ORF encoding a cis-acting viral protein. In this study, we used a naturally occurring DI RNA and inserted a 12 -nucleotide (nt) amber-mutation linker at various positions to truncate the ORF. Most of the mutants replicated {{as well as the}} wild-type DI RNA, irrespective of the presence or absence and the length of the ORF in the RNA. Sequence analysis showed that all of the mutants retained the insertional mutations even after two viral passages in tissue culture, establishing that the mutant DI RNAs replicated. We have further introduced two 3 -nucleotide substitutions of the first two AUG codons of the ORF, thus completely closing the ORF. This DI RNA replicated as well as the wild-type DL but, after a single passage, the majority of the mutant RNAs was replaced by recombinant RNAs which contain a restored functional ORF. However, an additional insertion of a 12 -nt amber-mutation linker downstream of the AUG substitutions prevented recombination, and the DI RNA still replicated. These data indicate that DI RNA replication does not require a DI-specific ORF encoding cis-acting viral proteins and that a 12 -nucleotide insertion could prevent or delay the occurrence of RNA recombination, suggesting the importance of direct or <b>indirect</b> RNA <b>alignment</b> in homologous RNA recombination...|$|R
40|$|An {{ontology}} is {{a formal}} {{representation of a}} domain modeling the entities in the domain and their relations. When a domain is represented by multiple ontologies, there is need for creating mappings among these ontologies {{in order to facilitate}} the integration of data annotated with these ontologies and reasoning across ontologies. The objective {{of this paper is to}} recapitulate our experience in aligning large anatomical ontologies and to reflect on some of the issues and challenges encountered along the way. The four anatomical ontologies under investigation are the Foundational Model of Anatomy, GALEN, the Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary and the NCI Thesaurus. Their underlying representation formalisms are all different. Our approach to aligning concepts (directly) is automatic, rulebased, and operates at the schema level, generating mostly point-to-point mappings. It uses a combination of domain-specific lexical techniques and structural and semantic techniques (to validate the mappings suggested lexically). It also takes advantage of domain-specific knowledge (lexical knowledge from external resources such as the Unified Medical Language System, as well as knowledge augmentation and inference techniques). In addition to point-to-point mapping of concepts, we present the alignment of relationships and the mapping of concepts groupto-group. We have also successfully tested an <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment</b> through a domain-specific reference ontology. We present an evaluation of our techniques, both against a gold standard established manually and against a generic schema matching system. The advantages and limitations of our approach are analyzed and discussed throughout the paper...|$|E
40|$|The UM-Flint Urban Alternatives House (UAH) is a LEED Platinum {{certified}} {{residential property}} redevelopment project established in 2010 through {{a partnership between}} the Genesee County Land Bank Authority and the University of Michigan-Flint. UM-Flint with community partners seek to use the UAH as demonstration project that connects residents in Flint and Genesee County to programs and resources that support adoption of sustainability measures to increase community resilience. Population decline and economic challenges {{are evident in the}} metropolitan Flint area, and energy costs place a larger financial burden on low income households. The desire to connect residents to resources that reduce residential energy and water costs while advancing adoption of sustainable practices informed development of this study. The objectives of the study were to identify organizations and programs in Flint and Genesee County that provided resources or support to advance household level energy efficiency, water conservation, and sustainable development practices, to understand how these organizations are networked together, and to understand the opportunities and barriers they perceive relative to advancing efforts in the region. To meet this objective, the study focused on gathering organization level information and perspectives. Participants were identified using a snowball sampling technique. Stakeholder analysis and social network analysis were the methods used to inform the study. The stakeholder analysis was completed using an integrated approach, informed by semi-structured interviews with nineteen stakeholders (n= 19). NVivo 10 quantitative analysis software was employed to analyze stakeholder interview responses using a strategic perspectives approach. An actor linkage survey was completed by seventeen of the participants (n= 17), and the information collected from the surveys provided data for the social network analysis completed using NetMiner 10 software. Forty-eight organizations were identified as stakeholders with direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>alignment</b> with the study area. Thirty-four of these organization were active in the study region. Analytical categorizations resulted in organizations being classified in three levels: type (i. e. Government, community organization, etc.), organizational alignment identified as 1) Community Economic Development, 2) Community Education and Engagement, 3) Health, and 4) Coordination/Collaboration, and study alignment identified as 1) Energy Efficiency, 2) Water Conservation, 3) Construction (Regular and “Green”), 4) Agriculture and Food Access, and 5) Recycling and Waste Management. The first portion of the results section explores the themes found through analysis of the stakeholder interview data. The organizational alignments provided a broad context through which the themes emerged. Community economic development examines the role of stakeholders involved in housing programs, often supported by state and federal funding aimed at low to moderate income households. Community education and engagement highlights the important role of the utility provider as well as water quality and resources management organizations, and educational institutions. Health aligned stakeholders included those that addressed household hazards and organizations engaged in local food system work. Coordination and collaboration identifies that many partnerships exist, but only one local collaboration focused primarily on household health and sustainability. Opportunities and barriers are also examined. The second portion of the results section features the results of the social network analysis. The social network analysis focuses on measures of centrality, exploring the properties of an actor (stakeholders represented as nodes in the network) and the prominence of said actor in the network based on the ties to other actors. Measures of centrality highlighted in the analysis include in- and out-degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality which are often positively correlated. The dominant actors and the deviations from the positive correlations found between the centrality measures are identified. The discussion and recommendations section of the study notes that a variety of programs and initiatives exist that support energy efficiency, water conservation, sustainable construction, and overall household level sustainability in in the study region, but few stakeholders have a primary focus in these areas. Recommendations for ongoing stakeholder engagement with existing efforts and approaches to advance education and outreach objectives are made. The impacts of fluctuations in funding, particularly at the federal level, areas in which services are being centralized, and market gaps revealed by the study are discussed. The study identifies several areas to advance residents’ connections to energy efficiency, water conservation, and household level sustainability, and concludes with the following: Education is both an opportunity and a barrier to connecting residents to resources for energy efficiency, water conservation, and household level sustainability. The inventory of programs may serve as a starting point to connecting residents to these resources, and development of a social marketing campaign could advance both promotion and adoption of these resources. Stakeholders in the Flint area are actively partnering on a number of initiatives and to advance community sustainability in a larger context. Building a shared understanding of household sustainability, understanding the strengths and limitations of partner organizations, and finding ways to creatively leverage resources through new and existing collaborations could support efforts moving forward. Ongoing engagement with stakeholders aligned with fair housing, natural resource management/water quality, and local food systems is recommended. The important role of government in connecting to resources and advancing a collective vision is recognized. Building alignments with business and economic development efforts is also suggested. </ul...|$|E
40|$|InAs/GaSb heterojunctions {{offer the}} unique {{situation}} in a semiconductor of overlapping conduction and valence bands. A wavevector dependent minigap occurs due to the anticrossing of the electron and hole dispersion relations. As a result the resistivity increases strongly in very pure intrinsic structures due to {{the reduction in the}} electron group velocity. Applying a magnetic field parallel to the layers shifts the conduction and valence band relative to each other in k-space and the structure turns back to an indirect semimetal. As a result we can observe a giant negative magnetoresistance. Interband absorption is observed across the minigap, and this can also be removed by the parallel field which transforms the system to an <b>indirect</b> band gap <b>alignment.</b> In high perpendicular magnetic fields strong oscillations occur in the Hall coefficient, and at low temperatures a series of zero Hall resistance states are found in which a divergence of the diagonal resistivity occurs at the same point as a zero in the Hall resistance.

40|$|Spatially <b>indirect</b> Type-II band <b>alignment</b> in magnetically-doped {{quantum dot}} (QD) {{structures}} provides unexplored opportunities {{to control the}} magnetic interaction between carrier wavefunction in the QD and magnetic impurities. Unlike the extensively studied, spatially direct, QDs with Type-I band alignment where both electrons and holes are confined in the QD, in ZnTe QDs embedded in a (Zn,Mn) Se matrix only the holes are confined in the QDs. Photoexcitation with photon energy 3. 06 eV (2. 54 eV) generates electron-hole pairs predominantly in the (Zn,Mn) Se matrix (ZnTe QDs). The photoluminescence (PL) at 7 K {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field exhibits an up to three-fold increase in the saturation red shift with the 2. 54 eV excitation compared to the shift observed with 3. 06 eV excitation. This unexpected result is attributed to multiple hole occupancy of the QD and the resulting increased penetration of the hole wavefunction tail further into the (Zn,Mn) Se matrix. The proposed model is supported by microscopic calculations which accurately include the role of hole-hole Coulomb interactions as well as the hole-Mn spin exchange interactions.

40|$|Sequence {{alignment}} is {{an important}} bioinformatics tool for identifying homology, but searching against the full set of available sequences is {{likely to result in}} many hits to poorly annotated sequences providing very little information. Consequently, we often want alignments against a specific subset of sequences: for instance, we are looking for sequences from a particular species, sequences that have known 3 d-structures, sequences that have a reliable (curated) function annotation, and so on. Although such subset databases are readily available, they only represent a small fraction of all sequences. Thus, the likelihood of finding close homologs for query sequences is smaller, and the alignments will in general have lower scores. This makes it difficult to distinguish hits to homologous sequences from random hits to unrelated sequences. Here, we propose a method that addresses this problem by first aligning query sequences against a large database representing the corpus of known sequences, and then constructing <b>indirect</b> (or transitive) <b>alignments</b> by combining the results with alignments from the large database against the desired target database. We compare the results to direct pairwise alignments, and show that our method gives us higher sensitivity alignments against the target database...|$|R
