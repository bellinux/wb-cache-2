40|$|Objective: There {{has been}} little {{research}} exploring the types of settings within community hospitals in which treatment is provided for substance use disorders (SUD). This study aimed to address this information gap by describing the presence and use of community hospital medical/surgical units, psychiatric <b>units,</b> and <b>detoxification</b> <b>units</b> for patients with a principal diagnosis of SUD across a sample of states. Characteristics of patients with a principal SUD diagnosis who were discharged from those settings are also described. Method: Patients with substance use disorders treated in community hospital psychiatric or <b>detoxification</b> <b>units</b> were compared to those treated in medical/surgical beds (scatter beds) using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases from 12 states. Results: Overall, across the states, there was a ten fold variation in the hospitalization rate per capita for SUD. The percent of discharges treated in scatter beds ranged {{from a low of}} 26 % to a high of 82 %. Patients treated in scatter beds in hospitals without specialized units were less likely to receive detoxification or rehabilitation services.

One of the most prevalent and impairing comorbidities of ADHD in adults are substance use disorders. We estimate rates of ADHD in patients with substance abuse disorders and delineate impairment in the co-morbid group. Method Screening for ADHD followed by a research diagnostic interview in people attending in-patient drug and alcohol <b>detoxification</b> <b>units.</b> Results We estimated prevalence of undiagnosed ADHD within substance use disorder in-patients in South London around 12 %. Those individuals with substance use disorders and ADHD had significantly higher self-rated impairments across several domains of daily life; and higher rates of substance abuse and alcohol consumption, suicide attempts, and depression recorded in their case records. Conclusions This study demonstrates the high rates of untreated ADHD within substance use disorder populations and the association of ADHD in such patients with greater levels of impairment. These {{are likely to be}} a source of additional impairment to patients and represent an increased burden on clinical services. </p...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{the most}} common {{treatment}} for substance abuse stems from a medical model, which views addiction disease. This model sees disease of addiction as being rooted solely in the individual. Relatively recent research suggests that addiction can be best understood holistically, as evident in the more recent programming that focus on {{other aspects of the}} individual. Currently, most female correctional facilities contain a range of evidence-based programming for substance abuse that have been shown to both reduce recidivism, and promote positive social behavior. Most of the substance abuse programs are largely funded by organizations such as CSAT. In addition to residential TCs, prison-based substance abuse programming may include <b>detoxification</b> <b>units,</b> inpatient drug treatment, outpatient treatment or counseling, self-help group/peer counseling, education/awareness, or maintenance program. Volunteering professionals across several disciplines often run these programs, since effective gender-responsive programming should address substance abuse holistically. While there has been {{an increase in the number}} of substance abuse treatment options, research regarding their effectiveness has reduced since the late 1990s. The outcome evaluations that come during the early 2000s focus primarily on programming elements that contribute to high levels of effectiveness. For example, a 2001 study of treatment investigated the effectiveness of receiving treatment (versus not receiving treatment), group type (mixed versus female only), and the type of women's treatment (enhanced vs standard).|$|R

SUD patients experienced comparably low physical QoL and had significantly lower psychological, social, and existential QoL domain scores when compared with the somatic sample. Mental distress and having a SUD were the major factors explaining variations in QoL, with both influencing QoL negatively. In the SUD sample, QoL improved moderately at the six-month follow-up with less improvement for the domain relationship to a partner. To facilitate the recovery of SUD patients, clinicians must view their patients' situation holistically and invest efforts into the different life domains affected by poor QoL...|$|E

40|$|Underreporting of {{drug use}} is {{commonly}} found more often than overreporting. Overreporting may, however, occur in particular settings, e. g. in subjects entering a detoxification program. METHODS: Self-reports (standardized semi structured interview) of recent drug use of 554 patients consecutively admitted to a drug <b>detoxification</b> inpatient <b>unit</b> were compared to urine screening results at admission. Overreporters were defined as indicating a consumption of a specific drug during the preceding 7 days (3 days for cocaine) which was not confirmed by the urine screening. Underreproters denied consumption but presented positive urine. RESULTS: Overreporting was especially prevalent for opiates, and relatively more frequent (59. 9 % heroin, 40 % methadone) than underreporting (6. 8 % heroin, 20. 4 % methadone). Signs of intoxication at admission, current methadone substitution, and previous institutional detoxification experiences influenced opiate overreporting. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the retained parameters predicting overreporting of recent opiate consumption corroborated the hypothesis of patients trying to receive more consideration from the therapeutic team and to get more intensive pharmacological care...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of the relationships between alcoholics' and nonalcoholics' attributions and their emotions of anxiety and depression. The research design is an ex post facto/causal comparative analysis. Subjects were 150 white males. The treatment factor is separated into three levels: no treatment for alcoholism (50 nonalcoholics), two or three day treatment for alcoholism (50 alcoholics in <b>detoxification</b> <b>units),</b> and three to six months of treatment for alcoholism (50 alcoholics in a supportive living situation, halfway house, three-quarterway house). The Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) was used to separate nonalcoholics from alcoholics. The variables measured for the three populations are: attributional style (as measured by the Attributional Style Questionnaire-revised for drinking practices) and emotional state (as measured by the Profile of Mood State). One-way MANOVA analysis was used to examine the data because there are three attributional areas measured by the ASQ (internality, stability, and globality) and two emotional areas measured by the POMS (tension-anxiety, depression-dejection). MANOVA analysis resulted in a significant F. The three groups were significantly different at the multivariate level in terms of attributional and emotional states. Discriminate analysis was used to determine if the groups were reliably different. Both synthetic variables analyzed resulted in significant results. The first synthetic variable was labeled "emotional stability," and the second was labeled "specific causal attribution. "Univariate analysis showed: (1) no significant difference between groups on the internal/external dimension or the stable/unstable dimension, (2) significant difference at the. 01 level on the global/specific dimension when comparing alcoholics in recovery and nonalcoholics, and (3) significant difference at the. 01 level on anxiety and depression levels of each of the three group comparisons. Pearson Product Correlations were examined to understand the relationships between attributions and emotional states for alcoholics and nonalcoholics. The stable/unstable and global/specific dimensions are positively correlated with depression and the global/specific dimension is positively correlated with anxiety. All the hypotheses were supported: 1. Alcoholics in detoxification make different attributions and have different mood states than alcoholics in recovery. 2. Nonalcoholics make different attributions and have different mood states than alcoholics in treatment and in recovery. 3. There are correlational relationships between the attributions and emotional states for alcoholics and nonalcoholics. Some alcoholic treatment recommendations were made.

40|$|The Strategic Response Group (SRG) is a {{partnership}} {{set up to}} address public substance misuse and perceived anti-social behaviour in Dublin city centre. This report - Report of the Strategic Response Group to build sustainable street-level drug services and address related public nuisance - acknowledges that for historical reasons there is a clustering of drug treatment and homelessness services in or adjacent to the inner city. While these services {{play a major role}} in the provision of effective treatment to problematic drug users, the report recommends that there should be greater access to prompt provision of treatment options nationally and that people should be treated and accommodated in the most appropriate setting for their circumstances and provided with support services as close to their home as possible. The report takes a holistic approach to address the issues of the city centre. The group have set out their recommendations in the short, media and long term and under the headings of treatment, rehabilitation, homelessness, policing responses, planning and urban design, legislation and regulation and implementation. Key recommendations of the report include: •	There should be greater access to and prompt provision of treatment options nationally. People should be treated and provided with support services as close to their home as possible. The treatment provided should be of the level of complexity required to meet their needs. This should ensure that people are only using services that are essential and appropriate to meet their needs and that are local to their place of residence. This should involve a relocation of service provision for some people from the city centre area where possible. •	Gardaí need to be given powers to deal with street dealing of prescription drugs so as to initiate prosecutions. The SRG supports the current proposals by Roisin Shortall TD, Minister of State with special responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, to update the Misuse of Drugs legislation in relation to Benzodiazepines. Provisions should also be made for the scheduling of Z-Hypnotics (Zimmovane). •	Emergency accommodation should only ever be used in an ‘emergency’. This is often not the case, due to a lack of suitable long-term housing options people often spend long periods in emergency accommodation. Private B&B’s are a form of emergency provision which are often not fit for purpose and are without regulatory provision. •	To discourage street-drinking, to reduce harm and to offer safer alternatives, accommodation models should be provided where people who wish to consume alcohol can do so in their accommodation under regulated conditions. •	Enhanced public lighting is required to increase public perceptions of safety in particular locations & in general street planning to predict potential use of public spaces. •	There is a need to strengthen the links between existing Local Drug Task Forces, particularly in the City Centre area (North Inner City, South Inner City). There is a need to explore a cross North Inner City Local Drugs Task Force and South Inner City Local Drugs Force Partnership Group with a specific focus on implementing the recommendations within this report at a local level. •	There is a need to make community-based residential crisis stabilisation/ <b>detoxification</b> <b>unit(s)</b> available.

40|$|The {{background}} {{for this project}} is an internal quality survey from 2013 at the <b>Detoxification</b> <b>Unit</b> of Sørlandet hospital. In recent decades the pattern of substance use among patients admitted for detoxification has changed from predominantly single-substance abuse to simultaneous multi-substance abuse. The evidence base for medication-assisted pharmacological treatment of polydrug users remains inadequate. A non-experimental cohort {{study was conducted with}} 284 polydrug users in the <b>Detoxification</b> <b>Unit</b> of Sørlandet Hospital in 2013. The therapeutic approach was standardised, and was based on social environmental therapy and symptomatic treatment of withdrawal symptoms with valproate and clonidine as key medications. The social environmental therapy was not specifically studied, but it is fair to assume that it had a great impact on the completion rate. Three quarters of the patients were male and they had used more than three different substances on average. The average mean age was 39 years. In total, 75 % of patients completed the detoxification programme, and for 95 % detoxification occurred without complications. In 89 % of cases, the standard treatment protocol was followed. There was a weak but significant correlation between treatment discontinuation and the number of substances used. The completion rate in this study was considerably higher than in previous detoxification studies, and the complication rate was lower. In view of the good results observed and the high degree of standardised treatment, the regimen can be considered a sound safe treatment option for other detoxification units.

40|$|Introduction: Alcohol {{dependence}} is {{an important}} risk factor for suicidal behaviours. Current data show that between 14 and 43 % of alcohol-dependent patients attempt suicide. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyse the risk factors for suicide attempts among patients treated for alcohol dependence. Methods: Medical data of 994 patients hospitalised in Alcohol <b>Detoxification</b> and Rehabilitation <b>Units</b> of Nowowiejski Hospital in Warsaw were analysed. The relationships between variables that are thought to be related to the prevalence of suicide attempts in this population were evaluated. The relevant psycho-social and demographic data as well as information on alcohol use and treatment history were included. Results: 292 (29 %) patients confirmed suicide attempts in the past. Among the variables included in the logistic regression model, previous episodes of delirium tremens, earlier onset of alcohol dependence, comorbidity of somatic disorders, and unemployment proved to be significant risk factors for previous suicide attempts. Discussion: The higher prevalence of suicide attempts among patients with previous episodes of delirium tremens and earlier onset of alcohol dependence confirms the relationship between the severity of alcohol dependence and suicide attempts. The effect of unemployment and comorbidity of somatic disorders on incidence of suicide attempts might presumably be mediated by co-occurring pain, depression, and poorer social functioning. Conclusions: Earlier onset of alcohol dependence and previous episodes of delirium tremens are the risk factors of suicide attempts attributable to the severity of alcohol dependence. The other risk factors (unemployment and somatic disorders) are nonspecific to alcohol dependence, and were previously found to increase the risk in various psychiatric populations...|$|R

One hundred four crack cocaine female users were followed for 20 days in a <b>detoxification</b> inpatient treatment <b>unit.</b> Plasma levels of adiponectin, resistin and leptin were assessed every 7 days during 3 weeks of follow-up. the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) retrospectively assessed childhood maltreatment history. A healthy control group was included to provide adipokines reference values (HC). All crack users increased leptin plasma levels during early abstinence despite concentrations remained lower in comparison with non-users group. Crack users reporting childhood maltreatment exhibited a significant reduction in plasma levels of adiponectin and resistin when compared to CM group. in addition, only CM participants increased plasma levels of adiponectin during detoxification. This is the first study evaluating adipokines during crack cocaine abstinence. Our results suggest a modulator effect of childhood maltreatment on inflammatory status in treatment-seeking crack cocaine dependents during early abstinence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Introduction: Delirium tremens (DT) is a {{life-threatening}} complication {{that occurs in}} 5 – 33 % of patients treated for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyse the risk factors for delirium tremens among patients treated for alcohol dependence. Methods: Medical data of 1027 patients hospitalised in Alcohol <b>Detoxification</b> and Rehabilitation <b>Units</b> of Nowowiejski Hospital in Warsaw were analysed. The relationships between variables that are thought to be related to the prevalence of delirium tremens in this population were evaluated. The relevant psycho-social and demographic data as well as information on alcohol use and treatment history were included. Results: 262 patients (25. 5 %) confirmed delirium tremens in the past. Among the variables included in the logistic regression model, previous episodes of consciousness loss, suicide attempts and episodes of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, as well as harmful use of other psychoactive substances, proved to be significant risk factors for delirium tremens. Discussion: The higher prevalence of DT among patients with previous suicide attempts confirms the relationship between the severity of alcohol dependence and suicide attempts and DT. Additionally, higher risk of DT in patients with previous episodes of consciousness loss can be explained by an increased number of head injuries in individuals with severe addiction. Presumably, the higher prevalence of DT among patients with previous episodes of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and other substance abuse can be attributed to the kindling model. Conclusions: Previous episodes of alcohol withdrawal syndrome are the risk factors of delirium tremens attributable to the severity of alcohol dependence. In our opinion, the other risk factors, such as loss of consciousness, suicide attempts in the past and harmful use of other psychoactive substances, are nonspecific to alcohol dependence...|$|R
