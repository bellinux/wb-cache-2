5|$|In {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As <b>developmentally</b> <b>disabled</b> individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E

Traditional treatments for ADD/ADHD, such as stimulant drugs, behavior modification, and cognitive-behavior therapy have had limited, short-term success and many drawbacks. Neurotherapy (or EEG feedback) which addresses the frontal lobe dysfunction, has shown significant, long-term results, by teaching patients to normalize their brainwave responses to stimuli. When Instantaneous Neuronal Activation Procedure (INAP) {{is used in}} adjunct to neurotherapy, treatment time is significantly reduced without losing long-term effects of the therapy. INAP was developed {{on the basis of}} research on hypnotic phenomena. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterized by the inability to self-regulate focused attention. Children with hyperactivity are impulsive and behaviorally disinhibited. The condition is <b>developmentally</b> <b>disabling</b> which, if left uncontrolled persists into adolescence and adulthood.

25|$|Developed by Gertrude Orff at the Kindezentrum München, {{is another}} {{approach}} known as Orff Music Therapy. Both the clinical setting of social pediatrics {{as well as}} the Orff Schulwerk (schoolwork) approach in music education (developed by German composer Carl Orff) influence this method, which is used with children with developmental problems, delays and disabilities. The area of social pediatrics was developed after the Second World War in Germany by Theodor Hellbrügge, who understood that medicine alone could not meet the complex needs of <b>developmentally</b> <b>disabled</b> children. He consulted psychologists, occupational therapists and other mental healthcare professionals whose knowledge and skills could aid in the diagnostics and treatment of children. Gertrude Orff was asked to develop a form of therapy based on the Orff Schulwerk approach to support the emotional development of patients. Elements found in both the music therapy and education approaches include the understanding of holistic music presentation as involving word, sound and movement; the use of both music and play improvisation as providing a creative stimulus for the child to investigate and explore; Orff instrumentation, including keyboard instruments and percussion instruments as a means of participation and interaction in a therapeutic setting; and lastly, the multisensory aspects of music used by the therapist to meet the particular needs of the child, such as both feeling and hearing sound.|$|E

In the case where both parents (or guardians) are not employed, while there are temporary child care needs, on condition {{that they are willing to}} participate in vocational training or search for jobs; or their families are in special circumstances or have suffered especially unfortunate events, they can be covered.

Indeed, professionals from special education, rehabilitation, psychiatry, and social work have all directed attention to {{the development and implementation}} of evaluation and remedial programs. The heightened activity in this area is in part a result of early assessment research with these populations, which provided preliminary evidence of difficulties in social and emotional adjustment in many disabled individuals. In response to these findings, many intervention efforts have been implemented to deal with these issues and improve the life situation of the disabled. Also, there were indications that <b>developmentally</b> and physically <b>disabled</b> children often were deprived of adequate educations. As a result, legal and legislative initiatives have been enacted in recent years to make public education available to all students irrespective of disability. Central to all therapeutic and psycho educational endeavors with the disabled is psychological evaluation. Only through careful and com­prehensive psychological evaluation can areas of deficit as well as strengths be identified. Once treatment targets and goals have been ascertained, psychological evaluation is needed to determine the efficacy of intervention strategies. However, the field of psychological evalua­tion, in general, and with disabled persons, in particular, has become highly specialized.
