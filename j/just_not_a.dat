UGO.com ranked him eleventh in their list of top Mortal Kombat characters, stating that his exclusivity as a hidden character in the original game made him an [...] "arcade legend" [...] and {{set the tone for}} secrets in future titles in the series, and adding, [...] "future games would feature even more hidden enemies and complicated ways of accessing them, but the first was still the best." [...] He was also fifth in Game Revolution's list of top [...] "old school" [...] Mortal Kombat characters", praised for his introduction in Mortal Kombat and his changes in the sequel. IGN listed him as a character {{they would like to see}} as downloadable content for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, noting [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>not</b> (<b>a</b> Mortal Kombat) game without a bevy of palette-swapped ninjas...and our vote goes to Reptile," [...] adding that while the character would be a [...] "pain in the ass to fight sometimes", his inclusion would be [...] "a blessing to have on your side." [...] He was also featured in the 2008 MSN article about the ten greatest Easter eggs in gaming. In 2010 UGO, included him on the list of the 25 coolest hidden characters in video gaming. ScrewAttack placed Reptile at ninth place on their list of top ten Mortal Kombat characters, commenting that anyone who got to fight him in the original Mortal Kombat became a local legend and getting to play as him and turn invisible in Mortal Kombat II was [...] "icing on the cake". In UGO Networks' 2012 list of the top Mortal Kombat characters, Reptile placed as sixth, stating that he is the best hidden character in the series. Cheat Code Central included him in the 2012 list of top ten hidden characters in fighting games at number two.|$|E

2500|$|Scooby-Doo has {{maintained}} a significant fan base, which has grown steadily since the 1990s due to the show's popularity among both young children and nostalgic adults {{who grew up with}} the series. Several television critics have stated that the show's mix of the comedy-adventure and horror genres was the reason for its widespread success. As Fred Silverman and the Hanna-Barbera staff had planned when they first began producing the series, Scooby-Doo's ghosts, monsters and spooky locales tend more towards humor than horror, making them easily accessible to younger children.

He said, [...] "I reveled in the sheer {{brilliance}} of how much energy and gameplay mileage Nintendo has packed into every world." [...] Otero's only complaint was that [...] "the camera becomes a slight obstacle in four-player multiplayer". GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.5, praising its gameplay and presentation, while criticizing camera issues and some odd control choices. GamesRadar gave the game a score of 4.5/5, praising improved multiplayer and some moments so brilliant {{that they can make}} some other levels seem dull by comparison. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku called the game [...] "a terrific Mario game... <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> very good Wii U game", praising the game itself, but lamenting that it doesn't do much to show off the Wii U's capabilities.

Positive reviews have downplayed the personnel changes, pointing out Corgan's dominance over songwriting and music throughout the band's history. The album was praised by April Long of Uncut for its energy {{and retention of}} Smashing Pumpkins' [...] "signature goth-metal-shoegaze sound." [...] Spence D. of IGN gave the album a score of 6.9 out of 10 and said, [...] "Zeitgeist isn't a bad album; it's <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> great album. Which means that it's rather indicative of the times. [...] Here's to hoping that the next Pumpkins outing gives into the experimental urge and builds upon the intriguing elements displayed on the album's final two songs.

[...] John Cruz of Sputnikmusic gave it a score of 3.5 out of 5 and said, [...] "While not enough to stand among the best the Pumpkins have to offer, Zeigeist nonetheless stands fairly well on its own, Smashing Pumpkins or no.

6000|$|Arthur Ashmore was a fresh-coloured, thick-necked English gentleman, {{but he was}} <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> subject; {{he might}} have been a farmer and {{he might have been}} a banker: you could {{scarcely}} paint him in characters. His wife did not make up the amount; she was a large, bright, negative woman, who had the same air as her husband of being somehow tremendously new; a sort of appearance of fresh varnish (Lyon could scarcely tell whether it came from her complexion or from her clothes), so that one felt she ought to sit in a gilt frame, suggesting reference to a catalogue or a price-list. It was as if she were already rather a bad though expensive portrait, knocked off by an eminent hand, and Lyon had no wish to copy that work. The pretty woman on his right was engaged with her neighbour and the gentleman on his other side looked shrinking and scared, so that he had time to lose himself in his favourite diversion of watching face after face. This amusement gave him the greatest pleasure he knew, and he often thought it a mercy that the human mask did interest him and that it was not less vivid than it was (sometimes it ran its success in this line very close), since he was to make his living by reproducing it. Even if Arthur Ashmore would not be inspiring to paint (a certain anxiety rose in him lest if he should make a hit with her father-in-law Mrs. Arthur should take it into her head that he had now proved himself worthy to aborder her husband); even if he had looked a little less like a page (fine as to print and margin) without punctuation, he would still be a refreshing, iridescent surface. But the gentleman four persons off--what was he? Would he be a subject, or was his face only the legible door-plate of his identity, burnished with punctual washing and shaving--the least thing that was decent that you would know him by? ...|$|E
