40|$|<b>Hairy</b> <b>roots</b> <b>disease</b> is an {{important}} problem in cultivation of greenhouse vegetables (tomato, aubergine and cucumber). Infection is caused by rhizogenic bacteria from Agrobacterium/Rhizobium group. It {{has been shown that}} infection process is regulated by environmental factors and quorum sensing mechanism. Rhizogenic bacteria produce acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) as signal molecules, which enable cell-to-cell communication. Disruption of this communication process will most likely lead to lower infection and symptoms. There are several possible routes of quorum quenching. One of them is degradation of pathogenic bacteria’s signal molecules by other microorganisms present in the root environment. Bacteria capable of AHL degradation were previously isolated from natural environment such as soil and water. In this research AHL degrading bacteria were successfully isolated from greenhouse growing substrate rockwool. Application of these micro-organisms in greenhouse practice is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes {{are closely}} related plant {{pathogens}} that cause different diseases, crown gall and <b>hairy</b> <b>root.</b> Both <b>diseases</b> result from transfer, integration, and expression of plasmid-encoded bacterial genes located on the transferred DNA (T-DNA) in the plant genome. Bacterial virulence (Vir) proteins necessary for infection are also translocated into plant cells. Transfer of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and Vir proteins requires a type IV secretion system, a protein complex spanning the bacterial envelope. A. tumefaciens translocates the ssDNA-binding protein VirE 2 into plant cells, where it binds single-stranded T-DNA and helps target it to the nucleus. Although some strains of A. rhizogenes lack VirE 2, they are pathogenic and transfer T-DNA efficiently. Instead, these bacteria express the GALLS protein, which is essential for their virulence. The GALLS protein can complement an A. tumefaciens virE 2 mutant for tumor formation, indicating that GALLS can substitute for VirE 2. Unlike VirE 2, GALLS contains ATP-binding and helicase motifs {{similar to those in}} TraA, a strand transferase involved in conjugation. Both GALLS and VirE 2 contain nuclear localization sequences and a C-terminal type IV secretion signal.

40|$|Introduction Crown gall and <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>disease</b> are plant tumors {{resulting}} from a set of genes with morphogenic effects which alter normal cell development and differentiation being introduced into the nuclear plant genome. Both tumors are induced in many dicotyledonous plants by oncogenic strains of Agrobacterium faciens and A. rhizogenes, respectively et al. 1984; Nester et al. 1984). Virulent bacteria harbor a large (Ti or Ri), a specific segment of which, known as T-DNA, covalently integrates into plant chromosomes, thus initiating the neoplastic transformation. Once growth has been initiated, are not necessary to maintain it, thus allowing the axenic culture of tumor tissue.

40|$|Abstract—Following agrobacterial infection, the Agrobacterium rhizogenes rolA, rolB and rolC {{genes are}} {{transferred}} to plant genome, causing tumor formation and <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>disease.</b> The emerging {{complexity of the}} rol-gene triggered effects and the involvement of signals generated by these genes in basic processes of cell biology such as calcium and ROS signaling and modulation of expression of calcium-dependent protein kinase genes indicate that the plant oncogenes, like some animal protooncogenes, use sophisticated strategies to affect cell growth and differentiation. Recent data raise the intriguing possibility that some components {{of plant and animal}} oncogene signaling pathways share common features. The rol oncogenes are involved in regulation of secondary metabolism performing a function not existing in animals. Studying of processes representing hot spots in animal cell biology, such as the triangle combining the interplay between oncogene expression, ROS production and cell senescence/apoptosis, calcium signaling and processes of protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation will help in understanding functions of the plant oncogenes. In this respect, new directions of rol-gene studies are highlighted in this article underlying the necessity to use metabolomic, genomic and proteomic approaches in further investigations.

40|$|Plant <b>hairy</b> <b>roots</b> {{have been}} widely used in the {{production}} of secondary metabolites because of its stabilization of genetics, fast growth rate and high content of secondary metabolites. In order to enhance the secondary metabolite accumulation, a lot of metabolic regulation methods have been applied in the <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> culture. <b>Hairy</b> <b>roots</b> cultured in liquid medium easily formed dense clumps which impaired the liquid mixing and dissolved oxygen mass transfer. As a result, the growth and secondary metabolism of <b>hairy</b> <b>roots</b> were limited. In this study, ultrasound was employed in Echinacea purpurea <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> culture to trigger off the defence strategy and to reduce the oxygen limitation for enhancing the root growth and cichoric acid production. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method was employed to simulate the hydrodynamics and mass transfer within the <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> clumps in a bioreactor, and it also was used to illustrate the ultrasound intensive effect on the oxygen mass transfer for improving <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> growth and cichoric acid production. An efficient ultrasound-stimulation strategy was developed for improving the <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> growth and cichoric acid biosynthesis in the <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> cultures of E. purpurea. The mechanism of ultrasound effect on <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> growth and metabolism was further discussed. Proper ultrasound strategy stimulated rolB expression, which further increased the endogenous IAA content for one time, and finally shortened the growth cycle for 5 days. The oxidative burst, characterized by rapid and transient production of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion, was triggered by ultrasound. This stimulated the activity of antioxidative enzymes and the metabolism of antioxidative compounds such as flavoniods and phenolic compounds. The marked increase of cichoric acid production in E. purpurea <b>hairy</b> <b>roots</b> was related to the increases of phenylalanine ammonium lyase (PAL) activity stimulated by ultrasound. Multiple ultrasound stimulation with intervals of 5 days produced the highest amount of cichoric acid because of the high PAL activity in the whole culture process. Ultrasound was applied to intensify the bioreactor culture process. Compared with that in the control, <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> biomass and cichoric acid content increased after multiple ultrasound treatment for 6 min each 5 days. A two-dimensional axisymmetric CFD model based on a porous media model and a discrete population balance model was established to investigate the hydrodynamics and mass transfer behavior in an airlift bioreactor for <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> culture.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a large plasmid in A. tumefaciens cells, called the TI-plasmid, besides being {{essential}} for oncogenicity also determines: (1) the specificity and {{the activity of the}} enzyme-system for octopine or nopaline utilisation; (2) the synthesis of either octopine or nopaline in crown gall cells as well as the morphology of the tumors on Kalanchoë stems. A few A. tumefaciens strains give rise to tumors whose cells do not synthesise octopine or nopaline. This indicates that these compounds themselves are not essential for the tumorous nature of the plant cells. Roots induced by the <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>disease</b> bacteria of two A. rhizogenes strains tested do not contain nopaline or octopine. Although octopine or nopaline could also not be detected in normal tissues of Kalanchoë, teratomata and aberrant looking roots developing from tumors do contain the same type of guanidine derivative as present in the tumor from which they develop. This suggests that once synthesis of the unusual guanidine compounds has started in the plant cells as a result of tumor induction, the control system regulating gene expression in each state of differentiation of a cell does not repress the genes coding for these compounds. For the moment, a mechanism of gene addition, i. e. the acquisition of plasmid genes by the plant cells, seems to be less remote to explain the data obtained. However, no direct biochemical data exist to support this theory. Other possibilities are discussed.

Interest has focused on these bacteria because they provide one of the more efficient means of introducing foreign DNA into susceptible plants. Although long recognized as a pathogen of dicotyledonous angiosperms, Agrobacteriwn strains have not generally been regarded as strongly tumorigenic on gymnosperms. Studies were undertaken which identified Agrobacteriwn strains which were both strongly tumongenic and weakly tumorigenic on four pinaceous gymnosperms; A bies procera, Pinusponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Tsuga heterophylla. Identification of opmes in the tumor tissue confirmed host transformation. Strongly tumongenic bacterial strains were also isolated from native galls found on P. menziesü. Certain native bacterial isolates harbored Ti-plasmid sized plasmids and incited rapid tumor development. Successful plant transformation by Agrobacterium requires the induction and expression of a cascade of bacterial virulence genes. This cascade is initiated when periplasmic or transmembrane regions of the bacterial virA protein interact with certain phenolic compounds originating from the host plant. Because it was not known whether the range in bacterial tumorigenicity observed on conifers was due to differences in strain sensitivity to host phenolic compounds, or was due to other causes, studies were undertaken to identify compounds in P. menziesii extracts capable of inducing expression of the Agrobacterium virulence genes. Coniferin was identified as the major inducing compound in P. menziesii extracts. As a glucoside, coniferin has a novel structure in comparison to other Agrobacterium virulence gene inducers which are aglycones. In a representative set ofAgrobacterium strains, interesting parallels exist between levels of bacterial beta-glucosidase, virulence gene induction by coniferin and tumorigenicity levels on conifer hosts.

40|$|Aim: Rhizogenic Agrobacterium biovar 1 strains are the causative {{agent of}} <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>disease</b> (HRD), an {{increasing}} {{problem in the}} hydroponic cultivation of tomato and cucumber in Europe. A previous study has demonstrated that different lineages of rhizogenic agrobacteria are able to form biofilms. Although hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is a frequently used biocide in hydroponic systems, until now its effectiveness to remove rhizogenic agrobacteria {{has not yet been}} unequivocally demonstrated. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy of H 2 O 2 in controlling Agrobacterium-containing biofilms. Methods and Results:. Using lab-scale experiments we found a huge variation between different rhizogenic Agrobacterium biovar 1 strains in EC 50 values, ranging from 18. 8 to 600 ppm H 2 O 2, representing the lowest and highest concentration tested, respectively. Using pilot-scale experiments in which different H 2 O 2 concentrations were tested, treatment with 25 ppm H 2 O 2 was found to be ineffective. In contrast, treatment with 50 ppm significantly affected a catalase-negative Agrobacterium population, while a catalase-positive population was only marginally affected. For the catalase-positive Agrobacterium population, a treatment of 100 ppm H 2 O 2 was required to be effective. Finally, H 2 O 2 treatment of HRD in two commercial greenhouses was monitored, and showed that the H 2 O 2 concentration decreased considerably towards the end of the irrigation circuits. Further, a clear correlation was found between the actual concentration of H 2 O 2 and the incidence of HRD. Conclusion: We showed that H 2 O 2 may be effective to reduce biofilm formation by rhizogenic bacteria. Nevertheless, it was clear from our results that the required H 2 O 2 concentration depends on the particular Agrobacterium strain(s) present in the greenhouse. Significance and Impact of Study: This is the first study that examined the effectiveness of H 2 O 2 to control HRD in hydroponic systems, and the effect of catalase activity on H 2 O 2 effectiveness. Our study has direct relevance for the highly-intensive horticultural sector. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes are {{the causal}} agents of gall or <b>hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>disease,</b> but {{normally}} the bacteria do not cause disease in wheat. However, both bacteria grew without inhibition {{when exposed to}} intact or wounded wheat roots or embryos, and they colonized wheat root surfaces to levels similar to dicotyledonous plants. A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes induced 23 % cell death after a 1 -h exposure to wheat embryo cells grown in 7. 4 mM O 2, while the extent of cell death at 2. 1 mM 02 was 8 %. Contact with A. tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes caused cultured wheat embryo and root cells to rapidly produce H 202, which decreased when embryos and roots were cultured at 2. 1 mM O 2. Browning and autofluorescence, {{and an increase in}} ferulic acid in cell walls, were observed in wheat embryo and root epidermal cells exposed to Agrobacterium, but. neither lignin nor callose was detected. Agrobacterium appeared to induce resistance-like responses in wheat that may limit transformation efficiency. The inability to regenerate wheat plants using tissue culture has been a limitation to high efficiency transformation. Regeneration via somatic embryogenesis was improved significantly by simulating the in ovulo environment to which the immature wheat embryos are exposed. Triticum embryo culture medium (TEC) improved callus formation, somatic embryo formation, and regeneration from somatic embryos while reducing precocious germination when compared to growth on Murashige and Skoog medium. Regeneration frequencies were improved when embryos were cultured at the O 2 concentration found in the wheat ovule (2. 1 mM O 2) rather than atmospheric 02 concentration (7. 4 mM O 2). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of wheat was limited by tissue necrosis following co-cultivation, and by poor plant regeneration. Reduction of necrosis and increased plant regeneration were accomplished by amending the culture medium with antioxidant compounds and by reducing the O 2 tension in which the wheat embryos were cu 1 tured. Twelve days past anthesis (DPA), wheat embryos were co-cultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains WAg 11 or EHA 101, incubated on TEC medium containing antioxidant compounds (catalase, cysteine and ascorbic acid), and cultured at 2. 1 mM O 2 concentrations.

40|$|Crazy roots” (also {{known as}} “hairy root disease”) caused by rhizogenic Agrobacterium biovar 1 strains {{has become a}} major problem in {{hydroponics}} greenhouses, especially in the cultivation of tomato and cucumber (Weller et al., 2006). <b>Hairy</b> <b>root</b> <b>disease</b> is characterized by excessive root development, leading to a strong vegetative growth and severe losses in marketable yield. Importantly, infections are often persistent as many Agrobacterium strains are able to form biofilms in the irrigation system. Prevention and removal of biofilms are considered to be crucial in management of the disease. To this end, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is frequently used in hydroponics systems as a disinfecting agent. However, in a recent study it was demonstrated that many rhizogenic Agrobacterium biovar 1 strains show catalase activity, enabling them to survive exposure to H 2 O 2 (Bosmans et al., 2015). Therefore, the effectiveness of H 2 O 2 to control Agrobacterium containing biofilms can be questioned. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of H 2 O 2 to control biofilms that harbour rhizogenic agrobacteria using a pilot-scale system. Material and Methods Experiments were performed using the pilot-scale system described by Vankerckhoven et al., (2011). Briefly, the system consists of four subsystems (allowing to test different H 2 O 2 concentrations at once), each containing a water container. From each container water was pumped through a piping system harboring a biofilm sampling device consisting of polycarbonate rings. Following inoculation with Agrobacterium (106 cells per ml), biofilms were allowed to develop on the polycarbonate rings for 65 h. Subsequently, H 2 O 2 was applied at different concentrations, including 25 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm. A treatment in which no H 2 O 2 was applied was used as negative control. Next, every 24 h bulk water and biofilm samples were taken to quantify the number of Agrobacterium cells as well as the total number of culturable bacteria. Quantification was performed by quantitative PCR (rhizogenic agrobacteria; Bosmans et al., 2016), and traditional culture-plate enumeration on Plate Count Agar, respectively. The experiment was performed for a catalase-positive and catalase-negative Agrobacterium biovar 1 strain. Results and Conclusions While application of 25 ppm H 2 O 2 was ineffective for both the catalase-positive and catalase-negative strain, substantial differences between both strains were observed for the other concentrations tested. More particularly, while treatment of the catalase-negative strain with 50 ppm resulted in a significant reduction in Agrobacterium cells, the same treatment was ineffective for the catalase-positive Agrobacterium strain. When 100 ppm H 2 O 2 was applied both the catalase positive and catalase negative strain were affected. These results clearly indicate that the efficacy of the H 2 O 2 treatment is strongly dependent on the particular Agrobacterium strain present in the greenhouse. Moreover, the presence of a catalase-positive Agrobacterium strain is able to protect other bacteria against H 2 O 2 treatment as well. Altogether, our data suggest that the treatment against hairy roots disease should be attuned to the specific Agrobacterium strain present in the greenhouse. status: publishe...|$|E
