5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes are an ever-present threat {{during the}} summer and fall season, which puts Galveston in Coastal Windstorm Area. Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula are {{generally}} at the <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> among the communities near the Galveston Bay. However, though the island and peninsula provide some shielding, the bay shoreline still faces significant danger from storm surge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> in flying is in takeoff and landing, {{meaning that}} longer {{aircraft}} trips are safer per mile. Commuter planes used on shorter flights have higher risk than larger jet aircraft. Driving on U.S. Interstate highways, which {{are almost always}} controlled-access divided highways, is safer than driving on most other roads and highways.|$|E

5|$|FreeFall Stage {{discouraged}} {{people under the}} age of fifteen from attending because of {{the subject matter of the}} play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at the <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> of being trafficked. Several human trafficking survivors attended the performances, and other survivors sent the Eldridges messages about their personal experiences with human trafficking. Quandt said that he encountered many audience members who, because of watching the play, became determined to do something to combat human trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Gedi {{was made}} a {{historic}} monument in 1927. The site was declared a protected monument in 1929, after looters began removing Chinese porcelain inset as architectural decoration. In 1939, the Kenya Public Works Department began restoring structures that were at the <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> of collapse. Further site restoration, primarily clearing vegetation overgrowth, was conducted in 1948–1959 by James Kirkman, who was appointed warden of the site after Gedi and the surrounding forest was declared a national park in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E

Cheque and credit card fraud was also more prevalent against English speaking businesses...|$|R

5|$|The blast {{caused by}} a sudden release of the gas {{pressure}} inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged. The <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause of failure can range from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.|$|E
5|$|Radioisotopes of caesium {{require special}} precautions: the {{improper}} handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources {{can lead to}} release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute the <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> to health. Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste.|$|E
50|$|Sullivan and Knutson found, in 2000, that {{children}} with intellectual disabilities were at slightly <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of sexual abuse than disabled children in general, who in turn were at 3.14 times <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of experiencing sexual abuse than non-disabled children.|$|R
50|$|Patients with {{epilepsy}} face a <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of accidents, {{injury and}} other medical conditions than the general population. A European study showed that people with epilepsy were at <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> for accidental injuries related to seizures such as concussions, abrasions and wounds and reported more hospitalizations and medical action than the general population. Other {{studies have shown that}} people with epilepsy are at a <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of seizure related drowning, suffocation, broken bones and burns and more likely to die in a fatal automobile crash.|$|R

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E

2500|$|Rather than stating a {{flat rate}} of {{morbidity}} or mortality, many factors are reported {{as contributing to}} the relative risk of the procedure and anesthetic combined. [...] For instance, [...] an operation on {{a person who is}} between the ages of 60–79 years old places the patient at 2.32 times <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> than someone less than 60 years old. [...] Having an ASA score of 3, 4 or 5 places the person at 10.65 times <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> than someone with an ASA score of 1 or 2. [...] Other variables include age greater than 80 (3.29 times risk compared to those under 60), gender (females have a lower risk of 0.77), urgency of the procedure (emergencies have a 4.44 times <b>greater</b> <b>risk),</b> experience of the person completing the procedure (less than 8 years experience and/or less than 600 cases have a 1.06 times <b>greater</b> <b>risk)</b> and the type of anesthetic (regional anesthetics are lower risk than general anesthetics). Obstetrical, the very young and the very old are all at <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of complication so extra precautions may need to be taken.|$|R
