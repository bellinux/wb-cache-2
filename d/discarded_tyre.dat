Button's final pit stop while 7 seconds ahead, on lap 39, was delayed {{due to an}} error on the left rear wheel and allowed Rosberg back into the lead. Following Button's pit stop, Rosberg now led Massa by 19.1 seconds in clear command and within sight of victory as highlighted by his engineer saying [...] "most important thing is your looking after the tyres". Finally Massa pitted from second place, but he now released a Räikkönen-led train of cars. On lap 43, eleven cars could be seen {{from one end to}} the other of the long back DRS straight. Alonso went wide on turn 7 onto the <b>discarded</b> <b>tyre</b> marbles while trying to overtake Maldonado and nearly collected the Sauber of Sergio Pérez on the way back onto track. Grosjean who was a part of the train went wide in turn 7 (like Alonso) and lost grip on tyre marbles while trying to overtake Vettel, consequently losing some positions. By lap 49 Räikkönen's tyres appeared to hit the 'cliff' and lose effective tyre performance. In the space of 2 laps Räikkönen went from 2nd to 12th.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The rapid {{progress}} {{made by the}} country brings with it the consequences of industrialization and the accompanied environmental hazards with it. One such environmental problem is the disposal of waste generated by modern society and <b>discarded</b> <b>tyres.</b> <b>Discarded</b> <b>tyres</b> are a non-degradable waste product with a great capacity of polluting the environment. This paper investigates the feasibility of using these tyres as an inert material in concrete. Rubber fibers obtained by the shredding and grinding of tyres is incorporated in concrete. Various fresh concrete and hardened concrete properties are studied. The performance of the concrete after treatment with NaOH solution is also investigated. Finally, rubberized concrete based tiles study was carried out...|$|R
40|$|M. A. Waste {{management}} {{has always been}} a delegated responsibility, undertaken on behalf of the public by authorities, industry and specialist waste management contractors. In South Africa, there are neither regulations nor measures to deal with the accumulation of used tyres or to control the disposal thereof. Municipalities for example, have no plans in place to deal with used tyres generated and some landfills refuse to dispose of used tyres. As a result, used tyres have been disposed haphazardly, at times stockpiled and burnt and thereby present an environmental problem. This research investigates <b>discarded</b> <b>tyres</b> as an aspect of solid waste, as well as options that may be taken for their disposal. The research points to the current waste tyre disposal problems. These disposal problems are a result of the chemical composition of tyres, their size and shape. It was found that although there has been a proliferation of environmental legislation, no regulation ensures that <b>discarded</b> <b>tyres</b> are systematically collected for appropriate disposal. Given the undesirable consequences of inappropriate waste tyre disposal, three recommendations are made: An integrated national waste management policy, in which a workable public participation is formalised, will determine the future of used tyre management including the management of <b>discarded</b> <b>tyres.</b> This requires an attractive incentive to collect and appropriately dispose of used tyres. Allowance has to be made for entrepreneurs to determine the most efficient and less expensive way of used tyre disposal to achieve environmentally desirable outcomes. Non-subsidised markets are therefore recommended. There are possibilities of using used <b>tyres</b> that are <b>discarded</b> as raw materials in other industries. Technologies that take advantage of the fuel value and steel in used tyres should be explored and encouraged. <b>Discarded</b> <b>tyres</b> can also be used for some constructions or in the manufacture of some new products. ¨ South Africa may have to consider legislation for the collection, transfer and reprocessing of used tyres. The rate of waste tyre generation is also an outcome of tyre design. The possibility of producing tyres that are environmentally friendly should be explored. Discussions are taking place within the tyre manufacturing industries in South Africa to formulate and implement sustainable plans that will address the problems of waste tyre disposal...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} {{the performance of}} concrete mixtures incorporating 5 %, 7. 5 % and 10 % of <b>discarded</b> <b>tyre</b> rubber as aggregate and cement replacements was investigated. Numerous projects have been conducted on replacement of aggregates by crumb rubbers but scarce data are found on cementitious filler addition in the literature. Hence to examine characteristics of tyre crumb-containing concrete, two sets of concrete specimens were made. In the first set, different percentages by weight of chipped rubber were replaced for coarse aggregates {{and in the second}} set scrap-tyre powder was replaced for cement. Selected standard durability and mechanical test were performed and the results were analysed. The mechanical tests included compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity. The durability tests included permeability and water absorption. The results showed that with up to 5 % replacement, in each set, no major changes on concrete characteristics would occur, however, with further increase in replacement ratios considerable changes were observed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Using <b>discarded</b> <b>tyre</b> rubber as {{concrete}} aggregate {{is an effective}} solution to the environmental problems associated with disposal of this waste material. However, adding rubber as aggregate in concrete mixture changes, the mechanical properties of concrete, depending mainly on the type and amount of rubber used. An appropriate model is required to describe the behaviour of rubber concrete in engineering applications. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show how a new evolutionary data mining technique, evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR), is used to predict the mechanical properties of rubber concrete. Design/methodology/approach – EPR is a data-driven method based on evolutionary computing, aimed to search for polynomial structures representing a system. In this technique, a combination of the genetic algorithm and the least square method is used to find feasible structures and the appropriate constants for those structures. Findings – Data from 70 cases of experiments on rubber concrete are used for development and validation of the EPR models. Three models are developed relating compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and elastic modulus to a number of physical parameters that are known to contribute to the mechanical behaviour of rubber concrete. The most outstanding characteristic of the proposed technique is that it provides a transparent, structured, and accurate representation of the behaviour of the material in the form of a polynomial function, giving insight to the user about the contributions of different parameters involved. The proposed model shows excellent agreement with experimental results, and provides an fficient method for estimation of mechanical properties of rubber concrete. Originality/value – In this paper, a new evolutionary data mining approach is presented for the analysis of mechanical behaviour of rubber concrete. The new approach overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional and artificial neural network-based methods presented in the literature for the analysis of slopes. EPR provides a viable tool to find a structured representation of the system,which allows the user to gain additional information on how the system performs...|$|E
40|$|Bitumen is {{a mixture}} of organic liquids which is black, high {{viscosity}} and it is sticky materials where it can be applied in several of application. Waste sludge can be used as another alternative to formulate the bitumen by manipulating ratio needed. Waste sludge consists of mineral oil solid waste, which includes oily sand, tank bottoms and other three kinds of sludge from refineries such as dissolved air flotation scum, excessively activated oily sludge and bottom sludge of oil from pools. Waste sludge is the major source of pollution produced in the process of oilfield production and development. In order to formulate the bitumen, other material that is needed include mineral oil, waste sludge and crumb rubber. The form of crumb rubber is form from <b>discarded</b> <b>tyre.</b> Generally, the tyre rubber is ground to a particulate or crumb prior to adding it to bitumen. This form of the tyre rubber is called Crumb Rubber and the mineral oil is used as the medium to heat up the crumb rubber until it is melt and dissolved. The main objective in this experiment is to formulate and identify the best ratio of the bitumen produced. The method that is used to formulate is heating and mixing process which is being conducted inside the fume hood. So that it can absorb the fume released when the process is conducted. The key parameter during the process is weight of the sample, temperature, time and the speed of the mixer (rpm). Once it is produced, then the sample need to analyse based on the density 15 °C using ASTM D 70 method, viscosity test by using ASTM D 2170, penetration @ 25 °C test which by using ASTM 5 method and softening point test which is by using ASTM D 36 method. The best ratio by far is (1 : 2 : 1. 2) formulation by having viscosity of 93 centipoise, density of 1. 0398 Kg/L, softening point which is at 62 °C and penetration which is at > 40 mm of penetration. The sample that is formulated were then being compared with the actual bitumen sampl...|$|E

The study revealed appreciable increase in ultimate bearing pressure and decrease in settlement with the provision of a single layer reinforcement. Further, rubber grid performed better than the Geo-grid in respect to BCR and SRF.

The use of waste tyre shreds as fill material in geotechnical applications can help to mitigate the waste tyre disposal problems.

With regard to this, an investigation into tyre shreds mixed with sandy soils of South Africa was undertaken to assess the shear strength behaviour of the sand-tyre shred composite and to propose an alternative use of the scrap tyres produced every year...|$|R

The <b>Discarded</b> vehicle <b>tyres</b> which are historically been disposed of into landfills constitute an important part of the solid waste. Tyre disposal to landfills is problematic, as waste rubber is not easily biodegradable. An emerging field for the reuse of scrap tyres is in the production of concrete, where rubber tyres can be used as a partial replacement to natural aggregates.

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} overcome the two problems of low-quality soil {{and a growing number}} of <b>discarded</b> <b>tyres</b> bymixing low-CBR soil with recycled tyre chips. The compound soil-tyre chips was then stabilised by Portland cement with theaim of using them as a new material in road construction in order to reduce the occurrence of shrinkage cracks. To achievethe purposes of this research three standard geotechnical testing programmes were employed: (1) modified compaction tests,(2) California Bearing Ratio tests (CBR), and (3) unconfined compression tests. The modified compaction test results provedthat for the mixtures having very low tyre chips and cement content, the behaviour is very complex. It was also observed thatthe greater the percentage of rubber added the lower the global density. However, this is predictable as the specific gravityof the rubber is much lower than that of the soil. For the relationship between the optimum moisture content (OMC) and thecement content, it was observed that there is no clear pattern. For the specimens having no cement added, the CBR for unsoaked specimens was observed to be greater than that forsoaked specimens. However, when the cement was introduced the CBR test showed that the resistance to penetration for thesoaked specimens was significantly greater, indicating the effects of cement added on the strength. In addition, it was foundthat the CBR values for both soaked and unsoaked specimens gradually increased with the increase of cement content. Lastly, the unconfined compressive strength progressively increased with the increased percentage of cement...|$|R
40|$|Recycling of {{worn out}} tyres has {{obtained}} a great interest. Great efforts are therefore devoted {{to find new}} fields of application of ground tyre rubber (GTR). A method {{that has the potential}} of utilising large numbers of <b>discarded</b> <b>tyres</b> involves grinding the rubber into small particles and then reusing it as a filler in thermoplastic, thermoset and rubber compounds. However, the incorporation of GTR particles into polymer matrices significantly impairs the properties of the resulting composites. This is because of the poor matrix-filler adhesion and the lack of reactive sites on the GTR particle surface. There are several ways to 'upcycle' GTR. This thesis aimed at developing a suitable surface treatment for GTR particles by chemical modification in order to improve their compatibility with polar matrix materials. Rubbers were treated by ultraviolet light (UV) initiated grafting of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA). The viability of this grafting was first shown at unvulcanized and vulcanized styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). Note that SBR is the major component in tyre mixtures. Major parameters of the grafting reaction affecting the grafting degree, the amount of undesired by-products and the crosslinking degree were studied and optimized for SBR. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and elemental analysis have been used for chemical characterization of the treated rubbers.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the use of fossil carbon (oil, natural gas, coal) to {{manufacture}} materials (‘products of non-energy use') and with the potential to reduce the inputs of fossil resources and the emissions of fossil CO 2 in Germany. An overview of the material flows is given for Germany in 1995. Recycled and re-used products still accounted for less than 10 % of the end products consumed domestically. The energy requirements and CO 2 emissions from the production and waste management processes related to non-energy use have been calculated: it is estimated that approximately 1700 PJ of finite primary energy are consumed and 57 Mt of fossil CO 2 emissions are released (1995). Compared with the total German industry (without non-energy use) this represents 44 % of the energy use and 20 % of the fossil CO 2 emissions. Detailed analyses are performed {{in order to determine the}} extent to which the energy consumed by and the CO 2 emissions released from this system could be reduced. This is done by estimating the possible effects of (a) using waste as a resource, and (b) using biomass as a feedstock. In the first group recycling, re-use and enhanced energy recovery are investigated for plastics, <b>discarded</b> <b>tyres,</b> technical rubber products, asphalt, industrial bitumen and waste lubricants. The second group, i. e. the analysed bio-based materials, comprises of oleochemical surfactants, lubricants from vegetable oils, starch polymers and selected bulk chemicals. The total potential savings related to waste use and biomass use (see above (a) and (b)) are estimated at 220 PJ of gross finite energy and 14 Mt of gross fossil CO 2. This is the equivalent of a 13 % saving in energy and a 24 % reduction in CO 2 emissions. Hence, the saving potential identified on the non-energy side is comparable with the saving potential discussed and negotiated for CO 2 mitigation through energy efficiency improvements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the effectiveness of}} a less expensive adsorbent, a <b>discarded</b> rubber <b>tyre</b> (DRT) in removing toluene from aqueous phase. Adsorption of toluene on a DRT has been studied by using batch system at 25 and 30 °C. It was found that up to 70 % of toluene was removed for the range of toluene initial concentrations studied between 50 - 300 mg/l. Using linearized forms of equilibrium models, namely Langmuir and Freundlich models, the maximum adsorptive capacities were determined. It was evident from the experimental data that, although both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models could describe the isotherm data, the adsorption of toluene on a DRT was described well by the Freundlich isotherm. For Freundlich K values, sorption capacities were 6. 6374 and 7. 7535 mg/l at 25 and 30 °C, respectively. The values of Freundlich exponent n were greater than one for both temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Number of {{proposed}} highways in Sri Lanka {{are to be}} constructed over sites underlain by soft peaty clay, due to scarcity of land. In {{order to ensure that}} the in-service settlements of these roads are small enough and the road could function satisfactorily, number of special ground improvements techniques are to be adopted. An alternate approach that could be considered is the use of a lightweight fill material in the construction. Extremely lightweight fill material such as expanded and extruded polystyrene blocks were used in a number of developed countries in the construction of road embankments over soft ground and in landslide repair. However, these materials are to be imported to the country and would be very expensive. As such, from a local point of view, a process involving the use of such materials would not be economically competitive. In order to find an economically feasible solution, the lightweight fill materials should be developed with the locally available inexpensive raw materials. As such, lightweight fill materials were developed locally by mixing with different proportions of tyre chips with lateritic soil, sawdust with lateritic soil and paddy husk with lateritic soil. Tyre chips were obtained by shredding <b>discarded</b> motorcar <b>tyres.</b> Sawdust was obtained from wood mill waste and paddy husk was obtained from rice mill waste. The developed fill material should of sufficiently low density and workable. Different mix proportions were tried out to get several suitable mixes. The developed material should be sufficiently incompressible and should possess adequate shear strength. Further detailed tests were conducted on selected mixes to establish their engineering characteristics in relation to strength and stiffness. The effectiveness of the use of lightweight fill material in the embankment construction was studied in detail by the finite element package CRISP. The set criterion was that the in-service settlement of the road should be less than 50 mm. This was achieved through the preloading process. In this study a comparison was done for two different approaches; one constructed with lateritic soil and the other incorporating the developed lightweight fills in the preloading process. The placement of the fill layers, the settlement of the peaty clay, the effect of the removal of the preload and the application of the pavement and traffic load was studied with a fully coupled Modified Cam clay constitutive model. Parametric analyses were also done varying the thickness of the embankment and the peaty clay. The process was found to be helpful in reducing the construction period and consumed fill volume. The advantages were more prominent with the increase of embankment height and soft layer thickness...|$|R
40|$|Minimising {{environmental}} impact from buildings and building construction processes while providing thermal {{comfort to the}} occupants {{are some of the}} main goals of green building design. Many different approaches exist to achieve these goals, one of which is the “Earthship”, invented by American architect Michael Reynolds. The Earthship is an earth-sheltered autonomous house with walls made substantially from waste products, most notably, <b>discarded</b> car <b>tyres.</b> This thesis presents original research to investigate claims about Earthship performance: that it provides passive thermal comfort in any climate and is the most sustainable green building design in the world. This investigation has been conducted by using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the overall {{environmental impact}} of the Earthship and to compare it to a variety of similar building types characterised by their wall construction materials and other design features. To support assumptions in the LCA, a Post Occupancy Evaluation and a Thermal Performance study were conducted to estimate heating and cooling energy use in a variety of climates. The environmental credentials of the Earthship are then compared to that of other housing types, using both the LCA and thermal modelling approaches. A post occupancy evaluation (POE) of Earthship homes in Taos, New Mexico, USA, was conducted. This included interviews and surveys of the occupants, and monitoring of the indoor thermal environment. Some aspects of the POE were also extended to an international cohort of Earthship occupants to help justify the assumptions that Earthships provide a level of amenity comparable to conventional housing. The indoor monitored data were also used to calibrate a thermal simulation model of an Earthship home in Taos to ensure the accuracy of the model. The tested approach and parameters to model this Earthship were then used in a model to predict the indoor temperature and theoretical heating and cooling energy requirement of an Earthship design in cold climates and in a warm Mediterranean climate of Adelaide, Australia – the particular context of the LCA study. Thermal modelling of other building types, characterised by their wall materials, was conducted for the Adelaide climate, to predict the heating and cooling energy requirement which was needed for the comparative LCA study. The research produced the following results. Firstly, in the extreme climate of Taos, the Earthship is able to provide thermal comfort without active heating and cooling systems, and that people are generally very satisfied with the level of comfort and amenity provided. Secondly, in the Adelaide climate, Earthship performance would be similar to Taos; approaching zero energy use for heating and cooling, while in cold and overcast climates minimal space heating may be required. Finally, in the Adelaide climate and context, of all the house types considered, the Earthship had the least environmental impacts and these were considerably less than conventional grid connected homes. The Earthship’s comparatively low environmental impact arises from the holistic design, in particular the greenhouse and earth-sheltering, which enable occupants to be extremely energy and water efficient, and therefore live within the limits of modestly sized “off-grid” systems (autonomously) while still enjoying a high level of comfort and amenity. The use of tyres to construct the Earthship’s external walls proved to be a low impact method for constructing a retaining wall capable of being earth-sheltered. The study has provided scientific evidence about the thermal performance and environmental credentials of the Earthship and other housing types, supporting claims that Earthships can provide passive thermal comfort in many climates and that it may be the most sustainable green building design compared to the other building types investigated by this study.
