500|$|... {{came off}} as {{peculiar}} [...] Not a typical relationship. A lot of macho men {{see the movie}} and like Guy's character, because he doesn't give me any special treatment. I think we come off as a couple that has that has a genuine and deep connection. He is always there for me, but he's not impressed. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> are sort of The Honeymooners, only I'm the Jackie Gleason character. Obviously, he irritates me on a significant basis, as everyone's significant other does.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which O'Malley's colleagues were {{laughing}} at his funeral was one of Vernoff's favorite scenes. She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. And {{then there are the}} editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that’s what <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's design {{came from}} Iwata, {{who was able}} to {{transport}} his original ideas directly into the game as far as the NES' graphical capabilities could be taken at that time. He said: [...] "the goal was really to try to pull off the best graphics on the NES to date. Simple graphics were more or less the standard on the NES at the time but I had this firm belief {{that it was possible to}} do something better, something prettier. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> pulled it off and were able to show people what could be done [...] It left an impression around the office, and from what I've heard [...] influenced the work of other games that were later made by other NES developers as well." [...] The game's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft's staff and an outside composer, Naoki Kodaka, who had previously worked on scores for many of the company's other titles. Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that [...] "none of those people are working together anymore since they've all separated from Sunsoft [...] ".|$|E

5000|$|Jordan Ireland was {{critical}} about the album: [...] "With this album <b>I</b> don’t really <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> nailed it, we’re definitely {{falling into a}} lot of categories that’ve been done before and <b>I</b> don’t <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it’s anything completely original or anything like that, but that’s kind of the goal that we’re heading towards." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} also subject to less {{favorable}} reviews from critics who were {{disappointed with the}} gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of Time Out [...] "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
500|$|The Robot Masters {{featured}} {{in some of}} the previous Mega Man games were the result of design contests held in Japan, in which fans of the series would submit their character ideas to Capcom. Keeping with the tradition, Japan held a design contest for Mega Man 6. After the release of Mega Man 5, the magazine Nintendo Power held a similar contest in North America. Only eight out of the more than 200,000 worldwide character submissions for Mega Man 6 were accepted for the game. Six of the Robot Masters were designed by Japanese fans, while the remaining two (Knight Man and Wind Man) were designed by North American fans who entered the Nintendo Power contest. The North American cover of the game pays homage to the two designers by featuring their Robot Masters on it. [...] Inafune admitted that it was stressful when the last characters being designed for the game were not meeting with the development team's schedule. He concluded, [...] "For having hit a lot of roadblocks, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> got a lot done for 6. The theme for our designs was 'The world is our stage,' and I really enjoyed bringing what I felt was the unique flavor of different countries into the game." [...] Yuko Takehara, credited as [...] "Yuko", composed the musical score for Mega Man 6. Takehara collaborated with several other composers for the follow-up Mega Man 7 in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Turner {{himself had}} this to say of the album, fully {{cognizant}} that it would be the band's last: [...] "I don't know if looking back many years from now if Wavering Radiant will be my favorite Isis record or not, but <b>I</b> certainly <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it's the best record we were capable of making at the time, and <b>I</b> also <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> didn't compromise in any really significant way the spirit or ideology behind the band in making it. And sonically speaking, I think it sounds really good, so that makes me happy, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I co-wrote {{more with}} Marc on this record than with Jim {{in the last}} five years. I think we are more like-minded. I think that we both have been closer to the same ideal, and a great group is always the sum total of the {{individuals}} that comprise the group. This band is the sum total of the individuals that are in it — we're different than Concrete Blonde. <b>I</b> just <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> are at the same place at the same time." ...|$|R
40|$|By {{analyzing}} Japanese data, we {{will show}} that causals express not only causations (that is the "dynamic relations") such as (a) but also what I call the "static relations" such as (b). The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze the static causal and to reveal its function. (a) Because I dropped the vase, it is broken. (b) Because it is autumn, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> crying. The static causals are based on connotation. In the case of (b), the sentence reports the particular instance of connotation such as (c). (c) Whenever it is autumn, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> crying. <b>We</b> argue that the background common knowledge that sustains the expression (b) is highlighted by the static relations...|$|R
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anderson played guitar for the {{experimental}} rock project Amps for Christ until the early 2000s. In 2006, she shaped the noise-folk band Gowns with The Mae Shi member and then-boyfriend Ezra Buchla. On February 5, 2010, Anderson announced the official disbandment of Gowns, which coincided with the ending of her personal relationship with Buchla. In the announcement, Anderson wrote [...] "We were tapping into some very raw emotions, and I'm ultimately proud of the risks we took. In spite of anything else, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were honest, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were brave."

2500|$|In May 2008, Switchfoot {{moved into}} their new studio which they called Spot X, and {{recording}} {{for the record}} was {{kicked into high gear}} in June, with the band proceeding without a producer. [...] "I feel like we've got a fairly firm grip on {{what we want to do}} and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> can get there on our own", Switchfoot singer Jon Foreman said at the time. Progress was halted briefly when the band embarked on the Music Builds Tour in August, but was resumed soon after.|$|E
50|$|In February 2012, Bullard told Reuters that a {{third round}} of {{quantitative}} easing would only be necessary if the U.S. economy deteriorates and inflation drops, adding that the U.S. economy was not in such a situation. On Sept. 13, 2012, the FOMC announced {{the third round of}} bond-buying, dubbed QE3. Bullard, who was not a voting member of the FOMC at that time, told financial media that he would have voted against QE3: “I would have voted against it based on the timing. <b>I</b> didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had a good enough case to make a major move at this juncture,” Bullard told Reuters.|$|R
500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like,</b> by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. <b>I</b> didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had to put a photo on the cover, I {{wanted it to be}} more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't a bad idea," [...] she declared. [...] "Where are {{we going}} to play bridge, Cecil? In some smaller room, I hope. This one is really {{beginning}} to get on my nerves a little.

Ugh! <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a Goth. <b>We</b> are too modern for this place, Cecil." ...|$|R

Sulkowicz confirmed the authenticity and time stamps of the messages, but included her annotations. Sulkowicz believed that Paul sent the message to avoid suspicion and said her response was so that Nungesser would not be scared to discuss the incident.|$|E

That's when the 'Nothing' album came out.' I {{just wanted to make}} some good music that would affect people in a good way." [...] Williams says it wasn't easy. N*E*R*D worked on [...] "a previous body of work which was really good, but it wasn't timeless to me. <b>I</b> didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were pushing ourselves as much as we could. We needed to perfect the sound, so we kept pushing the date back until it was right." [...] The result includes [...] "a lot of vintage sounds...The album is very '68-'72, '73, America meets Crosby, Stills & Nash meets Moody Blues." ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 20, 2017, Dallas {{said in a}} {{red carpet}} {{interview}} at the People's Choice Awards: [...] "For sure. 100% {{there will be a}} season 2. ... I think it's gonna dive deeper more into my relationship between my mom and sister, and then kind of a more in-depth view on where we're going and what's continuing to go on, because we're only taking steps forward, so <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the more <b>we</b> go, the more interesting it gets". Dallas also stated that the second season would feature a different premise altogether.|$|R
5000|$|According to Gibbard, guitarist and {{producer}} Chris Walla's writing contributions were key during the album's writing and recording: [...] "There {{are a few}} songs that Chris wrote all the music for. I cut and pasted and wrote lyrics and arrangements for them. This {{is the first time}} that we've had multiple compositions that started with Chris's demos and not mine, which is exciting." [...] Gibbard continued to praise Walla's contributions, stating: [...] "I'm down with Chris screwing around with what he wants to do. He's yet to lead us down the wrong path. I think we're constantly trying to reinvent the band without losing sight of who <b>we</b> are. <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> went all Kid A on everyone. But there are moments on this record where we looked at each other and said, 'Oh, man, fans of The Photo Album (2001) are going to wonder what's going on here.'" ...|$|R

Tonight's result hasn't changed my opinion on that. I'm looking forward to it, obviously. You love to get that qualifying spot on Sunday, but we really earned it tonight, to start on the front row, which is even better. It was definitely a great way to start the season." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 2008 interview, {{contributor}} Graham Linehan {{admitted to}} {{mixed feelings about}} Jam: [...] "Jam wouldn't be my favourite thing of Chris's, {{and it was the}} one where <b>I</b> didn't really <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were contributing a lot. Its mood was so grim that I just found it difficult to join in. I think that Chris was just interested in tying people in moral knots - giving them a moral problem and then just twisting it so they have to do something awful {{to get out of the}} first moral problem. Although this is a secondary impulse for him, he's also interested in pushing buttons that haven't been pushed in comedy in people; making them laugh in a way that they're not used to. ...

500|$|Several viewers {{outside the}} film industry, such as evangelical pastors and commentators, argued that Frozen {{promotes}} normalization of homosexuality, while others {{believed that the}} main character, Elsa, represents a positive image of LGBT youth, viewing the film and the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} coming out. These claims were met with mixed reactions from both audiences and the LGBT community. Writing for Film International, Robert Geal has argued that while the film offers a superficially progressive vision of homosexuality, it perpetuates conservative notions about sexuality and gender; whereas Elsa's female homosexuality is rendered visually pleasurable to a male gaze, male transgressions of heterosexuality are coded in various negative ways. When asked about perceptions of a homosexual undertone in the film, Lee said, [...] "We know what we made. But at the same time <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> once <b>we</b> hand the film over, it belongs to the world, so I don't like to say anything, and let the fans talk. I think it's up to them."

Eventually Wheeler and Ritter decided to form the All-American Rejects.

[...] Excerpt from [...] "Ruiz gives Phils the feeling they hit the lottery", by Jim Salisbury in The Philadelphia Inquirer, March 29, 2008 [...] Ruiz struggled to hit consistently throughout the season, specifically in the first half; {{from the beginning of}} the year until July 11, he hit [...]206 with 2 home runs and 20 RBIs. Nevertheless, due to his rapport with the pitching staff (pitchers' ERA when throwing to him (catcher's ERA) was 3.56, the best for any catcher in the National League (NL)), and a vote of confidence from manager Charlie Manuel, he was secure in his position. In late July, he had a multi-hit game against the New York Mets, which may have helped him break out of his slump.

[...] Producer Harry Fraud also spoke about {{how long it took}} to complete the album, saying: [...] "We really only started working on it at New Year’s. And it came out in June. So there hasn’t really been that much time because we worked on it so quick. That’s important, because <b>I</b> kind of <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> captured that moment for ourselves.
