He also, on Death In June's Brown Book, gave Fire + Ice's Ian Read his first exposure: through work with former Death In June member Tony Wakeford's Sol Invictus and solo work in Fire + Ice Ian Read has also become a significant figure in this field, as documented in Diesel and Gerich's Looking For Europe.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with reviewers generally calling [...] "Papa's Cabin" [...] a solid finale to the Dean O'Dell mystery {{but one that}} was less entertaining than previous mystery-ending episodes. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode an 8.2 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "great". He wrote that it was [...] "an interesting episode that went against the grain {{as far as what}} the show <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> similar reveals in the past." [...] While stating that Tim being the actual murderer was not very surprising, the reviewer felt satisfied with the scene in which Veronica pieces the clues together to implicate Tim. He also commented on how [...] "Papa's Cabin" [...] differed from previous mystery-ending episodes by having lower stakes, a characteristic he felt was appropriate. He thought it was similar to a traditional detective story model, meaning that it [...] "fell in line with the feel of the show." [...] However, he did not enjoy the fact that Fabian's character was being written out of the show. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, lauded the episode. He referred to the conclusion of the Dean O'Dell story arc as the closure to a conventional mystery in the sense that Veronica and Keith slowly built up evidence instead of stumbling on one incriminating object by chance. The reviewer also thought that the episode provided an intellectually satisfying conclusion to the mystery and that it [...] "maintains that level of involvement." ...|$|E

King Zeal leaves the Sun Stone, the trigger for the revival of Zeal, with a follower {{and walks to the}} North Cape. He reveals that Lavos survived defeat in Chrono Trigger and clung to life in the Darkness Beyond Time. He used the Frozen Flame to revive King Zeal, manipulating him to take revenge on the heroes. He is now merging with Schala, as he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> all the other [...] "Arbiters" [...] who have used the Frozen Flame throughout history. Lavos calls King Zeal, intending to merge with him as well and evolve to become the Dream Devourer (as seen in Chrono Trigger DS). The party convince Zeal's followers not to activate the Sun Stone, and pursue Zeal to the Darkness Beyond Time. King Zeal confronts them once more, revealing his will is stronger than that of Lavos; he'll merge, but become the dominant personality within the Dream Devourer and create a new Zeal using its vast power. The party defeat him and return to Chronopolis. They notice the planet's Gates are closing again, and depart to their homes, promising to stay in touch. Belthasar meanwhile reveals he has the Frozen Flame, which activates and informs him that Lavos is still alive and will become the Time Devourer, the enemy of Chrono Cross. It challenges Belthasar to a grand game, and he begins drawing up plans for Project Kid. The game closes with King Zeal, shown to be alive and imprisoned by Magus in 11,995B.C., who forces him to teach advanced temporal magic.|$|E
