40|$|An {{experimental}} study on Vortex-Induced Motion (VIM) of the semi-submersible platform concept with four square columns is presented. Model tests {{were carried out}} to check the influence of different headings and hull appendages (riser supports located at the pontoons; fairleads and the mooring stretches located vertically at the external column faces; and <b>hard</b> <b>pipes</b> located vertically at the internal column faces). The results comprise in-line, transverse and yaw motions, as well as combined motions in the XY plane, drag and lift forces and spectral analysis. The main results showed that VIM in the transverse direction occurred {{in a range of}} reduced velocity 4. 0 up to 14. 0 with amplitude peaks around reduced velocities around 7. 0 and 8. 0. The largest transverse amplitudes obtained were around 40 % of the column width for 30 degrees and 45 degrees incidences. Another important result observed was a considerable yaw motion oscillation, in which a synchronization region could be identified as a resonance phenomenon. The largest yaw motions were verified for the 0 degrees incidence and the maxima amplitudes around 4. 5 degrees. The hull appendages located at columns had the greatest influence on the VIM response of the semi-submersible. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The compressed air pipe is run through bolster and other members and then in a zig-zag pattern under the locomotive's belly to extend its length, which allows the maximum amount of moisture to condense {{on the way to the}} reservoirs. As a result, it has multiple pipe connections. A weakness of the system was that, after an accident or even a <b>hard</b> coupling, these <b>pipes</b> tended to develop leaks at the joints which were extremely difficult to repair.|$|R

40|$|The {{pipeline}} is a strategically important {{technology to}} any modern nation. It {{is used for}} transporting water, sewage, natural gas, crude oil, refined petroleum products, hazardous chemicals, grain {{and hundreds of other}} products. Pipeline assessment is often expensive and disruptive. Efficient inspection of pipelines for internal damages is a challenging task. It becomes even <b>harder</b> when <b>pipes</b> are coated with insulating materials. Under traditional ultrasonic methods insulation coatings are removed at selected places. Then wall thickness at those spots are measured by ultrasonic transducers. Sudden drop in the pipe wall thickness indicates possibility of corrosion damage. This is a time-consuming and expensive operation. The Lamb wave inspection technique, proposed in this paper, is a much more efficient technique because by this technique long pipes can be inspected by removing the insulation coating at a relatively fewer locations. In this technique the Lamb wave propagates {{along the length of the}} pipe, this is also known as cylindrical guided waves. For efficient generation of Lamb modes in the pipe wall special sensors are to be fabricated. Several arrangements of transmitter, receiver and specimen have been tried out. Some arrangements require the presence of a coupling fluid between the transducer and the pipe wall. These arrangements can be used for inspecting horizontal pipes only. Other arrangements do not need any coupling fluid and can be used equally well for inspecting horizontal, inclined, and vertical pipes. Experimental results, presented in this paper, show that for efficient inspection of a pipe it should be excited by multiple transducers. Transducers should be positioned at an inclination relative to the pipe axis...|$|R

Blake was very ill, and something must be done to save him; but for a while Harding could not see how help could be obtained.

40|$|Loop {{heat pipe}} is a passive {{two-phase}} heat transport device that is gaining importance {{as a part}} of spacecraft thermal control systems and also in applications (such as in avionic cooling and submarines). Hard fill of a loop heat pipe occurs when the compensation chamber is full of liquid. A theoretical study is undertaken to investigate the issues underlying the loop beat pipe hard-fill phenomenon. The results of the study suggest that the mass of charge and the presence of a bayonet have significant impact on the loop heat pipe operation. With a largern mass of charge, a loop heat <b>pipe</b> <b>hard</b> fills at a lower heat load. As the heat load increases, there is a steep rise in the loop heat pipe operating temperature. In a loop heat pipe with a saturated compensation chamber, and also in a hard-filled loop heat pipe without a bayonet, the temperature of the compensation chamber and that of the liquid core are nearly equal. When a loop heat pipe with a bayonet hard fills, the compensation chamber and the evaporator core temperatures are different...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{vulnerability}} of urban populations {{is becoming a}} major issue of concern with climate change, particularly in the cities of the Southwest United States. In this article we discuss the importance of understanding coupled social and technical systems, how they constitute one another, and how they form the conditions and circumstances in which people experience heat. We discuss the particular situation of Los Angeles and Maricopa Counties, their urban form and the electric grid.

Further, the regulatory infrastructure of electricity generation and distribution also contributes to creating differential vulnerability.

Social infrastructure includes codes, conventions, rules and regulations; technical systems are the <b>hard</b> systems of <b>pipes,</b> wires, buildings, roads, and power plants.

40|$|Numerical and {{experimental}} investigations of mixing in pipelines with side and opposed tees are carried out. Cold water flowing in a main pipe {{is mixed with}} hot water flowing through a tee. The temperature is measured experimentally to quantify the degree of mixing. The velocity and temperature fields are also solved numerically. The effects of the mesh size, mesh-localized refinement, dependence of the fluid physical properties on temperature, and turbulence model on numerical results were examined. Experimental results show good agreement with corresponding predictions of the numerical model over a relatively wide range of Reynolds number; however, close agreement is harder to obtain {{in the vicinity of}} the jet through the tee. The pipe length required to achieve 95 % mixing is found to be a function of U-j/U-m. The angle at which the side jet is injected determines whether the jet impinges on the opposite wall and also affects the pipe length required to achieve 95 % mixing. This work recommends that industry should not use 90 degrees tees because of possible poor mixing at certain velocity ratios and <b>hard</b> impingement. For <b>pipe</b> diameters ranging from 1 to 16 in., if d(j) /d(m) is kept constant, then for any velocity ratio th...|$|R
40|$|Stereotaxic thalamic lesions by {{electrocoagulation}} {{have been}} produced on sixty four cases of extrapyramidal disorders by means of newly deviced simple electrocoagulation probe, which is made of 300 mm of straight steel wire with one millimeter in diameter covered loosely by 293 mm of <b>hard</b> teflon <b>pipe</b> as insulation to electricity and the local heat. The probe, therefore, has retractable 7 mm bare tip, {{so it can be}} safely withdrawn without any, danger from hemorrhage of destructed tissue after coagulation. As a preliminary experiment, stereotaxic thalamic lesions by the probe {{have been produced}} in the dog brain as well as the formalin suspended human brains under observation with ultrasonic A-scope apparatus by reflection method. The transducer provided with barium titanate (2. 25 Mc, 10 mm diameter) was used. It was clearly identified that the echoes were corresponded to size and location of the lesions in the dog brain as well as human brain specimen. During the surgery, echo was noted from the tip of probe which was in the target area of the thalamus of the patients. In every case, the lesion echoes showed high fluctuating amplitude and width during coagulation procedure. Lesion echoes were observed up to 45 days after the surgery. They maintained stable duplicate echoes during the period. It is our suggestion that the ultrasonic examination of the stereotaxic lesion is useful to note accidental hemorrhage in the lesion of a reconvalescent patient. It is also a great aid for this purpose to check the midline echo at the same time. Recently further investigations with ultrasonic compound sector scope, Aloka SSD- 10, were done. The ultrasonic scanning was performed on the operative side vertically. During and after the coagulation of the target, twenty three cases were examined with compound sector scope. The reflextion from the lesion with compound scope was noted in 91. 3 % of the cases while 82. 9 % with A-scope. The lesionecho was obtained about 1. 4 cm lateral from the midline echo in case of destruction of V. L. nucleous of the thalamus. In case of the centre median the lesionecho was located adjacent to the midline echo. These lesionechoes were located correctly in their anatomical coordinates of the targets. But {{the size and shape of}} the lesionechoes were identified rather larger than the destructed lesions. This deflexion would be due to the width of the ultrasonic reflected wave. As confirmative experiments, stereotaxic thalamic destructive lesions have been produced in the specimen of the formalin suspended human brains under observation with ultrasonic compound sector scope. It is our impression that echo-encephalgraphy with the ultrasonic compound scope has a potential usefulness to observe location, shape and size of the lesion as well as to detect the accidental hemorrhage of a reconvalescent patient...|$|R
