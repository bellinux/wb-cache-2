By a Strategic Judgment Bias <b>account,</b> the <b>categories</b> associated with objects are explicitly used as cues for determining similarity, and objects that are categorized together are judged to be more similar because similarity is not only a function of the objects themselves, but also the objects' category labels. By a Changed Object Description <b>account,</b> <b>category</b> learning alters the description of the objects themselves, emphasizing properties that are relevant for categorization. A new method for distinguishing between these accounts is introduced which measures the difference between the similarity ratings of categorized objects to a neutral object.

40|$|Temporary {{agencies}} {{are commonly used}} by Swedish companies today, and according to Coe, Johns and Ward (2009), this is because Sweden has a strict labor market regulation which makes companies afraid to employ workers on a permanent basis. By using temporary agencies, companies can come around the Employment Protection Act (EPA) which makes us question which parts of the EPA that companies consider as a problem and if the use of temporary agencies actually can reduce this problem for Swedish companies. Focus in this thesis is companies´ personnel costs, {{which means that the}} EPA and the use of temporary {{agencies are}} investigated with these costs in mind. Therefore, the purpose with this thesis is to investigate how the EPA affects Swedish companies’ personnel costs over the years 2007 - 2009, and examine if the use of temporary agencies can reduce these costs. A descriptive investigation is conducted in order to examine the purpose of this thesis. The study is accomplished through an Internet based questionnaire which is send to 68 randomly chosen companies all over Sweden, with 51 - 150 workers from no specific branch or geographical area. 32 companies participate in the study. From the descriptive investigation it is evident that the EPA has increased personnel costs for Swedish companies over the years 2007 - 2009. However, this happens indirectly through decreased flexibility making it difficult for companies to quickly adjust to changes in demand. Also, a majority of the companies are critical towards the EPA and show direct consequences’ of negative impacts experienced. Consequently, we suggest that the EPA is updated to fit the conditions of today´s labor market. Furthermore, temporary agencies reduce companies’ personnel costs by enabling them to hire workers and avoid costs as employment benefits and costs for absenteeism. However, the direct costs of temporary workers are higher than the direct cost for permanent workers. Therefore, we suggest that the use of temporary agencies should not be used instead of permanent employments but mainly in situations of escalating demand when greater flexibility is needed. Finally, the costs for permanent workers are reported in <b>account</b> <b>category</b> 7 “personnel costs, depreciation etcetera” and the costs for temporary workers are reported in <b>account</b> <b>categories</b> 5 - 6 “other external operating expenses” in the income statement. However, both these <b>account</b> <b>categories</b> are included in the same main category of costs. This means that the only difference in the income statement is due to the higher cost of temporary workers. Besides this, companies´ accounting is not affected...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the degree of {{material}} harmonization between the Portuguese accounting practices and IASB international accounting standards. We analyse exhaustively the Portuguese practices and the most recent modifications on international accounting standards. In this paper, the accounting topics which were analysed more frequently in previous studies and are generally referred as problematic accounting areas were selected for further research. Our sample includes 237 disclosure and measurement practices over 14 <b>accounting</b> <b>categories.</b> The methodology used in this research proposes to measure the similarities or differences between the accounting practices of 37 Portuguese groups and the recommendations of the IFRS. We attempt to do an itemby- item comparison in the selected categories. The Jaccard coefficient is calculated and the discrimination for the different categories is ranked accordingly. The results indicate that diversity exists among Portuguese accounting practices and international accounting standards. The flexibility of the regulation concerning some concepts and methods contributes to the Portuguese diversity and compromises comparability issues. Given these results, we indicate the <b>accounting</b> items and <b>categories</b> that need future intervention from Portuguese regulators...|$|R

40|$|Human ventral {{temporal}} cortex shows a categorical organization, with regions responding selectively to faces, bodies, tools, scenes, words, {{and other}} categories. Why is this? Traditional <b>accounts</b> explain <b>category</b> selectivity as arising within a hierarchical system dedicated to visual object recognition. For example, {{it has been}} proposed that category selectivity reflects the clustering of category-associated visual feature representations, or that it reflects category-specific computational algorithms needed to achieve view invariance. This visual object recognition framework has gained renewed interest {{with the success of}} deep neural network models trained to "recognize" objects: these hierarchical feed-forward networks show similarities to human visual cortex, including categorical separability. We argue that the object recognition framework is unlikely to fully <b>account</b> for <b>category</b> selectivity in visual cortex. Instead, we consider category selectivity in the context of other functions such as navigation, social cognition, tool use, and reading. Category-selective regions are activated during such tasks {{even in the absence of}} visual input and even in individuals with no prior visual experience. Further, they are engaged in close connections with broader domain-specific networks. Considering the diverse functions of these networks, category-selective regions likely encode their preferred stimuli in highly idiosyncratic formats; representations that are useful for navigation, social cognition, or reading are unlikely to be meaningfully similar to each other and to varying degrees may not be entirely visual. The demand for specific types of representations to support category-associated tasks may best <b>account</b> for <b>category</b> selectivity in visual cortex.
