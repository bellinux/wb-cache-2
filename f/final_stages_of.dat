5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although the <b>final</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should {{not be limited to}} such capacities.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the <b>final</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
