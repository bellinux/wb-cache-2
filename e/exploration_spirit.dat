5000|$|Ossian {{estimated}} that a module {{on par with}} other large games like Kingmaker would take four to five months to develop. Pre-production on Daggerford began in April 2005 and took {{a month and a}} half. Ossian went through five designers in this stage, none of whom were successful. Choosing a designer required much of the time allocated for pre-production, and to compensate, Ossian developers immediately began creating the game, fleshing out details as they went. In order to keep in line with the <b>exploration</b> <b>spirit</b> of Baldur's Gate, Ossian hired designers specifically for the game's sidequests. The world map system in particular posed problems to designers, who stated that [...] "the toolset really wasn't made to do what we wanted it to do." [...] In addition, only Miranda and his wife worked in a brick and mortar building—most of the game's design was coordinated online using Skype. The production of Daggerford took longer than Ossian had anticipated, and in February 2006, BioWare's Live Team Lead Designer Rob Bartel offered the studio advice on their module. The next month, BioWare inspected the game and approved it for content completion.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{innovation}} management processes of Finnish companies in significantly changing business environment were examined. Data collection {{for this study}} draws on qualitative methods and interviews. Based on the analysis, it can be summarized that innovation activities are often characterized as processual and hierachically structured with emphasis on the traditional stage-gate–model. As a contrast, in some interviews also highly informal and unsystematic origins and processes of innovation are described. Strategy processes are often characterized according to the established terminology emphasizing rationality and formal processes. However, business strategies are also perceived as a limiting and hindering factor for innovations.   Based on the analysis, {{there seems to be}} heavy emphasis on incremental innovation, which builds on advancing current competencies, businesses, and capabilities. Large foreign companies and "players" are described as trendsetters, which are followed. The majority of characterizations do not convey an <b>exploration</b> <b>spirit</b> or passion for radical, disruptive innovations and creation or transformation to entirely new businesses. Descriptions of developing new social innovations (eg. Facebook, Twitter), novel business models, intrapreneurship or start-up mentality as well as passionate visions of transformational ideas and business opportunities appear seldom. Activities for developing processes for open innovation are seen as a future possibility. Currently {{there is a lack of}} open innovation tools and processes. Many companies accumulate "big data" from their operations. However, developing its widespread analysis and utilization is seen to take place in the future. Descriptions of active development of ideas to transform businesses and business models based on "big data" analytics are rare.  Industrial innovations originate from networks involving customers, suppliers and public R&D organizations. The study raises also some suggestions how to reform the Finnish innovation system. Development is needed in company innovation management processes, TEKES activities, new funding instruments and university incentive system. On the Finnish societal level, an innovation gap emerges between small companies and large enterprises...|$|E

5000|$|Most lunar and Martian surface probes use RHUs for heat, {{including}} many probes that use solar panels rather than RTGs to generate electricity. Examples include the seismometer deployed on the Moon by Apollo 11 in 1969, which contained 1.2 ounces (34 grams) of plutonium-238; Mars Pathfinder; and the Mars <b>Exploration</b> Rovers <b>Spirit</b> and Opportunity. RHUs are especially useful on the Moon {{because of its}} lengthy and cold two-week night.|$|R
