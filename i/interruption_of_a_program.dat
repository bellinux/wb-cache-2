40|$|Dialog {{boxes that}} collect {{parameters}} for commands often create ephemeral, unnatural <b>interruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>program's</b> normal execution flow, encouraging {{the user to}} complete the dialog box {{as quickly as possible}} in order for the program to process that command. In this paper we examine the idea of turning the act of collecting parameters from a user into a first class object called a user interface continuation. Programs can create user interface continuations by specifying what information is to be collected from the user and supplying a callback (i. e., a continuation) to be notified with the collected information. A partially completed user interface continuation can be saved as a new command, much as currying and partially evaluating a function with <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> parameters produces <b>a</b> new function. Furthermore, user interface continuations, like other continuation-passing paradigms, can be used to allow program execution to continue uninterrupted while the user determines a command's parameters at his or her leisure...|$|R
