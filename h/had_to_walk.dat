5|$|The named plaintiff, Oliver L. Brown, was a parent, {{a welder}} in the shops of the Santa Fe Railroad, an {{assistant}} pastor at his local church, and an African American. He was convinced {{to join the}} lawsuit by Scott, a childhood friend. Brown's daughter Linda, a third grader, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> six blocks to her school bus stop to ride to Monroe Elementary, her segregated black school one mile (1.6km) away, while Sumner Elementary, a white school, was seven blocks from her house.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as {{was the use of}} stones or any hard object in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of which}} each fighter <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> to the scratch unaided within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
5|$|Rescue trains were {{dispatched}} {{from across}} Atlantic Canada, {{as well as}} the northeastern United States. The first left Truro around 10am carrying medical personnel and supplies, arrived in Halifax by noon and returned to Truro with the wounded and homeless by 3pm. The track had become impassable at Rockingham, on the western edge of Bedford Basin. To reach the wounded, rescue personnel <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> through parts of the devastated city until they reached a point where the military had begun to clear the streets. By nightfall, a dozen trains had reached Halifax from the Nova Scotian towns of Truro, Kentville, Amherst and Stellarton and from the New Brunswick towns of Sackville, Moncton and Saint John.|$|E

5|$|The station {{opened on}} 1 August 1887 {{as part of}} the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway. Construction of the station {{structure}} was not completed until 1895, with modular-design wooden buildings, commonly seen on the new suburban railway lines, being built on both platforms. The station is located on part of the former site of brick and tile works, Jordanhill being an area of artisans and miners until the close of the nineteenth century. The railway station arrived just as much of the local industry was declining, giving residents, who previously <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> to Hillhead or Partick to find transport into Glasgow, proper access to the city centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking out for themselves and distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, {{and he was not}} seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, his 1980s musical {{repertoire}} {{presented an}} increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, {{as well as}} the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.|$|E

5|$|Prince Caspian {{has over}} 1,500 special effects shots, more than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobes 800 effects shots, yet the film had {{less time to}} {{complete}} them. The scale of special effects led Andrew Adamson to base production in the UK, {{to take advantage of}} new tax credits. Therefore, it legally qualifies as a British film. This also meant the director only <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> five minutes from the editing room to supervise the effects. British visual effects companies the Moving Picture Company and Framestore CFC were hired to create the visual effects alongside Weta Digital. Framestore worked on Aslan, Trufflehunter and the door in the air; Scanline did the River-god; Weta created the werewolf, the wild bear and Miraz's castle; MPC and Escape Studios did the main battle, the tunnel scene, the castle assault, the council scenes and all the other creatures.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Titanic {{began in}} July 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with {{the filming of}} the modern day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full scale RMS Titanic had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge which could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking. For {{the safety of the}} stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron chose to build his RMS Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The Daily Mirror noted at the end of April 1906 that the BS offered poor value for money compared to the equivalent motor bus service, which cost only 1d. per journey, and that passengers disliked the distances that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> between the trains and the lifts. Such problems were not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenue generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

25|$|Barges {{were pulled}} by mules along the {{adjacent}} towpath, a power source employed {{even after the}} development of steam engines, since the bow wave from a faster steamboat would have damaged the channel. Children were often hired to lead the mules at first; in the canal's later years grown men were employed. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> 15–20 miles (24–32km) a day, pump out the barges and tend the animals. For this they were paid about $3 a month.|$|E
