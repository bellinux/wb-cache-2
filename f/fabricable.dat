In this contribution, we propose the use of nanoprisms embedded on a dielectric substrate that is flat and adjacent to the metal-dielectric layer used for sensing through the excitation of SPR. This structure funnels the incoming radiation more efficiently, and therefore, plasmon resonances benefit from {{the increase in the}} energy reaching the plane of interest.

Due to its simple struc-ture, a wide-area power floor of 3. 52 m 2 (1. 6 m × 2. 2 m) could be fabricated as a prototype. Three pickups with evenly displaced angle and space are adopted, considering the limited bottom area of the free-moving mobile robot. The size and position of each pickup are appropriately selected for the given subwinding size of the power floor and magnetic pole arrangement.

To design structures with high acceleration gradients, we explore the adjoint variable method, a highly efficient technique used to compute the sensitivity of an objective with respect to a large number of parameters. With this formalism, the sensitivity of the acceleration gradient of a dielectric structure with respect to its entire spatial permittivity distribution is calculated by the use of only two full-field electromagnetic simulations, the original and adjoint. The adjoint simulation corresponds physically to the reciprocal situation of a point charge moving through the accelerator gap and radiating.

Designing such machines, however, is made particularly tedious by the complex influence each configuration parameter has on the final drawing. We propose a novel constrained exploration method that enables a user to easily explore feasible drawings by directly indicating pattern preferences at different levels of control. The user starts by selecting a target pattern with the help of construction lines and rough sketching, and then fine-tunes it by prescribing geometric features of interest directly on the drawing.

Developing new simpler structures with richer electromagnetic (EM) properties and wider working frequency bands is highly demanded for fast light-based information transfer and information processing. In the present work, we propose theoretically that a honeycomb-structured LC circuit with short-range textures in inductance can generate a topological photonic state accompanied by inversion between p- and d-orbital like EM modes carrying optic orbital angular momenta (OAM). We realize experimentally the topological photonic state in planar microstrips, a sandwich structure of bottom metallic substrate, middle dielectric film and top metallic strips with hexagonal patterns in strip width, in microwave frequency. Measuring accurately the amplitude and phase of EM fields, we demonstrate explicitly that topological interfacial EM waves launched from a linearly polarized dipole source propagate in opposite directions according to the sign of OAM, with the relative weight of p- and d-orbital like EM modes tunable precisely by sweeping the frequency in the topological band gap, which can hardly be achieved in other photonic systems and condensed-matter systems.

Research is conducted using finite-difference time-domain simulations and a custom built dark-field Fourier-space microscope, designed to interrogate individual particles and measure their angular scattering in thin films for the first time. It is found that the excited modes, large angle scattering and substrate coupling of the nanoparticles can be manipulated and improved considerably through careful choice of the materials and dimensions of the layers. Scattering from silver nanowires into a substrate is observed experimentally for the first time and an overcoating thin film is exploited to create highly directional emission, which is compared with nanoantennas in the literature. The potential to use this system as a novel sensing element is discussed. Following on from this, the nanocube patch antenna system is reviewed and its operation as a subwavelength plasmonic gas sensor is demonstrated for the first time to test for relative humidity using the Nafion polymer. This easily <b>fabricable</b> system shows superior sensitivities to other single-particle sensors across a range of humidities and simulations predict that by using sharper cubes and different deposition processes a further tripling of the recorded efficiency is achievable. The nanopatch structure can be readily adapted to detect a variety of other gases, and has the potential for integration into photonic circuitry. </p...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{traditional}} metal-based dental files, such as NiTi being demonstrated {{effective in}} root cleaning, the tooth structure is always damaged. Thus, {{to fulfill the}} need for a minimally invasive tool for contemporary endodontics and dentistry, the use of polymer fibers might provide a good option, as it is soft, <b>fabricable,</b> and disposable. In this study, two types of nylon fibers with respective average diameters of 206. 9 µm (fiber W) and 156. 4 µm (fiber B), respectively, were used as dental files, and mounted onto either a reciprocating or a low-speed rotary hand-piece. In vitro, simulated root canal models were colored red using nail varnish, and then cleaned by the fiber files mounted on the hand-pieces. Three parts of the simulated models, i. e., the apical third, the medium third, and the coronal third, were chosen to assess the cleaning the efficiency (CE) of each specimen by calculating the ratio of the cross-sectional area changes, before and after cleansing, using micro-Computer Tomography (CT). A NiTi file with a low-speed hand-piece was used as a control. SEM was used to observe the nylon fiber surfaces before and after the cleansing. Micro-CT results showed that for both the nylon fibers, W and B, an average CE of 82. 11 % ± 9. 68 % for the medium third could be achieved, which is statistically higher (p < 0. 01) than the coronal third and apical third. The cleansing efficiency was not affected by, the types of fibers, nor the hand-pieces according to student’s t-test. Most of the nylon fibers could withstand deformation after the cleansing. To conclude, nylon fiber files have demonstrated a certain cleansing efficiency in simulated root canals, and micro-CT is a promising method to assess CE...|$|E
