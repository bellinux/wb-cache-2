Contrary to water-source geothermal systems, direct exchange systems do not contain antifreeze.

This is due to the low boiling point of R-410A: -60.5 °F. R-410A refrigerant replaces larger volumes of antifreeze mixtures used in water-source geothermal systems and presents no threat to aquifers or to the ground itself.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of an offshore drilling facility (the Kravtsovskoye (D-6) oilfield) in the territorial waters of Russia, 22.5 km from the coastline of the Curonian Spit raised concerns over possible oil spills.

These concerns did not engender support in the government of Russia. They were, however, supported by the government of Lithuania,.

5000|$|Due to the {{numerous}} foreign primary sources that hint {{to the existence}} of true watertight compartments in junks, historians such as Joseph Needham proposed that the limber holes were stopped up as noted above <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>leakage.</b> He addresses the quite separate issue of free-flooding compartments on pg 422 of Science and Civilisation in Ancient China: Less well known is the interesting fact that in some types of Chinese craft the foremost(and less frequently also the aftermost) compartments is made free-flooding. Holes are purposely contrived in the planking. This is the case with the salt-boats which shoot the rapdown from Tzuliuching in Szechuan, the gondola-shaped boats of the Poyang Lake, and many sea going junks. The Szechuanese boatmen say that this reduces resistance to the water to a minimum, though such a claim makes absolutely no hydrodynamic sense, and the device is thought to cushion the shocks of pounding when the boat pitches heavily in the rapids, as it acquires and discharges water ballast rapidly supposedly just at the time when it is most desirable to counteract buffeting at stem and stern. As with too many such claims, there has been no empirical testing of them and it seems unlikely that the claims would stand up to such testing since the diameter or number of holes needed for such rapid flooding and discharging would be so great as to significantly weaken the vulnerable fore and aft parts of the vessel. The sailors say, as sailors {{all over the world are}} inclined to do wen conjuring up answer to landlubbers' questions, that it stops junks flying up into the wind. It may be the reality at the bottom of the following story, related by Liu Ching-Shu of the +5th century, in his book I Yuan (Garden of Strange Things)In Fu-Nan (Cambodia) gold is always used in transactions. Once there were (some people who) having hired a boat to go from east to west near and far, had not reached their destination when the time came for the payment of the pound (of gold) which had been agreed upon. They therefore wished to reduce the quantity (to be paid). The master of the ship then played a trick upon them. He made (as it were) a way for the water to enter the bottom of the boat, which seemed to be about to sink, and remained stationary, moving neither forward nor backward. All the passengers were very frightened and came to make offerings. The boat (afterwards) returned to its original state.This, however, would seem to have involved openings which could be controlled, and the water pumped out afterwards. This was easily effected in China (still seen in Kuangtung and Hong Kong), but the practice was also known in England, where the compartment was called the 'wet-well', and the boat in which it was built, a 'well-smack'. If the tradition is right that such boats date in Europe from +1712 then it may well be that the Chinese bulkhead principle was introduced twice, first for small coastal fishing boats at the end of the seventeenth century, and then for large ships a century later. However, the wet well is probably a case of parallel invention since its manner of construction is quite different from that of Chinese junks, the wet well quite often not running the full width of the boat, but only occupying the central part of the hull either side of the keel. [...] More to the point [...] wet wells were apparent in Roman small craft of the 5th century CE.|$|E

Here we present a dataset acquired in the Eifel volcanic district, using geochemical monitoring methods focussing on both dissolved and gaseous species. Onshore and offshore monitoring (Lake Laacher See) were performed to depict spatial behaviour of CO 2 natural releases. Additional gaseous species, mainly helium and radon, were also monitored to better assess the shapes of gas vents, using methodologies that were learned from hydrological and tectonic applications. Lake water monitoring allowed the characterisation of the water body itself, in terms of lateral heterogeneities, to evaluate the impact of CO 2 deep degassing {{near the bottom of the}} lake. The use of a dedicated sensor for monitoring in situ CO 2 partial pressure did not provide more valuable information that was learned from more classical physico-chemical parameters.

40|$|Building in {{cold climate}} zones {{requires}} a high insulation thickness {{and a good}} protection against interstitional condensation. Applying vapour tight membranes {{on both sides of}} a roof construction offers no drying potential <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>leakages</b> or initial moisture. Therefore the use of slightly permeable membranes at the interior side is often preferred because they allow condensed or existent moisture to dry out. However, drying to the interior space will only happen if the solar heat gains of the roof are high enough to inverse the vapour flow for a sufficient time period. This paper looks to the climate limits of building flat roofs with moderately permeable vapour retarders. The balance of interstitial condensation and subsequent drying is investigated using an adapted hygrothermal simulation tool for heat and moisture transport in building components. For the simulations a black surfaced flat roof construction with mineral fibre insulation and moderate vapour retarder is considered. Special interest is set on the drying potential in relation to the building's location in Northern climate zones. The results can be shown by two limit lines around the North Pole, one for vapour retarders with a constant permeability and the other for those with humidity controlled permeability. These lines are not parallel to the Arctic Circle. They reflect the regional climate conditions which are influenced by the Gulf Stream and other meteorological phenomena...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the adverse effects of global warming due to anthropogenic CO 2 emission into the atmosphere, geological sequestration of CO 2 into subsurface formations has been investigated by many studies over the last decade. However, selection of formations and sites for any field application is still open to debate. The most important properties of a formation suitable for carbon sequestration are those which impact the fluid flow processes. The injection or extraction of gas can change the pore pressure within the reservoir, which in turn results in redistribution of the stress field. These events may cause considerably leakage of the fluid into the surrounding geological formations or ground surface. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the potential of Yort-e-Shah aquifer for CO 2 storage, through a series of analyses with a simplified numerical model. The numerical results suggest that the optimum injection pressure in Yort-e-Shah aquifer is about 15. 51 MPa with a safety factor of about 1. 7. The results of the fluid pressure and gas plume expansion are presented. Also, an analysis was carried out for a case with leak through cap rock. When there is no leak, the pressure within the aquifer is stable, while on the other hand, the pressure <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>leakage</b> is slightly smaller. <b>In</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>leakage,</b> the pressure is lowest in the middle of the reservoir, mainly because the nodes at the middle of the aquifer are influenced by all the leakage points, while around the wellbore or near the end of gas plume, are affected less due to their longer distance to leakage points...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLeakage of CO 2 from {{geological}} reservoirs {{is one of}} {{the most}} fearsome unexpected scenarios for CO 2 storage activities. If a leakage reaches the ground level, exposure to high CO 2 concentrations is more likely to occur in low ventilated spaces (pit dug in the ground, basement, building) where CO 2 could accumulate to high concentrations. Significant literature and models about indoor exposure resulting from intrusion of soils gases in building are available in several domains (e. g., contaminated soils, radon, etc.). However, there is no guarantee that those approaches are appropriate for the assessment of consequences of CO 2 leakage due the specificity of CO 2 and due to the singularities of the source <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>leakage</b> from anthropic reservoirs. Furthermore, another singularity compared to conventional approaches is that the risk due to CO 2 exposure should be evaluated considering acute concentrations rather than long term exposure to low concentrations. Thus, a specific approach is needed to enable a quantitative assessment of the risk for health and living in indoor environment <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>leakage</b> from a reservoir reaching the unsaturated zone below the buildings. We present the results of the IMPACT-CO 2 project that aims at understanding the possible migration of CO 2 to indoor environment and to develop an approach to evaluate the risks. The approach is based on modelling and experiments at laboratory scale and at field representative scale. The aim of the experiment is to capture the main phenomena that control the migration of CO 2 through unsaturated zone, and its intrusion and accumulation in buildings. The experimental results will also enable numerical confrontation with tools used for risk assessment. Experiments at representative scale (Figure 1) are performed on the PISCO 2 platform (Ponferrada, Spain) specifically instrumented and designed for understanding the impacts of CO 2 migration towards the soil surface. The experiment is composed of a 2. 2 m deep basin filled with sand upon which a specifically designed cylindrical device representing the indoor condition of a building (with controlled depressurization and ventilation) is set up. The device includes a calibrated interface that represents a cracked slab of a building. The injection of CO 2 is performed at the bottom of the basin with a flow rate in the range of hundreds of g/d/m². The first results show that the presence of a building influences significantly the transport of CO 2 in the surrounding soil leading to two competing phenomena: 1) seepage in the atmosphere mainly controlled by diffusion gradient and 2) advective/diffusive flux entering the building due to the depressurization.
