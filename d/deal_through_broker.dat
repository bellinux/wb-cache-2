40|$|This paper investigates whether trades {{initiated}} <b>through</b> institutional <b>brokers</b> generated better return {{performance than}} trades through full-service or discount brokers, on the Toronto Stock Exchange from September 1999 to August 2000.

In addition, discount brokers are found to trade much more actively than full-service brokers who in turn are more active than institutional brokers. ...|$|R

5000|$|After bids by Parretti {{to acquire}} New World Pictures and Kings Road Entertainment went nowhere, Parretti {{set his sights}} on {{purchasing}} MGM/UA. In the mid-1980s, American businessman Kirk Kerkorian sold portions of MGM/UA to Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System. In 1985-86, Kerkorian repurchased United Artists and then MGM, but without the company's film library and Culver City lot and film processing labs (entities which had been earlier sold by Ted Turner to Lorimar). In 1989, Kerkorian agreed to sell his MGM/UA interests to Australian broadcasting company Qintex after they tendered an offer of $1.5 billion deal to beat out Rupert Murdoch. [...] However, when Qintex was unable to provide a $50 million letter of credit the deal collapsed. [...] Five months after the Qintex <b>deal</b> fell <b>through,</b> Parretti <b>brokered</b> a <b>deal</b> to make the purchase for $1.2 billion, but questions were raised over Parretti's financial acumen. [...] Parretti gained interest from Time Warner chairman Steve Ross; the company forwarded $125 million to the MGM/UA purchase in exchange for exclusive home video distribution rights to the studio's product. Turner Broadcasting System advanced Parretti $200 million for domestic television rights. Parretti also made deals with Fininvest, Sansea, and Reteitalia to fund the acquisition. He ultimately received backing from a Dutch branch of Crédit Lyonnais to complete the MGM/UA purchase. He then merged it with his Pathé Communications Group, to form MGM-Pathe Communications Co. in November 1990. Once Parretti took control, he laid off most of the financial staff and offered a major financial role to his daughter Valentina.|$|R

The stock debuted at $15 a share. Dale Kramer also took over the reins of the company in 1991. In late 1991, ShopKo introduced a [...] "Vision 2000" [...] prototype model, which opened in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Duluth, Minnesota, Dixon, Illinois, Loveland, Colorado, Longmont, Colorado, and Lacey, Washington, and relocated stores in Marshall, Minnesota, and Mitchell, South Dakota. In 1996, ShopKo merged with Phar-Mor, an Ohio-based chain. The following year, Shopko acquired Penn-Daniels Inc. and its eighteen Jacks Discount Stores. In 1997, Phar-Mor split from ShopKo, and ShopKo bought out all of SuperValu's stock in the company. It also banned all tobacco products from being sold in its stores. 1998 brought yet another acquisition, this one of Venture Stores in Kentucky, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois and Kansas. The <b>deal</b> was <b>brokered</b> <b>through</b> Kimco Realty. William Podany became President of ShopKo in 1999. He led the acquisition of 147 Pamida stores later that year.

50|$|Commercial lenders {{specialize}} in hard money and bridge loans, often those that close quickly, {{in as little}} as two weeks.

Going <b>through</b> a <b>broker</b> rather than directly through a lender may cause longer wait times for loan financing and more up-front fees. However, they can greatly facilitate the process and come up with innovative and unique ways to overcome obstacles that the borrower {{may not be able to}} access on their own.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{enforcement}} of traditional vegetable marketing contracts between producers and traders in Ethiopia using the general conceptual framework of contract enforcement extended to capture the payment at risk. Empirical results show that despite its imperfections, compliance with contractual obligations is mainly due to mutual trust and brokers' mediation. Moreover, results demonstrate the necessity of contractual arrangements that guarantee flexibility without exposing trading partners to the risks of opportunism. A separate analysis of contract enforceability <b>through</b> <b>brokers</b> reveals that farmer's age, whether a buyer is a trader, information access and trader-specific investment have a significant positive impact while family size, frequency of transactions, dependency on the trader, duration of the relationship and distance to the trader have a significant negative impact on contract enforceability <b>through</b> <b>brokers.</b> Furthermore, pooled multinomial Logit regression analysis show that traders' non-compliance to contractual obligations are mainly due to the risks related to perishability, seasonality, illiteracy and his type. An effective enforcement of vegetable marketing contracts in the study areas may be achieved through governmental and/or private institutions interventions that target market information access, development of cooperatives and associated support programmes.

5000|$|He {{made his}} {{professional}} debut in sprint cars in 1998 and from 2000 to 2003 {{was one of}} the top drivers in the World of Outlaws winged sprint car series. In 2004 he suddenly decided to change his career path and drove in the IRL's Infiniti Pro Series winning his first three races and finishing fourth in series points despite missing three races. He was announced as the driver for Hemelgarn Racing's car in the IndyCar Series in 2006 with new backing from NBA star Carmelo Anthony. The partnership was dubbed [...] "Carmelo Hemelgarn Racing". The <b>deal</b> was <b>brokered</b> <b>through</b> the IRL's new marketing partner, Simmons-Abramson Marketing, made up of rock legend Gene Simmons and entertainment industry vet Richard Abramson. Chesson started the first 4 races of the season, the last being the Indianapolis 500, where he and teammate Jeff Bucknum tangled on the second lap and finished in the last two positions. Chesson has numerous tattoos, including one of the 2006 Indianapolis 500 logo that he had applied in public at the Speedway during the final day of qualifying. Since the demise of his deal with Hemelgarn, Chesson did not return to the Indycar Series {{until the end of the}} 2007 season when, in another Simmons/Abramson brokered deal, Chesson was announced as the second driver for Roth Racing alongside team owner Marty Roth with both cars sponsored by fashion label Dussault Apparel. He made his 2007 debut at the final race of the season at Chicagoland Speedway and finished 19th after mechanical gremlins sidelined him for over 100 laps.
