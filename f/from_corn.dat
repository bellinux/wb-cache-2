5|$|In August 1945, {{shortly after}} the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company {{observed}} spotting and fogging on their film, which {{was at that time}} usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J. H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible, due to the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> husks. Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.|$|E

25|$|As {{mandated}} by law, {{and in order}} to establish the fuel category for each biofuel, EPA included in its modeling direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as emissions from land use changes related to the full lifecycle. EPA's modeling of specific fuel pathways incorporated comments received through the third-party peer review process, and data and information from new studies and public comments. EPA's analysis determined that both ethanol produced <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> starch and biobutanol <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> starch comply with the 20% GHG emission reduction threshold required to classify as a renewable fuel. EISA grandfathered existing U.S. corn ethanol plants, and only requires the 20% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions for any renewable fuel produced at new facilities that commenced construction after December 19, 2007.|$|E
25|$|Illinois {{is ranked}} second in corn {{production}} among U.S. states, and Illinois corn {{is used to}} produce 40% of the ethanol consumed in the United States. The Archer Daniels Midland corporation in Decatur, Illinois is the world's leading producer of ethanol <b>from</b> <b>corn.</b>|$|E
25|$|Plastics are {{typically}} organic polymers of high molecular mass, {{but they often}} contain other substances.

25|$|Like {{all modern}} bourbons, Van Winkle bourbons are made {{primarily}} <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> and aged in charred new oak barrels.

25|$|In {{spite of}} being a staple in the Mexican diet, Mexico's {{comparative}} advantage in agriculture is not in corn, but in horticulture, tropical fruits, and vegetables. Negotiators of NAFTA expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture two-thirds of Mexican corn producers would naturally shift <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> production to horticultural and other labor-intensive crops such as fruits, nuts, vegetables, coffee and sugar cane. While horticultural trade has drastically increased due to NAFTA, it has not absorbed displaced workers <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> production (estimated at around 600,000). Corn production has remained stable (at 20 million metric tons), arguably, {{as a result of}} income support to farmers, or a reluctance to abandon a millenarian tradition in Mexico: not only have peasants grown corn for millennia, corn originated in Mexico. Mexico is the seventh largest corn producer in the world.|$|E
25|$|In the USA {{there are}} tariffs on the {{importation}} of sugar, and subsidies {{for the production of}} maize (corn). High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is derived <b>from</b> <b>corn,</b> and significantly cheaper there than sucrose as a sweetener. This has led to sucrose being partially displaced in U.S. industrial food production by HFCS and other non-sucrose natural sweeteners.|$|E

It is made <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> starch, sugar, cardamom powder, nutmeg powder and ghee. Peanuts are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavour. After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using frankincense (lubaan) or incense (cuunsi), which is prepared inside an incense burner {{referred to as a}} dabqaad.|$|E
25|$|The various {{cultures}} {{that have come}} through the state have influenced the development of breads, desserts and sweets. Most sweets are made from cow's milk, sugar cane, peanuts, rice, nuts, sesame seeds and piloncillo. These include pipitoria, jamoncillo, cubierto de viznaga, cubiertos de calabaza, cubiertos de camote, squash in honey, piloncillo, pitahaya ice cream, crystallized oranges and limes, cakes made <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> and rice pudding.|$|E
25|$|High-fructose {{corn syrup}} (HFCS) (also called glucose-fructose, {{isoglucose}} and glucose-fructose syrup) is a sweetener made <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> starch {{that has been}} processed by glucose isomerase to convert some of its glucose into fructose. HFCS was first marketed in the early 1970s by the Clinton Corn Processing Company, together with the Japanese Agency of Industrial Science and Technology where the enzyme was discovered in 1965.|$|E

25|$|Clark {{and his men}} set off <b>from</b> <b>Corn</b> Island on June 24, 1778, {{leaving behind}} seven {{soldiers}} who were deemed not hardy enough for the journey. These men stayed with the families {{on the island and}} guarded the provisions stored there. Clark's force numbered about 175 men, organized in four companies under Captains Bowman, Helm, Harrod, and Montgomery. They passed over the whitewater of the falls during a total solar eclipse, which some of the men regarded as a good omen.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> or sugar beets or palm/vegetable oils, particularly if cane bagasse {{is used to}} produce heat and power for the process. Furthermore, if biofuels are used for crop production and transport, the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol energy unit can be very low. EIA estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology, the well-to-wheels CO2 emissions can be 90 percent lower than conventional gasoline.|$|E
25|$|Historically most U.S. ethanol {{has come}} <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> and the {{required}} electricity for many distilleries came mainly from coal. Debate ensued about ethanol's sustainability. The primary {{issues related to}} the large amount of arable land required for crops and ethanol production's impact on grain supply, indirect land use change (ILUC) effects, as well as issues regarding its energy balance and carbon intensity considering its full life cycle. Recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production and commercialization may allay some of these concerns.|$|E

25|$|Menthol is {{an organic}} {{compound}} made synthetically or obtained <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> mint, peppermint, or other mint oils. It is a waxy, crystalline substance, clear or white in color, which is solid {{at room temperature}} and melts slightly above. The main form of menthol occurring in nature is (−)-menthol, which is assigned the (1R,2S,5R) configuration. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it is widely used to relieve minor throat irritation. Menthol also acts as a weak kappa opioid receptor agonist.|$|E
25|$|Typical souvenirs from Slovakia are dolls {{dressed in}} folk costumes, ceramic objects, crystal glass, carved wooden figures, črpáks (wooden pitchers), fujaras (a folk {{instrument}} on the UNESCO list) and valaškas (a decorated folk hatchet) {{and above all}} products made <b>from</b> <b>corn</b> husks and wire, notably human figures. Souvenirs can be bought in the shops run by the state organisation ÚĽUV (Ústredie ľudovej umeleckej výroby – Centre of Folk Art Production). Dielo shop chain sells works of Slovak artists and craftsmen. These shops are mostly found in towns and cities.|$|E
25|$|Some part {{of these}} {{chemicals}} leaves the field. Nitrogen in forms such as nitrate (NO3) is highly soluble, and along with some pesticides infiltrates downwards toward the water table, where it can migrate to water wells, rivers and streams. A 2008 National Research Council study found that regionally the highest stream concentrations occur where the rates of application were highest, and that these rates were highest in the Corn Belt. These flows mainly stem <b>from</b> <b>corn,</b> which as of 2010 was {{the major source of}} total nitrogen loading to the Mississippi River.|$|E
50|$|East, {{across the}} Chemung River <b>from</b> <b>Corning,</b> lies Gibson, {{the site of}} a feeder canal for the Chemung Canal system. Some of Corning's early {{prosperity}} came from the feeder canal system exposure. Canal cargoes <b>from</b> <b>Corning</b> included soft coal, timber, tobacco, grain, and whiskey. From April 22 to December 11, 1850, the canal season that year, the newspaper reported that 1,116 boats left the port of Corning. Tolls for the year totaled $54,060.39. Among items shipped were 46,572,400 pounds of coal. The canal's best peacetime year was 1854 when 270,978 tons of freight was hauled. The Civil War brought an abnormal amount of business, with a peak of 307,151 tons hauled in one year.|$|R
