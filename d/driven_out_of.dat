5|$|The {{massacre}} at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti-Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, {{though there were}} incidents in Oregon and other states as well. Near Newcastle, Washington a mob of whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese coal miners. Throughout the Puget Sound area, Chinese workers were <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> communities and subject to violence in Washington cities and towns, including Tacoma, Seattle, Newcastle, and Issaquah. Chinese workers were <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above events were specifically connected to the wave of violence touched off at Rock Springs.|$|E
5|$|While besieging Potidea, Artabazus {{also decided}} to besiege Olynthus, which was also in revolt. The town was held by the Bottiaean tribe, who had been <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Macedon. Having taken the town, he massacred the defenders, and handed over the town to the Chalcidian people.|$|E
5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west. The 5th Battalion, Norfolk Regiment were <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Shilta, but infantry from the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{in the process}} of being relieved, returned to the front, closed the gap, and pushed the Ottoman soldiers back out of the lines of communication.|$|E

5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} {{formerly}} enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, {{such as the}} brothers Yeon Namsaeng (634–679) and Yeon Namsan (639–701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla began fighting the Tang forces there. At {{the same time the}} Tang faced threats on its western border when a large Chinese army was defeated by the Tibetans on the Dafei River in 670. By 676, the Tang army was <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Korea by Unified Silla. Following a revolt of the Eastern Turks in 679, the Tang abandoned its Korean campaigns.|$|E
5|$|As Vizier he {{had taken}} all powers under his control as the king was only a puppet, a figurehead, who was into enjoying life with wine, opium and women. But he {{overestimated}} and over exercised his powers {{with the result that}} the Emperor’s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy to help them get rid of their Vizier. A civil strife ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Delhi. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1541, {{in either}} the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Heraklion) on Crete, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had {{probably}} been <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Chania to Candia after an uprising against the Catholic Venetians between 1526 and 1528. El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and tax collector. Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, also Greek. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531– 13 December 1604), was a wealthy merchant and spent {{the last years of}} his life (1603–1604) in El Greco's Toledo home.|$|E
5|$|By 13 August, the {{offensive}} had fully halted, with German forces being <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks and assault guns to Allied counter-attacks and air strikes, {{more than two-thirds}} of their committed total. As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West in danger of being encircled by Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|France invaded {{and began}} occupying Syria in 1919 and {{following}} the Battle of Maysalun in July 1920, Faisal was exiled and the kingdom annulled. Al-Bakri left for Amman in Transjordan, which was {{under the authority of}} Faisal's brother King Abdullah. Al-Bakri would later serve as Abdullah's aide in 1921, a position he held for about two years before returning to Syria after the French issued amnesty for political exiles. On his return, he became a member of al-Shahbandar's People's Party and actively sought to topple the French authorities in Syria and align the country with the ruling Hashemites in Iraq, Transjordan and the Hejaz. The Hashemites were <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the latter in 1925 by the Saudis.|$|E

5|$|It is, I believe, universally {{agreed that}} the only way to keep Indians from harassing the country is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their country. I believe if Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1971, {{though the}} Shah of Iran was {{claiming}} historical sovereignty over Bahrain, he accepted a referendum {{held by the}} United Nations and eventually Bahrain declared independence and signed a new treaty of friendship with the United Kingdom. Bahrain joined the United Nations and the Arab League later in the year. The oil boom of the 1970s benefited Bahrain greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bahrain replaced Beirut as the Middle East's financial hub after Lebanon's large banking sector was <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country by the war.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians and French {{remained}} {{confused about}} {{what was expected of}} each other if or when, hostilities commenced. The Belgians were determined to hold the border fortifications along the Albert Canal and the Meuse, without withdrawing, until the French Army arrived to support them. Gamelin was not keen on pushing his Dyle plan that far. He was concerned that the Belgians would be <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward to link up with French forces. This information was not given to Gamelin.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day the violence continued to spread, and Chinese {{patients in a}} hospital were taken outside and killed. Attempts to extinguish fires in areas devastated the preceding day failed, and the flames increased in vigour, and continued until 12October. Meanwhile, a group of 800 Dutch soldiers and 2,000 natives assaulted Kampung Gading Melati, {{where a group of}} Chinese survivors were holding up under the leadership of Khe Pandjang. Although the Chinese evacuated to nearby Paninggaran, they were later <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the area by Dutch forces. There were approximately 450 Dutch and 800 Chinese casualties in the two attacks.|$|E
5|$|The fort's defenders, the Royal Fencible American Regiment led by Joseph Goreham, {{a veteran}} of the French and Indian War, {{successfully}} repelled several attempts by Eddy's militia to storm the fort, and the siege was ultimately relieved when the RFA plus Royal Marine reinforcements drove off the besiegers on November 29. In retaliation for the role of locals who supported the siege, numerous homes and farms were destroyed, and Patriot sympathizers were <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the area. The successful defense of Fort Cumberland preserved the territorial integrity of the British Maritime possessions, and Nova Scotia remained loyal throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stretch of}} Hebden Beck {{before it reaches}} the River Wharfe was used to power a corn mill in the Middle Ages, and corn milling survived {{into the middle of}} the 19th century. In the 14th century Fountains Abbey had a fulling mill in the village. In 1791 a three-storey cotton mill was built {{alongside}} the corn mill. It housed 54 spinning frames and was productive until 1870 when it was <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business by the more efficient stream-driven machinery of the industrial revolution. At its peak, the mill employed more than 70 men, women, and children. The building was used for other purposes including a roller skating rink until it was demolished in 1967.|$|E

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in the spring or summer of 1277 in north-eastern Bulgaria where the Mongol devastation was strongest. In the summer of 1277 Ivaylo confronted and defeated a plundering Mongol unit. Another victory followed soon and by autumn all Mongols were <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Bulgarian territory. Having achieved what had eluded the Bulgarian arms for decades, his popularity and reputation rose quickly. Among his followers were an increasing number of nobles who were discontent with the intrigues of Empress Maria. Ivaylo was hailed as Emperor by the people and many regions came under his control.|$|E
5|$|While U.S. {{support for}} China {{was a reason}} for the war, the U.S. Army did not deploy major ground forces there, {{although}} U.S. air and service units played a vital role. After being <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Burma in 1942, a provisional regiment of the U.S. Army (Merrill's Marauders) participated in the reconquest of Northern Burma in 1944, and two regiments took part in the Central Burma Campaign the following year before moving on into China. In response to U.S. Army Air Forces operations from China, the Japanese drove the Americans and Chinese from eastern China. Only in the last weeks of the war did the tide turn in favor of the Allies in China.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kamil proclaimed himself sultan in Cairo, {{while his}} brother al-Mu'azzam claimed the throne in Damascus. Al-Kamil {{attempted}} to retake Damietta, but was forced back by John of Brienne. After learning {{of a conspiracy}} against him, he fled, leaving the Egyptian army leaderless. Panic ensued, but {{with the help of}} al-Mu'azzam, al-Kamil regrouped his forces. By then, however, the Crusaders had seized his camp. The Ayyubids offered to negotiate for a withdrawal from Damietta, offering the restoration of Palestine to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, {{with the exception of the}} forts of Mont Real and Karak. This was refused by the leader of the Fifth Crusade, Pelagius of Albano, and in 1221, the Crusaders were <b>driven</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Nile Delta after the Ayyubid victory at Mansura.|$|E
