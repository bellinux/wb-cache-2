6000|$|Of {{the fact}} and {{evidence}} of the supernatural I will speak afterwards. Here we are only concerned with this clear point; that {{in so far as}} the liberal idea of freedom can be said to be on either side in the discussion about miracles, it is obviously on the side of miracles. Reform or (in the only tolerable sense) progress means simply the <b>gradual</b> <b>control</b> of matter by mind. A miracle simply means the swift control of matter by mind. If you wish to feed the people, you may think that feeding them miraculously in the wilderness is impossible--but you cannot think it illiberal. If you really want poor children to go to the seaside, you cannot think it illiberal that they should go there on flying dragons; you can only think it unlikely. A holiday, like Liberalism, only means the liberty of man. A miracle only means the liberty of God. You may conscientiously deny either of them, but you cannot call your denial a triumph of the liberal idea. The Catholic Church believed that man and God both had a sort of spiritual freedom. Calvinism took away the freedom from man, but left it to God. Scientific materialism binds the Creator Himself; it chains up God as the Apocalypse chained the devil. It leaves nothing free in the universe. And those who assist this process are called the [...] "liberal theologians." ...|$|E

During the film, it is stated that Xavier believes that humans and mutants have now achieved peace, prompting him to focus on building up the Institute as a more conventional school, intending to bring humans into the school as well as mutants, although Hank and Raven each make preparations for a future conflict to prepare for the worst even if Hank wants to hope. He has also started teaching the young Jean Grey, helping her develop a more <b>gradual</b> <b>control</b> of her powers without the telepathic blocks of the original timeline, and the storyline sees his first meeting with Scott Summers after Scott's powers emerge during an argument with a bully at school. When he hears that Eric has disappeared and learns of rumors of an ancient mutant, Xavier makes contact with new foe Apocalypse while using Cerebro, allowing Apocalypse to take remote control of Xavier's telepathy and use him to make the governments launch all their nuclear missiles, before teleporting to the mansion to abduct Xavier. Although Apocalypse forces Xavier to transmit a telepathic message to the human race by enhancing his powers, proclaiming Apocalypse's intentions to launch a plan of conquest against the world, Xavier uses the opportunity to transmit a private message to Jean with his location, and concludes the message by telling those with power to protect those without rather than to prepare for conquest.|$|E

This last issue is critic since mega events have to respect a mandatory deadline and any delay could cause critical project scope reduction. It is thus fundamental to control efficiently and effectively their progress to obtain the best performances. Despite “project controlling” field is well-documented concerning mega-projects, there is a gap for mega events. In addition, literature focuses on strategic elements without providing operative methods to control the execution phase.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the fin width on substrate-to-gate coupling in long-channel silicon-on-insulator triple-gate transistors is investigated. A complementary analysis, taking into account both the "front coupling" (variation of the front-channel threshold voltage V-T 1, {{as a function of}} the substrate bias V-G 2) and "back coupling" (variation of the back-channel threshold voltage V-T 2, {{as a function of the}} front-gate bias V-G 1) characteristics has been carried out. It is shown that the back coupling, as opposed to the front coupling, is highly sensitive to the fin width in narrow-channel devices and can even be used in fin width extraction. Simple analytical 2 -D models for the body potential, V-T 1, and V-T 2 have been developed to clarify the experimental data, showing in particular the <b>gradual</b> <b>control</b> of the back interface potential by the lateral gates in narrow fins.

40|$|Historical {{importance}} of wetlands in malaria transmission in southwest of Spain Malaria is a parasitic disease {{that is currently}} affecting {{a good number of}} countries with approximately one million deaths per year. Traditionally, this pathology has been related to wetlands and other unhealthy water bodies. It disappeared from most of Western Europe after the Second World War; however, its eradication from Spain took place later. In fact, the WHO didn’t ofcially declare malaria in Spain eradicated until 1964, after a <b>gradual</b> <b>controlled</b> process of the illness, through the improvement of health and hygienic conditions in the country, and the ght against the vectors, the parasite, and its reservoirs. In 1913, the Spanish regions with the largest number of municipalities with autochthonous malaria were, precisely, those con-taining larger areas covered by unhealthy water bodies (except for Extremadura). Among them, Western Andalusia outstood as the main region with the largest area of unhealthy malaria focuses and with high mortality and morbidity rates. Within Western Andalusia, Huelva —and especially its coastal areas — has been, for centuries, one of the provinces with greater endemicity. After the Spanish Civil War a process of reforestation with fast-growing species took place in the Coastal Aeolian Sheet of the Province of Huelva, which led to an 88 % reduction of the surface covered by ponds in this territory.

A total of 110 (24 %) patients presented with severely raised blood pressures deemed to require emergency management. At presentation 84 / 110 had symptoms and signs of long standing hypertension with neurological involvement. Between 1975 and 1980 bolus intravenous injections of diazoxide and/or hydralazine were used {{with the aim of}} reducing the blood pressure to within the normal range for age in the first 12 - 24 hours after admission. Of 57 patients treated in this way 13 developed hypotensive complications and four, whose blood pressures returned to normal within 24 hours of admission, suffered irreversible neurological damage. Subsequently, the management changed to the use of intravenous infusions of labetalol (1 - 3 mg/kg/hour) and/or sodium nitroprusside (0. 5 - 8 micrograms/kg/min) to enable a more <b>gradual</b> <b>controlled</b> reduction of blood pressure over the first 96 hours of admission.

In all cases blood pressure reduction was achieved in a more controlled manner without further neurological impairment or serious irreversible side effects. From our experience, the use of labetalol and sodium nitroprusside by incremental infusion in the critical early phase of management has resulted in improved control of accelerated hypertension without the sudden hypotensive episodes seen when bolus injections are used...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} pragmatic {{value of a}} scaffolded {{language}} curriculum (SLC) model for fostering students’ deep approach to learning in a language discipline. An SLC based on the control wedge model (Cadman and Grey, 2000) was implemented with third-year undergraduate students in Advanced Japanese — the majority completing various non-Arts degrees. Building upon students’ existing Internet literacy in English, a variety of staged tasks were embedded and scaffolded in a curriculum, guiding students to complete a research project — involving writing a research essay and giving an oral research presentation, both in Japanese. Students investigated self-selected social issues in Japan to develop both their Japanese language-specific and research skills. With a <b>gradual</b> <b>control</b> shift from teacher to student, students became increasingly autonomous, in their utilisation of Japanese search engines and online tools to locate and read authentic online materials in Japanese. Results from formal student experience surveys show that authentic tasks embedded in an SLC effectively improved students’ course experience ratings in all areas; including transferable, generic research and thinking skills, without increasing perceptions of workload. Implications and future directions, as well as transferability of this model to other language contexts, are also discussed. Kayoko Enomoto[URL]...|$|E
