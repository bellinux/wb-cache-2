Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4–5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> are pluripotent and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the placenta.|$|E
25|$|From this knowledge, ES cell {{contributions}} to chimeras have been developed. <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> {{can be used}} in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper.

An example is the chimera built off of <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> and tetraploid embryos, tetraploid embryos which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that on-and-off {{transcription}} factors (TFs) regulations play crucial roles in differentiation and reprogramming. Oct 4, Sox 2 and Nanog {{as well as their}} constituted gene networks cooperatively maintain <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> pluripotency. Recently, TFs such as Nanog, Stella and Rex 1 show heterogeneous expression in <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> populations and such heterogeneity lead to different differentiation potential indicating that heterogeneous gene expression may control cell fate. Besides gene regulation triggered by TFs, intrinsic noise was also found to be a potential source in heterogeneity and stochastic cell fate determination. For safe clinical application of stem cell-based therapy, it is crucial to quantify these dynamic processes and transition rate during research and development. However, in most cases, the transition rate is too low to be measured and is often entangled with cell proliferation. In order to disentangle these processes, we established a Nanog-EGFP reporter <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> line and quantified the transition rates between two subpopulations. We also developed a mathematical model involving cell state transition, proliferation and noise to facilitate deciphering this process. We first generated a dual reporter <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> line (Nanog-EGFP and EF 1 α-H 2 B-mCherry) based on PiggyBac system. Using a simple <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation process, differentiation and dedifferentiation could be obviously observed based on Nanog <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> reporter. In order to quantify the transition and proliferation rate, we performed multiple batches of <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and dedifferentiation based with this reporter <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> line. Mathematical models (drift-diffusion-growth equation) are also introduced to fit the data. The quantitative and nontrivial model predictions lead to new experiments and hypotheses. Combined the flow cytometry data with mathematical models, we are able to directly derive the most likely potential landscape (Waddington’s landscape) based on Nanog distribution. Our results and approaches developed would provide more clues for future <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation studies. In another project, we generated multiple <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> reporters in which Nanog, Oct 4 and Rex 1 were all labeled with different fluorescence proteins. We differentiated the reporter <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> line specifically into epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) based on previous protocols. Based on flow cytometry analysis, we found that, during the transition from <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> to EpiSC state, all the three marker genes showed heterogeneous expression pattern, and three sub-populations can be identified at the EpiSC steady (later) state. The cell fate identity and potential converting ability into other identities like <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> or inter-converting ability among three populations were being conducted based on chemical factors. In addition, we quantitatively characterized PiggyBac mediated multiplex gene transfer in mouse embryonic stem cell which lay a good foundation in above mentioned <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> reporter generation. HS 4 insulator was also characterized on the effect of protecting from promoter interference and gene silencing as well as transposition efficiency.

2500|$|The {{general methods}} for {{creating}} chimeric mice {{can be summarized}} either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos.

[...] <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of homologous recombination, thus allowing gene targeting.

2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{combinations}} that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and <b>ES</b> <b>cells,</b> diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>ES</b> <b>cells.</b> The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for. [...] <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst.

However, analysis also revealed that Nanog loss severely compromises the self-sustaining feedback structure of the <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> regulatory network. Consequently, these nascent changes soon become consolidated to committed fate decisions in the prolonged absence of Nanog.

5000|$|<b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> use a {{different}} strategy to deal with DSBs. [...] Because <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> give rise {{to all of the}} cell types of an organism including the cells of the germ line, mutations arising in <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> due to faulty DNA repair are a more serious problem than in differentiated somatic cells. Consequently, robust mechanisms are needed in <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> to repair DNA damages accurately, and if repair fails, to remove those cells with un-repaired DNA damages. Thus, mouse <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> predominantly use high fidelity homologous recombinational repair (HRR) to repair DSBs. [...] This type of repair depends on the interaction of the two sister chromosomes formed during S phase and present together during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. HRR can accurately repair DSBs in one sister chromosome by using intact information from the other sister chromosome. Cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (i.e. after metaphase/cell division but prior the next round of replication) have only one copy of each chromosome (i.e. sister chromosomes aren’t present). Mouse <b>ES</b> <b>cells</b> lack a G1 checkpoint and do not undergo cell cycle arrest upon acquiring DNA damage. [...] Rather they undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to DNA damage. [...] Apoptosis {{can be used as a}} fail-safe strategy to remove cells with un-repaired DNA damages in order to avoid mutation and progression to cancer.

It has been reported that the lineage specific differentiation could be affected by the size of <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> colonies and embryoid bodies (EBs). However, much of the underlying biology has not been well elucidated. In this study, we used microengineered hydrogel microwells to direct <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and determined the role of WNT signaling pathway in directing the differentiation. This was accomplished by forming <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates within microwells to form different size EBs. We determined that cardiogenesis was enhanced in larger EBs (450 μm in diameter), and in contrast, endothelial cell differentiation was increased in smaller EBs (150 μm in diameter). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the EB-size mediated differentiation was driven by differential expression of WNTs, particularly noncanonical WNT pathway, according to EB size. The higher expression of WNT 5 a in smaller EBs enhanced endothelial cell differentiation. In contrast, the increased expression of WNT 11 enhanced cardiogenesis. This was further validated by WNT 5 a-siRNA transfection assay and the addition of recombinant WNT 5 a. Our data suggest that EB size could be an important parameter in <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> fate specification via differential gene expression of members of the noncanonical WNT pathway. Given the size-dependent response of EBs to differentiate to endothelial and cardiac lineages, hydrogel microwell arrays could be useful for directing stem cell fates and studying <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation in a controlled manner.

However, during differentiation, STAT 3 activity steadily increased from day 5 to 14 and was reduced by day 21. STAT 3 activity was also confirmed separately by Western blots.

Our experimental dataset includes measurements for 28 signaling protein phosphorylation states across 16 different factorial combinations of cytokine and matrix stimuli as reported previously. Results: The Bayesian network modeling approach allows us to uncover previously reported signaling activities related to mouse <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> self-renewal, such as the roles of LIF and STAT 3 in maintaining undifferentiated <b>ES</b> <b>cell</b> populations. Furthermore, the network predicts novel influences such as between ERK phosphorylation and differentiation, or RAF phosphorylation and differentiated cell proliferation. Visualization of the influences detected by the Bayesian network provides intuition about the underlying physiology of the signaling pathways. We demonstrate that the Bayesian networks can capture the linear, nonlinear and multistate logic interactions that connect extracellular cues, intracellular signals and consequent cell functional responses.
