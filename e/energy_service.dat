2500|$|Fuel {{switching}} on the demand side refers to changing {{the type of}} fuel used to satisfy a need for an <b>energy</b> <b>service.</b> [...] To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed. Energy efficiency alone may {{not be sufficient to}} meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions. Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning coal. [...] There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric heat pump has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient coefficient of performance of heat pumps.|$|E

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>services</b> play a {{key role}} in {{increasing}} energy efficiency in the industry. The key actors in these services are the local and regional energy companies that are increasingly implementing <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> as part of their market offering and developing service portfolios. Although expectations for <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> have been high, progress has so far been limited, and many companies offering <b>energy</b> <b>services,</b> including <b>energy</b> companies, are experiencing difficulties in implementing <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> and providing them to the market. Overall, this research examines what is needed for local and regional energy companies to successfully implement <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> (and consequently provide them to the market). In doing this, a two-stage process is used: first, we identify key activities for the successful implementation of <b>energy</b> <b>services,</b> and second, we aggregate the findings to the business model level. This research demonstrates that to succeed in implementing <b>energy</b> <b>services,</b> an <b>energy</b> company may need to renew parts or all of its existing product-based business model, formulate a new business model, or develop coexisting multiple business models. By discussing two distinct business model innovation processes, this research demonstrates that there can be different paths to success.

CEE protocol 11 - 004. Collaboration for Environmental Evidence: www. environmentalevidence. org / SR 11004. html. 1 1. Background Although there is no simple definition, modern <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> are often identified in terms that contrast them with traditional <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> such as those derived from the burning of biomass in open fires (UN-Energy 2005; Brew-Hammond 2010).

Examples of modern <b>energy</b> <b>services,</b> therefore, include (among others) electricity from solar home systems (SHSs) for lighting, natural gas burned in modern stoves for cooking and petroleum-based engines for motive power to enable agro-processing (Modi et al. 2005; Practical Action 2010).

It then investigates household <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> divided into three classes: lower income, middle income, and upper income. It finds that the primary energy technologies involved with low-income households involve {{a greater number of}} fuels and carriers, ranging from dung and fuelwood to liquefied petroleum gas and charcoal, but a fewer number of services. Middle-income households throughout the world tend to rely on electricity and natural gas, followed by coal, liquefied petroleum gas, and kerosene. These homes utilize energy to produce a much broader range services. The upper class or rich have access to the same energy fuels, carriers, and technologies as middle-income homes and families, but consume more energy (and more high luxury items).

40|$|The {{rapid pace}} of {{urbanization}} {{has an impact}} on climate change and other environmental issues. Currently, 54 % of the global population lives in cities accounting for two-thirds of global energy demand. Sustainable energy generation and consumption is the top humanity’s problem for the next 50 years. Faced with rising urban population and the need to achieve energy efficiency, urban planners are focusing on sustainable, smart energy systems. This has {{led to the development of}} Smart Grids (SG) that employs intelligent monitoring, control and communication technologies to enhance efficiency, reliability and sustainability of power generation and distribution networks. While energy utilities are optimizing energy generation and distribution, consumers play a key role in sustainable energy usage. Several <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> are provided to the consumers to know households' hourly energy consumption, estimate monthly electricity cost and recommendations to reduce energy consumption. Furthermore, advanced services such as demand response, can now control and influence energy demand at the consumer-end to reduce the overall peak demand and re-shape demand profiles. The effectiveness and adoption of these services highly depend on the consumers’ awareness, their participation and engagement. Current <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> seldomly consider consumer preferences such as their daily behavior, comfort level and energy-consumption pattern. In this thesis, we investigate development of personalized <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> that strive to achieve a balance between efficient-energy consumption and user comfort. Personalization refers to tailoring <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> based on individual consumers’ characteristics, preferences and behavior. To develop effective personalized <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> a set of challenges need to be tackled. First, fine-grained data collection at user and appliance level is required (data collection challenge). Mechanisms should be devised to collect fine-grained data at various levels in a non-intrusive way with minimal sensors. Second, personalized <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> require detailed user preferences such as their thermal comfort level, appliance usage behavior and daily habits (user preference challenge). Accurate learning models to derive user preferences with minimal training and intrusion are required. Third, <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> developed needs to be easily scalable, from one household to tens and thousands of households (scalability challenge). Mechanisms should be developed to tackle the deluge of data and support distributed storage and processing. Fourth, <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> should deliver real-time feedback or recommendations so that users can promptly act upon it (real time challenge). This calls for development of distributed and low complexity algorithms. This thesis moves away from traditional SG services [...] which hardly consider consumer preferences and comfort [...] and proposes a novel approach to develop effective personalized <b>energy</b> <b>services.</b> The proposed <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> provide actionable feedback, raise awareness and promote energy-saving behavior among consumers. In this thesis, we follow a bottom-up data-driven methodology to develop personalized <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> at various scales [...] (i) nano: individual households, (ii) micro: buildings and spaces, and (iii) macro: neighborhoods and cities. To this end, we present our approach [...] physical analytics for sustainable, smart energy systems [...] that combines IoT data, physical modeling and data analytics to develop intelligent, personalized <b>energy</b> <b>services.</b> Physical analytics fuses data from various Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart meters, smart phones and smart watches, along with physical information such as household type, demographics and occupancy to infer energy-usage patterns, user behavior and discover hidden patterns. This approach is used to learn and model user preferences and energy usage, subsequently, employed to develop personalized <b>energy</b> <b>services.</b> This thesis is organized into three parts. Part I describes how to derive fine-grained information with minimal sensors and intrusion. We present two novel algorithms viz., LocED and PEAT that derive fine-grained information from appliance and user level, respectively. This real-time information is used to raise awareness on energy-usage behavior among occupants. Part II presents personalized <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> targeted at households and buildings. We develop services that shift and/or reduce energy consumption and cost by considering individual consumers’ preferences and comfort. These <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> are aimed at providing actionable feedback to occupants towards sustainable energy usage. Part III presents <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> targeted at neighborhood and city level. These <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> aim to identify target consumers in a neighborhood based on their energy-usage pattern and preferences for various DR programs. Finally, we present data-processing architectures that investigate how to cope with the overwhelming data generated from smart meters towards design and development of sustainable, smart energy systems. This thesis advocates that the design and development of <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> should follow personalized approach with consumer preferences and comfort given paramount importance. Results show that the personalized <b>energy</b> <b>services</b> developed has significant potential to raise awareness, reduce energy consumption and improve user comfort in smart [...] homes, buildings and neighborhoods.
