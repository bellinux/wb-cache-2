40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of {{preoperative}} <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy on apoptosis in IIa and IIb cervical cancer tissue. Methods: Patients with IIa and IIb locally advanced cervical cancer who received preoperative auxiliary therapy in our hospital between May 2013 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed and divided into adjuvant chemotherapy group, <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> group and combined treatment group according to the different preoperative adjuvant therapies. Cervical cancer tissues were collected respectively during biopsy (before treatment) and during surgical excision (after treatment) to extract RNA, and then fluorescence quantitative PCR kits {{were used to determine}} the expression of pro-apoptosis genes, anti-apoptosis genes and invasion genes. Results: After treatment, SARI, Rab 26, FHIT and eIF 4 E 3 expression in cervical cancer lesions of three groups were significantly higher than those before treatment while serum CA 125, TSGF and SCC-Ag levels as well as MRP 8, MRP 14, p 38 MAPK, ERK 1 / 2 and c-myc expression were significantly lower than those before treatment, and SARI, Rab 26, FHIT and eIF 4 E 3 expression in cervical cancer lesions of combined treatment group were significantly higher than those of adjuvant chemotherapy group and <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> group while serum CA 125, TSGF and SCC-Ag levels as well as MRP 8, MRP 14, p 38 MAPK, ERK 1 / 2 and c-myc expression were significantly lower than those of adjuvant chemotherapy group and <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> group.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} was to analyze the outcomes of the patients, who received salvage radiotherapy for incidentally discovered cervical cancer following simple hysterectomy, and to identify the influence of <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> on treatment outcomes. Methods: Data from 117 patients with occult cervical cancer who underwent simple hysterec-tomy followed by salvage radiotherapy from September 1979 to November 2010 were collected. All the patients received external beam radiotherapy with (n 45) or without (n 72) intracavi-tary radiotherapy. Local control, disease-free survival, overall survival and treatment-related toxicity were investigated. Results: The median follow-up time was 75 months. The 5 - and 10 -year local control/disease-free survival/overall survival rates were 93 / 87 / 87 % and 90 / 84 / 83 %, respectively. Among 98 patients who had no residual disease and negative resection margin on surgical specimens, 32 (33 %) received <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> and 66 (67 %) did not. There were no differences in patient and tumor characteristics between patients treated with and without intracavitary radio-therapy.

A field emission (FE) -type X-ray generator using carbon nanotubes is a newly-developed compact system that can be as small as several cm in length. Considering the compactness of the equipment, the FE-type X-ray generator may become a useful tool for endoscopic, <b>intracavitary</b> or intraoperative <b>radiotherapy</b> in the future. The aim {{of this study was to}} inves-tigate the biological effects of X-rays generated by the FE-type X-ray source in comparison with those of conventional TE-type X-rays. Mouse thymic lymphoma 3 SB cells were irradiated by an FE-type X-ray generator developed by our group and a conventional TE-type X-ray source under identical conditions. DNA damage after radiation was detected by foci formation of phospho-H 2 AX (γ-H 2 AX). Effect on the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint was analyzed by immunoblotting. Induction of apoptosis was studied using the TUNEL assay. In terms of induction of DNA damage (DNA double-strand breaks), activation of cell cycle checkpoints (p 53 stabilization, p 21 induction, Chk 1 and Chk 2 phosphorylations), and induction of apoptotic cell death, FE-type X-rays were as effective as TE-type X-rays, and FE-type X-rays appeared to be applicable to radiation therapy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} done to {{evaluate}} response, compliance and survival of weekly low dose cisplatin (20 mg/m 2) and gemcitabine (125 mg/m 2) concurrently with pelvic radiation as primary treatment of stage IIB-IIIB cervical cancer. Methods: External radiation consisted of 50 Gy/ 25 fractions using 6 - 10 MV photon followed by 600 cGy boost to parametrium if it was still felt thickened. Then, <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> to deliver 60 Gy at point A. Chemotherapy consisted of gemcitabine at a dose of 125 mg/ m 2 was given by i. v infusion over 30 minutes immediately after cisplatin 20 mg/ m 2 weekly for 5 weeks during EBRT. Forty–five eligible patients received the treatment protocol. Results: Toxicity was tolerable and manageable. No grade 4 toxicity while grade 3 was recorded in hematologic one only. In order of frequency; diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and anemia (50 %, 40 %, 35. 5 %) were most common adverse events. Overall clinical response rate was 93. 4 % with pathological complete response of 62. 2 %. After median follow-up of 20 months, 2 -year survival and progression-free survival rates were 90. 5 % and 81 % respectively. Conclusion: Weekly combination of low- dose cisplatin and gemcitabine given concurrently with pelvic radiotherapy in primary treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer resulted in a high response rate with a good compliance.

40|$|Treatment with {{preoperative}} <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> (ICRT) {{is used in}} {{cervical cancer}} with the intention to reduce the tumour burden and sterilize microscopic disease in the paracervical tissues. Preoperative ICRT is, however, a controversial treatment regime since it is unclear if addition of ICRT to surgery improves treatment outcome compared to surgery alone. This question constitutes {{the basis of this}} thesis. In relation to this issue we have studied clinical, dosimetric and molecular key factors with focus on DNA damage repair signalling molecules of possible importance for radiotherapy sensitivity. One possible way to investigate the potential benefit of preoperative ICRT is to analyze whether complete tumour remission in the surgical specimen after preoperative ICRT is correlated to treatment outcome or not. In paper I we analyzed treatment results after preoperative ICRT in patients with cervical cancer stage IB-IIA. We found a strong correlation between pathologic complete remission (pCR) and survival with a 5 -year survival of 95 % in patients with pCR compared to 46 % in patients with residual tumour (non-pCR) (p< 0. 0001). These results indicate that the use of preoperative ICRT may contribute to treatment outcome compared to surgery alone. DNA double strand breaks (DNA DSBs) and their repair has in tumour cell lines been linked to radiosensitivity. In paper II we therefore analyzed the expression of proteins related to the DNA-PK repair pathway; DNA-PKcs, Ku 70, Ku 86, p 53, p 21 and Mdm- 2 in pre-treatment tumour tissue with the aim to find predictive markers for radiotherapy response. Our hypothesis was that high DNA repair capacity in the primary tumour, reflected by a high frequency of cells positive for DNA-PK proteins, would correlate with non-pCR cases. However, we did not find that any of the analyzed proteins were predictive for radiotherapy response. Our hypothesis in paper III was that residual tumours that survived radiotherapy would display a higher frequency of DNA-PK positive cells reflecting a higher capacity to DNA DSB repair compared to their corresponding primary tumours. The expression of DNA-PKcs, Ku 70, Ku 86, p 53, p 21 and Mdm- 2 proteins was compared in pre- and post-treatment tumour tissue. We found that residual tumours showed an increased frequency of tumour cells positive for DNA-PK complex proteins compared to the frequency in the primary tumour. This result may be interpreted as that radiation causes a selection pressure allowing tumour cells with high DNA-PK expression to survive RT. Biological effective dose (BED) can be used to predict the influence on outcome of different treatment schedules for individual patients. In paper IV we evaluated BED with respect to survival, local control and late toxicity in patients treated either with radiotherapy and surgery or with radiotherapy alone. We found a correlation between BED and treatment outcome for patients treated with radiotherapy alone but not for patients treated with radiotherapy and surgery. No correlations were found between BED and late toxicity from bladder and rectum. In conclusion this thesis illustrates that treatment with preoperative <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> may be beneficial for patients with cervical cancer stage IB-IIA. We found that the expression of the DNA-PK complex proteins in primary tumour cannot predict RT response. We did, however, find that the frequency of the DNA-PK complex proteins is higher in residual tumour after ICRT than in corresponding primary tumour. BED cannot be used as a predictive factor for the outcome in patients treated with pre-and postoperative radiotherapy or for the late side effects but does correlate with local control of the tumour and survival in patients treated with RT alone...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{report the}} outcome of {{carcinoma}} cervix patients treated radically by external beam radiotherapy and high dose rate <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy.</b> Material and Methods: From January 2005 to December 2006, a total of 709 newly diagnosed cases of carcinoma cervix were reported in our department. All cases were staged according to the International Federation of Gynecologist and Oncologist staging system. Out of 709 cases, 342 completed radical radiotherapy and were retrospectively analyzed {{for the presence of}} local residual disease, local recurrence, distant metastases, radiation reaction, and disease free survival. Results: There were 11 (3. 22 &#x 0025;), 82 (23. 98 &#x 0025;), 232 (67. 83 &#x 0025;), and 17 (4. 97 &#x 0025;) patients in stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The median follow up time for all patients was 36 months (range 3 - 54 months). The overall treatment time (OTT) ranged from 52 to 69 days (median 58 days). The 3 year disease free survival rate was 81. 8 &#x 0025;, 70. 7 &#x 0025;, 40. 08 &#x 0025;, and 11. 76 &#x 0025; for stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively.

Methods: A total of 133 consecutive patients with intermediate risk early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma treated at Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute from February 2010 to March 2014 were enrolled in our study. All patients received adjuvant therapy and were subdivided into three groups: pelvic radiotherapy (RT; N= 42), adjuvant chemotherapy + <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> (CT+ICRT; N= 47), or concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT; N= 44). Disease-free survival (DFS) and therapeutic complications were evaluated. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} in DFS for patients treated with RT, CT+ICRT, and CCRT (P> 0. 05) with 3 -year rates of 94. 0 %, 93. 4 %, and 97. 6 %, respectively. Frequencies of grade III–IV acute toxicities were higher in patients treated with CCRT (34. 1 %) than those treated with RT (9. 5 %) or CT+ICRT (16. 7 %; P> 0. 05), with no significant differences observed between RT and CT+ICRT groups (P> 0. 05). Grade I–II late toxicities were higher in CCRT (25 %), followed by RT (19. 0 %), and finally, the CT+ICRT group (4. 3 %; P 0. 05).

40|$|Purpose: For {{cervical}} carcinoma {{patients with}} poor geometry for conventional <b>intracavitary</b> <b>radiotherapy,</b> a simple vaginal template for interstitial implantation {{as a substitute}} was used. This template has also been used to treat patients who had hysterectomy done without knowledge of an early tumor in the cervix, and for patients with recurrent disease. This is {{a report of the}} treatment results. Methods and Material: A total of 21 patients were treated over from July 1987 to June 1991 with this vaginal template implant forming part of the treatment, 12 of these were performed for vaginal stenosis. The applicator consists of a front piece and an end piece. Holes were drilled in the front piece to guide the implantation of the cervix or vaginal vault. The diameter of applicators varied from 2 cm to 3. 5 cm. Depending on the diameter of the applicators, six to eight needles on the periphery, or eight peripheral plus one central needle were used. The activity of the needles were around 8 mCi with a total length of 5. 5 cm. The end piece was locked onto the front piece by a bayonet-type locking device. The purpose of the end piece was two-fold: to make up the length of the whole applicator to fit the vagina and to keep the implanted needles in place without being extruded. The implantation was performed under general anesthesia. Results: One of the twelve patients treated with the vaginal template implant for vaginal stenosis had relapsed centrally but subsequently died of intercurrent disease. Two other patients died of intercurrent disease at 26. 2 and 41. 9 months, respectively, without evidence of relapse. Nine other patients had been followed with no evidence of local relapse for 23. 7 to 54. 6 months.
