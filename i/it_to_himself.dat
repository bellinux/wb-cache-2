5|$|Nick Hendricks (Bateman) and Dale Arbus (Day) {{are friends}} who despise their bosses. Nick {{works at a}} {{financial}} firm for the sadistic David Harken (Spacey), who implies {{the possibility of a}} promotion for Nick for months, only to award <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> Dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston); she threatens to tell his fiancee Stacy (Lindsay Sloane) that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her. Nick and Dale's accountant friend Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) enjoys working for Jack Pellitt (Donald Sutherland) at a chemical company, but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's cocaine-addicted son Bobby (Farrell), whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company.|$|E

25|$|They {{are trying}} to persuade me to let my boy be inoculated with smallpox. But as I have {{expressed}} sufficiently clearly my aversion to this impertinence they are leaving me in peace. Here inoculation is the general fashion. But for my part I leave the matter to the grace of God. It depends on His grace whether He wishes to keep this prodigy of nature in this world in which He placed it or to take <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>Himself.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{music for}} Super Metroid was {{composed}} by Kenji Yamamoto and Minako Hamano, and uses 16-bit versions {{of music from}} previous games. According to Yamamoto, {{he came up with}} the game's theme by humming <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> while riding his motorcycle from work. In addition to composing music, Yamamoto served as a sound programmer and created sound effects for the game. These simultaneous roles allowed him [...] "to produce distinct Metroid music with a sound programmer’s ear, with a sound effect creator’s ear, and with the approach methodology and theory of a composer." [...] The arrangements and remixes of the game's themes were used in Metroid Prime and its sequels, because Yamamoto wanted [...] "to satisfy old Metroid fans. It's like a present for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Levin had {{rejected}} Judaism when a youth, he quested after spirituality. Such religious sympathies as he had, he said, were [...] "with quietist faiths, like Buddhism, {{on the one}} hand, and with a straightforward message of salvation, like Christianity, on the other". With the help of Stassinopoulos he continued to search after spiritual truth. She later wrote, [...] "He tried therapy, he tried Insight, a self-awareness seminar that I had helped to bring to London, he tried a stint in an ashram in India. Lesser souls would have avoided the ridicule that was heaped on him for his spiritual 'search' by simply keeping <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> But he didn't, because anything he was touched by he had to write about". In 1980 he wrote extensive accounts in his column about {{his visit to the}} Indian commune of the meditation teacher Osho.|$|E

2500|$|El Conde Lucanor (the name Lucanor {{being taken}} from the prose Tristan), also {{entitled}} the Libro de enxemplos, was first printed by Gonzalo Argote de Molina at Seville in 1575, and it revealed Don Juan Manuel as a master {{in the art of}} prose composition, and as the predecessor of Boccaccio in the province of romantic narrative. The structure of stories reflects the ordinances and hierarchical structuring of the medieval world. In the first parts a young nobleman, Lucanor, proposes an abstract problem to Patronio; later, he gives an apologue which extracts the solution from Patronio's tale, applying <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] Juan Manuel concludes the story with a short verse, condensing the moral of the story into short, concrete statements.|$|E
2500|$|Late in his life, Seedman finally {{revealed}} why he {{had given}} the order. In a new preface to the 2011 E-book release of his 1974 memoir Chief!, he explained what he had kept to himself for four decades. With the tensions outside escalating, he had called Chief Inspector Michael Codd from the mosque and asked for two busloads of police cadets armed with nightsticks to keep order on the street outside. Codd refused and hung up. When Seedman called back {{he was told that}} Codd was out to lunch. That failure to support officers in the field had been the real reason for his retirement. He had kept <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> since [...] "I loved the police department so much that I couldn't drag it through the dirt by saying what those bastards did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Owin {{returned}} {{a little later}} and saw Chad privately. He asked about the singing. Chad {{told him that he}} must keep <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> for the time being: angels had come to call him to his heavenly reward, and in seven days they would return to fetch him. So it was that Chad weakened and died after seven days– on 2 March, which remains his feast day. Bede writes that: [...] "he had always looked forward to this day– or rather his mind had always been on the Day of the Lord". Many years later, his old friend Egbert told a visitor that someone in Ireland had seen the heavenly company coming for Chad's soul and returning with it to heaven. Significantly, with the heavenly host was Cedd. Bede was not sure whether or not the vision was actually Egbert's own.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was later}} alleged that Daniel had Fragile X syndrome, {{and that this}} was the cause of {{domestic}} problems in the Benoit family. It was also suggested that needle marks on Daniel's arms were the result of growth hormones given to him because Benoit and his family considered him undersized due to Fragile X. Benoit's coworker and best friend, wrestler Chris Jericho, stated that from his own research on the condition, the symptoms [...] "fit Daniel to a tee, all across the board". With regard to those who had publicly stated that they had no knowledge of Daniel having the condition, Jericho said, [...] "If Chris had decided that he wanted to keep <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> you wouldn't have been able to pry that out of him with anything." [...] Despite Chris Jericho's initial statements regarding Daniel, he later stated in his 2011 book Undisputed, [...] "It turned out that Daniel didn't have Fragile X, but at the time it made sense because I was grasping at straws." ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Neal said he didn't [...] "compete {{with little}} guys who run around {{dominating}} the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe." [...] O'Neal {{added that he}} was only competing against Duncan: [...] "If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that." [...] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected {{to be part of the}} second unit. Privately, he wanted to start, but kept <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg including knee, calf, hip, and Achilles injuries. The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury, and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20minutes. After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf. It was the last regular season game he would play that year. [...] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.|$|E
2500|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and [...] intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as Forward Observer for Artillery, while attached to Company H, Second Battalion, Ninth Marines, Third Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against communist forces at Ky Phu in Quang Tin Province, Republic of Vietnam, on 18 December 1965. [...] When the company was suddenly pinned down by a hail of extremely accurate enemy fire and was quickly separated from the remainder of the battalion by over five hundred meters of open and fire-swept ground, and casualties mounted rapidly, Lieutenant Barnum quickly made a hazardous reconnaissance of the area seeking targets for his artillery. Finding the rifle company commander mortally wounded and the radio operator killed, he, with complete disregard for his own safety, gave aid to the dying commander, then removed the radio from the dead operator and strapped <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] He immediately assumed command of the rifle company, and moving at once into the midst of the heavy fire, rallying and giving encouragement to all units, reorganized them to replace the loss of key personnel and led their attack on enemy positions from which deadly fire continued to come. [...] His sound and swift decisions and his obvious calm served to stabilize the badly decimated units and his gallant example as he stood exposed repeatedly to point out targets served as an inspiration to all. [...] Provided with two armed helicopters, he moved fearlessly through enemy fire to control the air attack against the firmly entrenched enemy while skillfully directing one platoon in a successful counterattack in the key enemy positions. [...] Having thus cleared a small area, he requested and directed the landing of two transport helicopters for the evacuation of the dead and wounded. [...] He then assisted in the mopping up and final seizure of the battalion's objective. [...] His gallant initiative and heroic conduct reflected great credit upon himself and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and United States Naval Service.|$|E
