5|$|Despite {{the safer}} <b>eastern</b> <b>channel</b> and {{improvements}} in maritime technology, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar. In February 1997, two fishermen who were not wearing lifejackets drowned after their boat capsized. Two anglers {{had been killed in}} a similar incident in 1994. On 25 June 2007, the Padstow lifeboat and a rescue helicopter rescued the crews of two yachts in separate incidents from the area.|$|E
5|$|For an {{hour after}} dawn on 13 August, there were few German tracks upon the plot tables in {{operations}} rooms, and none {{at all in the}} central and <b>eastern</b> <b>Channel.</b> The first signs of concentration, however, came earlier than usual, for between 05:30 and 05:40 two formations of 30 or more aircraft were located in the Amiens area. For 30minutes, they remained over land, but at 06:10 they began moving inland. The Observer Corps and radar tracked them and guided the RAF units to intercept. Unaware of the German intent, the controllers directed three full Squadrons and detachments of three others were alerted by 06:15. No. 151 was protecting a convoy in the Thames, No. 111 was protecting RAF Hawkinge and No. 74 Squadron RAF was covering RAF Manston. Parts of No. 85, No. 43 and No. 238 Squadron RAF were also airborne near London. By 06:25, the German formations were well over the Channel. No. 238 was moved to cover their own base at RAF Warmwell. No. 257 Squadron RAF was also ordered to take off at 06:20 to patrol Canterbury. Not satisfied with the strength of the forces already airborne, controllers dispatched No. 601, 213, 64 and 87 Squadrons to intercept between 06:30 and 06:35. The first combats began at 06:30.|$|E
5|$|The next lock is Compton Lock, {{the only}} one built on a river section. It is also called Compton Place Lock or Twyford Lock, and the extra flow {{compared}} to other locks may explain the erosion that has taken place, resulting in a circular area of water between {{the upper and lower}} gates. Just above Shawford Bridge, the river and navigation diverged, with Shawford Mill just below the junction. The building still stands. The bridge is a modern construction, and is located at a point where the towpath crosses to the western bank. Just to the south is a weir at the site of Shawford Single Gates, which probably ensured the mill had an adequate head of water. The village of Twyford lies to the east, and the Twyford Drain splits, with the western channel rejoining the river below the mill, and the <b>eastern</b> <b>channel</b> continuing as a relief channel. There are two more locks on the navigation, called Malm Lock and College Mead Lock, before the navigation rejoins the river. By the junction is the intake for Otterbourne Water Treatment Works.|$|E

25|$|The {{floods and}} debris flows of 1999 {{did not follow}} the <b>eastern</b> <b>channel</b> on Caraballeda. This channel, formed during the 1951 floods, had been lined with {{concrete}} and designed to safely transport the flows into the sea. Instead, the debris flows overwhelmed the channel and the flows overtopped the banks wherever the channel changed direction. Once free of the culvert, the channel rapidly avulsed across the fan and spread debris throughout the community. These overbank flows demolished 2-story houses and destroyed the first two stories of apartment buildings. Farther down the fan, the debris flows routed themselves down streets. As the flows progressed, they left thinner and thinner deposits, though they often still exceeded 1 meter (3feet) in thickness. After several avulsions, the channel roughly followed the pre-1951 flood path.|$|E

Analyses of past zooplankton samples from a long-term monitoring program suggest that this non-indigenous species has been present in the <b>eastern</b> English <b>Channel</b> at least since 2007.

40|$|International audienceAsthenognathus atlanticus Monod, 1932, {{has been}} {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from {{the eastern part of the}} bay of Seine (<b>eastern</b> english <b>Channel).</b> A total of 30 specimens were collected between the years 2008 and 2011, along the normandy coast from ouistreham to Antifer, mainly on mud and muddy sand habitats, between 10 and 25 m depth. the distribution range of A. atlanticus has been previously known to cover eastern Atlantic coasts from Angola to the western english Channel, where it reached its northern limits. it is also present in the western part of the Mediterranean Sea. the changes in the sediment composition of the eastern bay of Seine have probably led to the development of a potentially favorable habitat for this species. However, the data collected have not yet been sufficient to ascertain the origin, and the method of introduction of the <b>eastern</b> english <b>Channel</b> specimens. in the discussion, we ponder if they might have originated from the western english Channel populations, and was transported as larvae in the eastern english Channel; they could have originated from a more distant population, and have been brought to the <b>eastern</b> english <b>Channel</b> through human activities. each hypothesis is possible in theory...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecosystem}} model Atlantis {{was used}} to investigate the key dynamics and processes that structure the <b>Eastern</b> English <b>Channel</b> ecosystem, with a particular focus on two commercial flatfish species, sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). This complex model was parameterized with data collected from diverse sources (a literature review, survey data, as well as landings and stock assessment information) and tuned so both simulated biomass and catch fit 2002 – 2011 observations. Here, the outputs are mainly presented for the two focus species and for some other vertebrates found {{to be important in}} the trophic network. The calibration process revealed the importance of coastal areas in the <b>Eastern</b> English <b>Channel</b> and of nutrient inputs from estuaries: a lack of river nutrients decreases the productivity of nursery grounds and adversely affects the production of sole and plaice. The role of discards in the trophic network is also highlighted. While sole and plaice did not have a strong influence on the trophic network of vertebrates, they are important predators for benthic invertebrates and compete for food with crustaceans, whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and other demersal fish. We also found that two key species, cod (Gadus morhua) and whiting, thoroughly structured the <b>Eastern</b> English <b>Channel</b> trophic network...|$|R
25|$|The only ways to {{the island}} are {{swimming}} or boating. Canoeists and kayakers {{have the option of}} launching from a small parking lot maintained by the Pennsylvania State Park Service adjacent to the north point of the island or from Bull's Island recreational area roughly one mile (1.6km) upstream on the New Jersey shore of the river. A public boat launch several miles downstream in Lambertville, New Jersey makes a convenient place to take out a boat. Any unpowered boats launched from the parking lot on the Pennsylvania side require a launch permit from the Pennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission. Larger boats should not attempt to approach the island's rocky shore line. Boaters passing by the area of the island are best off going through the far <b>eastern</b> <b>channel</b> of the river between Eagle Island and New Jersey; the other two channels are frequently too shallow for safe passage.|$|E
