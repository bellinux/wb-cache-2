5|$|When in estrus, the female's scent changes subtly {{and nearby}} males begin pursuit. In addition, a female alerts males {{she is in}} estrus by {{whistling}} through her nose. During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female {{does not want to}} mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water. Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the <b>harder</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male. The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} more {{extensions}} to Petri nets, however, {{it is important to}} keep in mind, that as the complexity of the net increases in terms of extended properties, the <b>harder</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to use standard tools to evaluate certain properties of the net. For this reason, it is a good idea to use the most simple net type possible for a given modelling task.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to achieve the right balance between the degree of structure and flexibility that {{is built into the}} learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the <b>harder</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the learners to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure the learning experience just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet the learning experience should be open and free enough to allow for the learners to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E
25|$|Insertional {{mutagenesis}} – If the DNA {{is integrated}} in a sensitive {{spot in the}} genome, for example in a tumor suppressor gene, the therapy could induce a tumor. This has occurred in clinical trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) patients, in which hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with a corrective transgene using a retrovirus, and {{this led to the}} development of T cell leukemia in 3 of 20 patients. One possible solution is to add a functional tumor suppressor gene to the DNA to be integrated. This may be problematic since the longer the DNA is, the <b>harder</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to integrate into cell genomes. CRISPR technology allows researchers to make much more precise genome changes at exact locations.|$|E

25|$|An {{effective}} fast bowler {{needs to}} be able to hold a consistent line and length, or in common terms, to be accurate. In this context, line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman, in the horizontal dimension running from the off to the leg side, while length describes the distance the ball travels toward the batsman before bouncing. Variations in length is generally seen as the more important of the two for a fast bowler. The faster the bowler, the <b>harder</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to achieve consistent line and length but sheer speed can make up for the shortfall. Fast bowlers who also manage to be accurate can be devastatingly effective, for example the likes of Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath and South African pace bowler Shaun Pollock.|$|E
25|$|In primates, {{reproductive}} synchrony {{usually takes}} the form of conception and birth seasonality. The regulatory 'clock', in this case, is the sun's position in relation to the tilt of the earth. In nocturnal or partly nocturnal primates—for example, owl monkeys— the periodicity of the moon may also come into play. Synchrony in general is for primates an important variable determining the extent of 'paternity skew'—defined as the extent to which fertile matings can be monopolised by a fraction of the population of males. The greater the precision of female reproductive synchrony—the greater the number of ovulating females who must be guarded simultaneously—the <b>harder</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for any dominant male to succeed in monopolising a harem all to himself. This is simply because, by attending to any one fertile female, the male unavoidably leaves the others at liberty to mate with his rivals. The outcome is to distribute paternity more widely across the total male population, reducing paternity skew (figures a, b).|$|E
500|$|The Government of Canada {{disagreed}} with Ontario's ruling {{and announced that}} the decision would be appealed. Falle helped the Crown formulate their case. That November, Falle was a panelist at a debate about the case. At the debate, which was hosted by the Queen's Law and Public Policy Club at Queen's University, Falle said that, whatever {{the outcome of the}} appeal, she was glad that the case was removing the taboos surrounding talking about prostitution. The following June, Falle and more than twelve others intervened in the case, arguing that the laws should be reinstated to protect women from pimps. As part of this anti-prostitution coalition, Falle said that all areas of the sex industry are unsafe, including escort agencies and strip clubs. Falle testified in the lower courts, saying that [...] "the more they say the women are there by choice, the <b>harder</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for us to convince police, social workers and everyone else that these people are vulnerable." [...] She also said that striking down anti-prostitution laws sends a message to men that it is acceptable to harass women. Falle said that all the applicants in Bedford v. Canadaincluding Terri-Jean Bedford, the dominatrix seeking to have the anti-brothel law struck downentered the sex industry as children. For this reason, Falle argued that neither of these women chose a life of prostitution as a consenting adult; that life had already been chosen for them by the time that they had reached the age of consent. Falle encouraged Canadians to take an interest in Bedford v. Canada because any Canadian girl can become a victim of prostitution.|$|E

There they {{discussed}} lengthening the current ten-year statute of limitations in Colorado for sexual assault. Gloria Allred, who represents most of the nearly 60 alleged victims, spoke to the gathering via Skype: [...] "I have been to New Jersey, and I'm not aware of any down side since they eliminated the statute (of limitations) for rape and sex assault." [...] Brauchler said he does not want any victim denied a fair hearing because of Colorado's statute, but [...] "I don't have a magic number". Any change would have to be done carefully, he said, because the more time that passes between an alleged sex assault and prosecution, the <b>harder</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the accused to defend themselves. Fields noted that Colorado has no statutory limit on murder. [...] "Why have an arbitrary cap for sex assault?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Institutionalist {{arguments}} for resolving ethnic conflict often focus on national-level institutions {{and do not}} account for regional and local variation in ethnic violence within a country. Despite similar levels of ethnic diversity in a country, some towns and cities have often found to be especially prone to ethnic violence. For example, Ashutosh Varshney, {{in his study of}} ethnic violence in India, argues that strong inter-ethnic engagement in villages often disincentivizes politicians from stoking ethnic violence for electoral gain. Informal interactions include joint participation in festivals, families from different communities eating together or allowing their children to play with one another. Every day engagement between ethnic groups at the village level can help to sustain the peace in the face of [...] national level shocks like an ethnic riot {{in another part of the}} country. In times of ethnic tension, these communities can quell rumors, police neighborhoods and come together to resist any attempts by politicians to polarize the community. The stronger the inter-ethnic networks are, the <b>harder</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for politicians to polarize the community even if it may be in their political interest to do so.|$|E
