The measurements were done on the pure Scotch pine stands of Koçimek locality (Gölbaşı village, Uzundere town, Erzurum province, Turkey). Diameter, <b>double</b> bark <b>thickness,</b> tree-rings and height was measured a total of 60 trees. 30 of them are infested with mistletoe and the others are without mistletoe. To investigate how does mistletoe affects annual tree diameter increment, height growth and <b>double</b> bark <b>thickness,</b> the SPSS package program was used. We tested all data for normal distribution at first. After that, we used paired samples t-test.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} work was {{detection}} of regularities of bark formation on {{various parts of}} stems of Siberian larch Larix sibirica Ledeb. trees. In work, materials of ten trial areas established in larch stands of green moss group of forest types are used. 703 sample trees were cut down and measured. The trial areas were established at Priangarsky and Central Siberian subtaiga-forest-steppe forest vegetation regions. Sample trees were cut down into sections, equal to one tenth of the stem length. As {{a result of the}} carried-out works, the average sizes of <b>double</b> <b>thickness</b> of bark at stems of various diameter are established. The mathematical model, describing regularities of bark formation at various relative heights of stems of the Siberian larch trees with various diameters is constructed. This mathematical model is the basis for the auxiliary table containing data characterizing a bark share in diameter of a stem with bark. The relative sizes of bark on various sites of stems are established. For this purpose the <b>double</b> <b>thickness</b> of bark at height of the corresponding one-tenth height of a stem wood is taken for basic parameter. The bark sizes at other relative heights are expressed percentage of basic size. The relative sizes of bark changes from 206. 8 % at the stem basis to 20. 8 % for sections of the corresponding 0. 9 shares of the stem height. The supplied generalizing information on the forest vegetation areas stated above is provided in work. The equation of pair dependence of relative <b>double</b> <b>thickness</b> of bark on the relative height of section of a stem is calculated.

30|$|It {{should also}} be borne in mind that most often a metal {{electrode}} {{is applied to the}} back surface of the CdTe absorber layer with the result that radiation with low absorption coefficient is reflected from such an interface.

(13).

40|$|ABSTRACT: ASTM D 1002 is a {{standard}} test method {{used to evaluate the}} shear strength of adhesives. This method is popular due to the simplicity of the test, ease to replicate, and the consistency of the testing results. However, this test is also the most criticized one, as the results can be too misleading to be used as design criteria. Due to the material elastic mismatch and the eccentricity of the test setup, a mixed mode loading is introduced to the adhesive joint. This paper presents a detailed study on the behavior of the adhesive joint under the shear loading, tested by the ASTM D 1002 method. The conventional fracture mechanics theory is utilized. A crack embedded in the adhesive joint specimens, including both the single <b>thickness</b> and the <b>double</b> <b>thickness,</b> are used for the analysis. The specimen is loaded on a tensile test machine until failure, and the load and displacement are recorded for each specimen. The result from the experiment is used as the data for the stress and fracture mechanics analysis. From the experimental results, it is seen that the specimen also experiences out-of-plane tensile stress. There is an indication that the final failure might be due to cleavage loading, for the <b>double</b> <b>thickness.</b> The eccentricity of the loading path cannot be eliminated completely. The results of the experiment and the effect of the mixed mode loading are studied in detail. This paper provides {{a better understanding of the}} behavior of adhesives under a mixed-mode fracture. This knowledge is beneficial to understand and design reliable adhesive bond joints...|$|R

50|$|The technique, if {{used with}} a camera not {{specially}} designed for contact printing, {{runs the risk of}} jamming the camera, due to the <b>double</b> <b>thickness</b> of film in the gate, and damaging both the exposed and unexposed stock. On the other hand, because both strips of film are in contact and are handled by the same film transport mechanism at the same time, registration is kept very precise. Special cameras designed for the process were manufactured by Acme and Oxberry, amongst others, and these usually featured an extremely precise registration mechanism specially designed for the process. These process cameras are usually recognisable by their special film magazines, which look like two standard film magazines on top of each other. The magazines allow the separate loading of exposed and unexposed stock, as opposed to winding the two films onto the same reel.|$|R
