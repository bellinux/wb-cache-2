40|$|This paper compares three {{independent}} {{methods for}} deriving the residual stresses distribution in AS 60 normal cooled <b>flash-butt</b> <b>welded</b> rail. A numerical technique utilised a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical analysis with representative temperature dependent and phase transformation {{properties of the}} rail steel. The numerical model also incorporated an element removal regime to assess the effect of stress relaxation when slicing a plate section from a welded rail section for neutron stress mapping. Two experimental techniques were used to quantify the magnitude of residual stresses in the weld; these were strain gauging and trepanning, and neutron diffraction (ND). The results showed satisfactory correlation between the residual stress distribution obtained from the numerical analysis and the strain gauge/trepanning data and ND stress mapping, respectively. The ND and numerical analysis both confirmed that the tensile residual stresses in both vertical and longitudinal directions are concentrated in the web region, despite a significant relaxation {{as a result of}} the sectioning method used to obtain the plate section for neutron stress mapping. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Thermal history {{along the}} length of a {{circular}} section subjected to <b>flash-butt</b> <b>welding</b> was analyzed by the finite difference method. A one–dimensional nonlinear thermal numerical simulation using a computational model based on the finite difference approach is formulated taking into consideration fusion zone (FZ) temperature as a measure of heat input, ambient and initial temperature of rod. Flexibility of physical characteristics such as bar length, diameter and temperature dependency of thermal properties and variation of boundary conditions were applied. Peak temperatures of 490 oC and 410 oC were computed for a 20 mm external diameter solid and hollow pipes respectively at distance 5 mm from weld line. Preheat temperatures of 200 oC and 400 oC resulted into a 41. 1 % and 89. 3 % increase respectively in peak temperature as compared with non preheat conditions. The predicted values from this model compared reasonably with experimentally obtained thermal histories...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostics of {{residual}} welding stresses {{based on the}} layout of temperature traces that (i) characterize isothermals of maximal temperatures within a thermal cycle of welding and (ii) are retained on the metal surface of a welded joint represents a prospective trend of non-destructive methods of control {{of residual}} stresses. The traces to be examined include both natural (temper colours and fusion boundaries) and artificial traces formed on the metal surface {{in the course of}} fusion of pre-applied temperature indication lines (lines of temperature indication markers, etc.). The layout of temperature traces assures the uniqueness of the solution to an inverse problem of a thermal cycle of welding reconstructed by the researcher. The kinetic pattern of alterations of the stress-deformation state (SDS) of a welded joint in the course of welding, as well as the pattern of residual stresses (the latter solely require the information concerning the cooling stage of a thermal cycle) can be identified {{on the basis of the}} reconstructed thermal cycle model. In the paper, the procedure of reconstruction of a thermal cycle on the basis of temperature traces is exemplified by resistance <b>flash-butt</b> <b>welds</b> of metal rods. Despite the one-dimensionality of the model, it presents a widespread type of welding of rails and accessories of building structures; this type of welding is used to connect edges of steel pipes, including those that have a big diameter and are used as underwater gas pipelines.

40|$|Abstract. Neutron {{scattering}} using diffraction techniques is now recognised as {{the most}} precise and reliable method of mapping sub-surface residual stresses in materials and industrial devices. It was therefore decided to build the dedicated strain scanner KOWARI among the first suite of instruments for the new Australian Replacement Research Reactor OPAL. In order to support the new instrument and familiarize the Australian user community with the technique a „Neutrons for Engineering “ project has been established to provide a fully integrated residual stress service. To {{make use of the}} neutrons at Australias HIFAR reactor the existing three-axis spectrometer has been refurbished and modified to allow strain measurements. The Australian Strain Scanner (TASS) will operate until the new strain scanner becomes operational in 2006. Apart from giving an overview about the technique and properties of the new strain scanner we would like to present and discuss two case studies: a) residual-stresses obtained from a break-disc of a car and b) residual-stresses within a <b>flash-butt</b> <b>welded</b> plate cut out of a railway. Principle The technique of deriving strains by neutron diffraction is based on Bragg's law hklhkld Θ⋅⋅ = sin 2 λ (1) to determine the lattice spacing of planes dhkl labeled by Miller indices (hkl) from the diffraction angle Θhkl with a known wavelength λ. At a steady state source the obtained peak, superimposed on a (uniform) background, can be well described by a Gaussian distribution and the peak position can be obtained by fitting such a Gaussian to the data obtaining a certain peak width at half maximum (FWHM). The elastic strain εhkl may be calculated using the logarithmic derivative of eqn. (1) according to 1 sin sin tanta...|$|R

40|$|Generally about 80 {{percent of}} railway tracks are welded by <b>flash-butt</b> <b>welding</b> that {{consists}} of electrical heating and hydraulic forging. The service performance of such welds is affected by their ability to support the service loads without fatigue damage or fracture. Horizontal split-web fractures, which may involve splitting of rail head, are of main concern because of potential risk of a catastrophic derailment. In this paper, failure analysis of three broken flash welded rails is presented. The investigation included chemical analysis, hardness measurement, SEM fractography, and microstructural characterization. The crack path consisted of two regions where after initial propagation parallel to the rail surface it tended to propagate on a slant surface. Fractographic analysis showed that high cycle fatigue was the main failure mechanism. Crack initiation sites were located at welded zones and were associated with large inclusions that were not properly removed during chiseling of upset material. Fatigue crack propagation was confined to planes parallel to the rail surface. Crack branching occurred after considerable unstable fast fracture. Finally it is clarified that trapped inclusions, residual stresses, track irregularities and dipping from localized wear in soft regions of weld, associated with variations in pearlitic microstructure, contribute to horizontal split-web fractures...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} improve {{residual}} stress measurement techniques in large components with complex geometries using neutron diffraction. In this work, residual stresses in rail weld samples were measured at locations in welds where {{traditional methods of}} measurement {{are not able to}} access. This {{is the first time that}} full scale rail welds were used for neutron diffraction measurements. The procedure used in these measurements can be used to measure residual stresses more accurately and with higher resolutions in structures with complex and large geometries. Residual stresses in four rail samples were measured at locations where welds are more prone to crack and fracture. Two of the rail welds were made using aluminothermic welding technique, and they had different preheating conditions. Other two samples were made through <b>flash-butt</b> <b>welding</b> technique, and different welding machines were employed to make them. Using the measured residual stresses, the correlation between railway welding techniques, some of the welds' metallurgical characteristics and the measured residual stresses were determined. This work can be used as a stepping stone toward weld optimization procedure in railway industry by minimizing the magnitude of residual stresses, and it adds to understanding of measuring residual stresses in full scale samples, lattice parameter measurements in reference samples and determining the correlation between welding parameters and residual stresses in rail welds. The result obtained through these measurements can be used as a sound base for fatigue analysis and life span prediction of rail welds...|$|E
40|$|Within railway {{engineering}} practice continuous rails {{is created by}} welding lengths of rail. Conventional rail welding processes include aluminothermic/thermite welding and <b>flash-butt</b> <b>welding.</b> Both welding processes result in a large width of the weld and heat affected zone (HAZ). The weld and HAZ show irregularities along the rail surface including hardness variations, microstructural disturbances and/or inclusions. This makes welds in particular susceptible to damage. Laser welding of rails is proposed to create welds with a smaller weld and HAZ width. This thesis investigates the feasibility of laser welding for rails. The evolution of microstructures in R 260 Mn rail steel has been studied using x-ray fluorescence, dilatometry, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and hardness measurements. From the data obtained from these experiments and thermal models that have been constructed, an appropriate set of welding conditions was determined and used for laser welding. The welding conditions considered are laser power, welding speed and pre-heating temperature. The main focus was put on welding speed and pre-heating. Preliminary welds consisted of a mainly martensitic and thus unacceptable microstructure. By selecting the welding conditions accordingly, the cooling rate could be decreased to form a pearlitic microstructure instead. Especially pre-heating {{was found to be}} a valuable method to reduce cooling rate and achieve an acceptable weld in terms of microstructure. The welded samples did contain welding defects like solidication cracking and porosity. The amount of welding defects is observed to decrease for higher welding speeds. It can be concluded that laser welding can be used to achieve an acceptable weld in terms of microstructure, especially when a pre-heating is applied to the rails. Further optimisation of the welding conditions may resolve welding defects...|$|E
