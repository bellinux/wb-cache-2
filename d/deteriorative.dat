Pasteurization is important in destroying naturally occurring enzymes that are associated with deterioration of the juice. Pectinesterase is infamous for its <b>deteriorative</b> activity in orange juice. In the pasteurization process, juice is generally rapidly heated to 197 °F for about 40 seconds. Several industry leaders use flash pasteurization, which is carried out by tubular or plate-type heat exchangers. In order to prevent over heating, turbulent flow is vital to heat the juice rapidly. Cans are filled with the pasteurized juice and inverted immediately to allow the juice to sterilize the inside parts of the lid. The orange juice filled can is sealed and cooled to 90 to 100 °F by spinning on the conveyor belt under cool water sprays. Quality of storage is determined by time and temperature. Juice must be stored at cool temperatures to prevent deterioration.|$|E

If these stresses exceed the tensile strength of the slab, it may be considered that cracking occurs in the slab. This paper deals with an experimental study for deterioration or crack of concrete slabs by temperature stresses. The results are as follows : 1) The detrioration of concrete slabs by temperature stresses was confirmed by measuring dynamic modulus of elasticity, calculating <b>deteriorative</b> ratios and observing cracks {{on the surface of}} the slabs. 2) The concrete with water cement ratio of 75 %t was more <b>deteriorative</b> than that of 45 % or 60 % under temperature stresses. 3) The larger the differences of temperature, the more <b>deteriorative</b> the concrete, and deterioration of concrete progressed by repetition effect of temperature stresses. 4) Concrete and mortar with the same water cement ratio showed a similar tendency with respect to deterioration by temperature stresses...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to design and develop a novel decontamination process for concrete, which could harness the <b>deteriorative</b> effect of various microorganisms found within the natural environment by a process known as biodecontamination. Whilst the majority of existing research into concrete deterioration has focused on the effect of sulphur or nitrogen bacteria, this study has investigated the effect of the lesser documented heterotrophic bacteria and fungi on concrete deterioration, and their possible use within a biodecontamination system. A number of heterotrophic bacteria and fungi were isolated and characterised from samples of deteriorating concrete removed from four similar cellars. The <b>deteriorative</b> ability of ten of these bacterial and fungal isolates was established using weight loss analysis. A further evaluation of the <b>deteriorative</b> activity of two of the heterotrophic bacterial and fungal isolates, was investigated by means of Dionex ion exchange chromatography and atomic absorption spectrophotometry, which traced the liberation of key cations as indicators of the deterioration of the calcite binary material which cemented the concrete particulate material together. The results obtained from this study indicated that the calcite binary material was deteriorated after {{a short period of time}} as a consequence of ion exchange reactions at the surface of the material between magnesium and calcium cations. Environmental scanning electron microscopy was used to visualise microorganisms at the concrete surface. This technique provided evidence of deterioration, as indicated by the expansion of pores at the material surface. The microorganisms isolated were used to develop two mixed consortia (consortium 1 and consortium 2) in different media. The <b>deteriorative</b> activity of these organisms was compared with an axenic culture of Aspergillus carbonarius, since this fungus produces citric acid, a known <b>deteriorative</b> agent of concrete. Following the selection of these microorganisms, various conditions within the liquid culture medium were altered in an attempt to enhance the levels of deterioration obtained. As a consequence of results obtained from these investigations, it was recommended that the growth medium was supplemented with 5...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{experimental}} {{evaluation of the}} surface microstructural integrity of Si 3 N 4 ceramics milled with abrasive waterjet was studied. The {{results show that the}} surface residual stress resulting from abrasive waterjet milling process for ceramics is compressive, and the compressive residual stress ranges from negative 203 MPa to negative 19. 6 MPa. The results also show that the water pressure, the standoff distance, nozzle traverse speed and the lateral spacing have strong effects on the surface residual stress. The results also show that there is some enhancement in the hardness of AWJ milling surface, and it is affected by milling process parameters. The micro-topography of the milled surface cross section shows that there is a thin <b>deteriorative</b> layer in milled layer, in which no obvious crack is observed.

After 21 days of fermentation the <b>deteriorative</b> bacteria concentration reached 9. 7 Log 10 CFU. g- 1 corresponding to 6 % NaCl and 4 % glucose.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the changes in}} total phenolics, extractable condensed tannins (ECT), protein noncovalent bound condensed tannins (PNBCT) and irreversible covalent bound condensed tannins (ICBCT) in the hypocotyls and pericarps of Aegiceras corniculatum fruits during dry storage. The loss of moisture content and survival rate, as indicators of the viability and quality of plant tissues, were also monitored during the dry storage. Great amount of free condensed tannins combined with proteins in the senescent pericarps {{during the process of}} <b>deteriorative</b> reactions associated with dry storage, which contributed to the rapid increase of PNBCT characterized by the sigmoid model. However, there was a rapid loss of total phenolics and ECT from pericarps during the first 9 days of the dry storage, with 37. 3 % loss of ECT due to the transformation of PNBCT. PNBCT of the hypocotyls also fitted a sigmoid model with dry storage time, and was related to the viability of the hypocotyls. During the dry storage, most of the disappeared ECT of hypocotyls formed complexes with protein, and the total condensed tannins (TCT) did not decline during the 27 days dry storage. The distribution of the oligomers and polymers in the condensed tannins was significantly different between the fresh and dried hypocotyls of A. corniculatum. The oligermers with lower degree of polymerization (DP) appeared to have higher capacity of binding to proteins than the polymers with high DP in plant tissues during the dry storage. The changes of hydroxy pattern of tetramers in the fresh and dried hypocotyls showed that the proteins would be selective binding those flavan- 3 -ol oligomers with more hydroxyl in plant tissues with <b>deteriorative</b> reactions during dry storage. However, the hydroxy pattern of nomamers was not significantly different between the fresh and dried hypocotyls.
