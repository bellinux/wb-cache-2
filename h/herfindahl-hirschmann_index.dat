40|$|Using {{a maximum}} entropy technique, the authors {{estimate}} the market shares of each firm {{in an industry}} using the available government summary statistics such as the four-firm concentration ratio and the <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>Index.</b> They show that their technique is very effective in estimating the distribution of market shares in twenty industries. The authors' results provide support for the recent practice of using the <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>Index</b> rather than four-firm concentration ratio as the key explanatory variable in many market power studies, if only one measure is to be used.

40|$|Abstract: The paper investigates bundle pricing under {{imperfect}} competition. In a multiproduct context, the substitution/complementarity {{relationships among}} products can affect pricing in complex ways. This {{is used to}} motivate multi-product generalizations of the <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>index,</b> which capture cross-market effects of imperfect competition on bundle pricing. Applied to the US corn seed market, the analysis investigates the pricing of conventional seeds and patented biotech seeds. For bundled biotech seeds, it finds strong evidence of sub-additive bundle pricing, thus rejecting standard component pricing. The econometric results document how increases in traditional and cross-market measures of imperfect competition contribute to higher seed prices...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{partially}} cooperating firms are examined in N-firm oligopolies. The <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>Index</b> {{is assumed to}} detect the violation of the antitrust regulation by the firms, and based on this assumption a piece-wise differentiable dynamic system can be developed. The firms stop cooperating if this index becomes larger than a certain threshold and they restart or continue cooperating otherwise. The equilibria of the dynamic system are first determined. Local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibria are then investigated showing {{the complexity of the}} dynamic behavior of the system.

40|$|Measures of the {{academic}} quality of individual researchers tend to ignore the context. Here we introduce contextualised measures of individual quality: cardinal and ordinal pseudo-Shapley values. The cardinal values do not add much new information if departments are roughly the same size, but the ordinal values do. Ordinal Shapley-values {{can be interpreted as}} measures of the market power of an individual, her power over the rank of her current employer, and her ability to affect rankings of all departments in a country. We use normalised <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>indices</b> to assess the concentration of contributions to a department’s standing. This provides further information on the power of individuals over their departments, but also reveals the robustness of departmental rankings to job mobility. rankings, individuals, departments...|$|R

Market analysis covers road, rail and air transport. Knowing the concentration of these markets is useful when it realizes development strategy of these sectors with profound implications on the national economy. There is a decreasing degree of concentration in the road transport sector due to growing number of enterprises in this market. Air transport has similar trend the road transport, the concentration declining during the span of years analyzed. Regarding the <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>index</b> in the railway sector, we find that it reveals for the year 2012 a very high degree of concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to use a simultaneous equations method for estimating police production and demand to determine whether or not there are economies of scale in policing. In addition, the effect of market power on productivity, using the <b>Herfindahl–Hirschmann</b> <b>Index,</b> is to be measured. The estimation yields the result that there are diseconomies of scale with respect to the amount of crime beyond about 22 000 people in the policing jurisdiction and diseconomies of scale in numbers of police beyond about 36 000 people. Efficiency is also reduced where there is greater market power. This is conjectured to be the public sector equivalent of taking market power profits. Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates bundle pricing under {{imperfect}} competition. In a multiproduct context, {{we first}} examine how substitution/complementarity relationships among products can affect pricing. This {{is used to}} motivate multi-product generalizations of the <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>index</b> (GHHI) capturing cross-market effects of imperfect competition on bundle pricing. The GHHI model is applied to pricing of conventional and patented biotech seeds in the US from 2000 - 2007. One major finding is that standard component pricing in biotech traits is soundly rejected in favor of sub-additive bundle pricing. This result {{is consistent with the}} presence of scope economies in the production of genetic traits. The econometric estimates show how changes in market structures (as measured by both own- and cross-Herfindal indexes) affect U. S. corn seed prices...|$|E
40|$|We {{calculate}} the electricity prices {{that would result}} from a pure "poolco" market with identical profit-maximizing generating firms. We advance theoretical concepts developed by Klemperer and Meyer (1989) and Green and Newbery (1992), and propose a new formula for the instantaneous market clearing price when generating firms adopt bidding strategies given by the Nash Equilibrium. Applying this formula to empirical electricity supply and demand data, we find that even in markets with a relatively high number of firms, the price of electricity is {{significantly higher than the}} short-run marginal cost of generation. We express the average annual price mark-up with a Price-Cost Margin Index, and show how it varies with market concentration, as measured by the <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>Index</b> (HHI). We conclude that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's use of the HHI in its merger guidelines could prove inadequate in addressing market power concerns in deregulated poolco markets. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Auctions {{serve as}} a primary pricing {{mechanism}} in various market segments of a deregulated power industry. In day-ahead (DA) energy markets, strategies such as uniform price, discriminatory, and second-price uniform auctions result in different price settlements and thus offer different levels of market power. In this paper, we present a nonzero sum stochastic game theoretic model and a reinforcement learning (RL) -based solution framework that allow assessment of market power in DA markets. Since there are no available methods to obtain exact analytical solutions of stochastic games, an RL-based approach is utilized, which offers a computationally viable tool to obtain approximate solutions. These solutions provide effective bidding strategies for the DA market participants. The market powers associated with the bidding strategies are calculated using well-known indexes like <b>Herfindahl–Hirschmann</b> <b>index</b> and Lerner index and two new indices, quantity modulated price index (QMPI) and revenue-based market power index (RMPI), which are developed in this paper. The proposed RL-based methodology is tested on a sample network.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{high-tech}} and telecommunication, non-ferrous sector has {{a crucial role in}} industries development. Cooper, nickel, aluminum, zinc, lead and tin are used, directly or indirectly, in most of the technologies, especially in high-tech production. The paper present a short index of the global investments for the non-ferrous transnational corporations listed on London Metal Exchange. The non-ferrous investment index presented in the paper refers to the most profitable corporation exports on world, European Union (EU 28) and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) level. The export concentration, estimated through <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>index</b> on world, EU 28, CEE and Romanian level, show that the non-ferrous industry is in full process of releasing. The cases presented in the article show that the non-ferrous companies invest intensively in equipment and technologies with superior production capacities, which combat pollution given by non-ferrous processes, research and development for the non-ferrous innovative technologies, and creating new markets. Sustainable and intelligent development is the inflexion point of the non-ferrous transnational corporation investments. The research is predominant in exploration of the transnational corporations’ internet pages and reports, and statistical calculus from international trade websites...|$|E
40|$|Differences in the {{regulatory}} framework create specific path dependencies in per mobile market. Correspondingly, {{there is a need}} to assess how the mobile markets differ till now as well as the direction of the market evolution in the future. Therefore the systematic assessment of the mobile markets will present the insight of the market dynamics along with rising opportunity to make comparison between multiple mobile markets. As a part of research methodology, we first perform theoretical review regarding the previous research on the analysis of mobile market structures. We observe that most of the research focuses on either the analysis of a single market parameter for multiple mobile markets or comparison of two markets for a set of parameters in a qualitative or quantitative way. In contrast with above we take a systematic approach by taking a set of parameters for multiple mobile markets. We complete our analysis by investigating the market characteristics from spectrum policy and market structure point of view. Based on the evaluation, we assess the state-of- art outlook of the selected mobile markets: Finland, Chile, Turkey, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, China, India, United States, Japan and Sweden. Based on our results, we assess that <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>Index</b> is the explaining factor for the spectrum policy. In this regards, India possesses the most decentralized where China has the most centralized mobile spectrum. Market structure analysis put forward both mobile prices and investments per subscribers as the explaining factor for the market structure. Based on that, India is the most open mobile market where Japan has the most closed mobile market structure. European markets; Finland, Sweden and U. K. have more open market structure than the North American mobile market...|$|E
40|$|In {{common with}} other major {{economic}} centres in China, Shanghai's energy consumption {{has been increasing}} rapidly to support the high growth rate of its economy. To achieve rational, efficient and clean use of energy, together with improved environmental quality within the city, the Shanghai municipal government has decided to expand the supply and utilization of natural gas. Shanghai plans to increase the share of natural gas in its primary energy mix to 7 per cent by 2010, up from 3 per cent in 2005. This increase in natural gas demand has to be matched with a corresponding increase in supply. To date, the Shanghai region has relied on offshore extracted natural gas but this supply is limited due {{to the size of}} the reserves. Since 2005, the West-East pipeline has provided an alternative for Shanghai but demands from other regions could reduce the potential for expanding supplies from that source. Since domestic production will not be sufficient to meet demand in the near future, Shanghai is building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal at the Yangshan deep-water port that would allow an additional supply of more than 3 billion cubic meters per year of natural gas. Malaysia has already committed to supply LNG to the Shanghai terminal at a price that is significantly higher than the wholesale "city-gate" price for natural gas transported via pipeline, but still lower than the gas price to end-use consumers. The presence of both an LNG terminal and a transmission pipeline that connects Shanghai to domestic gas-producing regions will create gas-on-gas competition. This study assesses the benefits of introducing such competition to one of China's most advanced cities under various scenarios for demand growth. In this paper, the impact of imported LNG on market concentration in Shanghai's gas market will be analysed using the <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>index</b> (HHI) and the residual supply index (RSI). Our results show that Shanghai remains a supply-constrained gas market that will continue to rely upon gas supplies from the western provinces and imported LNG. After 2017, the gas market in Shanghai can be regarded as unconcentrated since its HHI fall below 1800 under a very high growth scenario. In terms of RSI, the gas market can be considered competitive at low, moderate and high growth consumption between 2012 and 2015. Gas LNG Shanghai...|$|E

It looks at the market structure in conjunction with decisive factors, considering the role of auditors and regulatory standards for statutory auditing. The analysis commences with the elucidation of auditing financial statements with regulatory standards, including collation between standards, to comprehend the current internationalization of accounting and influence on audit quality and audit market structure. The UK audit market has been examined thoroughly {{in terms of the}} so called ?Big Four?? (PwC, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG) audit market concentration, competition, auditor rotation, audit fee, and audit quality. Audit market concentration has been measured through the concentration ratio and the <b>Herfindahl-Hirschmann</b> <b>Index,</b> considering audit companies? revenue to clarify market shares between Big Four companies and mid-tier firms. In so doing, the two biggest accountancy firms, PwC and Deloitte, were also investigated to ascertain their influence on the market by assessing their last five years? financial analysis to evaluate the future audit market concentration amid accountancy firms in the UK. Methods of analysis include comprehensive ratio analysis to measure liquidity, asset management, debt management and profitability. Pertinent elaborated calculations {{can be found in the}} appendices. Results of data analysed demonstrate that the UK audit market is most concentrated with considerable barriers to entry and switching, since the Big Four have constant and high market share of FTSE companies. As is evident from the Deloitte and PwC?s ratio analysis results, they have consistent and robust positive indicators; so bridging the gap between midtier and Big Four companies would not be straightforward for the near future. Despite pessimistic results, some recommendations may alleviate this concentration: ? The confusions of financial reporting and auditing standards resulting from the paucity of adaptation should be lessened. ? Mandatory joint audit may be useful to reduce market concentration by signing off audit report and opinion by the each audit firm; on the condition that one joint auditor should be non-Big four companies. viii ? Mandatory rotation should not be prolonged for more than fifteen years. At the same time, tendering should be in a transparent and veritable-based approach to achieve salutary results. ? Companies should report transparently choice and investors should display persuasive motive in auditor choice. ? Prudence and transparency should be controlled by the regulators for steering audit market, to attain stability of financial systems. ? In terms of changing perception bias towards to mid-tier or small audit firms, reputation should be improved through enhancing occupational skills, such as sector expertise, international network and excellence of staff...|$|E
