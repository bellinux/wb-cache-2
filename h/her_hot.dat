500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal <b>her</b> <b>hot</b> temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E
500|$|During 1843 and 1844, Seacole {{suffered}} {{a series of}} personal disasters. She and her family lost much of the boarding house in a fire in Kingston on 29 August 1843. Blundell Hall burned down, {{and was replaced by}} New Blundell Hall, which was described as [...] "better than before". Then her husband died in October 1844, followed by her mother. After a period of grief, in which Seacole says she did not stir for days, she composed herself, [...] "turned a bold front to fortune", and assumed the management of her mother's hotel. She put her rapid recovery down to <b>her</b> <b>hot</b> Creole blood, blunting the [...] "sharp edge of [...] grief" [...] sooner than Europeans who she thought [...] "nurse their woe secretly in their hearts". She absorbed herself in work, declining many offers of marriage. She later became widely known and respected, particularly among the European military visitors to Jamaica who often stayed at Blundell Hall. She treated patients in the cholera epidemic of 1850, which killed some 32,000Jamaicans. Seacole attributed the outbreak to infection brought on a steamer from New Orleans, Louisiana, demonstrating knowledge of contagion theory. This first-hand experience would benefit her during the next five years.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the rest}} of the office get into a heated debate over whether actress Hilary Swank can be {{considered}} [...] "hot". Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) leads the group voting she is not hot, claiming she looks like a [...] "monster". Jim temporarily convinces Kevin to switch sides by having him imagine Hilary kissing him, only for Kevin to switch back, saying the debate is whether she is hot, not whether he would have sex with her. Angela (Angela Kinsey) resists the debate, but eventually votes [...] "hot" [...] after getting offended by Kevin's crude remarks. Kelly (Mindy Kaling), who believes herself less attractive than Swank, gets emotional when Toby (Paul Lieberstein) defends his [...] "not hot" [...] vote. Pam (Jenna Fischer) argues they should not let the Kevins of the world decide who is hot, or decide anything at all. Oscar (Oscar Nuñez) gives a detailed overhead presentation about the structure of Swank's facial features, concluding she is [...] "attractive...not hot." [...] An uncharacteristically uplifting Stanley (Leslie David Baker) votes hot, claiming pointing out flaws is no way to live life. At the end of the debate, the sides are still tied until Michael, oblivious of their debate, passes by the pictures on the wall and casually calls <b>her</b> <b>hot.</b>|$|E
2500|$|About 15 {{minutes after}} the torpedo struck Aragon, her Master, Captain Bateman, gave the order from her bridge [...] "Every man for himself". Those {{remaining}} aboard rushed to get over her side, and her bow rose {{out of the sea}} as soldiers swarmed down her side into the water. One of the VADs who survived later recorded [...] "We felt that all our friends were drowning before our eyes". About 17 to 20 minutes after being hit Aragon went down, and she suffered a second explosion as the cold seawater reached <b>her</b> <b>hot</b> boilers. Some of her boats were left upturned in the water.|$|E

She found mainstream success in the U.S. later that year, with <b>her</b> <b>Hot</b> Dance Club Play number-one, Billboard Hot 100 top three single, [...] "Milkshake"; this helped to propel her third album, Tasty, to gold status in the U.S., where it peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200 and has sold 533,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. [...] "Milkshake" [...] also went gold, selling over 500,000 copies, and earned Kelis a Grammy Award nomination in 2004 for Best Urban/Alternative Performance. Although the Neptunes contributed several tracks to Tastythe album was released by their label Star Trak Entertainment, {{a joint venture with}} Arista RecordsKelis began collaborating with other producers, such as Dallas Austin, André 3000, Rockwilder, and Raphael Saadiq.

2500|$|Bernhardt did {{not remain}} long with the Comédie-Française. She played Henrietta in Molière's Les Femmes Savantes and Hippolyte in L'Étourdi, {{and the title}} role in Scribe's Valérie, but did not impress the critics, or {{the other members of}} the company, who had resented her rapid rise. The weeks passed, but she was given no further roles. <b>Her</b> <b>hot</b> temper also got her into trouble; when a theater doorkeeper {{addressed}} her as [...] "Little Bernhardt", she broke her umbrella over his head. She apologized profusely, and when the doorkeeper retired 20 years later, she bought a cottage for him in Normandy. At a ceremony honoring the birthday of Molière on 15 January 1863, Bernhardt invited her younger sister, Regina, to accompany her. Regina accidentally stood on the train of the gown of a leading actress of the company, Zaire-Nathalie Martel (1816–1885), known as Madame Nathalie. Madame Nathalie pushed Regina off the gown, causing her to strike a stone column and gash her forehead. Regina and Madame Nathalie began shouting at one another, and Bernhardt stepped forward and slapped Madame Nathalie on the cheek. The older actress fell onto another actor. Thierry asked that Bernhardt apologize to Madame Nathalie. Bernhardt refused to do so until Madame Nathalie apologized to Regina. Bernhardt had already been scheduled for a new role with the theater, and had begun rehearsals. Madame Nathalie demanded that Bernhardt be dropped from the role unless she apologized. Since neither would yield, and Madame Nathalie was a senior member of the company, Thierry was forced to ask Bernhardt to leave.|$|E
2500|$|The wooden Osborn was downbound for the Soo Locks with a {{cargo of}} 1,120 tons of iron ore and towing two {{schooner}} barges, the George W. Davis and the Thomas Gawn. [...] The Alberta was upbound with her usual amount of passengers and freight on her regular run between Owen Sound, Ontario and Port Arthur, Ontario. [...] The Osborn carefully whistled her approach {{through the fog}} but one ship whistled once for a starboard course and the other ship whistled twice for a port course. [...] Shipwreck historian Frederick Stonehouse wrote: As reported in the local papers, ‘the barge blew three whistles, the Alberta answering, and checked down to seven miles per hour, but in a moment the Osborn appeared under the Alberta’s bow and the latter struck her midway between the main and mizzen masts on the starboard side, cutting her almost in twain.’ [...] When the larger , 2,282 ton, steel steamer Alberta rammed the smaller , 891 ton, wooden Osborn, she penetrated [...] {{to the center of}} the ship cutting her almost in two. The large gash in the Osborn’s hull caused the water to hit <b>her</b> <b>hot</b> boilers which exploded and immediately killed two crewmen. [...] Alberta stayed locked with Osborn long enough for Captain Wilford and his wife to transfer to her. One of the Alberta’s passengers jumped to the Osborn to save three lives, including Captain Wilford’s children. While this rescuer from Alberta was still below decks, the Osborn broke free and sank, taking his life along with those of two crewmen.|$|E
