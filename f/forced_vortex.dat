40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{interaction between}} a barotropic point vortex and a steplike topography with a bay-shaped shelf. The interaction {{is governed by}} two mechanisms: propagation of topographic Rossby waves and advection by the <b>forcing</b> <b>vortex.</b> Topographic waves are supported by the potential vorticity (PV) jump across the topography and propagate along the step only in one direction, having higher PV on the right. Near one side boundary of the bay, {{which is in the}} wave propagation direction and has a narrow shelf, waves are blocked by the boundary, inducing strong out-of-bay transport in the form of detached crests. The wave–boundary interaction as well as out-of-bay transport is strengthened as the minimum shelf width is decreased. The two control mechanisms are related differently in anticyclone- and cyclone-induced interactions. In anticyclone-induced interactions, the PV front deformations are moved in opposite directions by the point vortex and topographic waves; a topographic cyclone forms out of the balance between the two opposing mechanisms and is advected by the <b>forcing</b> <b>vortex</b> into the deep ocean. In cyclone-induced interactions, the PV front deformations are moved in the same direction by the two mechanisms; a topographic cyclone forms out of the wave–boundary interaction but is confined to the coast. Therefore, anticyclonic vortices are more capable of driving water off the topography. The anticyclone-induced transport is enhanced for smaller vortex–step distance or smaller topography when the vortex advection is relatively strong compared to the wave propagation mechanism.

40|$|The flow {{behavior}} in hydrocyclone is quite complex. This complexity of fluid flow in a cyclone is basically {{due to the}} fact flow in cyclone is a swirling turbulent multiphase flow. A multiphase CFD model with individual sub models for the air-core, turbulence, and particle classification was used to simulate the various hydrocyclones. The predicted velocity field from the LES, DRSM turbulence models is compared with LDA measurements of Hsieh (1988) data for 75 mm cyclone. The LES with the modified Mixture model, particles with a feed size distribution is seems to promising in predicting classification curve accurately. Further the CFD model validation is attempted to compare with Renner (1976) data which was originally measured using high-speed sampling probe at different precisely controlled positions. A CFD multi-phase case was set-up with the same 6 inch cyclone design (Renner 1976) and operating conditions. The overall classification curve predicts close to the experimental data. From the validation of CFD with the Renner (1976) data it was observed that the predicted position sample size distributions are reasonably comparable with experimental data nearby wall positions and at bottom cone section, but considerably differ at nearby <b>forced</b> <b>vortex</b> region, and also nearby tip of vortex finder wall locations. Close to the <b>forced</b> <b>vortex</b> (inner position), the discrepancy between measured and predicted size distributions are large.

40|$|In this article, {{we review}} {{some of the}} {{theoretical}} solutions used to describe swirl dominated flows in both unidirectional and bidirectional flow orientations. This short survey starts with the Rankine vortex and culminates in the presentation of an essentially viscous solution of the bidirectional vortex. After classifying representative swirl motions as external or internal depending on physical boundary conditions, their commonalities are identified along with their relevance to either geophysical or industrial applications. For example, all swirl dominated flows comprise a <b>forced</b> <b>vortex</b> core centered about their axis of rotation. The core is due to viscous forces and increases in size with successive increases in viscosity. It is delineated by {{the point where the}} swirl velocity reaches its maximum. Within the <b>forced</b> <b>vortex</b> core, the tangential velocity is linearly proportional to the radius, a characteristic of rigid body rotation. Outside the <b>forced</b> <b>vortex</b> core, the tangential velocity gradually becomes inversely proportional to the radius, thus exhibiting a free vortex tail. In internal flows, this free, irrotational tail is clipped at the boundaries in fulfillment of the no slip requirement. In external flows, it extends out to infinity. Finally, all swirl dominated flows decay axially and their vorticity is confined to either the core vortex or wall boundary layers. These will be described {{in the context of the}} bidirectional vortex confined in a cylindrical chamber. What is most prevalent here, and perhaps, what sets the analysis of the bidirectional vortex apart lies in its formal prediction of essential flow attributes directl...|$|E

50|$|Thermowells are {{typically}} installed in piping systems {{and subject to}} both hydrostatic and aerodynamic <b>forces.</b> <b>Vortex</b> shedding is the dominant concern for thermowells in cross-flow applications and is capable of forcing the thermowell into resonance {{with the possibility of}} fatigue failure not only of the thermowell but also of the temperature sensor. The conditions for flow-induced resonance generally govern the design of the thermowell apart from its pressure rating and materials of construction. Flow-induced motion of the thermowell occurs both in-line with and transverse to the direction of flow with the fluid forces acting to bend the thermowell.

In liquids and in high-pressure compressible fluids, a smaller but nonetheless significant component of motion in the flow-direction is also present and occurs at nearly twice the vortex shedding rate.

If, as for a flat plate, the leading edge is also sharp, then {{vortices}} also shed {{at the leading edge}} and the role of leading edge vortices is two-fold：(1) they are lift increasing when they are still close to the leading edge, so that they elevate the Wagner lift curve,(2) they are detrimental to lift when they are convected to the trailing edge, inducing a new trailing edge vortex spiral moving in the lift decreasing direction. For this type of flow a <b>vortex</b> <b>force</b> line (VFL) map [...] can be used to understand the effect of the different vortices in a variety of situations (including more situations than starting flow) and may be used to improve vortex control to enhance or reduce the lift. The <b>vortex</b> <b>force</b> line map is a two dimensional map on which <b>vortex</b> <b>force</b> lines are displayed.

When, however, there is vortex outside the body, there is a vortex induced drag, in a form similar to the induced lift.|$|R

Observational data are used in chapter 2 to construct climatologies of the Arctic polar vortex structure during vortex-splitting and vortex-displacement SSWs occurring between 1958 and 2002. During vortex-splitting SSWs, polar vortex breakdown is shown to be typically independent of height (barotropic), whereas breakdown during vortex-displacement SSWs is shown to be strongly height dependent (baroclinic). In {{the remainder of the}} thesis (chapters 3 - 7), a hierarchy of models approach {{is used to}} investigate a possible resonant excitation mechanism which is responsible for the vortex breakdown seen in our observational study. A single layer topographically <b>forced</b> <b>vortex</b> model is shown to exhibit vortex-splitting behaviour similar to that observed during SSWs. Two analytical reductions, the first a fully nonlinear analytical model of an elliptical vortex in strain and rotation velocity fields, the second a weakly nonlinear asymptotic theory applied to a topographically <b>forced</b> <b>vortex,</b> show that vortex-splitting in the model occurs due to a self-tuning resonance of the vortex with the underlying topography. Resonant excitation of an idealized polar vortex by topographic forcing is then investigated in a three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic model, with emphasis on the vertical structure of the vortex during breakdown. It is shown that vortex breakdown similar to that observed during displacement SSWs occurs due to a linear resonance of a baroclinic mode of the vortex, whereas breakdown similar to that observed during splitting SSWs occurs due to a resonance of the barotropic mode. The role of self-tuning in these resonant behaviours is then discussed in relation to the analytic reductions of the single layer model. ...|$|E
