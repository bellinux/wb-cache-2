To her knowledge, {{at the time she}} was taken, only a dozen Beothuk survived.

25|$|ISRO {{has applied}} its {{technology}} for telemedicine, directly connecting patients {{in rural areas}} to medical professionals in urban locations via satellites. Since high-quality healthcare is not universally available {{in some of the}} remote areas of India, the patients in remote areas are diagnosed and analyzed by doctors in urban centers in real time via video conferencing. The patient is then advised medicine and treatment. The patient is then treated by the staff at one of the 'super-specialty hospitals' under instructions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> Mobile telemedicine vans are also deployed to visit locations in far-flung areas and provide diagnosis and support to patients.|$|E

When she arrives at her aunt's house, though, she finds that her learned relative has left early for a lecture tour in America, Christmas notwithstanding.

25|$|Hospitals in {{this era}} {{were the first to}} require medical diplomas to license doctors. The {{licensing}} test was administered by the region's government appointed chief medical officer. The test had two steps; the first was to write a treatise, on the subject the candidate wished to obtain a certificate, of original research or commentary of existing texts, which they were encouraged to scrutinize for errors. The second step was to answer questions {{in an interview with the}} chief medical officer. Physicians worked fixed hours and medical staff salaries were fixed by law. For regulating the quality of care and arbitrating cases, it is related that if a patient dies, their family presents the doctor's prescriptions to the chief physician who would judge if the death was natural or if it was by negligence, in which case the family would be entitled to compensation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> The hospitals had male and female quarters while some hospitals only saw men and other hospitals, staffed by women physicians, only saw women. While women physicians practiced medicine, many largely focused on obstetrics.|$|E
25|$|The Second Doctor's {{time came}} to an end when the TARDIS landed {{in the middle of a}} warzone, created by a race of alien warlords who, with the help of another renegade Time Lord the War Chief, {{progressively}} kidnapped and brainwashed humans into becoming soldiers for them, hoping to use the ones who survived to conquer the Galaxy. Although the Doctor was able to defeat their plan, he realised he would be unable to return the human subjects to their various original points in Earth's history. He therefore contacted the Time Lords, sacrificing his own freedom in the process, and despite an attempt to escape was forced to return to his home planet. He was then put on trial by the Time Lords, for breaking their laws of non-interference. Despite the Doctor's argument that the Time Lords should use their great powers to help others, he was sentenced to exile on 20th century Earth, the Time Lords forcing his regeneration into the Third Doctor in the process. Jamie and Zoe were returned to their own time, with their memories of all but their first encounter with the Doctor wiped and the secret of the TARDIS was also taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} among the first pitched for the series, as creator Russell T Davies saw a {{potential}} to continue the story <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who episodes [...] "Army of Ghosts" [...] and [...] "Doomsday". Episode writer originally intended the episode to appear sometime midway through the series, but was ultimately brought forward to the fourth slot. It was filmed in the third production block. Because of the limited number of filming locations and cast members, it {{was among the}} cheapest episodes in the first series. It was seen by almost 1.4 million viewers after its original broadcast and received generally mixed reactions from critics, though the producers regard the episode as one of their favourites in the series.|$|E

50|$|Thanks to time travel, since Mel is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> future, she {{has already}} met him, but <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> {{perspective}} he is meeting {{her for the first}} time. Most spin-off media, including the novelisation by the Bakers, have assumed that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> at <b>the</b> end of the trial, takes Mel back to her proper place in time and eventually travels to her relative past to meet Mel for <b>the</b> first time <b>from</b> her perspective. That meeting, never seen on screen, is related in <b>the</b> Past <b>Doctor</b> Adventures novel Business Unusual by Gary Russell and also in the alternature universe audio story He Jests at Scars, which provides a semi-sequel to this TV story.|$|R

500|$|... "Time Crash" [...] {{was filmed}} at Upper Boat Studios in Upper Boat, Cardiff, {{as part of}} the fourth {{recording}} block of the fourth series (which included [...] "Partners in Crime") on 7 October 2007. Graeme Harper, director of Davison's final serial The Caves of Androzani, directed the episode. To replicate the Fifth Doctor's attire, the production team borrowed items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who exhibition in Blackpool and knitted a new cricket jumper to reflect the style worn from Castrovalva to Warriors of the Deep. [...] The accompanying Doctor Who Confidential episode reveals that the trousers Davison wore in [...] "Time Crash" [...] were the same pair that Colin Baker wore in his early scenes in The Twin Dilemma.|$|E
500|$|The fight scene between Lisa and Myfanwy was {{difficult}} to shoot, as the actress had to interact with a visual effect creature {{that would not be}} added until post-production. The producers added a plastic green beak stuck {{on the end of a}} stick to be used as a guide. The scene where the team go up on the invisible lift was made by making the platform stationary, but the camera below it would descend, giving the illusion the platform is ascending. The visual effect of the tools used to create Cybermen were reused <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who episode [...] "The Age of Steel", while the UFO footage when the Torchwood team return from the drinks was a tin foil-covered frisbee on a fishing line.|$|E
500|$|... "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] is {{the seventh}} episode of series six {{and also the}} 777th episode of Doctor Who, {{but there are no}} seven puns as the {{production}} team did not realise this until after shooting. The episode's idea stemmed from lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat wondering if the Doctor, who was typically a pacifist, could be provoked enough to assemble an army. The Headless Monks were first mentioned in [...] "The Time of Angels", added to that episode's script to help explain the monastic look of the Delirium Archive the Doctor and Amy were visiting. Similar troops also known as [...] "Clerics" [...] appeared in [...] "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone"; Moffat stated it seemed many armies in the future in Doctor Who were of religious origin. The possibility of the English word [...] "doctor" [...] originating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> was a notion made by Moffat on Usenet in 1995.|$|E

500|$|... "Blink" [...] {{was written}} by Steven Moffat. Part of the story for [...] "Blink" [...] is based on Moffat's Ninth Doctor short story <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who Annual 2006 called [...] "'What I Did on My Christmas Holidays' by Sally Sparrow". The short story is {{presented}} as a homework essay from Sally, though only 12 years old, who encounters evidence of the Doctor's presence from the past in her aunt's house while visiting. [...] "What I Did" [...] includes several elements that are reused in [...] "Blink", including messages under the wallpaper and an ontological paradox involving a conversation between Sally and the Doctor, prerecorded on a video cassette, based on a written transcript—the essay itself; however, instead of the Angels, [...] "What I Did" [...] features the Doctor and the TARDIS inadvertently separated twenty years in time by a fault in the time machine, and the Doctor is able to instruct Sally how to bring it back to him in the past.|$|E
