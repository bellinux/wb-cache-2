In his first competitive match, Zohar scored a goal as Israel beat their English counterparts by a score of 6-5 in Netanya, Israel. He was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the squad for the qualification round of the European beach football championship in Athens, Greece, but pulled out due to injury. Locally, Zohar represents the city of Rosh HaAyin in Israel's inaugural beach football league.|$|E
25|$|On June 4, 2013, the {{director}} {{declared that the}} color grading would commence on June 10, 2013, which he later followed up with a tweet on June 25, stating the process is now completed, without distorting original colors, and that 5.1 surround sound transfer {{is going to take}} place on June 28, 2013. Moreover, he also revealed an audio commentary and extra features are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of its upcoming Blu-ray release. On July 17, 2013, Friedkin announced that the film's soundtrack has been remastered. Two days before the Venice screening, Friedkin announced that a theatrical screening has been booked at Los Angeles' Cinefamily for spring 2014. On September 12, 2013, Friedkin revealed April 14, 2014 as the release date of the film's Blu-ray home video version.|$|E
25|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} most notable {{for the amount}} of {{injuries}} the Jackets incurred. The Jackets lead the league in man games lost with 502. At one point, the injured reserve list consisted of 15 players, including stars Sergei Bobrovsky, Brandon Dubinsky, Jack Johnson, and Ryan Murray. When the team's injured players began to return in late February, they were able to accumulate wins the way they had the previous two seasons and in the process, set a franchise record earning nine consecutive wins. However, the Blue Jackets still finished fifth in the Metropolitan Division and missed the playoffs by nine points despite a 42-35-5 record. On May 20, 2015, Nick Foligno was named the sixth captain in team history. The position had been vacant since Rick Nash was traded to the New York Rangers in July 2012. On June 30, 2015, the Jackets traded centers Marko Dano and Artem Anisimov, along with wingers Jeremy Morin and Corey Tropp, to the Chicago Blackhawks for Brandon Saad. This move was the subject of much controversy in Chicago since Blackhawks General Manager Stan Bowman had publicly said that Saad was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the organization for many years to come. The Jackets also acquired Michael Paliotta and Alex Broadhurst in the trade. The Jackets signed center Gregory Campbell from the Boston Bruins a few days later.|$|E

500|$|Journalists have {{expressed}} confusion {{about whether the}} game should {{be described as a}} teaser, video game, or demo. Despite ongoing debate, the game won awards for best trailer while also winning game of the month and best horror game of the year awards. While naming P.T. as an honorable mention for best trailer, Marty Sliva from IGN felt that P.T. was more of an [...] "interactive experimental film/puzzle game". [...] "Demo" [...] {{has been one of the}} more common descriptions, though GameSpot was reluctant to categorize it as such. Despite it being commonly called a demo of Silent Hills, there is no evidence that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of Silent Hills aside from the reveal of the trailer and title after the end of the game. Hideo Kojima himself explained that it was not a demo of Silent Hills and described it as a [...] "teaser" [...] in a tweet.|$|E
500|$|With Fox not reprising her role, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley {{was chosen}} to play Sam's new love interest. Ramón Rodríguez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, kind of business man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. So, for me, it was a blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. I had an out of body experience working on that one because I just couldn't believe I was there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E

Ames says that he is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the current events and calls off the whole deal. He insists that he will not leave his wife and start a new company if it requires him to kill someone. As Ames and Jamie continue arguing, Terry quietly goes to the campaign car and shifts it into [...] "drive." [...] The car rolls into the lake and slowly submerges as Rosie screams.|$|E

2500|$|In a February 2008 {{interview}} with Movieweb.com, actor Ray Stevenson stated that a Rome film was in development, with Heller {{working on a}} script. Heller confirmed in December that there was [...] "talk of doing a movie version", adding that [...] "It's moving along. It's not there until it is there. I would love to round that show off". In an April 2009 {{interview with}} the Associated Press, Actor Kevin McKidd stated the [...] "Rome" [...] film was [...] "in development", and Lucius Vorenus will likely {{be a part of}} it. In March 2010, Entertainment Weekly stated that Heller had completed the script for Morning Light Productions, the film's financiers, and was now awaiting a director and a studio, since HBO Films [...] "won't be involved". However, in a more recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Heller indicated the project had stalled – [...] "I'm not holding my breath". [...] On April 15, 2014 ScreenRant received reports from Entertainment Weekly in which it was confirmed that a movie based on HBO Rome is indeed on the way. Quote [...] "As reported in 2009 Bruno Heller, who wrote and executive produced the series, is writing the movie script as well; the film will be produced by Morning Light Productions. The only question that remains is which epoch of Rome will the movie focus on and which cast members will be featured on the big screen?" [...] Kevin McKidd (Lucius Vorenus) himself spoke in September 2013 about it. [...] "There is a script that is being shopped and it's supposedly very good, I haven't seen it, but I am definitely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the movie...
