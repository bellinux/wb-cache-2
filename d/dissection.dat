5|$|Vertebral artery <b>dissection</b> {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of <b>dissection</b> of the arteries in the neck. The other type, carotid artery <b>dissection,</b> {{involves}} the carotid arteries. Vertebral artery <b>dissection</b> is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E

5|$|Vertebral artery <b>dissection</b> {{has also}} been {{reported}} in association with some forms of neck manipulation. There is significant controversy {{about the level of}} risk of stroke from neck manipulation.

At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, or no association.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackground and Purpose: The {{pathogenesis}} {{of spontaneous}} cervical artery <b>dissections</b> (sCAD) and its best medical treatment are debated. This {{may be due}} to a lack of clear classification of sCAD. We propose the new Borgess classification of sCAD, based on the presence or absence of intimal tear as depicted on imaging studies and effect on blood flow. Materials and Methods: This is a single-center investigator-initiated registry on consecutive patients treated for sCAD. In the Borgess classification, type I <b>dissections</b> have intact intima and type II <b>dissections</b> have an intimal tear. Results: Forty-four patients and 52 dissected arteries were found. Forty-nine of 52 <b>dissections</b> (93 %) were treated with dual anti-platelet therapy. Twenty-one of 52 <b>dissections</b> were type I; 31 were type II. Type I <b>dissections</b> were more likely to present with ischemic symptoms (stroke, TIA) (p= 0. 001). More type I <b>dissections</b> occurred in the vertebral artery, while more type II <b>dissections</b> occurred in the internal carotid artery (...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis investigates {{attitudes of}} {{students}} and teachers of secondary schools (gymnasia) towards the use of <b>dissections</b> into educational process. Questionnaire survey {{is a part of}} the research, by which opinions about animal <b>dissections</b> are examined in terms of a particular interest in <b>dissections,</b> of general interest in natural sciences, disgust towards the peculiar facts and situations taking place during <b>dissections</b> and finally in terms of ethical standpoint of all respondents. Statistic processing of results examined relations between all presented aspects and between gender, age, school grade and targeting of studies, experience with <b>dissections</b> and interest of all teachers themselves. At the beginning of the inquiry the following research questions were stated: 1. Are attitudes of students towards <b>dissections</b> during the lessons of biology different between genders? 2. Are those attitudes affected by factors such as subject preference, targeted field of study, own experience with <b>dissections,</b> favoured method of teaching anatomy or owning a pet? 3. Do mutual correlations between the attitude of a student and a particular teacher exist? 4. Are standpoints of teachers towards <b>dissections</b> during the lessons of biology influenced by various factors such as implementation into educational [...] ...|$|R
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 20 million animals are used annually for educational purposes in the United States including, classroom observational exercises, <b>dissections</b> and live-animal surgeries. Frogs, fetal pigs, perch, cats, earthworms, grasshoppers, crayfish and starfish are commonly used in classroom <b>dissections.</b> Alternatives {{to the use of}} animals in classroom <b>dissections</b> are widely used, with many U.S. States and school districts mandating students be offered the choice to not dissect. Citing the wide availability of alternatives and the decimation of local frog species, India banned <b>dissections</b> in 2014.|$|R
5|$|Vertebral artery <b>dissection</b> is {{less common}} than carotid artery <b>dissection</b> (<b>dissection</b> {{of the large}} arteries {{in the front of}} the neck). The two {{conditions}} together account for 10–25% of non-hemorrhagic strokes in young and middle-aged people. Over 75% recover completely or with minimal impact on functioning, with the remainder having more severe disability and a very small proportion (about 2%) dying from complications. It was first described in the 1970s by the Canadian neurologist C. Miller Fisher.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} episode, 2% may {{experience}} a further episode {{within the first}} month. After this, there is a 1% annual risk of recurrence. Those {{with high blood pressure}} and dissections in multiple arteries may have a higher risk of recurrence. Further episodes of cervical artery <b>dissection</b> are more common in those who are younger, {{have a family history of}} cervical artery <b>dissection,</b> or have a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or fibromuscular dysplasia.|$|E

40|$|The literatur gives a {{view about}} synonomous {{expressions}} to <b>dissections,</b> the occur-rence, localisation, etiology and pathogenesis {{as well as}} about pathologic-anatomic-studies and radiograph descriptions of different structures. The own study is based upon 41 fetlock- and 54 hockjoints. A histologic control is made from all shadows seen in the Fein-Fokus-Radiograph picture. All <b>dissections</b> are analysed to their proportionalety of soft, spongious and sclerotic parts-shadows. The description of these different structures {{is not a problem}} for Fein-Fokus-System, if the <b>dissections</b> are enlarged six times. The composition and the difference in size of the <b>dissections</b> are shown, some smaler groups are inspected. A connection of the horse race, the sex of the horse, the joint and the localisation in the joint is not found. <b>Dissections</b> in fetlock joints were found at trotters, warm-blooded horses, thoroughbred horses and other races whereas in tarsocural joints they are found only in totters and warmblooded horses. 14 % of the fetlock <b>dissections</b> and 25 % of the tarsocrural joint <b>dissections</b> show sklerotic areas in the Fein-Fokus-Radiograph examination. There is a tendency, that sklerotic <b>dissections</b> of older horses have a higher grade of sklerotic but there is no connection with race and sex of horses with either joint and localisation in the joint. The trend of a higher sklerotic grade in older horses is described with exceptions for fetlockjoint as well as for tarsocrural joints, but there are not enough sklerotic dissec-tions (only 20) to do a statistical analysis. So only a trend is shown. The sklerotic dis-sections are bigger in size than the <b>dissections</b> with spongios character. There was no relation to race, sex, joint or localisation in the joint. The <b>dissections</b> with spongious character don´t show connections in all above given parameters. Neither in size nor in composition of the <b>dissections</b> there was a trend for references. <b>Dissections</b> that were free in the joint, ýFree bodysý, only were found in 6 of 95 joints, all 6 <b>dissections</b> are from fetlock joints. Even here there were nor references to above mentioned parameters. Refeing to the total size it is remarkable that these ýfree bodysý are smaler than the total size of all <b>dissections</b> from fetlock joints.

50|$|Only {{certified}} anatomists {{were allowed}} to perform <b>dissections,</b> and sometimes then only yearly. These <b>dissections</b> were sponsored by the city councilors and often charged an admission fee, rather like a circus act for scholars. Many European cities, such as Amsterdam, London, Copenhagen, Padua, and Paris, all had Royal anatomists (or some such office) tied to local government. Indeed, Nicolaes Tulp was Mayor of Amsterdam for three terms.

5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery <b>dissection.</b> It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid <b>dissection</b> are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis of {{spontaneous}} cervical arterial <b>dissection</b> involves neurological and arterial results. The overall functional prognosis {{of individuals with}} stroke due to cervical artery <b>dissection</b> {{does not appear to}} vary from that of young people with stroke due to other causes. The rate of survival with good outcome (a modified Rankin score of 0–2) is generally about 75%, or possibly slightly better (85.7%) if antiplatelet drugs are used. In studies of anticoagulants and aspirin, the combined mortality with either treatment is 1.8–2.1%.|$|E

40|$|Renal artery <b>dissections</b> are {{stenotic}} or occlusive lesions {{most often}} observed in hypertensive patients with underlying atherosclerosis or fibromuscular disease. Acute <b>dissections</b> may present spontaneously, as a complication of diagnostic or therapeutic angiography {{or as an}} agonal event associated with overwhelming systemic illness. Chronic <b>dissections</b> may produce renovascular hypertension or be entirely asymptomatic. Fourteen renal artery <b>dissections</b> have been encountered in nine patients treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center during the past decade. Eleven <b>dissections</b> {{have been found in}} seven patients with renovascular hypertension. Seven of these <b>dissections</b> were chronic (six functional, one silent) and four acute (two spontaneous, two secondary to angiography). Three agonal <b>dissections</b> were found in two additional patients postmortem: one at autopsy and bilateral <b>dissections</b> found at the time of cadaveric donor nephrectomy. Ten bypass procedures, including five complex branch reconstructions of which three were performed ex vivo, have been performed with 100 % immediate patency and maintenance or improvement of renal function. Long-term follow-up of these patients has shown sustained patency of the reconstructed renal arteries, excellent blood pressure control, and normal renal function in all. Nephrectomy has not been required and there have been no associated deaths. Seventy-seven additional renal artery <b>dissections</b> in 72 patients collected from previous reports have been analyzed. Patient survival (55 / 72, 76. 4 %) and preservation of the involved kidney in surviving patients (26 / 55, 47. 3 %) were low in these earlier series. In addition, renal failure was associated with 59 % of the deaths. The lethality of renal artery <b>dissections</b> and the ease and success of revascularization, which preserves renal function and ameliorates associated renovascular hypertension, emphasize the need for an aggressive approach to the recognition and treatment of this entity. Therapy should be directed toward arterial reconstructions and the preservation of functioning renal tissue...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although most {{cervical}} <b>dissections</b> {{are managed}} medically, emergent endovascular treatment may become {{necessary in the}} presence of intracranial large-vessel occlusions, flow-limiting and long-segment <b>dissections</b> with impending occlusion, and/or hypoperfusion-related ischemia at risk of infarction.

5|$|Vertebral artery <b>dissection</b> (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the {{vertebral}} artery, which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a blood clot, thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery <b>dissection</b> include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E

5|$|<b>Dissection</b> {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery <b>dissection,</b> even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E

40|$|Angiographically visible <b>dissections</b> {{occur in}} 30 % of cases after balloon {{coronary}} angioplasty 1 - 3 and in 5 to 10 % of patients when the procedure involves stent implantation 4. These <b>dissections</b> may be extensive and complicated, with contrast retention rapidly evol-ving to occlusion of the treated vessel, {{or they can}} be limited, without contrast retention and flow compromise 5 - 8. Cutlip et al 9 demonstrated that <b>dissections,</b> even the uncomplicated ones, {{are one of the}} main predictors of subacute thrombosis following stent implantation. These residual <b>dissections</b> are generally treated with a second stent, but the total length of the implanted stent is also associated with a greater risk of adverse events 9 and is consistently reported as one of the factors most strongly associated with res-tenosis 10 - 12. The studies 13 - 15 that analyzed the influence of uncomplicated residual <b>dissections</b> after coronary angioplasty in long-term follow-up do not suggest that a greater risk of restenosis exists in these patients. On the other hand, late follow-up of patients with un-complicated coronary <b>dissections</b> after stent implantation is rarely studied 16, 17.
