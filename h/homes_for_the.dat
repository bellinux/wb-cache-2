5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> craftsmen and tradespeople who {{flocked to the}} already overcrowded city.

Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E

5|$|As it is {{separated}} from the mainland by 3miles (4.8km) of water, few large mammals inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. Rabbits, fox, raccoons, otters, mink, gray and red squirrels, and chipmunks are all common as is the occasional beaver and coyote. Bats are the most abundant migratory mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats. Eagles and hawks are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as yellow warblers, American redstart, and indigo bunting are more common in early summer. Near the shoreline, gulls, herons, geese, and loons are common. Owls, including snowy owls and great grey owls, come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the warmer climate. Other birds, such as chickadees, cardinals, blue jays, and woodpeckers, live on the island year-round. Toads have also been found.|$|E

His expatriate neighbours and friends included Joan Sutherland, David Niven, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards in Switzerland and Ian Fleming and his wife Ann in Jamaica.

5|$|Leftover waters {{from the}} storm led to an {{increase}} in mosquitoes in Texas, which prompted a widespread application of larvicide via airplane. On July1, the flood areas of southern Texas were declared a major disaster area. This followed a delivery of 2flood specialists, 20laborers, 2portable water treatment plants, 7trucks, and a quantity of insecticides and water treatment tablets. Residents in Laredo, Texas provided citizens of its neighboring city Nuevo Laredo, Mexico with food and water. The Mexican government provided temporary <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> affected citizens of the flood. American officials distributed typhoid vaccinations, water purification tablets, and insecticides to the American cities along the Rio Grande. Safe water was eventually restored to Laredo, Texas on July12. All emergency work related to the disaster was finished by September3.|$|E

5|$|This victory did not {{delay the}} workhouse's fate; {{the site was}} duly sold to the Catholic Church for £110,000, and {{demolition}} began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E
