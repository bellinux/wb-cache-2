As substantive due process arises from the liberty clause, a <b>deprivation</b> of a substantive due process right is a <b>deprivation</b> of liberty and thus requires procedural due process.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a measure of}} the joint distribution of multiple <b>deprivations</b> in the United States, in other words {{a measure of the}} extent to which different <b>deprivations</b> are experienced by the same individual. Using Current Population Survey and American Community Survey data, we find that the experience of multiple <b>deprivations</b> affects 15 percent of Americans. We also find that income poverty is not a reliable proxy to measure multiple deprivations: 5. 5 % of the population, an estimated 17. 1 million Americans, experience multiple <b>deprivations</b> while they are not income poor. The odds of experiencing multiple <b>deprivations</b> are two to three times higher for Hispanics, immigrants and persons with disabilities. Further measurement efforts are needed on overlapping multiple <b>deprivations</b> in the US as such measures can be used in policy evaluation and monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The nomads are {{referred}} to as ethnic or socio-professional groups of people that travel and migrate from one geographical location to another, in search of means of livelihood. In Nigeria, the nomads are predominately the pastoralists, the migrant farmers, and the fishermen. Nomads are characterized by the absence of fixed domicile; hence they are always on the move. They do not have permanent place of settlement, therefore, their children suffer a lot of <b>deprivations.</b> This research investigated on the impact of psycho-social <b>deprivations</b> on emotional health and education of the nomadic children in Nigeria. A descriptive survey was adopted, while focus group discussion built into interview was used for data collection. Two research questions and two hypotheses guided the study. The population of the study was the entire nomads in Nigeria. A random sampling technique was used to select 400 nomads. The result was analysed, using mean scores, standard deviations, and z-test. The findings indicated that nomadic children experience emotional, intellectual <b>deprivations,</b> and <b>deprivations</b> of health care services, and social amenities among others. There is {{no significant difference in the}} mean scores and standard deviations of male and female respondents on whether nomadic children suffer psycho-social <b>deprivations.</b> There is no significant difference in the mean scores and standard deviations of male and female respondents on whet her psycho-social <b>deprivations</b> have impact on the emotional health and education of the nomadic children. Summarily, the findings were that nomadic children experience a high rate of psycho-social <b>deprivations</b> in Nigeria...|$|R
5|$|Sleep <b>deprivation</b> and {{cumulative}} fatigue effects {{describe how}} individuals {{who fail to}} have an adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep <b>deprivation.</b> A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E
5|$|When {{suffering}} from sleep <b>deprivation,</b> active immunizations {{may have a}} diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which {{have been shown to}} be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep <b>deprivation,</b> shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.|$|E

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{presents}} the normative, empirical, and policy motivations for focusing on multidimensional poverty measurement and analysis in general, and one measurement approach in particular. The fundamental normative motivation {{is to create}} effective measures that better reflect poor people’s experience, so that policies using such measures reduce poverty. Such measures are needed because, empirically, income-poor households are (surprisingly) not well-matched to households carrying other basic <b>deprivations</b> like malnutrition; also the trends of income and non-income <b>deprivations</b> are not matched, and nor does growth ensure the reduction of social <b>deprivations.</b> And, a dashboard overlooks the interconnection between <b>deprivations,</b> which people experience and policies seek to address. Turning to policy, we close by discussing how the Alkire-Foster methodology we present in Working Paper 86 (“Multidimensional Poverty Measurement and Analysis: Chapter 5 - The Alkire-Foster Counting Methology”) may be used...|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and <b>deprivation</b> (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of <b>deprivation</b> and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E

5|$|The term {{maternal}} <b>deprivation</b> is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal <b>deprivation</b> hypothesis.|$|E
