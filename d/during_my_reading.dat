The director says it is the artist's special place in Indian art that had drawn him to his life. [...] "A few years ago, I had done a play on Ravi Varma for KPAC. <b>During</b> <b>my</b> <b>reading</b> and research on him, I was fascinated {{to know more about the}} man and the circumstances in which those works were created. Here was a prince who had paid a price for pursuing his passion for the arts. He faced hostility and criticism but that did not put an end to his affair with brush and paint. Cases were filed against him but he fought against the orthodoxy and won the right to express himself. I felt there was space for a movie," [...] he explains. Instead of a biopic on the artist, the director wanted to focus on the artist at work, and chose a single work to unfold the life of the artist and the period he worked and lived in. [...] "Although his style was European, his themes were from Indian mythology. In each of his works on the Indian Puranas, he chose a point in the story that was filled with drama and emotion. I was stuck by the sensitivity and acumen of the man who used his brush to depict those moments. That is why I felt I could understand him better if I concentrated on a work and then narrate the story of the artist's creative process," [...] says the director.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to develop a better understanding of creativity in assessment, in order to facilitate achievement of the programme aim of developing creative teachers. This illuminative evaluation, within an interpretivist, social constructivist paradigm, was undertaken as practitioner research on an undergraduate primary education programme. <b>During</b> <b>my</b> <b>reading</b> and initial research I developed the Creativity Pyramid, which combined a wide range of phrases drawn from definitions of creativity, set in four hierarchical layers. I analysed existing assignment documents and school placement booklets for phrases related to creativity, using my Creativity Pyramid. In order to discover perceptions about creativity in campus-based assignments and school placement, I interviewed tutors (n= 9) and students (n= 7), held a virtual focus group and used semi-structured questionnaires with two year groups (Year 2, n= 32; Year 1, n= 55). I used an inductive approach to coding this data before identifying themes. The research showed there were opportunities for creativity in assessment on the programme, except in exams. Assessment for learning, which was more prevalent in school placement, was found to promote creativity. The campus-based assignments which were perceived as more creative were often those which required engaging an audience, such as presentations and creating resources. These assignments also had stronger constructive alignment of creativity aspects between the assignment brief and marking grid. Using the findings I developed the Creativity Cascade, which indicates facilitators and inhibitors of creativity in the cascade from tutor and teacher-mentor to student-teacher to pupil. The main recommendations were to establish a shared definition of creativity, to use this to ensure constructive alignment in all aspects of assessment, to review the core subject assignments and to increase the use of assessment for learning.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of an artistic–scientific project on eye-movements <b>during</b> <b>reading,</b> <b>my</b> collaborators from the psychology department at the KU Leuven and I had {{a close look at}} the poem “Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard” (“A throw of the dice will never abolish chance”) by Stéphane Mallarmé. The poem is an intriguing example of nonlinear writing, of a typographic game with white and space, and of an interweaving of different reading lines. These specific features evoke multiple reading methods. The animation, Movement in Un coup de dés, created during the still-ongoing collaboration interweaves a horizontal and a vertical reading method, two spontaneous ways of reading that point at the poem's intriguing ambiguity. Not only are we interested in different methods of reading; the scientific representations of eye movements themselves are a rich source of images with much artistic potential.
