5000|$|The {{corrugated}} medium is often [...] basis {{weight in the}} U.S.; in the UK, a [...] <b>fluting</b> <b>paper</b> is common. At the single-facer, it is heated, moistened, and formed into a fluted pattern on geared wheels. This is joined to a flat linerboard with a starch based adhesive to form single face board. At the double-backer, a second flat linerboard is adhered {{to the other side}} of the fluted medium to form single wall corrugated board. Linerboards are test liners (recycled paper) or kraft paperboard (of various grades). The liner may be bleached white, mottled white, colored, or preprinted.|$|E

The objective of this study was determination of the effective criteria for decision making to select the most suitable location for establishing a <b>fluting</b> <b>paper</b> mills from agricultural residues. For this purpose, effective criteria were divided into five major groups: Material and Product, Facilities and limitations of regional (infrastructure), Technical and Human, Economical, Rules & Regulations as well as 33 sub-criteria, after preliminary investigation, preparatory observation, and an interview with some of the paper producers and relevant experts. A hierarchy was designed based on five major groups of criteria and then the priority rates of obtained criteria and sub-criteria were determined by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) after compiling expert's opinions via questionnaire. Results have shown that among 33 determined effective criteria in location selection of <b>fluting</b> <b>paper</b> mills from agricultural residues, the sub-criteria of Supply residual amount, Ensure the supply of residual, Cost purchasing of raw material, Cost of transporting raw material have the highest priorities, respectivel...|$|E
40|$|Non-linear {{programming}} optimization {{method was}} used to optimize total steam and air consumption in the dryer section of multi-cylinder <b>fluting</b> <b>paper</b> machine. Equality constraints of the optimization model were obtained from specified process blocks considering mass and energy balance relationships in drying and heat recovery sections. Inequality constraints correspond to process parameters such as production capacity, operating conditions, and other limitations. Using the simulation, the process parameters can be optimized to improve the energy efficiency and heat recovery performance. For a corrugating machine, optimized parameters show the total steam use can be reduced by about 11 % due to improvement of the heat recovery performance and optimization of the operating conditions such as inlet web dryness, evaporation rate, and exhaust air humidity, accordingly total steam consumption can be decreased from about 1. 71 to 1. 53 tonnes steam per tonne paper production. The humidity of the exhaust air should be kept as high as possible to optimize the energy performance and avoid condensation in the pocket dryers and hood exhaust air. So the simulation shows the supply air should be increased by about 10 % to achieve optimal humidity level which was determined about 0. 152 kgH 2 O/(kg dry air) ...|$|E

40|$|Twin-screw {{extrusion}} pulping is a {{new approach}} to the manufacture of pulp for paper production, designed for non-wood feedstocks. In this research, the production of pulp from rice stem with a newly fabricated twin-screw extruder was investigated. Extrusion pulping of rice stem was conducted following a central composite design using a two-level factorial plan involving three process variables (pretreatment NaOH concentration: 0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2 %; extrusion temperature: 40, 60, 80 oC; and extruder rotational speed: 55, 70, 85 rpm). Responses of pulp and handsheets properties to the process variables were analyzed using statistical software (MINITAB 15). As the results show, pulping of rice stem fiber can be done at a relatively short pretreatment time about 4 hours and a low NaOH concentration about 0. 8 % by twin-screw extruder with limit extrusion temperature of about 80 oC and extruder rotational speed about 85 rpm. The effect of pretreatment solvent, NaOH, is greatly enhanced by increases in the extrusion temperature. Analysis of the results revealed that this process has suitable potential to be used to obtain a pulp with yields approximately equivalent to neutral sulfite semi-chemical pulping at fixed kappa number, which is applicable for <b>fluting</b> <b>paper</b> and linerboard production...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{the quality}} of {{recycled}} OCC pulp collected from different local companies was investigated {{compared with those of}} the local NSSC pulp from Mazandaran Wood and Paper Industries(MWPI). Also, the effect of different mixture from OCC pulp was evaluated with NSSC pulp. In addition, the effect of refining was studied on strength properties of OCC pulp and also combination of OCC and NSSC pulp. The results showed that, the NSSC pulp has the better fiber classification properties and higher strength properties compared to the recycled OCC pulp. Also, quality of OCC recycled pulps prepared from different companies was different because of the variety of raw material and production process. Refining of OCC pulp led to increase the mechanical properties of paper. The results of the handsheets and <b>fluting</b> <b>papers</b> prepared with various charges of OCC recycled pulp show {{that the majority of the}} mechanical properties were decreased and only tear strength were increased but difference between strength values were not shown significant. Totally, the results showed that by installation of an independent OCC mill in Mazandaran Wood and Paper Industries (MWPI) or completing present stock preparation with cleaning and suitable refining system, there is possibility to increase OCC consumption for fluting production with desirable quality...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} methods for the {{measurement}} compressive strength of linerboard and <b>fluting</b> medium <b>paper.</b> The results of different method can vary up to 30 % and more for same material sample {{and the biggest}} challenge is to determine compressive strength uninfected by other properties. It still isn’t specified which method is technically more correct. The Short-Span Compressive Test (SCT) method {{is assumed to be}} more accurate. However, the Ring Crush Test (RCT) method is still widely use despite that it is established it is affected by buckling load of test specimen. In this study these two different methods were performed to measure the compressive strength of corrugated board’s components. The results were implemented in Maltenfort equation for prediction of board compressive strength. The accuracy of methods was evaluated by comparing predicted compressive strength with measured board edgewise compressive strength (ECT). The result confirmed that SCT method is more successful for predicting compressive strength of corrugated board and therefor, more accurate...|$|R
50|$|Corrugated board {{adhesives}} are {{the next}} largest application of non-food starches globally. Starch glues are mostly based on unmodified native starches, plus some additive such as borax and caustic soda. Part of the starch is gelatinized {{to carry the}} slurry of uncooked starches and prevent sedimentation. This opaque glue is called a SteinHall adhesive. The glue is applied on tips of the <b>fluting.</b> The fluted <b>paper</b> is pressed to paper called liner. This is then dried under high heat, which causes {{the rest of the}} uncooked starch in glue to swell/gelatinize. This gelatinizing makes the glue a fast and strong adhesive for corrugated board production.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed for}} the drying of paper in a multi-cylinder drying section. The model {{is based on the}} unsteady state, one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which is applied to both the cylinder shell and the paper web. No internal mass transfer phenomena were modeled explicitly. Great emphasis ws placed on finding the proper heat and mass transfer coefficients that are integral parts of the boundary conditions. Based on the {{mathematical model}}, a simulation program was developed. In order to verify the simulation output nine different industrial paper dryers were surveyed. These produced different paper grades: newsprint, fine <b>paper,</b> <b>fluting,</b> and paperboard. During a survey, temperatures and moisture contents of both paper and drying air as well as the temperature of the cylinder surface were measured. Seven of the nine cases involved steady-state production, whereas in the remaining two cases the basis weight and machine speed were altered considerably. The model applied just as well to lighter paper grades such as newsprint as to heavier grades such as paperboard. The data predicted by the program compared favorably with the measured data in all nine cases...|$|R
40|$|Linear Corrugating is {{a process}} for the {{manufacture}} of corrugated containers in which the flutes of the corrugated medium are oriented in the Machine Direction (MD) of the several layers of paper used. Conversely, in the conventional corrugating process the flutes are oriented {{at right angles to}} the MD in the Cross Machine Direction (CD). Paper is stronger in MD than in CD. Therefore, boxes made using the Linear Corrugating process are significantly stronger-in the prime strength criteria, Box Compression Test (BCT) than boxes made conventionally. This means that using Linear Corrugating boxes can be manufactured to BCT equaling conventional boxes but containing 30 % less fiber. The corrugated container industry is {{a large part of the}} U. S. economy, producing over 40 million tons annually. For such a large industry, the potential savings of Linear Corrugating are enormous. The grant for this project covered three phases in the development of the Linear Corrugating process: (1) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes on commercial equipment to verify that boxes so manufactured would have enhanced BCT as proposed in the application; (2) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes made on laboratory equipment using combined board from (1) above but having dual manufactures joints (glue joints). This box manufacturing method (Dual Joint) is proposed to overcome box perimeter limitations of the Linear Corrugating process; (3) Design, Construction, Operation and Evaluation of an engineering prototype machine to form flutes in corrugating medium in the MD of the paper. This operation is the central requirement of the Linear Corrugating process. Items I and II were successfully completed, showing predicted BCT increases from the Linear Corrugated boxes and significant strength improvement in the Dual Joint boxes. The Former was constructed and operated successfully using kraft linerboard as the forming medium. It was found that tensile strength and stretch characteristics of the corrugating medium were not sufficient to allow <b>fluting</b> this <b>paper</b> in the former. Possible causes and corrective actions to overcome this problem are addressed in the body of the report below...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{thread accuracy}} in {{details of the}} machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, thread milling cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the thread milling cutters with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread milling cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread milling cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread milling cutters with helical flutes. Since the standard presents thread milling cutters with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth thread milling cutter with helical <b>flutes.</b> The <b>paper</b> solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy. The data obtained can be used to correct tooth profile thread milling cutters to improve the accuracy of the obtained thread. </p...|$|R
40|$|Paper that is {{subjected}} to moisture undergoes dimensional changes. It expands during moistening and shrinks during drying. When the paper is under tension between rollers, the effects are complex since shrinkage and expansion are restricted in the width direction. Waves can then appear on the paper web. This {{can be a problem}} in heatset web offset printing. The problem is known as waviness or <b>fluting.</b> The printed <b>papers</b> exhibit a wavy shape, which is visually disturbing due to light reflections which create glossy streaks. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to develop a method suitable for studying the moisture- and tension-induced waviness. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory scale to study how such waves develop during moistening and drying. The experimental setup was based on a modified tensile tester. A CCD camera and image analysis based on the STFI-OptiTopo technique was used to characterise the waviness. Moistening and drying were achieved by changing the surrounding air humidity. The method was used to study the effect of moisture uptake by the paper, and to evaluate the effect of tension on the waviness. It was found that increasing moisture resulted in a higher waviness amplitude, but that the web tension controlled the wavelength of the waviness. A high tension gave rise to a shorter wavelength. The measured wavelength was compared with a previously suggested model and the predicted wavelength was about twice as high as the measured wavelength. When paper becomes damp it can develop waves which can be a problem with heatset web offset printing. Paper with waves may have glossy streaks after printing. Laboratory experiments studied the effect of moisture uptake by the paper. Readings were taken at a range of air humidities. The effect of tension on the waviness was also measured. The waviness was characterised using a charge coupled device (CCD) camera and the STFI-Packforsk OptiTopo technique to analyse the images. When the humidity was increased the amplitude of the waves increased. A high tension resulted in shorter wavelengths. Results from a previous model were used as a comparison...|$|R
