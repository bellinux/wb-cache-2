40|$|Photothermal {{excitation}} is a cantilever excitation {{method that}} enables stable and accurate operation for dynamic-mode AFM measurements. However, the low <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{of the method}} has often limited its application in practical studies. In this study, we propose a method for improving the photothermal <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> by coating cantilever backside surface near its fixed end with colloidal graphite as a photothermal conversion (PTC) layer. The <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> for a standard cantilever of PPP-NCHAuD with a spring constant of ≈ 40 N/m and a relatively stiff cantilever of AC 55 with a spring constant of ≈ 140 N/m were improved by 6. 1 times and 2. 5 times, respectively, by coating with a PTC layer. We experimentally demonstrate high stability of the PTC layer in liquid by AFM imaging of a mica surface with atomic resolution in phosphate buffer saline solution for more than 2 h without any indication of possible contamination from the coating. The proposed method, using a PTC layer made of colloidal graphite, greatly enhances photothermal <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> even for a relatively stiff cantilever in liquid...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-contact}} {{magnetostrictive sensor}} (MsS) {{has been widely}} used in the guided wave testing of pipes, cables, and so on. However, it has a disadvantage of low <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency.</b> A new method for enhancing the <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the non-contact MsS for pipe inspection using guided waves, by adjusting the axial length of the excitation magnetic field, is proposed. A special transmitter structure, in which two copper rings are added beside the transmitter coil, is used to adjust the axial length {{at the expense of}} weakening the excitation magnetic field. An equivalent vibration model is presented to analyze the influence of the axial length variation. The final result is investigated by experiments. Results show that the <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the non-contact MsS is enhanced in the whole inspection frequency range of the L(0, 2) mode if the axial length is adjusted to a certain value.

40|$|The transducer-lens {{system is}} one major {{component}} {{in the performance of}} an acoustic microscope. The design criteria for the various types of applications of an acoustic microscope are different. For surface imaging applications, it is desired to have a small spot size and low sidelobe level. For materials characterization and subsurface imaging applications (such as subsurface crack imaging), it is required to have high surface wave <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Several researchers addressed the problem of surface imaging. 1 - 5 Also, some work has been done to investigate materials properties indirectly by using so-called V(z) curves. 6 - 8 The resolution obtained in the latter case is always much worse than that of the corresponding lens. The direct measurement of surface wave velocity by using conventional transducer-lens systems also gives poor spatial resolution because it suffers from the interference of the specularly-reflected signal with the surface wave component caused by the low efficiency of surface wave excitation. 9 In order to increase the surface wave <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency,</b> we first modified the design of the standard longitudinal transducer-lens system. Furthermore, we worked out a novel configuration, i. e, the shear transducerlens system. This gives very high surface wave <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> and anisotropic acoustic beam distribution. Therefore, it can be used for direct measurements of materials properties in different directions with much less defocus than in the case of conventional transducer-lens systems.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{investigated}} {{the role of the}} Si excess on the photoluminescence properties of Er doped substoichiometric SiOx layers. We demonstrate that the Si excess has two competing roles: when agglomerated to form Si nanoclusters (Si-nc) it enhances the Er <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> but it also introduces new non-radiative decay channels. When Er is excited through an energy transfer from Si-nc, the beneficial effect on the enhanced <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> prevails and the Er emission increases with increasing Si content. Nevertheless the maximum excited Er fraction is only of the order of percent. In order to increase the concentration of excited Er ions, a different approach based on Er silicate thin film has been explored. Under proper annealing conditions, an efficient luminescence at 1535 nm is found and all of the Er ions in the material is optically active. The possibility to efficiently excite Er ions also through electron–hole mediated processes is demonstrated in nanometer-scale Er–Si–O/Si multilayers. These data are presented and discussed...|$|E

Two characteristic emission bands peaking at about 460 and 510 nm are attributed to Cui and dumbbell centers, respectively.

40|$|International audienceA novel {{method to}} {{stabilize}} the correlated color temperature in pcW-LEDs from their initial turn-on state to thermal equilibrium is proposed and demonstrated. Under the normal operation condition, it can stabilize the CCT of a pcW-LED by the positive matching of the blue LED peak wavelength to the phosphor excitation spectrum. When the operating temperature unavoidably becomes higher in the LED die quickly after the initial turn-on, the phosphor conversion efficiency degrades and the LED blue light performs red shift. With the positive matching, the red shift actually helps enhance the <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the phosphor to compensate the thermal quenching and efficiency degradation. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} blue light to the yellow light can keep almost constant, as well as the CCTs. In the experiments, the CCT variation could be as small as from 7 K to 83 K in different cases. Finally, we introduce a new factor, the so-called guide number, which is used to count the total change of the enhancement in equivalent <b>excitation</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the relative reduction of the phosphor light emission. The guide number essentially helps in designing the matching blue LED die and phosphor pair for good CCT stabilization...|$|E
