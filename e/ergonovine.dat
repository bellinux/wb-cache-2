These include the ergot, a fungal parasite of the barley or rye grain, which contains the alkaloids ergotamine, a precursor to LSD, and <b>ergonovine.</b> However, modern attempts to prepare a kykeon using ergot-parasitized barley have yielded inconclusive results, though Alexander Shulgin and Ann Shulgin describe both <b>ergonovine</b> and LSA to be known to produce LSD-like effects.|$|E
50|$|Ergocristine is an ergopeptine {{and one of}} the ergot alkaloids. As of February 24, 2010 Ergocrisine {{has been}} federally scheduled. Because of the {{existing}} Controlled Substance Act regulatory controls on the LSD precursors lysergic acid, lysergic acid amide, ergotamine, and <b>ergonovine,</b> clandestine laboratory operators have sought uncontrolled sources of precursor material for the production of LSD. This has led to the illicit utilization of the precursor chemical ergocristine as a direct substitute for ergotamine and <b>ergonovine</b> for the illicit production of LSD. In fact, the largest clandestine LSD laboratory ever, William Leonard Pickard and Clyde Apperson, that was seized by the DEA utilized ergocristine as the LSD precursor. Recipes documenting procedures for utilizing ergocristine in LSD synthesis are easily found on the Internet.|$|E
50|$|Ergometrine {{also known}} as <b>ergonovine,</b> is a {{medication}} used to cause contractions of the uterus to treat heavy vaginal bleeding after childbirth. It can be used either by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. It begins working within 15 min when taken by mouth and is faster in onset when used by injection. Effects last between 45 and 180 minutes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the naturally occurring <b>ergonovine</b> (used as an oxytocic) and ergotamine (a vasoconstrictor used to control migraine), synthetic derivatives of importance are the oxytocic methergine, the anti-migraine drugs dihydroergotamine and methysergide, hydergine (a mixture of dihydroergotoxine mesylates, INN: ergoline mesylates), and bromocriptine, used for numerous purposes including treatment of Parkinson's disease. Newer synthetic ergolines used for Parkinson's disease include pergolide and lisuride.|$|E
50|$|The gold {{standard}} is coronary angiography with injection of provocative agents into the coronary artery. Rarely, an active spasm can be documented angiographically (e.g. {{if the patient}} receives an angiogram with intent of performing a primary coronary intervention with angioplasty). Depending on the local protocol, provocation testing may involve substances such as <b>ergonovine,</b> methylergonovine or acetylcholine and hyperventilation. Exaggerated spasm is diagnostic of Prinzmetal angina.|$|E
50|$|Other {{drugs that}} affect the {{cardiovascular}} system include ajmaline, which is a Class I antiarrhythmic agents, and ajmalicine, which is used in Europe as an antihypertensive drug. Physostigmine - an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase - and its synthetic analogs {{are used in the}} treatment of glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease (rivastigmine) and myasthenia (neostigmine, pyridostigmine, distigmine). Ergot alkaloids ergometrine (ergobazin, <b>ergonovine),</b> ergotamine and their synthetic derivatives (methylergometrine) are applied against uterine bleeding, and bisindole alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine are antitumor agents.|$|E
50|$|The hallucinogenic {{properties}} of the seeds are usually attributed to ergine (also known as d-lysergic acid amide, or LSA), although {{the validity of the}} attribution remains disputed. Lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide and <b>ergonovine</b> are also considered to be contributing psychedelic alkaloids in the plant. While ergine is listed as a Schedule III substance in the United States, parts of the plant itself are not controlled, and seeds and plants are still sold by many nurseries and garden suppliers.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{most often}} noted as [...] "recreational" [...] drugs, the lysergamides are also of medical importance. <b>Ergonovine</b> enhances {{the action of}} oxytocin, used to still post partum bleeding. Ergine induces {{drowsiness}} and a relaxed state and might be useful in treating anxiety disorder. Whether Ipomoea species are a useful source of these compounds remains to be determined. In any case, in some jurisdictions certain Ipomoea are regulated, e.g. by the Louisiana State Act 159 which bans cultivation of I. violacea except for ornamental purposes.|$|E
50|$|Ergoline {{derivatives}} (lysergamides) {{are probably}} {{responsible for the}} entheogenic activity. Ergine (LSA), isoergine, D-lysergic acid N-(α-hydroxyethyl)amide and lysergol have been isolated from I. tricolor, I. violacea and/or purple morning glory (I. purpurea); although these are often assumed to {{be the cause of}} the plants' effects, this is not supported by scientific studies, which show although they are psychoactive, they are not notably hallucinogenic. Alexander Shulgin in TiHKAL suggests <b>ergonovine</b> is responsible, instead. It has verified psychoactive properties, though as yet other undiscovered lysergamides possibly are present in the seeds.|$|E
50|$|Methylergometrine (also called methylergonovine, methylergobasin, and D-lysergic acid 1-butanolamide) is a {{synthetic}} analogue of <b>ergonovine,</b> a psychedelic alkaloid found in ergot, and {{many species of}} morning glory. It {{is a member of}} the ergoline family and chemically similar to LSD, ergine, ergometrine, and lysergic acid. Due to its oxytocic properties, it has a medical use in obstetrics. According to Jonathan Ott, methylergonovine has LSD-like actions above 2 milligrams, due to its agonistic action at the 5HT2A-mGlu2 receptor protomers. Clinical efficacy occurs around 200 µg, ten times lower than the hallucinogenic threshold.|$|E
50|$|The {{seeds of}} {{many species of}} morning glory contain ergoline {{alkaloids}} such as the psychedelic <b>ergonovine</b> and ergine (LSA). Seeds of Ipomoea tricolor and Turbina corymbosa (syn. R. corymbosa) are used as psychedelics. The seeds of morning glory can produce a similar effect to LSD when taken in large doses, often numbering into the hundreds. Though the chemical LSA is not legal in some countries, the seeds are found in many gardening stores; however, the seeds from commercial sources are often coated in some kind or form of pesticide or methylmercury.Theses coatings are especially dangerous if one {{has a history of}} liver disorders and may also cause neural damage.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. In {{patients}} with chest pain suggestive of variant angina, we performed this prospective study {{to test the}} specificity and diagnostic validity of <b>ergonovine</b> echocardiography (detection of regional wall motion abnormality during bedside <b>ergonovine</b> challenge) as a screening procedure before coronary angiography. Background. Spasm provocation test outside the catheterization room has generally not been accepted as a safe diagnostic method. Methods. <b>Ergonovine</b> echocardiography was performed in 80 consecutive {{patients with}} chest pain syndrome after confirmation of negative treadmill or normal stress myocardial perfusion scan results using thallium- 201. A bolus of <b>ergonovine</b> maleate was injected at 5 -min intervals up to a total cumulative dosage of 0. 35 mg with echocardiographic monitoring of left ventricular wall motion. A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was also recorded every 3 min after each <b>ergonovine</b> injection. Positive test results were development of regional wall motion abnormalities or transient ST segment elevation or depression > 0. 1 mV in any single lead of the 12 -lead ECG. Coronary angiography was undertaken within 2 ± 4 days (mean ± SD) after <b>ergonovine</b> echocardiography, and the spasm provocation test with acetylcholine or <b>ergonovine</b> was performed in patients with normal angiographic findings or lumen diameter narrowing < 70 %. Results. On the basis of angiographic criteria, 56 patients had coronary vasospasm; this finding was later ruled out in 19 patients with near-normal angiographic results by a negative response on the spasm provocation test. In the remaining five patients, coronary spasm provocation was not performed because they revealed {{a high degree of}} fixed stenosis (lumen diameter narrowing 97 ± 4 %). <b>Ergonovine</b> echocardiography could diagnose coronary vasospasm before angiography, with a sensitivity of 91 % (51 of 56 patients, 95 % confidence interval [ci] 84 % to 98 %) and specificity of 88 % (21 of 24 patients, 95 % CI 75 % to 100 %). Of 53 patients showing regional wall motion abnormalities during <b>ergonovine</b> echocardiography, characteristic ST segment elevation in the simultaneously recorded ECG was observed in only 20 (38 %). There were no complications, including myocardial infarction or fatal arrhythmia, during the test. Conclusions. <b>Ergonovine</b> echocardiography before coronary angiography is safe and {{can be used as a}} reliable diagnostic screening test for coronary vasospasm in patients with negative treadmill or normal stress myocardial perfusion scan results. These findings suggest that invasive coronary angiography can be avoided in selected patients for the diagnosis of vasospastic angina...|$|E
40|$|In many {{patients}} with chest pain of esophageal origin, findings are normal on routine esophageal manometry and dysmotility develops only upon provocation with <b>ergonovine</b> maleate. Unfortunately, <b>ergonovine</b> may induce myocardial ischemia in patients in whom {{coronary artery spasm}} did not occur during previous provocative testing in a cardiac laboratory—limiting its clinical usefulness. We have recorded esophageal pressure simultaneously with <b>ergonovine</b> infusion during angiography in ten patients without significant arterial stenoses. In two patients their usual chest pain developed associated with esophageal spasm and without changes in coronary vessels. Simultaneous performance of angiography and manometry enhanced the diagnostic yield of provocative testing by showing esophageal motility changes. This method may detect {{significant changes in the}} esophageal motility, is easy to carry out and does not interfere with angiography.

40|$|Patients with {{coronary}} vasospasm {{appear to}} be supersensitive to the coronary constrictor effects of <b>ergonovine.</b> To determine whether atherosclerosis alters arterial reactivity and sensitizes arteries to <b>ergonovine,</b> contractile responses of isolated aortae from control rabbits and from rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet were compared. Aortic strips were mounted in a myograph for the monitoring of isometric tension, equilibrated in oxygenated Krebs buffer, and exposed to graded concentrations of agonists and antagonists. The concentration-response relation for <b>ergonovine</b> in atherosclerotic arteries exhibited a markedly depressed constrictor threshold concentration (0. 5 pM vs. 0. 23 μM in controls), a significantly lowered one-half effective dose (ED 50) value, and an augmented maximal response. Furthermore, atherosclerotic arteries showed similar, although less pronounced changes in the concentration-response relation for serotonin. In contrast, responses to 34 mM KCl were virtually identical, and the concentration-response relation for phenylephrine were similar in the two groups. In control arteries, 0. 1 μM phentolamine and 0. 1 μM prazosin suppressed responses to 1 μM <b>ergonovine</b> by 71 and 90 %, respectively. However, in atherosclerotic arteries α-blockers in the same concentration inhibited responses to 0. 01 μM <b>ergonovine</b> by less than 10 %. On the other hand, 0. 1 μM cyproheptadine, a serotonergic antagonist, suppressed these responses by 82 %. Thus, the supersensitivity to <b>ergonovine</b> appeared to be mediated predominantly by a serotonergic mechanism.

40|$|Four {{species of}} Balansia (clavicipitaceous {{systemic}} grass pathogens) isolated from pastures where cattle {{showed signs of}} ergot toxicity were grown in culture. Balansia epichlo?, one isolate of B. claviceps, B. henningsiana and two isolates of B. strangulans produced conidia in submerged culture during {{the first stage of}} a two-stage fermentation procedure. When transferred to a glucose/sorbitol/inorganic salts medium during the second stage, these four species produced ergot alkaloids in stationary cultures. The transfer of fungi cultured in the first medium to the second medium was necessary for alkaloid biosynthesis. One isolate of B. claviceps did not produce alkaloids.

40|$|<b>Ergonovine</b> {{have been}} used for the {{prevention}} and treatment of postpartum or postabortion hemorrhage. Although this modality has been considered relatively safe in the obstetric patients, there were a few cardiac events associated with this drug in the post-delivery or post-abortion patients, especially in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. We experienced cardiac arrest in a non-parturient with no discernible risk factors. Although resuscitated, she also suffered from pulmonary edema with unstable hemodynamics and low oxygenation. To manage the patient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used and she recovered successfully without cardiopulmonary complications. Therefore, we recommend that when <b>ergonovine</b> is chosen as a modality, special caution should be paid to the pulmonary events, as well as cardiac, especially when administered by intravenously even in patients with no cardiovascular risk factors.

40|$|The {{respective}} {{contributions of}} coronary vascular endothelium, nitric oxide (NO) and serotonergic receptors {{to the effects}} of <b>ergonovine</b> on large and small coronary arteries were investigated in conscious dogs. In seven dogs with an endothelium intact, <b>ergonovine</b> (30 – 1000 [*]μg, i. v.) induced a biphasic response on large coronary artery with an early and transient vasodilatation (up to + 2. 9 ± 0. 5 % from 3310 ± 160 [*]μm, P< 0. 01) followed by a sustained vasoconstriction (down to − 4. 9 ± 0. 5 %, P< 0. 001) which occurred simultaneously with a sustained increase in coronary blood flow (CBF) (up to + 100 ± 26 % from 28 ± 4 [*]ml[*]min− 1, P< 0. 001). After endothelium removal (balloon angioplasty), the ergonovine-induced vasodilatation was abolished and vasoconstriction potentiated (− 6. 4 ± 0. 9 % after vs − 4. 9 ± 0. 5 % before endothelium removal, P< 0. 01). After blockade of NO synthesis by Nω-nitro-L-arginine (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) in four other dogs, the early vasodilatation induced by <b>ergonovine</b> was abolished but the delayed vasoconstriction as well as the increase in CBF remained unchanged. Both ketanserin and methiothepin (0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) abolished the early vasodilatation and reduced the delayed vasoconstriction induced by <b>ergonovine.</b> Ketanserin decreased and methiothepin abolished the reduction in coronary resistance induced by <b>ergonovine.</b> Thus, the complex interactions between vascular endothelium and serotonergic receptors to ergonovine-induced constriction of large coronary arteries might explain the induction of coronary spasms in patients with endothelial dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{utility of}} <b>ergonovine</b> testing for {{coronary}} artery spasm was assessed in 3, 447 patients with angiographically insignificant (≤ 50 % diameter stenosis) or no coronary artery disease. No patients clinically had Prinzmetal's variant angina. Overall, 4 % had a positive <b>ergonovine</b> test result, defined by spasm causing ≥ 75 % focal stenosis. Complications related to <b>ergonovine</b> use occurred in 11 patients (0. 03 %). In a training sample of 1, 136 patients (studied between 1980 and 1984), two independent predictors of spasm were found by using multivariate analysis: the amount of visible coronary artery disease {{on the coronary angiogram}} (p < 0. 0001) and a smoking history (p = 0. 001). A model to predict spasm based on these variables was validated in a test group of 2, 311 patients who received <b>ergonovine</b> from 1985 to 1989. This model allowed the identification of a subset of 480 patients in the validation sample who had a 10 % positive test rate compared with a 2 % positive test rate in the remaining patients.

40|$|The vasomotor {{response}} of proximal and distal angiographically {{normal coronary artery}} segments was studied in 12 patients with syndrome X, 17 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic stable angina and 10 control subjects with atypical chest pain and a normal coronary arteriogram. <b>Ergonovine</b> (300 fig by intravenous injection) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg by intracoronary injection) were administered to all patients. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurement (angiographically normal segments only) was carried out {{before and after the}} administration of <b>ergonovine</b> and nitrate. Baseline intraluminal diameters (mean ± SEM) of proximal and distal coronary segments were not significantly different in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease (proximal 2. 88 ± 0. 19, 3. 01 ± 0. 13 and 2. 86 ± 0. 13 mm; distal 1. 57 ± 0. 09, 1. 70 ± 0. 10 and 1. 61 ± 0. 06 mm, respectively).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{vasoconstrictor}} response to <b>ergonovine</b> and the vasodilator response to isosorbide dinitrate in spastic and non-spastic coronary segments from 31 patients undergoing serial angiographic follow up of variant angina. METHODS: Coronary angiograms and <b>ergonovine</b> provocation tests were repeated at an interval of 45 (SD 15) months apart. While all 31 patients showed {{a positive response}} to <b>ergonovine</b> initially, vasospastic responsiveness persisted in only 16 patients at follow up (group 1) {{and not in the}} other 15 patients in whom symptoms of variant angina had resolved (group 2). Mean luminal diameter of 170 normal or near normal entire coronary segments (American Heart Association classification) were measured (a) at baseline, (b) after the administration of <b>ergonovine,</b> and (c) after the administration of isosorbide dinitrate, during both the initial and follow up angiograms using a computer based quantitative angiography analysis system (CAAS II). RESULTS: In vasospastic patients (initial and follow up angiograms in group 1, and initial angiogram in group 2), basal tone was significantly higher in spastic segments compared to adjacent segments or segments in non-spastic vessels. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity at 20 % increase in basal coronary tone for the prediction of vasospasm were 77 % and 73 %, respectively.

40|$|Because an {{increase}} in coronary vascular resistance in response to <b>ergonovine</b> maleate has been suggested as a possible diagnostic aid for variant angina, changes were evaluated in coronary hemodynamics and serial myocardial thallium- 201 perfusion scans in 15 patients without angina and with normal coronary arteries in response to <b>ergonovine</b> (0. 05, 0. 10 and 0. 20 mg intravenously). For the group, heart rate-blood pressure product increased significantly (p < 0. 001) without any change in coronary sinus flow, coronary vascular resistance, myocardial oxygen extraction, arterial-coronary sinus oxygen difference and lactate extraction.

40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} the endothelium against ergonovine-induced contraction were examined in isolated porcine coronary arteries under normal conditions and after endothelial regeneration. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro in normal Yorkshire pigs (n = 16) and in pigs that had undergone balloon endothelium removal of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) 4 weeks before the study (n = 10). The presence of a complete endothelial lining was confirmed histologically. In rings from normal arteries contracted with prostaglandin F(2 α) {{in the presence of}} indomethacin and ketanserin (a 5 -HT 2 -serotonergic blocker), <b>ergonovine</b> caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. They were attenuated by rauwolscine (an α 2 -adrenergic blocker), inhibited by methiothepin (a combined 5 -HT 1 - and 5 -HT 2 -serotonergic blocker) or by pertussis toxin (an inhibitor of several G proteins) and abolished by oxyhemoglobin (a selective inactivator of endothelium-derived relaxing factor). In quiescent rings from normal arteries, <b>ergonovine</b> caused contractions that were inhibited by the presence of the endothelium; this endothelium-dependent inhibition was ablished by oxyhemoglobin. The direct contractions were not affected by prazosin (an α 1 -adrenergic blocker), rauwolscine, 6 -hydroxydopamine (an agent causing chemical sympathectomy), or diphenhydramine (an H 1 -histaminergic blocker) but were inhibited by ketanserin. In rings with regenerated endothelium contracted with prostaglandin F(2 α), the endothelium-dependent relaxations to <b>ergonovine</b> were reduced significantly and were not inhibited by pertussis toxin. In quiescent rings with regenerated endothelium, the endothelium-dependent inhibition of ergonovine-induced contraction was less. Oxyhemoglobin caused endothelium-dependent contractions in quiescent rings (an indirect index of basally released endothelium-derived relaxing factor) that were reduced significantly in quiescent rings with regenerated endothelium. These results indicate that 1) the endothelium exerts its inhibitory action against ergonovine-induced contractioins by the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor under basal conditions and upon stimulation by <b>ergonovine,</b> 2) endothelium-dependent relaxations to <b>ergonovine</b> are mediated mainly by 5 -HT 1 -serotonergic receptors, whereas the direct contractions are mediated by 5 -HT 2 -serotonergic receptors with little contribution of α-adrenoceptors, 3) the inhibitory role of the endothelium is impaired significantly in the regenerated state because of the reduced ability to release the relaxing factor, and 4) endothelial pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein may be involved in the synthesis of the relaxing factor upon stimulation by <b>ergonovine,</b> and dysfunction of the G protein may account partly for the dysfunction of regenerated endothelium. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{coronary}} stenoses may be {{the cause}} of a variable angina threshold and rest angina in patients with chronic stable angina. It has been suggested that eccentric but not concentric coronary artery stenoses have the potential for dynamic changes of caliber in response to vasoactive stimuli. The vasomotor response of eccentric (asymmetric narrowing) and concentric (symmetric narrowing) coronary stenoses to <b>ergonovine</b> (20 µg intracoronary or 300 µg intravenous) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg intracoronary) was studied in 51 patients with chronic stable angina. Diameter of reference segments (angiographically normal segments proximal to the stenoses) and that of eccentric (n = 30) and concentric (n = 35) coronary stenoses that ranged from 50 % to 90 % luminal diameter reduction were measured by computerized quantitative angiography before and after <b>ergonovine</b> and isosorbide dinitrate. <b>Ergonovine</b> reduced stenosis diameter (by ≥ 10 %) in 80 % of eccentric stenoses and 42 % of concentric stenoses (p < 0. 05). Mean (± SEM) diameter reduction with <b>ergonovine</b> was 19 ± 3 % and 9. 5 ± 2 % for eccentric and concentric stenoses, respectively (p < 0. 05). Isosorbide dinitrate increased coronary diameter (by ≥ 10 %) in 70 % of eccentric and 43 % of concentric stenoses (p < 0. 05). Mean diameter of eccentric stenoses increased from 1. 15 ± 0. 05 to 1. 35 ± 0. 06 mm after nitrate (18. 6 ± 2. 5 %), whereas diameter of concentric stenoses increased from 1. 05 ± 0. 05 to 1. 14 ± 0. 05 mm (10 ± 2. 5 %) (p < 0. 05). Average dilation of reference segments with administration of isosorbide dinitrate and constriction with <b>ergonovine</b> were not significantly different in patients with concentric and eccentric stenoses. Thus, in patients with chronic stable angina, both eccentric and concentric stenoses have the potential for dynamic changes of caliber in response to vasoactive stimuli. However, a significantly larger proportion of eccentric stenoses exhibit this potential. The magnitude of dynamic changes of caliber is also larger in eccentric than in concentric stenoses...|$|E

MethodsA total of 2, 129 patients in the VA-KOREA (Vasospastic Angina in Korea) registry were classified into positive (n = 454), intermediate (n = 982), and negative (n = 693) groups by intracoronary <b>ergonovine</b> provocation tests. The 24 -month incidences of cardiac death, new-onset arrhythmia, and acute coronary syndrome were determined (mean 26. 7 ± 8. 8 months). ResultsThe number of smokers, frequency of angina before angiography, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and triglyceride {{were higher in the}} positive group than in other groups. The clinical characteristics of the intermediate and the negative groups were very similar. In the positive group, the incidences of diffuse, focal, and mixed spasm were 65. 9 %, 23. 6 %, and 10. 6 %. Coronary spasm was more frequently provoked on atherosclerotic segments. The 24 -month incidences of cardiac death, arrhythmia, and acute coronary syndrome were low (0. 9 %, 1. 6 %, and 1. 9 %, respectively) in the positive group, and there was no cardiac death in the intermediate group (p = 0. 02). In the positive group, frequent angina, current smoking, and multivessel spasm were independent predictors for adverse events. ConclusionsThe 24 -month prognosis of the positive group in the intracoronary <b>ergonovine</b> provocation test was relatively worse than that of the intermediate group. More intensive clinical attention should be paid to vasospastic angina patients with high-risk factors including frequent angina before angiography, current smoking, and multivessel spasm...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} and diagnostic role of <b>ergonovine</b> maleate infusion under continuous two-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring for the identification of vasospastic myocardial ischaemia in patients with chest pain at rest not associated with diagnostic ECG changes. One hundred and twenty-eight consecutive patients, selected on the basis of absence of ischaemic ECG changes during angina at rest before or during hospitalization, were enrolled in the study. <b>Ergonovine</b> maleate was L v. administered in scaled doses (from 0025 to 0 - 2 mg at 10 min intervals) under echocardiographic, electrocardiographic and systemic blood pressure monitoring. Wall motion asynergies were observed in 33 patients, accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 patients and by ECG changes in 25 (ST elevation in 13 patients, ST depression in seven, T wave changes in five). All patients were able to complete the test. Non life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias were observed in four patients exclusively in association with ischaemia. In seven patients with a positive test, coronary artery spasm was documented at angiography. In 16 patients with a positive test, the vasospastic event was reproduced by a hyperventilation—echo test or a second <b>ergonovine</b> maleate-echo test performed within 3 days of the first examination. In none of the patients with a negative test was documentation of myocardial ischaemia due to a primary reduction in coronary blood flow. Thus, in patients who do not show ECG changes during chest pain at rest, the <b>ergonovine</b> maleate-echo test is feasible and safe; it permits the recognition of ischaemic episodes on the basis of wall motion abnormalities when conventional 12 -lead ECG-recorded chest pain is non-diagnostic...|$|E
40|$|Variant angina is {{characterized}} by spontaneous episodes of angina, usually occurring {{in the morning and}} having ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram. However, in the case presented here, vasospasm and angina was shown by <b>ergonovine</b> without ST elevation. The patient was a 60 -year-old man who presented with a 2 -year history of frequent chest pain. There were no abnormalities in coronary angiography. When <b>ergonovine</b> (100 µg) was injected, total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery was seen, without ST elevation at the electrocardiogram. The cause was collateral from left anterior descending artery to distal right coronary artery at the left coronary angiography. Therefore, in a patient with variant angina without ST elevation, a transient collateral circulation during vasospasm should be considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{cause of}} chest pain in {{patients}} with anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva {{has not yet been}} elucidated. In the following case, this anomaly was demonstrated, upon angiography, in a patient with recurrent chest pain and a negative stress test; in addition, spasm of the left anterior descending coronary artery was documented during <b>ergonovine</b> provocation. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} coronary artery spasm has been documented in a patient with this anomaly. On the basis of this case, we recommend <b>ergonovine</b> testing for all angina patients with aberrant coronary arteries in whom no other cause of chest pain is found at cardiac catheterization.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} {{changes in}} coronary artery spasticity {{in patients with}} vasospastic angina who had been stable for years under continuous drug treatment.  METHODS—Follow up coronary angiography was performed under intracoronary <b>ergonovine</b> provocation in 27  well controlled patients with vasospastic angina and no organic stenosis; the tests were done >  24 months after the initial coronary angiography, in which occlusive spasm had been induced by the same regimen of <b>ergonovine</b> provocation.  RESULTS—The mean (SD) follow up period was 47. 2  (21. 6) months. All patients had been free from angina attack for more than 24  months under treatment with antianginal drugs. During this follow up period, organic stenosis developed in only one case. Occlusive spasm was observed during follow up coronary angiography in 23  patients. Spasm with 90 % narrowing was observed in three other patients, and diffuse significant narrowing {{was seen in the}} final patient. No significant difference was found in spasticity (p =  0. 75) between the initial and the follow up tests.  CONCLUSIONS—Repeated <b>ergonovine</b> provocation during coronary angiography after a controlled period of several years showed that coronary spasm remains inducible in most patients. Discontinuance of drug treatment during the remission from anginal attacks achieved by medication may put the patient at high risk.    Keywords: vasospastic angina; ergonovine; angiograph...|$|E
40|$|Background: Coronary {{atherosclerosis}} with inflammation {{gives rise}} to coronary vasospasm in the patients with coronary vasospastic angina.

40|$|Objectives. : This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the location of coronary spastic activity may change over time in patients with persistent variant angina. Background. : Although electrocardiographic studies have provided indirect evidence to indicate that the location of ischemia may change in patients with variant angina, it has not been tested by quantitative angiography whether the location of vasospastic activity may change over time. Methods. : Paired <b>ergonovine</b> provocation tests and coronary angiography were performed at a mean (±SD) interval of 43 ± 13 months apart in patients with persistent symptoms of vasospastic angina in the absence of significant atherosclerosis. A total of 87 spastic and nonspastic segments of 87 major vessels in 29 patients were analyzed by quantitative angiography at baseline, after the administration of <b>ergonovine</b> and after isosorbide dinitrate at the initial and follow-up tests. Results. : In 13 patients (group 1), coronary spasm was observed in the same 16 coronary segments at both the initial and follow-up <b>ergonovine</b> provocation tests. In 16 patients (group 2), the following angiographic changes occurred between the initial and follow-up tests in 48 major vessels: Of the 23 segments that developed spasm at the initial test, 10 did not have spasm at the follow-up test; of the 25 vessels that did not demonstrate spasm on the initial test, 12 demonstrated spasm on the follow-up test (a new site of spasm). Thus, in 22 (46 %) of 48 vessels, fluctuation of spastic location was observed at follow-up. Conclusions. : Quantitative coronary angiography and repeated <b>ergonovine</b> tests revealed that some patients with persistent vasospastic angina demonstrate fluctuation of vasospastic location, whereas others exhibit a fixed location of vasospasm. Vasospastic angina may not only be a transient disease restricted in location, but may also be a persistent and variable condition involving multiple vessels over many years...|$|E
