In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team spent {{to make the first}} experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted the evolution of a multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade's other research included hypertension, <b>exercise</b> <b>physiology,</b> autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E

40|$|Background: Reduced {{exercise}} {{capacity is}} nearly universal among Fontan patients, though its etiology {{is not yet}} fully understood. While previous computational studies have attempted to model Fontan exercise, they did not fully account for global physiologic mechanisms nor directly compare results against clinical and physiologic data. Methods: In this study, we developed a protocol to simulate Fontan lower-body exercise using a closed-loop lumped-parameter model describing the entire circulation. We analyzed clinical exercise data from a cohort of Fontan patients, incorporated previous clinical findings from literature, quantified a comprehensive list of physiological changes during exercise, translated them into a computational model of the Fontan circulation, and designed a general protocol to model Fontan exercise behavior. Using inputs of patient weight, height, and if available, patient-specific reference heart rate (HR) and oxygen consumption, this protocol enables the derivation of {{a full set of}} parameters necessary to model a typical Fontan patient of a given body-size over a range of physiologic exercise levels. Results: In light of previous literature data and clinical knowledge, the model successfully produced realistic trends in physiological parameters with exercise level. Applying this method retrospectively to a set of clinical Fontan exercise data, direct comparison between simulation results and clinical data demonstrated that the model successfully reproduced the average exercise response of a cohort of typical Fontan patients. Conclusion: This work is intended to offer a foundation for future advances in modeling Fontan exercise, highlight the needs in clinical data collection, and provide clinicians with quantitative reference <b>exercise</b> <b>physiologies</b> for Fontan patients...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Physiology</b> <b>exercise</b> {{employing}} simulated diving {{is used in}} our {{curriculum to}} integrate knowledge in cardio-respiratory physiology. Aim was to improve model used in <b>physiology</b> <b>exercise</b> by employing continuous recordings of arterial pressure and heart rate. Materials and Methods: Total of 55 medical and dental students volunteered for the exercise. They were instrumented with photoplethysmographic blood pressure and heart rate device, {{as well as with}} pulse oxymetry. Continuous measurement of variables was undertaken while students performed apneas or breathed through snorkel in air or in cold water, or temperature change was applied to their forehead. Results: Employment of continuous recordings enabled detailed insight into changes in selected cardiovascular parameters during 30 seconds breathholding. Time course of the changes showed marked biphasic response. When face was submerged in cold water during apnea, arterial pressure initially decreased and heart rate increased. At the end of breath-hold, arterial pressure increased and heart rate decreased, respectively. Corresponding changes were less pronounced when breath-hold was performed without face immersion. Conclusion: Improved protocol in laboratory exercise enabled us to show two distinct phases in changes of cardiovascular variables which are characteristic of diving reflex. We showed students how modern technology can improve their studies in near future and encouraged and motivate them to participate actively in exercise...|$|R
40|$|Aim : To {{translate}} evidence-based methodologies {{of functional}} assessment and training from <b>exercise</b> and sports <b>physiology</b> {{to patients with}} neurological conditions. Methods : Dynamometric, neurophysiological and clinico-functional assessments were comprehensively performed within a multi-layered agenda consisting of different trials (3 randomized controlled trials, 5 cross-sectional studies, 4 single-group proof-of concept interventional trials) conducted on both healthy subjects and individuals presenting neurological conditions with a special focus on multiple sclerosis. These studies were aimed at addressing muscle weakness and its related disabilities, with a specific focus on multiple sclerosis. Results : Employing <b>exercise</b> and sports <b>physiology</b> techniques and methods with neurological patients, mostly multiple sclerosis, resulted into dynamometric and clinico-functional improvements which exceeded those commonly reported in clinical literature. In particular, the choice of strengthening exercise performed at maximal intensity proved well tolerated and effective in addressing muscle weakness due to neurological conditions. Moreover, assessment techniques borrowed from elite sports helped highlighting and characterizing the main differences between healthy and neurological individuals in terms of force production patterns and overall muscle capability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this integrated-article {{dissertation}} was to examine stress and health in Canadian post-secondary students. Data from the spring 2013 National College Health Assessment (NCHA) was utilized in study one and two. This dataset is comprised of 34, 039 students from 34 self-selected Canadian postsecondary institutions {{who took part in}} the NCHA survey. Study one examined the impact of stress, identified stressors and predicted which students were more likely to experience stress. Stress was the most commonly identified impediment to academic performance and 57. 6 % of students reported more than average stress. Most frequently reported stressors include; academics, finances, and sleep difficulties. Female students, graduate students, Caucasian students, non-international students, or students in a relationship were most likely to have elevated stress levels, as are those with a mental health diagnosis, learning disability, disability, or chronic illness. In study two, NCHA data was analyzed descriptively and structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship between health behaviours (e. g., physical activity, sleep, and nutrition), stress, and academic performance. A total of 13. 2 % of students reached Canada’s Food Guide Nutrition Guidelines, while 17. 2 % met Canadian Society of <b>Exercise</b> <b>Physiology’s</b> Guidelines for Physical Activity, and 44. 8 % identified that sleep was not a problem. Overall, 3. 3 % of students met recommendations for all three health behaviours. Sleep, exercise, and nutrition had a direct effect on stress and academic performance respectively. Stress also had a direct effect on academic performance. All health behaviours demonstrated significant indirect effects, influenced through stress, on academics. Lastly, via focus groups, study three investigated Canadian university students’ perceptions of individual and institutional factors that impact health and well-being. Students suggested that stress, health behaviours, accountability, and social capital affected their individual health. At an institutional level, a supportive campus culture mediates health; leading to engagement, cohesion, and empowerment. A lack of integration related to student health can result in; disconnection, disempowerment, and decreased motivation adversely impact health. Findings from all three studies support a comprehensive approach to addressing stress and overall health of students at post-secondary institutions...|$|R
