5|$|Today, most {{electronic}} devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control.

5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit {{can take many}} forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. <b>Electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis.

40|$|Traditional {{teaching}} (lecturing) method on {{the design}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> provides learners with little satisfaction, because they cannot check and confirm the validity of <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> they have designed. A better way to acquire design skills is to actually make the designed <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> and test the validity of design. In spite of the usefulness of such a practical approach, it has a disadvantage that there is only limited time for teaching (lecturing) {{and it is difficult to}} fabricate <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit,</b> perform <b>electronic</b> measurement, and test the validity of design in the limited lecture period. An alternative to overcome these disadvantages is to use simulation software that enables learners (students) to operate functionally the designed <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> and verify the appropriateness of design. The aim of this study was to examine the usefulness of simulation approach and clarify some problems related to such an approach...|$|R
5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
