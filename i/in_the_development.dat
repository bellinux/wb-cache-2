5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{identifies}} the critical strategic {{issues for the}} integration of facilities management (FM) into <b>the</b> <b>development</b> process (DP). It explains the factors that limit the integration and recognises the best practices applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> property <b>development</b> industry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a qualitative research approach through semi-structured interviews from the FM and property <b>development</b> industry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. Findings: The study discovered that the recognition of FM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> property <b>development</b> industry is encouraging. However, FM {{has been given a}} low priority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> property <b>development</b> industry, resulting in Facilities Managers being inadequately integrated into <b>the</b> <b>development</b> process. Research limitations/implications: Practical implications: Social implications: Originality/value: The paper suggests that it is imperative to understand these strategic issues to promote best practice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industry that improve the position of FM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> property <b>development</b> industry...|$|R

5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of adult homosexuality.|$|E
