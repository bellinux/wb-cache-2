Abstraction techniques, such as abstract data types, can support both the specification of <b>display</b> <b>interfaces</b> and the implementation of those interfaces in a variety of styles. These abstraction techniques also guide the organization of software systems that will use <b>display</b> <b>interfaces.</b> We are developing a system that includes specifications, interface description tools, prototype organizations, and runtime support. The emphasis is on flexibility and on the separation of policy from particular instances. Preliminary results from implementations in a prototype domain indicate the feasibility of the approach...|$|R

Remembering the syntax and usage of APIs is a difficult task for not just novices but also expert programmers. IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) provide capabilities like autocomplete and intellisense to assist programmers; however, programmers still need to visit search engines like Google to find API (Application Program Interface) documentation and samples.
