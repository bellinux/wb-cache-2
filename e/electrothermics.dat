40|$|International audienceAccurate {{knowledge}} of eddy currents {{is of great}} interest {{for the design of}} many electromagnetic devices such as used in <b>electrothermics.</b> Taking advantage of the fast decrease of the electromagnetic field inside the conductor, impedance conditions are usually considered to reduce the computational domain. However, whereas impedance conditions can be derived up to the required precision for any conductor with a smooth surface, these conditions are not valid near corners. Few authors have proposed heuristic impedance modifications close to the corners [1, 2] but these modifications are neither satisfactory nor proved. In particular in [2], the modified impedance seems to blow up near the corner, which does not seem valid for non-magnetic materials with finite conductivity as presented in [3]. In the present work, we do not consider the derivation of the impedance condition, which is an asymptotic expansion in high frequency (or high conductivity). We are rather interested in the description of the magnetic potential {{in the vicinity of the}} corner, considering the conductivity, as well as the frequency as given parameters. We emphasize that these considerations will be helpful to understanding the behavior of the impedance condition near corner singularities that will be considered in a forthcoming paper. [1] E. M.

40|$|The {{polymeric}} materials are widely applied in many industries {{because they have}} a number of advantages, which allow their use instead of traditional materials. Nevertheless, the issues of manufacturing products from {{polymeric materials}} and their applications are insufficiently studied. The same can be said about high-frequency (HF) <b>electrothermics</b> of polymers. Therefore, mathematical simulation of electrothermic processes is of interest both in terms of science and in terms of applications. Traditionally, the technological scheme with one insulator made of cardboard is used to implement the HF heating processes for welding of polymers without analyzing their insulating properties. For welding of polymer parts with various thickness it is interesting to consider the scheme with two heat insulators in the form of five-layer plate, including electrodes, insulators, and processed material. As a result of the conducted research activities the article presents a mathematical model {{in the form of a}} system of differential equations of unsteady heat conductivity taking into account internal sources of heat with appropriate boundary conditions, and software to implement it. The software that implements a mathematical model enables to study the mutual influence between the geometrical and electro-physical parameters of technological system of HF heating of the thermoplastics. From the calculations presented in numerical and graphic form the following areas of heating polymer are identified: uniform heating, regional zones of thermal influence of insulators. The article presents the research results of influence of heat insulators with different thickness on the distribution of thermoplastics temperature field. It is determined that the zone of maximum value of heating polymer can be displaced by modifying the parameters of insulating layers, thereby improving the welding quality of polymeric items. According to research results, we can conclude that there is a demand for creating a technological process for electro-thermic welding of polymers with a possibility to displace a zone of maximum heating (melting) polymer owing to changing heat insulation thickness. The developed software allows a new approach to the study of HF-heating modes, the solution of practical tasks to improve the welded joints quality of parts made from thermoplastics. </p...|$|E

50|$|Any {{extraction}} process {{will include a}} sequence of steps or unit processes for separating highly pure metals from undesirables in an economically efficient system. Unit processes are usually broken down into three categories: pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and electrometallurgy. In pyrometallurgy, the metal ore is first oxidized through roasting or smelting. The target metal is further refined at high temperatures and reduced to its pure form. In hydrometallurgy, the object metal is first dissociated from other materials using a chemical reaction, which is then extracted in pure form using electrolysis or precipitation. Finally, electrometallurgy generally involves electrolytic or electrothermal processing. The metal ore is either distilled in a electrolyte or acid solution, then magnetically deposited onto a cathode plate (electrowinning); or smelted then melted using an electric arc or plasma arc furnace (<b>electrothermic</b> reactor). Extractive metallurgy of ferrous and non-ferrous metals can involve pyrometallurgy, but chemical processes like hydrometallurgy and electrometallurgy are far more common in method of non-ferrous extraction.|$|R

40|$|Background: With 1, 8 M {{new cases}} and 1, 6 M deaths in 2012 worldwide, lung {{carcinoma}} is themost frequent cancer {{in men and}} the most fatal one in both males and females. Platinum-derivatives chemotherapy currently {{remains one of the}} most potent treatments available to physicians. Its main and first representative, cisplatin, is currently administered slowly by I. V. infusion and high hydration with mannitol 5 % solution before and after treatment in order to reduce its cumulative dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. The pulmonary administration of chemotherapy is a promising route as it could increase drug concentration close to the tumor while decreasing its systemic concentration and the related adverse effects. Materials & Methods: Cisplatin solution was administered once to CD- 1 female mice at a dose of 1. 25 mg/kg, either intravenously through the caudal vein or under anesthesia by endotracheal instillation to the lungs with a Microsprayer IA- 1 C (Penn-Century Inc. Philadelphia, USA). Blood, lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen and mediastinum were removed at different times postadministration (n= 5), weighted and digested in nitric acid at 60 °C under ultrasonication. Samples were then analyzed for platinum concentration with a SpectrAA 300 absorption spectrometer equipped with a graphite furnace GTA- 96 (Varian, Mulgrave, Australia) under specific <b>electrothermic</b> programs depending on the type of matrix. Results: The ETAAS appeared to be a reliable, fast and accurate method to quantify the platinum content in blood and different organs. The pharmacokinetic of cisplatin in mice lungs obtained after local delivery versus systemic delivery exhibits a 3 -fold increase in total platinum concentration in the lungs associated with a 10 -, 4 - and 5 -fold decrease in blood, kidneys and liver expositions, respectively. It also exhibits a 22 -, 5 - and 5 -fold decrease of peak concentrations in blood, kidneys and liver, respectively. Conclusion and perspectives: The pulmonary route seems a promising approach to increase the therapeutic index of cisplatin in lung cancer as it increases its lung concentration and decreases its blood and kidney concentrations. The development of cisplatin-based dry powders for inhalation is now ongoing to assess their tolerance, toxicity, efficacy and convenience. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|Thostenson, Erik T. In this work, {{composites}} of dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a thermosetting {{polymer matrix}} were investigated. It was {{the goal of}} the study to develop in situ sensing technologies based on the measurement of electrical resistance of a percolating network of CNTs in the polymer matrix. Three characterization methods were developed and changes in state of the composites were correlated to changes in electrical resistance. Composites of dispersed CNTs and vinyl ester (VE) resin were tested for thermoresistive behavior using a simple in situ electrical resistance measurement during thermomechanical analysis. Specimens ranging from 0. 1 to 1 wt% CNT were tested. The results showed that the thermoresistive behavior was strongly dependent on the CNT content and was highly tailorable in terms of sensitivity to temperature and polymer segmental motion. Specimens with CNT concentrations far above the electrical percolation threshold showed positive and negative temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) over the temperature range from 25 to 165 ̊C. Specimens with CNT concentration closer to the percolation threshold showed a near-zero and negative TCR. It was found that thermoresistive analysis of the CNT/VE composites was capable of detecting the glass transition and likely other polymer segmental and side chain processes previously observable only through more complex <b>electrothermic</b> analysis techniques. Cross-ply composites of glass fiber and dispersed CNTs in VE resin were tested in an environmental chamber while constrained in a constant displacement weathering fixture. Temperature was repeatedly cycled at a high rate from - 73 to 150 ̊C for approximately 56 hours. Electrical resistance was monitored in real-time during the duration of the testing regime, including the initial pre-tensioning step, and the evolution of damage observed in the electrical resistance data was assessed by edge replication. It was found that the electrical resistance response was sensitive to the combined thermal and mechanical loading condition and that significant cracking occurred in the 90 ̊ plies during environmental testing. A novel method of in situ polymer matrix composite materials process monitoring was developed. The method of torsional braid analysis (TBA) was used in conjunction with a real-time data acquisition system to determine the viscoelastic behavior of VE/CNT/glass fiber composite test specimens. The data acquisition system was used to collect electrical resistance data from electrodes placed {{at either end of the}} specimen during TBA tests. A rheometer with torsion accessory served as an analog for the torsional pendulum. The sensitivity of nanotube-based sensing to viscoelastic changes during cure was investigated. It was observed that electrical resistance was strongly correlated to the progression of cure. The proposed sensing method has the potential to give real-time sensing capability during critical phases of manufacturing as well as in-service monitoring for enhanced safety and reliability.
