5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
25|$|Much of Luther's musical {{heritage}} can {{be largely}} {{attributed to the}} influence of two long-serving individuals. The 40-year tenure of Dr. Carlo A. Sperati, Class of 1888, fostered the college's Lutheran musical tradition beginning in 1905 and developed the Luther College Concert Band into one of the first nationally touring music ensembles. Sperati's Concert Band quickly achieved national acclaim, and famed bandmaster John Philip Sousa canceled a performance of his own touring ensemble <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he could attend a performance of the Luther College Concert Band, which was scheduled to appear in a nearby city.|$|E
500|$|At one point, the {{principal}} male characters congregate {{in an alley}} behind Johnny's apartment to play catch with a football while wearing tuxedos. When Mark arrives, he is revealed to have shaved his beard, and the camera slowly zooms in on his face while dramatic music plays on the soundtrack. Nothing that is said or occurs during the scene has any effect on the plot; the scene ends abruptly when the men decide to return to Johnny's apartment after Peter trips. Wiseau received enough questions about the scene {{that he decided to}} address it on a Q segment featured on the DVD release; rather than explaining the scene, though, Wiseau only states that playing football without the proper protective equipment is fun and challenging. Greg Sestero has been questioned about the significance of Mark's shaving, though his only response for several years was [...] "if people only knew." [...] Sestero describes in The Disaster Artist that Wiseau insisted he shave his beard on-set <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> Wiseau would have an excuse for Johnny to call Mark [...] "Babyface," [...] Wiseau's own nickname for Sestero, and that the revealing of beardless Mark would be [...] "a moment". Sestero further detailed how the football-in-tuxedos scene was concocted on set by Wiseau, who never explained the significance of the scene to the cast or crew and insisted that the sequence be filmed at the expense of other, relevant scenes.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. So when we changed everything I was like I don't think they {{going to like it}} because it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it."

The characters are often said to be two-dimensional, the dialogue wooden, and the storytelling devices (such as excessive reliance on coincidence) strain credulity.

2500|$|Zuckerberg {{founded the}} Start-up: Education foundation. On September 22, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Zuckerberg had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, [...] "The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the two things could be kept separate." [...] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously. The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.|$|E
2500|$|Lechuza was {{released}} on May 22, 2001 and debuted on No.87 of the Billboard 200, with its single [...] "Threesome" [...] reaching No.66 on the UK Singles Chart. The album featured a total of eleven songs, {{all of which were}} more raucous and energetic than those on the band's previous efforts, with occasional escapes into heavy metal-esque guitar distortion paired with screaming vocal patterns. The reason for the change in style was Lewis' and DeLaPaz's constant feelings of disapproval for the band's songs, as revealed by Salazar in an interview in late 2002: [...] " [...] for Lechuza the guys were looking for a different direction so they wrote some songs that were way different, like Something Bad's Gonna Happen and Pasture of Muppets, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they could have some songs that they could, in their words, actually have fun playing onstage." [...] One of these songs, [...] "Beating a Dead Horse", explicitly addresses the problems that had arisen within the band.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his religious compositions, Pacificus is also credited with the writing of several pieces on secular knowledge, including a book on astronomy. He is also credited with the invention of several devices, including a means to throw flames from ships, but his most famous invention is his clock. On his epitaph, he is credited {{with the creation of}} a [...] "nocturnal clock" [...] (horologium nocturmum). This was long {{believed to be the first}} mechanical clock, or Water clock, a fact repeated in numerous sources even up to the present day. In medieval texts and illustrations however, it is shown that his [...] "clock" [...] was in fact an observation tube with crosshairs, accompanied by an argumentum, a text containing instructions on how to interpret the observations, and it was intended to be used not <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> monks could determine the hour of night, but also for calendrical purposes. The first of such medieval descriptions is the same poem by Pacificus, published as rhythmus 116 by K. Strecker in M.G.H. [...] "Poetae" [...] IV/2, [...] and followed by rhythmus 117, [...] "Carmen sperae caeli", a praise of the Christian zodiac, signed by the author himself with the same formula (Hirenicus humilis levita) found in the ms. Paris 1924 in a folio written, according to Campana, by Pacificus himself. Another poetical text on computus, rhythmus [...] "Anni domini notantur", has been also attributed to Pacificus.|$|E
