25|$|Historian David Day {{produced}} an unauthorised biography in 2015, the central contention {{of which was}} that Keating was an undiagnosed dyslexic. This <b>false</b> <b>allegation</b> resulted in a legal challenge from Keating. Day accepted {{that there was no}} evidence that Keating was dyslexic and issued a retraction and apology. The publishers, HarperCollins Australia were ordered to pulp unsold copies of the book.|$|E
25|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been reported}} by the media, most {{of which have been}} discounted by investigators. These have ranged from death by accident to Philip having been taken by extremists such as paedophiles and Satanists. One theory had a woman tell gardaí that her partner, an alleged paedophile, had killed Philip after abducting him. This was later declared a <b>false</b> <b>allegation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Discontent among student organisations in Malaysian {{universities}} soon posed a {{new problem}} for the UMNO-led government. The student movement were influenced by anarchist sentiments that their overseas counterpart. However, Mahathir {{in his capacity as}} Minister for Education issued a stern warning to university students and faculty not to become involved in politics. However, amidst allegations that farmers in rural states were starving due to government policies, massive student demonstrations were held in December 1974. These were <b>false</b> <b>allegation</b> as there were no known facts that any of the farmers or their families died because of starvation. Most of the demonstrators were Malays, and their ringleaders, which included Anwar Ibrahim—founder of Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (the Islamic Youth Movement of Malaysia, or ABIM)—were detained under the Internal Security Act, which effectively allows the government to detain anyone it sees as a threat to national security for an indefinite period. In 1975, Parliament passed amendments to the Universities and University Colleges Act (UUCA) which banned students from expressing support of or holding positions in any political party or trade union without written consent from the university's Vice-Chancellor. The act also banned political demonstrations from being held on university campuses. In 1976, however, mass demonstrations were held at the MARA Institute of Technology, protesting the UUCA. Mahathir then threatened to revoke the scholarships of the students, most of whom relied on public support to pay their way through university.|$|E

5000|$|Findings of {{multiple}} studies performed between 1987 and 1995 {{suggested that the}} rate of <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> ranged from a low of 6% to a high of 35% of reported child sexual abuse cases. Experts have argued that the reason for the wide range of differences in the rates resulted from different criteria used in various studies. In particular, a lower rate was found in studies that considered <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> to be based on intentional lying, whereas the higher rates were reported in studies that also added unintentional <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> resulting from suggestive questioning. [...] A 1992 meta-analysis suggests that <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> represent between two and ten percent of all allegations.|$|R
50|$|False {{reports are}} more common in custody disputes. Children appear to rarely make up <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> {{of their own accord}} but will make <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> if coercively {{questioned}} by individuals who believe abuse has occurred but refuse to accept children's statements that they were not abused (as was common practice during the satanic ritual abuse moral panic). <b>False</b> <b>allegations</b> can also arise as a consequence of false memories, sometimes implanted by questionable therapeutic practices.|$|R
500|$|Hale {{was born}} on 1 November 1609 in West End House (now known as The Grange or Alderley Grange) in Alderley, Gloucestershire to Robert Hale, a {{barrister}} of Lincoln's Inn, and Joanna Poyntz. His father gave up his practise as a barrister several years before Hale's birth [...] "because he could not understand the reason of giving colour in pleadings". This refers to a process through which the defendant would refer a case over the validity of his title to land to a judge instead of a jury, through claiming a (<b>false)</b> <b>allegation</b> about this right. Such an allegation would be a question of law rather than a question of fact, and as such decided by the judge with no reference to the jurors. Although in common use, Robert Hale apparently saw this as deceptive and [...] "contrary to the exactness of truth and justice which became a Christian; so that he withdrew himself from the inns of court to live on his estate in the country". John Hostettler, in his biography of Matthew Hale, points out that his father's concerns about giving colour in pleadings {{could not have been}} very strong [...] "since he not only retired to his estate at Alderley where he managed to live on his wife's inherited income, but also directed in his will that Matthew should make a career in the law".|$|E

In 1540, renowned kabbalist Malkiel Ashkenazi bought a courtyard from the small Karaite community, in which he established the Sephardi Abraham Avinu Synagogue. [...] In 1659, Abraham Pereyra of Amsterdam founded the Hesed Le'Abraham yeshiva in Hebron which attracted many students. In the early 18th century, the Jewish community suffered from heavy debts, almost quadrupling from 1717–1729, and were [...] "almost crushed" [...] from the extortion practiced by the Turkish pashas. In 1773 or 1775, a large/substantial amount of money was extorted from the Jewish community, who paid up to avert a threatened catastrophe, after a <b>false</b> <b>allegation</b> was made accusing them of having murdered the son of a local sheikh and throwing his body into a cesspit.

2500|$|Murphy {{has responded}} to Whiting's {{comments}} as follows: [...] "While Whiting, in his presentation for FARMS at BYU, exclaimed delight {{at the prospect of}} evolutionary biology coming to the defense of the Book of Mormon, he offered no scientific data to substantiate an Israelite origin of indigenous peoples anywhere in the Americas. In fact, he conceded, 'current genetic evidence suggests that Native Americans have a genetic history representative of Asia and not the Middle East.'" [...] Murphy further states: [...] "One of the most surprising critiques to emerge was the <b>false</b> <b>allegation</b> that I am evading peer review or that the research I reviewed would not stand up to peer review ... he article [...] was a summary of genetic research on Native American origins, nearly all of which had been subjected to peer review prior to publication in leading scientific journals such as American Journal of Human Genetics, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and American Journal of Physical Anthropology ....

2500|$|Before Riderhood {{can claim}} {{the reward for}} his <b>false</b> <b>allegation</b> against Hexam, Hexam is found drowned himself. Lizzie Hexam becomes the lodger of a doll's dressmaker, a {{disabled}} teenager nicknamed [...] "Jenny Wren". Jenny's alcoholic father lives with them, and is treated by Jenny as a child. Lizzie has {{caught the eye of}} the work-shy barrister, Eugene Wrayburn, who noticed her when accompanying his friend, the Harmon solicitor Mortimer Lightwood, to question Gaffer Hexam. Wrayburn falls in love with her. However, he soon gains a violent rival in Bradley Headstone, the schoolmaster of Charley Hexam. Charley wants his sister to be under obligation to no one but him, and tries to arrange lessons for her with Headstone, only to find that Wrayburn has already engaged a teacher for both Lizzie and Jenny. Headstone quickly becomes enamoured with Lizzie, and makes an unsuccessful proposal. Angered by Wrayburn's dismissive attitude towards him, Headstone comes to see him as the source of all his misfortunes, and takes to following him around the streets of London at night. Lizzie, fearing a violent quarrel between them, and unsure of Wrayburn's intentions toward her (Wrayburn admits to Lightwood that he himself doesn't know either), flees both men, getting work up-river from London.|$|E

2500|$|A {{study in}} the UK {{conducted}} from 2011 to 2012 found that false claims of rape and domestic violence are uncommon. This notion of frequent false accusations came about after the police and investigators began to follow an [...] "over-cautious approach" [...] when addressing reports of domestic violence. However, the study showed {{there were only a}} few <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> during seventeen months over 2011-2012. The study revealed that during the seventeen months, there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape and 111,891 for domestic violence in England and Wales, and in the same timespan, there were thirty-five prosecutions for making <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> of rape, six prosecutions for <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> of domestic violence, and three for <b>false</b> <b>allegations</b> of both crimes. Following the study and the eleven percent increase of reported cases of domestic violence in the last three months of 2012, there have been enhancements in the handling of the reported crimes with random checks of cases to ensure the correct handling of the prosecution of the cases.|$|R
