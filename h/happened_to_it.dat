5|$|Following the war, Ljotić's {{body was}} removed from the tomb in which it was buried. Two {{theories}} exist about what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> One claims it was removed by Ljotić's followers and taken to an unknown location following the creation of the Free Territory of Trieste in 1947. The other theory holds that Ljotić was buried in Šempeter pri Gorici until the signing of the Treaty of Osimo in 1977, when his followers removed his body from the tomb in which it was buried and took it to an unknown location outside Yugoslavia, possibly to Italy.|$|E

25|$|Astronaut Gordon Cooper {{reported}} {{suppression of}} {{a flying saucer}} movie filmed in high clarity by two Edwards AFB range photographers on May 3, 1957. Cooper said he viewed developed negatives of the object, clearly showing a dish-like object with a dome on top and something like holes or ports in the dome. When later interviewed by James McDonald, the photographers and another witness confirmed the story. Cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever heard what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times. The official explanation was that the photographers had filmed a weather balloon distorted by hot desert air.|$|E

25|$|At {{some time}} between 109AD and 122AD the {{garrison}} of the Ninth Legion {{was replaced by}} the Sixth Legion. There is no documented trace of the Ninth Legion after 117AD, and various theories have been proposed as to what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> The Sixth Legion remained in York until the end of Roman occupation about 400AD. The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of Britannia Inferior, and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a colonia or city. Constantius I died during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{shipped out}} to England in late 1917 where he trained in early 1918 in an Avro 504, perhaps at RFC Bramham Moor {{which was then}} renamed RAF Tadcaster, near Bramham cum Oglethorpe in Yorkshire. Hamilton was {{temporarily}} posted as a first lieutenant to United Kingdom No. 3 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, on 2 March 1918 He first scored as a combat pilot on 11 April 1918, flying the Sopwith Camel against his first German opponent, an LVG C.VI observation aircraft. The next day he made his second aerial kill; his third a week later. On 20 April he was flying {{at the tail end}} of 'C' flight when his commander Richard Raymond-Barker was attacked and killed by Manfred von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron. From far away Hamilton saw Richthofen shoot down a second aviator (who crashed but lived), then Hamilton was near enough to engage a blue Fokker Dr.I triplane, expending more than 300 rounds at it after which it went into a dive and spin, but Hamilton's own maneuvers prevented him from seeing what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Hamilton returned to base and claimed a kill but it was never confirmed—all of Richthofen's flight had returned safe from the engagement. On 3 June 1918, Hamilton became an ace, scoring his fifth confirmed victory.|$|E
500|$|An {{episode of}} the {{television}} documentary series Horizon titled [...] "Where is Flight MH370?" [...] was broadcast on 17 June 2014 on BBC Two. The programme, narrated by Amanda Drew, documents how the aircraft disappeared, what experts believe <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> and how the search has unfolded. The programme also examines new technologies such as flight recorder streaming and automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B), which may help prevent similar disappearances in the future. It concludes by noting that Ocean Shield had spent two months searching [...] of ocean, but that it had searched far {{to the north of}} the Inmarsat [...] "hotspot" [...] on the final arc, at approximately 28 degrees south, where the aircraft was most likely to have crashed. On 8 October 2014, a modified version of the Horizon programme was broadcast in the US by PBS as an episode of Nova, titled [...] "Why Planes Vanish", with a different narrator.|$|E

500|$|School {{officials}} again {{asked students}} about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was more fun than sitting in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I think this has {{to be the most important}} thing that has ever happened around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up. Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the male}} islanders {{utilised}} {{their knowledge of the}} Firth's currents to hire themselves out to passing vessels as maritime pilots. Their expertise was the product of a lifetime's experience on the waters of the Firth; as it was said, they had been [...] "dabbling in salt water from their childhood upwards". Indeed, the whole island was drenched in salt water thrown up by the powerful tides and storms to which it was subjected, particularly in the winter. The Statistical Account of Scotland noted that during a storm the sea level on the west of the island was more than two fathoms [...] higher than on the east side, and that the spray was thrown so high that it washed over the cliff tops [...] "and falls in such profusion as to run in rills to the opposite shore". The islanders took advantage of this phenomenon by capturing the water in a reservoir to power a watermill which ground their grain in the winter months. It is not now known exactly where the mill was or what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Although it is described in the Statistical Account, written in the 1790s, and a Robert Miller is listed in the 1851 census as its miller, by 1861 he had moved to farm a five-acre croft and no further mention is made of the mill in contemporary accounts.|$|E
500|$|On 18 June 1999, Ackah {{anonymously}} telephoned Brent social services, expressing {{concern over}} Climbié's situation. Samantha Hunt, the customer-service officer {{who received the}} call at the One Stop Shop at Brent House, faxed the referral to the children's social work department on that same day. Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon, and what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> was—according to Lord Laming, who headed the subsequent inquiry—the subject of [...] "some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence" [...] the inquiry heard. A few days later, possibly on 21 June 1999, Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make sure her concerns were being addressed. Ackah {{said that she was}} told by the person {{on the other end of}} the telephone that [...] "probably they [...] had done something about it". This call, however, did not trigger a new, separate referral. The first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999, when Robert Smith, the group administrative officer, logged the details of the referral onto the computer, with details of Climbié's injuries. Laming said the delay constituted [...] "a significant missed opportunity" [...] to protect Climbié. Edward Armstrong, the team manager of the intake duty team, said that he completed a duty manager's action sheet not for the 18 June referral, which he said never arrived in his office, but for the 21 June referral, which was a less serious case than the first; Laming called this version of events [...] "wholly unbelievable". Laming said that Armstrong's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses, that the quality of it [...] " [...] much to be desired", and that Armstrong's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team's [...] "inept handling" [...] of a genuine child protection case.|$|E
