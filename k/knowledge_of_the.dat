40|$|Recent dialogues in {{geography}} {{and the social}} sciences have reminded researchers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extent to which academic and policy knowledges are socially and spatially embedded – that is, they circulate through formal and informal systems of publishing, exchange, commodification and cultural influence.

In light of this, our paper surveys <b>knowledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creative economy itself, as reflected in a geography of industry reports and government policy statements in selected Asian countries.
