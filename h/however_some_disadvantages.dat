40|$|AbstractIn optical data transmission, {{adherence}} is {{the common}} method for joining optical components like fibres and lenses. Adhesive joints <b>however</b> have <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages.</b> The transmittable optical power is limited and the boundary layer causes undesired reflections. An alternative method for joining fibers with lenses is welding using CO 2 laser radiation. The irradiation pattern is designed in such a way, that the fibre is welded to the substrate around its whole circumference. Therefore a ring shaped beam is formed by a novel focusing device based on the Schwarzschild objective. The results of the welding experiments show significantly improved characterisitcs of the joint...|$|R
5000|$|There are, <b>however,</b> <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> of Ku band system. Especially at {{frequencies}} {{higher than}} 10 GHz in heavy rainfall areas, a noticeable degradation occurs, {{due to the}} problems caused by and proportional {{to the amount of}} rainfall (commonly known as [...] "rain fade"). [...] This problem can be mitigated, however, by deploying an appropriate link budget strategy when designing the satellite network, and allocating a higher power consumption to compensate rain fade loss. The Ku band is not only used for television transmission, which some sources imply, but also very much for digital data transmission via satellites, and for voice/audio transmissions.|$|E
5000|$|William Coad {{proposed}} in 1999 {{to handle the}} OA (outdoor air) and return air separately in building HVAC systems. Gatley also describes the application of DOAS for delivering dehumidified air to buildings to improve the indoor air quality and thermal comfort. More recent research efforts have been conducted to study the basics of DOAS with emphasis on the potential advantages compared to the conventional HVAC systems. S.A. Mumma {{suggests that there are}} four main problems with conventional all air overhead mixing VAV HVAC systems. [...] These issues of VAV systems highlight the corresponding advantages of DOAS systems. <b>However,</b> <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> of DOAS include: potentially higher first costs, lack of use in the United States, and potentially higher complexity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parametric}} Goldfeld-Quandt test {{offers a}} simple and intuitive diagnostic for heteroskedastic errors in a univariate or multivariate regression model. <b>However</b> <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> arise under certain specifications or in comparison to other diagnostics, namely the Breusch-Pagan test, as the Goldfeld-Quandt test is somewhat of an ad hoc test. [...] Primarily, the Goldfeld-Quandt test requires that data be ordered along a known explanatory variable. The parametric test orders along this explanatory variable from lowest to highest. If the error structure depends on an unknown variable or an unobserved variable the Goldfeld-Quandt test provides little guidance. Also, error variance must be a monotonic function of the specified explanatory variable. For example, {{when faced with a}} quadratic function mapping the explanatory variable to error variance the Goldfeld-Quandt test may improperly accept the null hypothesis of homoskedastic errors.|$|E

50|$|Third {{generation}} biofuels feedstock {{is represented}} by micro- and macro- algae, which present further advantages over the previous two. (The first generation biofuels are made from edible feedstock like corn, soybean, sugarcane, and rapeseed. Second generation of biofuels from waste and dedicated lignocellulosic feedstock shave advantages over those of first generation.) This marine biomass shows the prospect of high yields requiring no use of arable land. Major advantages of algae are: no competition with food crops for arable land, high growth rates, and low fractions of lignin which reduces the need for energy-intensive pretreatment and compatibility with biorefinery approach implementation. It has been proven that macroalgae can reach 2-20 times the production potential of conventional terrestrial energy crops <b>However,</b> <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> such {{as the presence of}} high water content, seasonal chemical composition and the occurrence of inhibitory phenomena during anaerobic digestion, make algal biofuels not yet economically feasible although they are more environmental friendly than fossil fuels.|$|E
5000|$|Phage {{therapy is}} another method for {{treating}} antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Phage therapy infects pathogenic bacteria {{with their own}} viruses, bacteriophages and their host ranges are extremely specific for certain bacteria, thus they do not disturb the host organism and intestinal microflora unlike antibiotics. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, infect and can kill bacteria and affect bacterial growth primarily during lytic cycles. Phages insert their DNA into the bacterium, where it is transcribed and used to make new phages, after which the cell will lyse, releasing new phage able to infect and destroy further bacteria of the same strain. The high specificity of phage protects [...] "good" [...] bacteria from destruction. <b>However,</b> <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> to use of bacteriophages also exist. Bacteriophages may harbour virulence factors or toxic genes in their genomes and identification of genes with similarity to known virulence factors or toxins by genomic sequencing may be prudent prior to use. In addition, the oral and IV administration of phages for the eradication of bacterial infections poses a much higher safety risk than topical application, {{and there is the}} additional concern of uncertain immune responses to these large antigenic cocktails. There are considerable regulatory hurdles that must be cleared for such therapies. The use of bacteriophages as a replacement for antimicrobial agents against MDR pathogens no longer respond to conventional antibiotics remains an attractive option despite numerous challenges.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, contour clicks were {{believed}} to be uvular in their rear articulation, whereas non-contour clicks were thought to be velar. However, it is now known that all clicks are uvular, at least in the languages that have been investigated, and that the articulation of these clicks is more complex than that of others but no different in location. Miller (2011) analyzes them as contours (that is, as a transition from one kind of sound to another within a single consonant), whereas Nakagawa (2006) analyzes them as sequences of a click followed by a uvular consonant (that is, as consonant clusters). The benefit of a cluster analysis is that it greatly reduces the consonant inventory of the language. Taa, for example, has 164 known consonants, including 111 (and potentially 115) clicks, an extraordinary number considering that the largest inventory of any language without clicks, that of Ubykh, is 80 (84 consonants including loanwords). With a cluster analysis, the number of clicks in Taa is reduced to 43, and the total number of consonants to 87, only slightly surpassing Ubykh for the most consonants in the world. There are, <b>however,</b> <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> to a cluster analysis: Although the click series and non-click series can often be made to align, in some languages there are consonants in these purported clusters that never occur alone, something that never happens with other kinds of consonants. Also, all other languages in the world that allow obstruent clusters (as English does with s and t in steep, and as these click clusters would be) also allow clusters with sonorants (as English does with r in treat). However, no Khoisan language allows a cluster of any consonant, click or otherwise, with sonorants like l, r, y or w. Miller concludes that the remarkably large numbers of consonants in these languages is real, a consequence of the greater number of permutations of clicks, where there are two places of articulation that can be independently manipulated.|$|E

50|$|<b>However,</b> {{there are}} <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> and criticisms with word-of-mouth {{marketing}}. Word-of-mouth marketing {{is subject to}} a lot of clutter. As well, word-of-mouth marketing may sometimes not be beneficial in changing or influencing consumer's attitudes and perception especially from an organic source as negative conversations may be held about the brand. This is due to the organic source not finding the product beneficial and therefore has a negative perception of the product, which is then shared.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to vacuum nozzles, mechanical grippers could {{be required for}} handling of some odd-shaped parts. Self-centering mechanical grippers allow simultaneous pickup and automatic centering {{without the need for}} a vacuum. A pair of tweezers-type grippers would hold the part while centering it along one axis. <b>However,</b> there are <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> with self-centering mechanical grippers: {{it is possible that the}} gripper edges could have contact with epoxy or solder paste. In addition, extra space is required between the components to accommodate the grippers.|$|R

30|$|The {{properties}} of the Ag-coated CSSNs are dependent on metal coverage. Thus, control of metal coverage {{is important to the}} application of this kind of core-shell-shaped nanostructure [15]. Until now, various approaches have been reported to fabricate the Ag-coated CSSNs, such as electroless plating [16, 17], layer-by-layer self-assembly [18], sonochemical methods [19], and so on. These methods have been attempted to coat uniform metal on the colloid cores. <b>However,</b> <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> exist during the synthesis. For example, in the electroless plating, metals or compounds such as gold, palladium, and SnCl 2 are used to activate the core surface, but they remain as an impurity in the final product. The layer-by-layer self-assembly is too complicated and time-consuming. In the sonochemical method, the high-intensity ultrasound and removal of oxygen are necessary; otherwise, impurity like Ag 2 O can be observed.|$|E
50|$|The {{step back}} technique, {{also known as}} {{telescopic}} or serial root canal preparation, is divided in two phases: in the first, the working length is established and then the apical part of the canal is delicately shaped since a size 25 K-file reaches the working length; in the second, the remaining canal is prepared with manual or rotating instrumentation. This procedure, <b>however,</b> has <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages,</b> such as the potential for inadvertent apical transportation.

Chitosan can easily adsorb anionic dyes, such as direct, acid and reactive dyes, by electrostatic attraction due to its cationic nature in an acidic condition. The dye enhancement activity of Chitosan nanoparticles was seldom reported. Unique characters of nanoparticles for their small size and quantum size effect supposedly promised Chitosan nanoparticles to exhibit superior dye ability improvement (Rinaudo 2006).|$|E

40|$|Density is an {{important}} measure for hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavement quality control. Traditionally, the nuclear gauge method is widely used in pavement density testing. <b>However,</b> <b>some</b> <b>disadvantages</b> of nuclear gauges (such as the handling, storage, and transportation of radioactive materials) have created the need of non-nuclear technology. This thesis evaluated the Pavement Quality Indicator (PQI) model 301, which was promised to be more efficient than the nuclear method. The PQI utilizes many electrical impedance principles by using the current going through the pavement to determine its density and moisture content. Test data were collected in the field during pavements, and cores {{were taken to the}} laboratory for further testing. A thorough investigation of calibration methods was also performed both in the lab, and on the field to improve the accuracy of the PQI’s results. Results showed that the PQI could be a better alternative to a nuclear gauge when the following benefits are considered: 1) economic savings, 2) faster data measurement, 3) no intense federal regulations, safety concerns, licensing and intense training, and 4) improved calibration techniques.
