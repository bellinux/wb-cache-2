The study areas represented by a <b>forestry</b> <b>ecosystem</b> located from west to east of Caspian forests in north of Iran. 6 sites were selected from Gilan (cool and moist), Mazandaran (moist with moderate winters) and Golestan (warm and arid) provinces. The measurements of the cores were made with the LINTAB device and TSAP program. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the time-series of the tree-rings indices as well as to the residual time-series of the monthly precipitation and temperature derived from 6 meteorological stations located near the study regions. The results of ring width variation (111 years of data) showed that 30. 2 % of the total variance of tree-rings chronologies could be attributed to the common variability of the climatic parameters: Finally, results have shown that 30. 2 % of variance has a significant and positive correlation with June precipitation in both species and in all sites. Precipitation in spring is an important factor to all physiological activities of tree, like cambium activation.

This study reports the first C. ciliata transcriptome, encompassing three different life stages (Nymphs, adults female (AF) and adults male (AM)). In total, 26. 53 GB of clean data and 60, 879 unigenes were obtained from three RNA-seq libraries. These unigenes were annotated and classified by Nr (NCBI non-redundant protein sequences), Nt (NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequences), Pfam (Protein family), KOG/COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins), Swiss-Prot (A manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database), and KO (KEGG Ortholog database). After all pairwise comparisons between these three different samples, {{a large number of}} differentially expressed genes were revealed.

Results showed that annual CO 2 effluxes (S+L) reached 3942. 20, 3422. 36 and 2163. 02 CO 2 g(.) m(- 2.) a(- 1), respectively in the monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest, mixed broadleaf-coniferous forest and coniferous forest. All {{the three types of}} forests revealed the same characteristics of seasonal changes with the CO 2 effluxes peaking throughout June to August. During this peaking period, the effluxes were 35. 9 %, 38. 1 % and 40. 2 % of the total annual effluxes, respectively. The CO 2 emission process responding to the environmental factors displayed significantly different patterns in forestry soils of the three types of forests. The coniferous forest (CF) was more sensitive to temperature than the other two types. The Q(10) values were higher, along with greater seasonal variations of the CO 2 efflux, indicating that the structurally unique <b>forestry</b> <b>ecosystem</b> has disadvantage against interferences. All the three types of forestry CO 2 effluxes showed significant correlation with the soil temperature (T-s), soil water content (M-s) and air pressure (P-a). However, stepwise regression analysis indicated no significant correlation between air pressure and the soil CO 2 efflux. With an empirical model to measure soil temperature and water content in 5 cm beneath the soil surface, the CO 2 effluxes accounting for 75. 7 %, 77. 8 % and 86. 5 % of the efflux variability respectively in soils of BF, MF and PF were calculated.

The present study had as its objective to discriminate and characterize types of A. araucana forests in the Conguillio National Park, located in the Southern-Center Chile, through data derived from the Landsat- 5 TM satellite and geographic information systems. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was satisfactorily related with variables corresponding to crown coverage and the diameter at breast height; thus, these index values were incorporated to the classification process. Using the digital elevation model and the NDVI, the effect provoked by the shadow was minimized. Seven types of forests, between dense and semi-dense-open, were discriminated {{in accordance with the}} accompanying species. The global reliability of the classification was 83. 8 %. The greatest reliability for the producer was for the medium crown density forest of A. araucana - N. dombeyi (B 1) (87. 5 %); and for the consumer, for the high crown density forests of A. araucana - N. dombeyi (B 1) and also for those of medium density (B 2) (93 %).

Consequently, a number of international and local laws and policy interventions have been established to ensure that natural resource use remains sustainable. In rural areas, overdependence on fuel wood has commonly been identified as one of the biggest threat to <b>forestry</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> This in turn has led to environmental degradation that includes among others species depletion, soil erosion and decline in water and air quality. Based on the myriad problems caused by over-reliance on fuel wood, this study sought to identify usage, management and perceived implication of woodland exploitation in Port St Johns local municipality in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Using interviews and questionnaires for key respondents in the local community, the study identified two key threats to socio-ecological stability resulting from wood fuel exploitation namely; high poverty levels and lack of coordination in the management of wood fuel resources. Apart from using fuel wood for domestic use, local fuel wood exploitation has been commercialized to augment household incomes. Lack of coordination in the management of natural resources has also created a vacuum in the exploitation and management of fuel wood resources. The study did not have inclination towards statistics such as chi-square and t-tests since the research questions and objectives did not refer to any relationship or significance level.

Key reasons for the widespread planting of A. mangium, in commercial monoculture plantations or in mixed plantings with other tree species or crops in areas with infertile soils, are its capacity to improve soil fertility (Wang et al. 2010; Forrester et al. 2013; Koutika et al. 2014; Machado et al. 2017; Tchichelle et al. 2017), change the soil faunal, microbial and bacterial communities (Bernhard-Reversat 1993; Bini et al. 2012, 2013; Huang et al. 2014; Pereira et al. 2017), and to stimulate crop or tree growth and forest productivity (Bouillet et al. 2013; Epron et al. 2013; Paula et al. 2015). The species is considered useful for these purposes due to the enhanced nutrient cycling, higher nutrient availability and microbial activities that accrue from its presence (Khanna 1998; Bini et al. 2012; Rachid et al. 2013; Santos et al., 2017 a, b). Introduction of A. mangium to agricultural, agroforestry or large open areas is, however, increasingly being shown to trigger major biological invasions. The number of publications documenting the invasive spread of A. mangium from planting sites is increasing rapidly; the species is currently recorded as an invasive species in Asia, Indonesia, southern Africa and South America (Richardson and Rejmánek 2011; Ismael and Metali 2014; Aguiar et al. 2014; Meira-Neto et al. 2018; Souza et al. 2018). Such invasions are reducing the overall benefit from using the species and is creating conflicts of interest between (agro) foresters on the one hand and conservationists and natural resource managers on the other. Such conflicts are arising in many temperate regions of the world where other Australian Acacia species (and other legume trees) have been planted outside their native range. Management initiatives are underway in many areas to reduce such conflicts (e.g. Kull and Rangan 2008; Dickie et al. 2014; van Wilgen and Richardson 2014; Shackleton et al. 2018 and references therein).|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comLimitations to agricultural productivity imposed by the root-zone constraints in Australian dryland soils are severe and need redemption to improve the yields of grain crops and thereby meet world demand. Physical, chemical and biological constraints in soil horizons impose a stress on the plant and restrict plant growth and development. Hardsetting, crusting, compaction, salinity, sodicity, acidity, alkalinity, nutrient deficiencies and toxicities due to boron, carbonates and aluminium are the major factors that cause these constraints. Further, subsoils in agricultural regions in Australia have very low organic matter and biological activity. Dryland salinity is currently given wide attention in the public debate and government policies in Australia, but they only focus on salinity induced by shallow groundwater. However, the occurrence of transient salinity in root-zone layers in the regions where water tables are deep is an important issue with potential for larger economic loss than water table-induced seepage salinity. Root-zone constraints pose a challenge for salinity mitigation in recharge as well as discharge zones. In recharge zones, reduced water movement in sodic horizons results in salt accumulation in the root zone resulting in chemical and physical constraints that reduce transpiration that, in turn, upsets salt balance and plant growth. High salinity in soil and groundwater restricts the ability of plants to reduce water table in discharge zones. Thus plantbased strategies must address different kinds of limitations in soil profiles, both in recharge and discharge zones. In this paper we give an overview of plant response to root-zone constraints but with an emphasis on the processes of salt accumulation in the root-zone of soils. We also examine physical and chemical methods to overcome subsoil limitations, the ability of plants to adapt to and ameliorate these constraints, soil modification by management of agricultural and <b>forestry</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> the use of biological activity, and plant breeding for resistance to the soil constraints. We emphasise that soil scientists in cooperation with agronomists and plant breeders should design site-specific strategies to overcome multiple soil constraints, with vertical and lateral variations, and to develop plant-based solutions for dryland salinity.

Potentially affected sectors include 1) <b>forestry</b> and <b>ecosystems,</b> 2) agriculture, 3) coast, 4) fishers, 5) water resources, and 6) communities and households. An impact classification system is developed that considers short and long run flexibility to adapt to climate change, the existing knowledge or capacity to adapt, {{and the degree to which}} climate matters after adaptation (i. e., the degree to which damages can be avoided).

40|$|The {{conception}} {{of sustainable development}} has been implemented into practice in numerous economic sectors, including <b>forestry.</b> Forest <b>ecosystems</b> are extremely important in the global ecological system, therefore maintenance and appropriate management of forest resources according to sustainable development principles have engaged {{a great deal of}} attention. The concept of sustainable forest management (SFM) encompasses three dimensions: ecological, economic and social. A powerful tool to promote SFM are criteria and indicators. The aim of the article was evaluation of SFM in Poland, using one of the methods proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). According to data available, Polish forestry has a number of advantages: Poland has avoided the problem of deforestation, forest area has been permanently increasing, there has been observed improvement of forest health and vitality as well as a significant share of forests has carried out protective functions with no impact on timber production. Poland’s model of SFM is an adaptive process of balancing the ever-changing set of economic, environmental and social expectations. Such a complicated undertaking requires constant assessing and adjusting forest practices, in response to new circumstances, scientific advances and societal inpu...|$|R
50|$|Researchers at the Institute {{are engaged}} in basic and applied {{research}} across a spectrum including agriculture and <b>forestry,</b> biodiversity and <b>ecosystem</b> health, atmospheric resources, climate and associated natural hazards, cultural resources and history of human settlements, disease and public health, emerging pests, fisheries and wildlife, energy and industrial technology, mineral resources, pollution prevention and mitigation, and water resources. Examples include impact and control of invasive Asian carp, Lyme disease vector ecology, Illinois water supply quality and quantity investigations, geologic carbon sequestration, development of geospatial tools, discovery and excavation of massive prehistoric settlements surrounding Cahokia in advance of new bridge construction, persistence of estrogens in dairy farm wastewater, electronics re-use to minimize electronic waste, and monitoring atmospheric deposition of radioisotopes in North America following the Fukushima reactor incident.|$|R
40|$|Globalization has remarkably {{redirected}} the {{flows of}} global forestry investment {{to developing countries}} since early 1990 s, several leading multinational forest companies have established a huge area of Eucalyptus plantations in the past decades in Guangxi, China. Previous {{studies show that the}} establishment of Eucalyptus plantations has both positive and negative effects on rural environment and communities’ livelihoods, but few of these studies have highlighted the local communities’ perspective. This study aims to assess how the local communities perceive ecosystem services and their livelihoods after the intense land use changes to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} impacts for companies operating or investing in the region, moreover, it also aims to complement the previous studies on forest industry managers’ perception on plantation <b>forestry</b> and <b>ecosystem</b> services in the context of China. With the guidance of two qualitative questionnaires, 5 village-level and 80 villager-level semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data in villages near Eucalyptus plantations. The results indicate that from local communities’ perspective, the establishment of Eucalyptus plantations has degraded ecosystem services, especially soil fertility, water quantity and quality, the local livelihoods have been however diversified to some extent. Some managerial implications concerning community engagement are provided according to the findings so that the forest companies can achieve better business performance in Guangxi and similar areas in future...|$|R
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} climate change and forest {{ecosystems}} (impacts, mitigation, vulnerability and adaptation), and includes work from various international institutions that consider forests {{as part of the}} solution to address climate change. The book aims to increase the understanding of forest ecosystems dynamics in response to a changing climate; to address deforestation and maximize carbon sequestration in forests and forest products. Community and political issues involved at various project and ecosystem scales are discussed in detail. By advancing and exchanging knowledge that is complimentary to the UNFCCC-IPCC framework, our team of editors and authors hope to add a valuable contribution to address global climate change in relation to <b>forestry</b> and forest <b>ecosystems</b> in vulnerable locations. It includes work from various institutions and international contributors. Book chapters include a wide variety of topics {{on climate change}} impacts, mitigation, vulnerability and adaptation of forests...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{ecosystem}} services {{has gained a}} strong political profile during the last 15 years. However, there is no specific EU policy devoted to governing ecosystem services. This article shows that the ecosystem services concept is already embedded in recent EU (environmentally-related) policies, such as the Biodiversity Strategy 2020 and the Invasive Alien Species Regulation. Our review of 12 policies shows that, overall, the coherence between existing policies and the ecosystem services concept is moderate. Policies showing very high coherence are confined to the policy arenas that address natural <b>ecosystems,</b> <b>forestry,</b> or agriculture. Given the sectoral nature of most EU policies and the limited options for revision in the near future, opportunities for improving coherence are most apparent in furthering {{the integration of the}} ecosystem services concept in the implementation of existing EU policies at national and regional levels. </p...|$|R
40|$|Six {{national}} programs-including the Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP), Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjin (DCBT), Shelterbelt Network Development Program (SNDP), Wildlife Conservation and Nature Reserve Protection Program (WCNR), and Industrial Timberland Plantation Program (ITPP) -were {{adopted as}} {{means to achieve}} the Chinese Government sustainable development national policy. While the programs have made promising progress circa 10 yr at the national level, problems exist at the regional and locals levels. This article, therefore, reviews the achievements and {{problems associated with the}} programs and their implementations, and provides recommendations for the full realization of the goals of the programs. We recommend a comprehensive strategy for future activities-including promotion of sustainability science, reformation of rigid policies and regulations, adoption of sustainable <b>forestry</b> practices, integrated <b>ecosystem</b> management approach, and formation of new international collaborations.

40|$|Research {{on water}} {{scarcity}} has mainly focused on blue water (surface- and groundwater), but green water (soil moisture directly {{returning to the}} atmosphere as evaporation) is also scarce, because its availability is limited and there are competing demands for green water. Crop production, grazing lands, <b>forestry</b> and terrestrial <b>ecosystems</b> are all sustained by green water. The implicit distribution or explicit allocation of limited green water resources over competitive demands determines which economic and environmental goods and services will be produced and may affect food security and nature conservation. We need to better understand green water scarcity {{to be able to}} measure, model, predict and handle it. This paper reviews and classifies around 80 indicators of green water availability and scarcity and discusses the way forward to develop operational green water scarcity indicators that can broaden the scope of water scarcity assessments...|$|R
