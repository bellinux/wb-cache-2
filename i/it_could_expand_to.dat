40|$|In wide double {{white dwarf}} (DWD) binaries, {{in which the}} co-eval WDs evolve independently, the more massive, faster-evolving WD {{can be used to}} obtain a main-sequence {{lifetime}} for the less-massive WD. By converting this lifetime into an initial mass for the less-massive WD, and combining it with the spectroscopically derived mass for this WD, one can constrain the initial-final mass relation (IFMR). However, the number of known and well-characterized DWDs is small, severely limiting their usefulness for this analysis. To obtain new constraints on the IFMR, we search for wide DWDs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9. We find 65 new candidate systems, thereby raising the number of known wide DWDs to 142. We then engage in a spectroscopic campaign to characterize these pairs, identifying 32 DA/DA pairs, two DA/DB pairs, four DA/DAH candidate pairs, a previously unidentified candidate triple WD system, and five DA/DC WDs. We present a reanalysis of the constraint on the IFMR placed by Finley & Koester (1997) using the DWD PG 0922 + 162, and finish by discussing how <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be <b>expanded</b> <b>to</b> a generic set of wide DWDs.

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} use of quinacrine pellets for non-surgical female sterilization. Background: The cal {{insertion}} of quinacrine pellets has been under study for over 15 years. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> potentially <b>expand</b> access <b>to</b> sterilization services, because it is relatively simple to administer, with {{the use of}} a modified IUD inserter, and is inexpensive. Methods: Published and unpublished data are reviewed. The short-term safety of transcervical quinacrine appears to be better than surgical sterilization, but it is less effective, especially among women under 35, and there are virtually no data on its reversibility. Thus, it is probably most appropriate for older women, aged 35 and over, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be an option for others where access to surgical sterilization is limited. Conclusion: The use of quinacrine pellets for female sterilization needs to be reviewed by appropriate regulatory authorities, especially with regard to long-term safety issues, and additional clinical studies are needed [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Big {{amounts of}} test data {{generated}} by the current used software testing tools (QA-C/QA-C++ and Cantata) contain {{a variety of different}} values. The variances cause enormous challenges in data aggregation and interpretation that directly affect generation of test metrics. Due to the circumstance of data processing, this master thesis introduces a database-centric test management framework for test metrics aims at centrally handling the big data as well as facilitating the generation of test metrics. Each test result will be individually parsed to be a particular format before being stored in a centralized database. A friendly front-end user interface is connected and synchronized with the database that allows authorized users to interact with the stored data. With a granularity tracking mechanism, any stored data will be systematically located and programmatically interpreted by a test metrics generator to create various kinds of high-quality test metrics. The automatization of the framework is driven by Jenkins CI to automatically and periodically performing the sequential operations. The technology greatly and effectively optimizes and reduces effort in the development, as well as enhance the performance of the software testing processes. In this research, the framework is only started at managing the testing processes on software-unit level. However, because of the independence of the database from levels of software testing, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> also be <b>expanded</b> <b>to</b> support software development at any level...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model to {{simulate}} the diffusion of impurities in bcc atomic lattices. It works with threedimensional volume divided in small cubic elements (voxels), containing more than one atomic cell each. Once the domain is discretized, impurities jump for one voxel to another according to certain probability {{that takes into account}} the composition and geometry of the target voxel. In present work, model was applied to prismatic volume, and in order to deduce the relationship between the atomic jumping frequency and the temperature two different cases were studied. One consists of a Fe matrix with Cr impurities, and the other, is based on a Cr matrix with Fe impurities. Results obtained from these simulations were compared with profiles obtained by Dictra software. Results for the atomic jumping frequencies were fitted to Arrhenius type equation, as shown in following expressions. JCr = 3. 396 × 1018 exp(− 306421 RT) JFe = 1. 096 × 1019 exp(− 411729 RT) From these equations it is possible to obtain an activation energy for the atomic jumping phenomenon of » 306 and » 411 kJ/mol for the Fe-matrix and Cr-matrix systems respectively. These energies match the empirical measured values for the diffusion of Cr and Fe impurities, 250 and 407 kJ/mol respectively. Results obtained in this work assure that the proposed model is suitable for simulating the three-dimensional diffusion of substitutional impurities in Cr and Fe bcc systems. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> be easily <b>expanded</b> <b>to</b> other bcc matrix systems.
