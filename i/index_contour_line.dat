By extending the contour tree (Freeman and Morse, 1967) to a contour graph, open <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> and carrying <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> can be handled. The ambiguities of the topological relationships among <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> are resolved using map structure information, i. e., elevation tags and <b>index</b> <b>contour</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Contour</b> graph is constructed and processed efficiently by introducing <b>index</b> <b>contour</b> graph.

Herein, we present a statistical approach to locate contour points for <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> construction {{in the presence of}} irregular sensor deployment with the assistant of Delaunay triangular meshes. The proposed contour-estimation algorithm has certain error-correction capa-bility, and it is robust to the data degradation coming from sensing and/or communication noise. To ensure the success of the proposed algorithm, we further analyze three sources of signal distortion: sensing noise, data quantization error, and data communication noise. We find that choosing a proper data quantization level can balance the communication cost and the desired signal quality. Meanwhile, the impact of channel impairment can be mitigated by the appropriate data-fusion mechanism. In this paper, an adaptive data-fusion mechanism is proposed to avoid excessive packet retransmissions. The correctness of the proposed approach is verified through simulation, and the effects of different system parameters on the overall system performance are also given to show the robustness of the proposed algorithm. This paper also offers some guidelines on the design of the WSN system. <b>Index</b> Terms—Contour estimation, <b>contour</b> <b>lines,</b> Delaunay triangulation, environmental monitoring, triangular meshes, Voronoi diagram, wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

(1) bad {{approximation}} of angular lines, (2) none or badly placed line inscriptions, (3) discontinuity when combining <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> sets of adjacent map sheets. We present a software system capable of dealing with the mentioned problems. A RasterDEM derived from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) AeS- 1 data, operated by AeroSensing Radarsysteme GmbH, serves as input for the software system. Prior to vector processing of the <b>contour</b> <b>lines,</b> DEM smoothing and local peak detection are perfomed on the raster data. <b>Contour</b> <b>lines</b> are organized in point and polygon lists. Various algorithms operate on the polygon/point list data structure, e. g. breaking of contours touching the map border, removal of small contours by thresholding on the number of tie points. The core of the program is the generalization module performing line smoothing and generalization. Three different approaches have been implemented: take each Nth point, Pavlidis and the Douglas-Peuker algorithm. The latter performed best with respect to <b>contour</b> <b>line</b> quality / time consumption tradeoff. To ensure continuity between map sheets, an overlap area forming a skirt on all four borders is constructed and <b>contour</b> <b>lines</b> are cutted in appropriate fashion.
