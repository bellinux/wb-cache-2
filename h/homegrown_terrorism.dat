40|$|The {{last decade}} marked a {{significant}} change in the European Union‟s approach towards terrorism. As a result of terrorist attacks (9 / 11, Madrid and London) the EU terrorism policy turned from a counter-terrorism approach, stressing repressive efforts targeting an outside threat, towards a counter-radicalization approach, targeting domestic radicalization processes. Led by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the latter approach based itself on a <b>homegrown</b> dimension of <b>terrorism</b> in which identification and resolving underlying causes of radicalization took center stage (Coolsaet 2012, 868). This shift was quite a significant one, since it influenced the traditional sovereignty of member states to deal with these issues themselves (Coolsaet 2012, 689).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether India’s democratic [...] institutions have effectively included Muslims as citizens fully capable of pursuing [...] their interests through peaceful means; or have, by excluding Muslims, contributed to a [...] rise in terrorist activity by external and internal Islamic extremist organizations in a [...] period of time when Islamic terrorism has grown worldwide. Has radical Islam as [...] global phenomena had a measurable effect on the formation of groups with an extremist [...] agenda in India? Has the rise to power of radical Hindu parties^in India’s national [...] parliament and state governments, contributed to a rise in violence? Has the Indian [...] government responded positively to recommendations by experts to prevent terrorism [...] by enacting and implementing legislation that prevents Muslims from turning to [...] terrorist alternatives? This study primarily uses qualitative means to answer these [...] questions. However, empirical analysis is used to supplement qualitative case studies [...] by introducing evidence of the opinions of Muslims towards India’s democratic [...] institutions. The study concludes that there has been an increase in <b>homegrown</b> [...] <b>terrorism</b> because India has not only failed to provide equal access to its institutions for [...] Muslims, but has even worked against them at time^hus^contributing to an increase in [...] terrorist activity...|$|R

25|$|Between 1993 and 2001, {{the major}} attacks or {{attempts}} against U.S. interests stemmed from militant Islamic jihad extremism {{except for the}} 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. On September 11, 2001, nearly 3,000 {{people were killed in}} New York City, Washington, D.C., and Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, during the September 11 attacks organized by 19 al-Qaeda members and largely perpetrated by Saudi nationals, sparking the War on Terror. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden considers <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorism</b> to be the most dangerous threat and concern faced by American citizens today. As of July 2011, there have been 52 homegrown jihadist extremist plots or attacks in the United States since the September 11 attacks.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPolice militarization {{is a complex}} subject with significant homeland security implications. Efforts to implement militarization reform without {{a clear understanding of}} the issue could negatively impact law enforcement’s ability to respond to emerging threats from <b>terrorism,</b> <b>homegrown</b> violent extremism, and armed criminals. Conversely, unfettered militarization of domestic policing could result in abuse of authority and loss of public confidence. This thesis proposes a nuanced definition of police militarization based on existing literature. The research then examines the correlation between violence and police militarization. A statistical analysis of crime data found an inverse relationship between levels of reported violence and militarization. However, the research discovered a strong nexus between perceptions of violence by the police and efforts to militarize. Social identity theory was used to explain why isolated acts of violence against police officers are perceived as attacks on the law enforcement community and lead to deep social divisions between the police and the public. This socially constructed reality of violence, which is reinforced by the media and training, has a powerful effect on police attitudes and behavior. The conclusion is that police militarization has been influenced by violence, and appropriate levels of militarized capabilities are needed to protect both the police and the public.

5000|$|While {{there are}} many {{potential}} definitions of domestic terrorism, it is largely defined as terrorism in which the perpetrator targets his/her own country. Enders defines domestic terrorism as “homegrown in which the venue, target, and perpetrators are all from the same country. The term “homegrown terrorism” stems from jihadi terrorism against Westerners. Wilner and Dobouloz described <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorism</b> as [...] "autonomously organized radicalized Westerners with little direct assistance from transnational networks, usually organized within the home or host country, and targets fellow nationals." [...] However, <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorism</b> is not just jihad or Islamic.|$|E

50|$|<b>Homegrown</b> <b>terrorism</b> {{is not new}} to the world. Security {{analysts have}} argued that {{after the end of}} the Cold war, {{military}} conflicts have increasingly involved violent non-state actors carrying out asymmetric warfare, of which terror attacks are one part. The United States has uncovered a number of alleged terrorist plots that have been successfully suppressed through domestic intelligence and law enforcement. The United States has begun to account for the threat of <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorism,</b> as shown by increased volume of literature on the subject in recent years and increased number of terrorist websites since Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, began posting beheading videos in 2003. A July 2009 document by the FBI estimated that there were roughly 15,000 websites and web forums that support terrorist activities, with around 10,000 of them actively maintained. 80% of these sites are on U.S.-based servers.|$|E
