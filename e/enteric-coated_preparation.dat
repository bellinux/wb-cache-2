A profound individual variation was observed in plasma prednisolone concentrations, and neither total nor unbound drug levels showed any consistent relationship with the size of the prednisolone dose or the control of the disease activity.

In this study we analyzed the pharmacokinetic profile of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as the free fatty acid (FFA), in an <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>preparation,</b> in 10 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 10 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Subjects received 2 [*]g daily of EPA-FFA for 8 weeks. Plasma phospholipid and red blood cell (RBC) membrane fatty acid content were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There was a rapid incorporation of EPA into plasma phospholipids by 2 weeks and a slower, but highly consistent, incorporation into RBC membranes (4 % total fatty acid content; coefficient of variation 10 – 16 %). There was a concomitant reduction in relative n- 6 PUFA content. Elongation and desaturation of EPA into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) were apparent and DHA content also increased in membranes. EPA-FFA is well tolerated and {{no difference in the}} pharmacokinetic profile of n- 3 PUFA incorporation was detected between IBD patients and HV.

40|$|Introduction. For the {{treatment}} of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) it is recommended enzyme replacement therapy with high-dose <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>preparations.</b> In this regard, the question arises about the rationale of clinical application of the older low-dose non <b>enteric-coated</b> enzyme <b>preparations</b> (as a reference drug served Mezim® forte). Results. A number of anatomical and physiological characteristics and active use of suppressants of gastric secretion — proton pump inhibitors, antacids (sodium bicarbonate) — allows significantly to increase the «survival» of pancreatic enzymes that do not contain enteric coating in gastric juice and their delivery to the duodenum. This formulation {{is used for the}} relief of pain in case of chronic pancreatitis (<b>enteric-coated</b> <b>preparations</b> are uneffective). It was proposed to use a combination of two dosage forms — enteric-coated and non enteric-coated — for more effective therapy EPI. In functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (irritable bowel syndrome with functional disorders of the pancreas, functional dyspepsia) non <b>enteric-coated</b> enzyme <b>preparations</b> speeds recovery of patients. In inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, this formulation increases the duration of remission, and in case of inflammatory bowel disease — also the quality of life during remission. Non <b>enteric-coated</b> enzyme <b>preparations</b> are used {{in a number of other}} diseases associated with maldigestion/malabsorption. Additionally, they are used for the gradual cessation of therapy by high-dose enzyme preparations. They also find application for the correction of EPI during snacks and some gaps in the diet. Financial sales figures indicate a high demand for low-dose non <b>enteric-coated</b> enzyme <b>preparations</b> (Mezim® forte). Conclusions. Low-dose non <b>enteric-coated</b> enzyme <b>preparations</b> are still widely used in current clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of iron in five {{ferrous sulfate}} preparations was studied in 10 healthy male volunteers. The preparations were an oral solution, {{two types of}} film-coated tablets and two types of enteric-coated tablets. Blood samples were drawn hourly from 8 am to 6 pm {{on the day before}} each study day to assess baseline serum iron concentrations and on the study day. Spectrophotometry was used to measure the serum iron concentrations. The area under the curve (AUC), the maximum concentration and the time to achieve the maximum concentration were compared by analysis of variance. The <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>preparations</b> resulted in AUCs less than 30 % of the AUC for the oral solution. The two film-coated products produced AUCs essentially equivalent to that of the oral solution. We conclude that the bioavailability of iron in the <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>preparations</b> was low, relative to that of the film-coated products and the oral solution, and that these products should not be considered interchangeable...|$|R
2500|$|Esomeprazole capsules, {{as well as}} Losec/Prilosec tablets, are {{formulated}} as a [...] "multiple-unit pellet system" [...] (MUPS). Essentially, {{the capsule}} consists of extremely small enteric-coated granules (pellets) of the esomeprazole formulation inside an outer shell. When the capsule is immersed in an aqueous solution, as happens when the capsule reaches the stomach, water enters the capsule by osmosis. The contents swell from water absorption, causing the shell to burst, and releasing the enteric-coated granules. For most patients, the multiple-unit pellet system is of no advantage over conventional <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>preparations.</b> Patients for whom the formulation is of benefit include those requiring nasogastric tube feeding and those with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).|$|R
40|$|Six healthy male volunteers {{received}} aspirin (ASA) in a compressed (320 mg) and an enteric-coated (800 mg) formulation {{as single}} oral doses ten days apart. Ten plasma samples {{were obtained from}} each volunteer between 5 and 120 min after compressed ASA, and seven between 10 and 240 min after enteric-coated ASA. ASA was undetectable (less than 100 ng/ml) in plasma from three subjects receiving compressed ASA and two receiving the <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>preparation.</b> Plasma levels and kinetic parameters of salicylate were the same in subjects with undetectable and detectable ASA plasma levels. More than 98 % inhibition of pre-drug serum TXB 2 was noted in all samples collected one and four hours after either ASA preparation. TXB 2 generation recovered on average by 3. 5 % at 24 hr with both preparations. Thus inhibition of platelet TXB 2 generation occurred independently {{of the amount of}} ASA reaching the peripheral circulation. If this is due to inhibition of platelet function in the enterohepatic circulation followed by extensive first-pass deacetylation of ASA, vascular PGI 2 synthesis could be spared. A better knowledge of the kinetic parameters of ASA for each of the formulations used in thrombosis prevention trials might help in solving the "aspirin dilemma"...|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{compare the}} {{dissolution}} profi les of various enteric-coated low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) tablets marketed in Indonesia. Methods The dissolution study {{was carried out}} according to US Pharmacocopoeiae (USP) /European Pharmacopoeiae, method A, using USP apparatus 1 (basket) 100 rpm, with 2 media: 0. 1 N HCl, 120 minutes for acid stage, and phosphate buffer pH 6. 8, 90 minutes for buffer stage. The sampling points were 120 minutes for the acid stage, and every 10 minutes until 90 minutes for the buffer stage. The acetylsalicylic acid was assayed using spectrophotometry at 280 nm for the acid stage, and at 265 nm for the buffer stage. The free salicylic acid was determined {{only at the end}} of the buffer stage with HPLC method. There were 6 test products (Cardio Aspirin® 100 mg, Aptor® 100 mg, Ascardia® 80 mg, Thrombo Aspilet® 80 mg, Astika® 100 mg and Farmasal® 100 mg), 3 batches for each product, and 6 units for each batch. Results The amount of ASA released from each ASA product tested at the end of acid stage (120 minutes) ranged from  1. 79 % for Cardio Aspirin® to 6. 92 % for Thrombo Aspilet®, all conformed to the compendial requirement for enteric-coated product (< 10 %). The amount of salicylic acid observed {{at the end of the}} dissolution test ranged from 3. 47 % for Cardio Aspirin® to 10. 90 % for Astika® and 11. 90 % for Thrombo Aspilet®. Thrombo Aspilet® showed sustained-release properties, causing high variability in ASA release, such that one of the 3 batches tested did not fulfill the compendial requirement of more than 75 % (the release was only 55. 11 %). High variability in ASA release between batches was also found with Farmasal® at 10, 20, and 30 minutes in buffer medium. The lowest effective dose of ASA as an antiplatelet drug for longterm use is 75 mg of plain ASA, and this is equivalent to 100 mg of enteric-coated ASA. Conclusions All of the low-dose ASA preparations marketed in Indonesia are enteric-coated products, while Thrombo Aspilet® is not only an enteric-coated but also a sustained-release product. Cardio Aspirin®, followed by Aptor®, has the right dose for low-dose <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>preparation</b> (100 mg), produces consistent ASA release between batches, and the most stable towards deacetylation (antiplatelet inactivation).

40|$|Abstract Background Enzyme {{treatment}} is the mainstay for management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in dogs. ‘Enteric-coated’ preparations {{have been developed}} to protect the enzyme from degradation in the stomach, but their efficacy has not been critically evaluated. The hypothesis of the current study was that enteric coating would have no effect on the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme treatment for dogs with EPI. Thirty-eight client-owned dogs with naturally occurring EPI were included in this multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial. Dogs received either an <b>enteric-coated</b> enzyme <b>preparation</b> (test treatment) or an identical preparation without the enteric coating (control treatment) over a period of 56 days. Results There {{were no significant differences in}} either signalment or cobalamin status (where cobalamin deficient or not) between the dogs on the test and control treatments. Body weight and body condition score increased in both groups during the trial (P P P P = 0. 225). Clinical disease severity score decreased over time for both groups (P = 0. 011) and no difference was noted between groups (P = 0. 869). No significant adverse effects were reported, for either treatment, for the duration of the trial. Conclusions Enteric coating a pancreatic enzyme treatment improves response in canine EPI. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} on a novel {{approach}} based on modification of the intestinal surface to prevent diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). The removable intestinal tie adult rabbit diarrhea (RITARD) model {{was used to test}} the efficacy of an <b>enteric-coated</b> protease <b>preparation</b> (Detach; Enzacor Technology Pty. Ltd.) in the prevention of bacterial attachment and diarrheal disease caused by colonization factor antigen I-positive (CFA/I+) E. coli H 10407. Protease was administered orally to rabbits 18 h prior to challenge with 10 " bacteria. Four groups of rabbits were inoculated with different ETEC strains which produced different combinations of adhesin and enterotoxin or with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Occurrence of diarrhea during the subsequent 24 -h incubation period was recorded. Oral administration of protease was successful in reducing diarrhea and diarrhea-induced death in six of seven (86 %) rabbits infected with CFA/I+, heat-stable and heat-labile toxin-positive E. coli (H 10407). Seven of eight (87 %) rabbits not protected by protease treatment died or developed severe diarrhea. Quantitative analysis of bacterial cultures obtained from the small intestine of rabbits showed a significant (P 0 to 99. 9 %).

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of postproduction neutron activation of an <b>enteric-coated</b> pancreatic enzyme <b>preparation</b> for in vivo gastric emptying studies has been investigated. During production of this multicomponent preparation, {{small amounts of}} 170 Er-enriched erbium oxide, suitable for neutron activation, were added. Postproduction neutron irradiation of the labeled preparation resulted in short-lived (7. 5 hr) gamma-emitting 171 Er. Various radiocontaminants, however, are produced also. Because of variations in activation yields, half-lives, decay schemes and radiotoxicities, both major and trace constituents were considered for optimization of both dosimetry and the diagnostic measurement. Conditions were optimized for the best ratio of the committed dose equivalent due to 171 Er to the total committed dose equivalent. The results show that postproduction neutron activation of a 170 Er-enriched multicomponent preparation can be performed safely within the guidelines set by the WHO for experiments in humans involving radioactive material...|$|R
40|$|Consistent {{levels of}} {{platelet}} inhibition {{are required to}} deliver effective antiplatelet therapy. Growing awareness that not all individuals respond comparably to aspirin {{has led to the}} concept of aspirin ‘resistance’ and prompted search for an means to confirm individual response. However, the term is misleading because there are many determinants of failure to respond to treatment. Aspirin’s primary pharmacological effect and that which is understood to prevent thrombosis is almost complete inactivation of platelet cyclooxygenase- 1 and thereby inhibition of thromboxane biosynthesis. In this thesis I report findings from a study of patients with cardiovascular disease taking aspirin, in which I apply point-of-care and laboratory assays with varying specificity for cyclooxygenase inhibition. I demonstrate weak correlation between aspirin assays, some of which measure cyclooxygenase inhibition and others that detect platelet reactivity despite cyclooxygenase inactivation. I identify supernatant thromboxane generation as a sensitive assay of aspirin response. I also demonstrate that low dose <b>enteric-coated</b> aspirin <b>preparations</b> fail to deliver an adequate dose to many patients. Heritable factors determine platelet reactivity to a greater extent that environmental factors and largely determine residual activity in the presence of cyclooxygenase inhibition. I demonstrate that haplotypic variation in the cyclooxygenase- 1 gene and a common splice variant in the gene that encodes the serotonin transporter modulate COX inhibition. I also identify a platelet G-protein (33 subunit splice variant that influences epinephrine-induced platelet activation via a non-COX dependent pathway. I demonstrate that the same variant increased bleeding in patients treated with the oral glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa antagonist orbofiban in the OPUS-TIMI 16 trial. Lastly I investigate the role of human growth arrest specific gene 6 in platelets. I take a molecular biology and in-silico analysis approach to characterising the gene and its transcriptional response elements. I also screen for genetic variants in its regulatory regions to assess their role in determining platelet reactivity...|$|R
40|$|The bisphosphonate pamidronate (3 amino- 1, 1 -hydroxypropylidene bisphosphonate (APD), Ciba-Geigy) is a {{powerful}} inhibitor of osteoclast function and {{has been shown to}} significantly reduce osteolysis associated with bone metastases in breast cancer. Until recently, however, only an intravenous preparation has been readily available. We have evaluated the toxicity and effect on urinary calcium excretion of an <b>enteric-coated</b> oral <b>preparation</b> of pamidronate in a phase I/II trial in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer. Sixteen women with progressive disease and evidence of active bone resorption with an elevated calcium excretion (fasting urine calcium/creatinine ratio greater than 0. 4 (mmol mmol- 1) on two occasions prior to treatment) were studied. Four were given 150 mg daily; four 300 mg daily; four 450 mg daily and four 600 mg daily. Urinary calcium/creatinine (Ca 2 +/Cr) ratios were measured on all patients after an overnight fast. In patients on 150 mg daily the mean ratio fell from 0. 65 (range 0. 57 - 0. 72) before treatment to 0. 13 (0. 02 - 0. 19) after three weeks treatment. Mean values at entry for patients on 300, 450 and 600 mg were 1. 18 (0. 72 - 2. 1), 0. 76 (0. 42 - 1. 5) and 0. 63 (0. 52 - 0. 82) respectively and after treatment these fell to 0. 11 (0. 05 - 0. 18), 0. 37 (0. 14 - 0. 68) and 0. 17 (0. 06 - 0. 25). There {{were no significant differences in}} efficacy between treatment groups. Oral, enteric-coated disodium pamidronate is non-toxic and effectively reduces calcium excretion, raised in association with metastatic bone disease at doses of 150 mg or above. At the doses used to date it is as effective as weekly treatments with 30 mg of the intravenous preparation. Further studies are required in order to determine its value for preventing complications of bone disease and possibly as an adjuvant to surgery for breast cancer...|$|R
