This <b>is</b> <b>fitting,</b> because O'Brien himself made free use of characters invented by other writers, claiming that there were too many fictional characters as is. O'Brien was also known for pulling the reader's leg by concocting elaborate conspiracy theories.|$|E

500|$|The plan {{to rebuild}} the synagogue in its {{original}} 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli government in 2000. Jerusalem architect Nahum Meltzer, who proposed rebuilding the synagogue in its original Ottoman format, was given the commission. Meltzer stated that [...] "both {{out of respect for}} the historical memory of the Jewish people and out of respect for the built-up area of the Old City, it <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> for us to restore the lost glory and rebuild the Hurva Synagogue the way it was." [...] The state-funded Jewish Quarter Development Corporation under the leadership of Dov Kalmanovich convinced the Israeli government to allocate $6.2million (NIS24m), about 85% of the cost, for the reconstruction, with private donors contributing the remainder. In the end, the government only gave NIS11m, with the remainder being donated by a Ukrainian Jewish businessman and philanthropist, Vadim Rabinovitch.|$|E

On behalf of that committee, Kvale reported it favorably to the full House on February 10. In the report, Kvale stated that the 40,000 medals would be struck without expense to the government, and that Treasury officials supported the bill. [...] "In view {{of the importance of}} this celebration to the many descendants of the Norse immigrants into this country, and through these to the State of Minnesota, which is officially sponsoring the event, and to the great Northwest, which they have been such a large factor in developing, the committee believes that such a medal <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> and proper and that this bill should be enacted into law." ...|$|E
500|$|Nominative {{determinism}} is {{the hypothesis}} that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine New Scientist in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting surnames. These included a book on polar explorations by Daniel Snowman and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation {{that some sort of}} psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in New Scientist, as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept aptronym, and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. [...] "Aptronym" [...] merely means the name <b>is</b> <b>fitting,</b> without saying anything about why it has come to fit.|$|E

According to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the song has a beat of 130 {{beats per minute}} and is written in the key of A minor. Spears's vocal range spans from G3-C5. In the song, Spears seems {{to be looking for}} a woman named Amy in a club. It has been suggested that Amy is either Amy Winehouse or an alter ego of Spears herself. The verses end with the hookline [...] "Hahahehehahaho", which, according to Poppy Cossins of The Sun, <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> to [...] "the album's [...] overtone". The chorus begins with the lines [...] "Love me, hate me / Say what you want about me", a reference to the public's perception and fascination with Spears' life. This presents Spears both as [...] "an object of desire and a punching bag". According to Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, this line also alludes to the public image of British singer Amy Winehouse.|$|E
500|$|A first European {{settlement}} {{was built by}} a Scottish arms smuggler from Glasgow named William Clark Cowie who named the settlement [...] "Sandakan", (which in the Suluk language means [...] "The place that was pawned"). It was soon renamed Kampong German (Kampung Jerman), due {{to the presence of}} several German bases there. When another new {{settlement was}} built shortly after the previous Cowie settlement had been destroyed by a fire, it was called as Elopura, meaning [...] "beautiful town". The name was given by the British North Borneo Company but the locals persisted to use the old name and later it was changed back to Sandakan. Besides Elopura, it was also nicknamed Little Hong Kong due to a strong presence of ethnic Chinese migration from Hong Kong (mainly Cantonese and Hakka). It was Pryer who gave the settlement the name Elopura meaning [...] "beautiful town". Several years later the settlement was again renamed Sandakan. The name Elopura, however, is still used for some local government functions of the Sabah State Legislative Assembly, including elections. The town is usually referred as [...] "Sandakan" [...] nowadays instead of [...] "Elopura" [...] or [...] "Little Hong Kong". However, efforts have been made to develop Sandakan so that the town <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> to have the name of [...] "Little Hong Kong" [...] again.|$|E

Korina Lopez from USA Today called the ballad [...] "sweet" [...] and one that offers a [...] "peek into her family life". Mesfin Fekadu from the Associated Press noted the song to be more honest than Beyoncé's previous work. Mike Wass of Idolator named the [...] "fragile ballad" [...] as a [...] "heartbreaking letter" [...] and his personal favorite on the album. He noted how it may never be disclosed whether the song was inspired by Beyoncé's personal loss, before adding that [...] "if so, it couldn't be a more beautiful tribute". Anupa Mistry from Spin found a [...] "moving story of a miscarriage" [...] in the track. Tom Breihan from the website Stereogum lauded Beyoncé's decision to record a song about the important subject of miscarriage, calling it [...] "an incredibly brave and real act" [...] and noting how it acted as a [...] "hug" [...] to people with similar experiences. He concluded that [...] "eople are going to cry their eyes out to this" [...] before naming [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] "maybe the realest, most grown-up things Beyoncé has ever done".|$|E

500|$|Viking metal {{has been}} {{considered}} the progenitor of the pagan metal genre, with Bathory's Hammerheart as the first pagan metal recording. Weinstein writes that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> that pagan metal began with Viking metal, given that the Vikings were Europe's last Pagans, converted slowly and with reluctance to Christianity". However, there are some key differences, as Imke von Helden explains: [...] " [...] deals mainly with Pagan religions and lies in a broader context where not only Old Norse mythology is dealt with, but also Celtic myths and history, fairy tales and other elements of folklore. Traditional instruments like the violin or flute are used more often in pagan than in Viking metal music." [...] The idea of incorporating and revering exclusively national or regional myths, stories, and tales first took root {{in the work of}} artists such as Adorned Brood, Falkenbach, Black Messiah, Enslaved or Einherjer, but, as a musical phenomenon, has grown far beyond Europe into a global trend in which artists express their affinity with an ethnic heritage. Viking metal, along with pagan and folk metal, forms part of a trend within cultural heritage movements toward wider acceptance of the heritage of ordinary and the everyday life, not just nationally significant and the iconic imagery, and also a trend to explore the outer reaches of heritage, where the definitions of heritage and heritage communities are stretched and contested.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its numerous memorials and monuments which pay homage to famous Americans, Washington, D.C. is home to many artworks honoring foreign heroes. Examples in Dupont Circle include memorials honoring Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi of India, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, and Lajos Kossuth of Hungary. [...] The idea of a U.S. monument honoring Shevchenko began with the American Shevchenko Society, founded in 1898. [...] Although the group's efforts never came to fruition, Ukrainian Americans continued to pursue the goal. [...] A turning point was when Professor Ivan Dubrovsky wrote an article in Svoboda titled [...] "In Favor of a Shevchenko Monument in Washington, D.C.", asking for support from the Shevchenko Scientific Society and Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA). [...] Thousands of Ukrainian Americans sent letters to members of Congress while Lev Dobriansky, a Ukrainian American economist and anti-communism activist, became a prominent advocate and lobbyist for erecting a monument honoring Shevchenko. [...] The activists eventually gained the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Representative Alvin Morell Bentley of Michigan. [...] Javits said [...] "Taras Shevchenko was a bard of freedom...It <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> that the statue of such a national hero, who taught the American ideals of patriotism and service to man, should stand {{in the capital of}} the U.S." [...] and Bentley stated, [...] "In erecting a statue of Taras Shevchenko in Washington the United States will give full expression to its understanding and appreciation of Taras Shevchenko and all that he means to the brave and noble Ukrainian people." ...|$|E
500|$|According to critic Martha P. Nochimson, {{the film}} is an {{exploration}} of the place of anonymous breakdowns of social order in personal life. For the most part, questions of justice operate in the background of The Man From London, which foregrounds the perceptions and point of view of an accidental witness to the murder, who, like the viewer, has no connection with anyone involved. The film principally concerns the texture of the world of the protagonist Maloin as he experiences it ﬁrst hand: fog, light, shadow, skin, walls, ﬂoors, windows, sounds. These are much closer to Maloin than any broken laws involving strangers as in the killing at the dock. As distinct from the trope of crime functioning as a break from the boredom of the mundane for the Hitchcockian ordinary man [...] "excitingly" [...] caught up in it, the interjection of crime {{in the lives of the}} characters of The Man from London is a phantom occurrence for those burrowed into the center of the mundane details of their lives. In other words, Tarr's ﬁlm suggests the possibility that it is only on an abstract plane that murder committed by and on strangers causes a stir and demands an investigation. In this context, it <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> that the investigation must be undertaken by a stranger, the man from London, since abstraction entails distancing from an enveloping context. Only the appearance of the man from London, Brown, impels Maloin to struggle with his de facto alienation, as an ordinary man, from moral principle, an alienation linked, counterintuitively, to the absence of desire in his daily grind.|$|E

500|$|The battle {{system in}} Medieval: Total War was {{considered}} by many reviewers to be {{the highlight of the}} game. In their review, Eurogamer felt [...] "The sensation of scale and drama in these conflicts is incredible", praising the visual effects and combat. The different battlefields and their environments were praised by IGN, with ActionTrip agreeing that [...] "Medieval: Total War looks better than Shogun", adding that the terrain and units are more detailed than those in Shogun: Total War. GameSpot praised the realistic battles, mentioning that the real-world battlefield considerations like fatigue, ammunition, facing, and morale included in the game was a [...] "welcome change". GameSpy also stated the [...] "chaotic" [...] battles were appropriate to the era, but criticised the siege aspect, claiming it to be [...] "too plain and underwhelming", with a lack of detail compared to the other 3D elements. The soundtrack to the game was well received by IGN, [...] "The soundtrack is full of rousing context-sensitive orchestra moments which get you in the mood for bloody slaughter" [...] commenting it <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> for a game that [...] "delivers body counts like no other" [...] ActionTrip also admired how the game's music changed pace as the battle commenced, praising The Creative Assembly for its [...] "masterfully placed audio and visual effects". The artificial intelligence for Medieval: Total War was thought to be much improved over its predecessor, CGW mentioning the AI was intelligent enough to prevent brute force alone from winning fights. Criticism was received on the larger battles giving low frame rates and performance, while ActionTrip also noted several unit management issues with path-finding and unit facing, stating [...] "it's demoralising to see archers facing the wrong way".|$|E
