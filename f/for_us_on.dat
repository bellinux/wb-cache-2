25|$|Look, if I have a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind {{and two others}} just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him {{he can see the}} whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.|$|E
25|$|Some 200 {{yards in}} advance of our position, which we were holding at a terrible cost, was a fence built high and strong. The troops in advance had tried to scale the fence and reform under that hell of fire. They were {{actually}} torn in shreds and wedged into the fence. The cry came to us for volunteers to pull down the fence. Instantly there sprang from the long line, fast being shortened as the ranks closed up over the dead, seventy-six volunteers. We ran straight for the fence amid a hail of iron and lead, the dead falling all about us, but to reach the fence was our only thought. A part of the force reached it, and, as one would grasp a rail it would be sent flying {{out of his hands}} by rifle-shots. The fence leveled, we made the attempt to return, and it was as hot <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> the retreat, as it had been on the advance. Few escaped death or wounds. I had almost regained my regiment, when I was hit. The line then successfully pressed on, and the 'Sunken Road,' or ' Bloody Lane,' as it is now known, was within our lines.|$|E
500|$|For the album, {{the band}} {{wanted to create}} the {{atmosphere}} of hyperactivity they knew [...] their fans wanted. They wrote a few songs, but felt the songs [...] "weren't strong enough" [...] {{and sent them to}} other musicians. Shay Haley, a member of the band, explained that in their new work, the band wanted to add energy to the emotional appeal of their past albums, though the band did not conceive a clear plan for the direction of the new album. N.E.R.D described the desired outcomes of [...] the album as [...] "a pre-cognitive effort to make music that would make sense <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> while we're on a stage and to recapture that feeling we love so much" [...] and additionally, [...] "to make something that was thought provoking and for people to listen to it and enjoy it on their own time".|$|E

500|$|On July 27, the Japanese {{government}} considered how {{to respond}} to the Declaration. The four military members of the Big Six wanted to reject it, but Tōgō persuaded the cabinet not to do so until he could get a reaction from the Soviets. In a telegram, Shun'ichi Kase, Japan's ambassador to Switzerland, observed that [...] "unconditional surrender" [...] applied only to the military and not to the government or the people, and he pleaded that it should be understood that the careful language of Potsdam appeared [...] "to have occasioned a great deal of thought" [...] {{on the part of the}} signatory governments—"they seem to have taken pains to save face <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> various points." [...] The next day, Japanese newspapers reported that the Declaration, the text of which had been broadcast and dropped by leaflet into Japan, had been rejected. In an attempt to manage public perception, Prime Minister Suzuki met with the press, and stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, {{how would you like to}} pull pints <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it just went on and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E

In the liner notes to the 1996 reissue of Spirit's self-titled debut album, California wrote: [...] "People always ask me why [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] sounds exactly like [...] "Taurus", which was released two years earlier. I know Led Zeppelin also played [...] "Fresh Garbage" [...] in their live set. They opened up <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> their first American tour." ...|$|E

2500|$|Developers updated their {{engine to}} allow for 150 units {{to be on the}} {{battlefield}} at one time. The game is powered by an upgraded version of Pandemic Studios' Zero engine, and was developed by the same team that worked on the first two [...] installments. Conquest director Eric Gewirtz said the team was [...] "throwing around these ideas, and in perfect serendipity, happened to get access to the Lord of the Rings license, and that was just the center <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> making this game." [...] Howard Shore's music, composed for the film trilogy, was used in the game. The film actors reprise their roles in cutscenes, which are archived footage from the film. In-game likenesses are based on their film counterparts. Hugo Weaving reprises his role as Elrond and serves as the game's narrator. All other cast members were replaced by voice doubles. Chris Edgerly voices Aragorn, Crispin Freeman voices Legolas, Martin Jarvis voices the white wizard Gandalf, and Yuri Lowenthal stands in for Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{perceptions}} on who Mohamed Bouazizi was. After his self-immolation, Bouazizi’s image flooded social media {{which lead to}} worldwide discourse. This complicated how Bouazizi was seen, [...] "Mohamed Bouazizi is not our hero. He's your hero," [...] said local Tunisian Arabic Nader Ncibi. There are accusations that social media diluted what Bouazizi stood for. Naafil Harshani, an activist that grew up with Bouazizi, said, [...] "what was important to Mohamed was putting {{food on the table}} and football. He {{had nothing to do with}} politics and wanted nothing to do with politics." [...] Mohamed Bouazizi did not plan to start a revolution, but it is undeniable that it preceded his anger towards not being able to sell his fruit. [...] "There are many stories on who Mohamed was and who Mohamed wasn't," [...] said Zahra Shwabli, a Hay Al Noor primary school teacher, [...] "It is important <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> this day to remember what Mohamed Bouazizi stood for: the dignity of all Tunisians.

You can interpret it how you like." [...] Jessica stated: It {{would have been so}} easy to have made a record just like the first, with unison voices on the verse and chorus. It worked <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> the first record; it became a trademark sound. Not degrading it, we loved it, but at some point you have to grow as an artist or you get stuck. According to Lisa: We made that record [...] two years ago. It would be so dated to do it again. I feel we're staying current but staying ourselves. It was a natural progression. We wanted a challenge, to take it somewhere new. People had become used to our sound. Other artists released that sound using songs we'd written. We get asked, [...] "Did you get pushed into this sound?" [...] We were doing the pushing! ...|$|E
