5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} that Tabak had {{then tried to}} conceal the crime by disposing of her body. The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak. Samples found behind the knees of <b>her</b> <b>jeans</b> indicated {{she may have been}} held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered. The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.|$|E

In 1976, Indian designer Mohan Murjani's Murjani Corporation, proposed launching a line of designer jeans carrying Vanderbilt's signature embroidered on the back pocket, {{as well as her}} swan logo. <b>Her</b> <b>jeans</b> were more tightly fitted than other jeans of that time. The logo eventually appeared on dresses and perfumes, while Vanderbilt also launched a line of blouses, sheets, shoes, leather goods, liqueurs, and accessories. Vanderbilt {{was one of the first}} designers to make public appearances, which was a difficult thing for her because of her shyness.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} a young woman were found frozen in a creek by hunters on November 23, 2008, in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, near an {{abandoned}} farm. To extract the body, investigators were forced to chisel away the ice and scuba divers searched the bottom for evidence. Some articles of clothing were found, including a black and pink top with a pink bow, originating from Family Dollar, distributed in the spring of 2008. The underclothing that she wore, also from Family Dollar, was shipped only between July 1 and July 15, 2008. <b>Her</b> <b>jeans</b> were that of the Angels brand and the bottom of the legs had been rolled up, somewhat, and an elastic ponytail holder was found on her wrist. No socks or shoes were found at the scene. Initially, no jewelry was found, until a penny-sized St. Benedict medal was found by divers, but it may not have belonged to her, as examiners could not be certain how long {{it had been in the}} water. However, some reports claim that a bracelet containing several pendants was also found on the girl's remains. The hair was a shoulder-length light brown, possibly having hair highlights due to having some different shades. The clothing had caused some issues with investigators, as many of the different articles were in various sizes.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} [...] "Phases and Stages/Washing the Dishes", {{with the woman}} tired of caring for her unfaithful husband, {{emphasizing}} her domestic chores. This is followed by [...] "Phases and Stages/Walkin'" [...] where, after consideration, she leaves her husband at night, saying [...] "Walkin' is better than runnin' away, and crawlin' ain't no good at all". In [...] "Pretend I Never Happened", she advises him to forget her and continue with his life. In [...] "Sister's Coming Home/Down at the Corner Beer Joint", her [...] younger sister describes the woman moving back home and sleeping late. Eventually, she overcomes her grief and begins a social life at the corner beer joint, representing her liberation with the lyrics [...] "(she's) dancin' on a hardwood floor, <b>her</b> <b>jeans</b> fit a little bit tighter than they did before". The final song of side one depicts the woman falling in love again but reluctant to admit it because she fears that her story will be repeated.|$|E
500|$|Because Jones's costume {{does not}} evolve much {{throughout}} the season, Maslansky used flashbacks {{to show how}} her costume had evolved to the present day: for 'pre-Kilgrave' Jessica Jones, Maslansky gave the character [...] "more pulled together" [...] clothes, albeit [...] "still kind of edgy" [...] clothes that did not change who she was as a character, but were just [...] "different". For instance, in a flashback to Jones working in a corporate environment, she does not wear a suit, instead [...] "wear <b>her</b> <b>jeans</b> and find a really cool jacket, maybe a vintage thing, maybe something that she borrowed from Trish". For a flashback where Jones wears a large sandwich costume, a [...] "variety" [...] of costumes were ordered online, with the chosen suit then distressed to [...] "look dirty and old"; [...] "a mere shadow of its former sandwich self," [...] becoming [...] "more of a hoagie than a sandwich." [...] In another flashback, Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave's control. The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character's real situation, with Maslansky calling it [...] "so beautiful and so free and so light".|$|E

2500|$|Liz has {{a rather}} satirical sense of humor. She has {{frequently}} {{been shown to}} be a stress eater, a trait she shares with Jack. Despite the fact that she often ingests high-amounts of junk food on a daily basis, she seems to keep her weight under control, perhaps because she {{does not seem to have}} proper meals.

2500|$|In Rome in 1992, a 45-year-old driving {{instructor}} {{was accused of}} rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told {{her that if she}} was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily have had to help her attacker remove <b>her</b> <b>jeans,</b> thus making the act consensual ("because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex"). [...] The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision “it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.” This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read “Jeans: An Alibi for Rape.” As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made Denim Day an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on this day has become an international symbol of protest. As of 2008 the Italian Supreme Court has overturned their findings, and {{there is no longer a}} [...] "denim" [...] defense to the charge of rape.|$|E

Participants who saw Laura wearing the bikini attributed significantly more blame to her for the assault than participants who saw <b>her</b> wearing <b>jeans</b> and a top.

"Who We Are" [...] was {{inspired}} by Jessica's travels around the world along with Ken Paves and Cacee Cob to discover what beauty is and means to other cultures while filming [...] "Jessica Simpson's The Price of Beauty". The concept of the song and show came from the controversy that was caused in January 2009, when Simpson was on her country tour and performed at a chili cook-off. This led to global media scrutiny about her weight gain and choice of clothing, branding her 'fat' and <b>her</b> 'mom <b>jeans</b> hideous'. Although Simpson didn't publicly speak about the criticism at the time, she felt that doing the show was her way of speaking out. The song is about Jessica's new perception about beauty and self-esteem.|$|R
