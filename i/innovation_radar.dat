Thus, a procedure called Sector Innovation Characteristic (SIC) and Sector Innovation Degree (SID) search in this study to establish a process to compare the innovation degree. The SIC allows normalizing the different dimensions of the <b>innovation</b> <b>radar</b> from specific sector for comparison effect between them.

In the context of micro and small enterprises (MSEs), this practice has been supported by the Brazilian Service of Support for Micro and Small Enterprises (Sebrae) through Local Innovation Agents (ALI) program, which aims to strengthen the practice of innovation by identifying opportunities to innovate. The main tool used in this work is the <b>Innovation</b> <b>Radar,</b> which is based on the original work of Sawhney, Wolcott and Arroniz (2006). This study aimed to achieve two main objectives: i) to analyze how MSEs can use the radar as a tool for building strategies for innovation; ii) comparatively analyze the sectors participating in the sample with regard {{to the extent to which}} innovation occurs and the importance of innovation for each sector analyzed. The study sample was composed of 1139 micro and small businesses that joined the ALI program in 2012, in the State of Paraná. The data were analyzed by statistical tests such as the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney and others. The results showed that the MSEs, innovate through similar dimensions of the Radar, even if they belong to different sectors. However, the difference between the sectors is analyzed in innovation intensity, which was more robust in the software sector and weaker in the furniture sector. It was also found that many dimensions of <b>innovation</b> <b>Radar</b> were little explored, which shows great potential for gaining competitive advantage...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Currently, in Brazil, the {{clothing}} industry {{is experiencing a}} rise in the offer of employment and in capacity utilization. But the low levels of investment in innovation and training to qualify and retain the workforce worry large- scale retailers and threaten their ability to meet growing demand, thus penalizing consumers. In addition, the increase in imports of raw materials and finished products with extremely competitive prices puts this sector in a crisis situation, given that most companies in this sector are small businesses (SBs). Thus, there is discussion on what characteristics would allow an improved competitive capacity in view of foreign competitors and of the entry of imported products in the domestic market. A study was led consisting of a survey that took a sample of 50 SMs located in the same geographic region.

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} a monostatic pulse-Doppler radar transceiver trying to detect targets sparsely populated in the radar’s unambiguous time-frequency region. Several past works employ compressed sensing (CS) algorithms {{to this type of}} problem but either do not address sample rate reduction, impose constraints on the radar transmitter, propose CS recovery methods with prohibitive dictionary size, or per-form poorly in noisy conditions. Here, we describe a sub-Nyquist sampling and recovery approach called Doppler focusing, which addresses all of these problems: it performs low rate sampling and digital processing, imposes no restrictions on the transmitter, and uses a CS dictionary with size, which does not increase with increasing number of pulses. Furthermore, in the presence of noise, Doppler focusing enjoys a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement, which scales linearly with, obtaining good detec-tion performance even at SNR as low as 25 dB. The recovery is based on the Xampling framework, which allows reduction of the number of samples needed to accurately represent the signal, directly in the analog-to-digital conversion process. After sampling, the entire digital recovery process is performed on the low rate samples without having to return to the Nyquist rate. Finally, our approach can be implemented in hardware using a previously suggested Xampling radar prototype.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a new policy}} tool to support innovation management and increase the innovation impact of research and innovation programs. With nearly 80 billion Euros {{over a period of}} 7 years (2014 - 2020), Horizon 2020 is the largest ever publicly funded research and innovation program in the European Union. Cutting-edge technologies are being developed within the program and a significant part of these technologies could be commercialized. But not all technologies and innovation with commercial potential actual reach the market. The questions are why, and what additional actions are needed {{on the part of the}} policy makers to address this problem? To this effect the European Commission developed and successfully tested an "Innovation Radar" in the part of the program that focuses on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and their applications. The <b>Innovation</b> <b>Radar</b> focuses on the identification of high-potential innovations and the key organizations developing these innovations in the program. Our paper presents the <b>Innovation</b> <b>Radar</b> (IR) methodology which was developed by our team jointly with the team from European Commission's Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content & Technology that manages the ICT part of Horizon 2020. The paper then presents the results of its pilot application. Approach and Data. The IR methodology is based on assessment of innovation and new technology ventures. The IR uses two composite indicators aiming at capturing the heterogeneity in innovation activities and innovators across projects. First, the "Innovation Potential Indicator" provides a holistic view of the innovation potential of projects. Second, the "Innovator Capacity Indicator" is capturing the innovator's capacity in conducting innovation activities. Each of these two indicators includes several sub-indicators. The IR characterizes innovations with respect to their technical readiness, innovation management and market potential. For innovators -usually researchers- it delivers information on their ability to innovate and their environment. We applied the OECD/JRC methodology to construct composite indicators. The data used in the paper was collected via a structured questionnaire during the IR pilot phase from May 2014 to January 2015 on the occasion of annual projects reviews conducted by external experts (projects typically run for 3 years). Results overview. Out of the 2600 projects running at the time, the IR scanned 280 projects. Over 500 innovations with market potential were identified, or on average nearly two new or substantially improved products or services within each project. The IR pilot phase provided in particular evidence that while innovators demonstrate high levels of technological expertise, they usually pay less attention to the business-related dimensions. The most common needs expressed by innovators are partnerships with other companies, business plan development and expanding to more markets. They less frequently mention needs for incubation, investment training, or participation in accelerators. More than 40 % of the innovators mention lack of financing as a major external bottleneck to innovation exploitation, although interestingly only 5 % have sought or are planning to seek private or public funding. Regulation issues and IPRs are also considered as important bottlenecks. Impact of the IR covers 3 main dimensions. It can: 1. 	Provide structured and quantified intelligence on innovations and innovators in publicly funded projects and use this intelligence to design customized support to those projects and organizations 2. 	Create bridges between innovative organizations/projects and external stakeholders such as venture capitalists 3. 	Provide feedback on the effectiveness of the program in funding innovation, thereby enabling the policy makers to improve its impact. Having completed the IR pilot phase and analyzed the collected information, it can be concluded that, for the first time, policy makers and project participants can obtain up-to-date structured information on the innovative output of the projects, and that the IR demonstrated its real potential as a policy tool to support innovation management.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1950 s, {{the threat of}} manned bombers {{carrying}} nuclear weapons across the arctic region was of paramount concern in continental defense. The 1952 Summer Study at MIT recommended {{the development of an}} earlywarning radar line across the northern reaches of Alaska and Canada, from Cape Lisburne on the northwest corner of Alaska to Cape Dyer on Baffin Island on the east coast of Canada. It was an ambitious undertaking, particularly since the radar system had not yet been developed or designed and a new detection process had yet to be invented. Among other <b>innovations</b> the <b>radar</b> net was proposed to use automatic-detection techniques to reduce drastically the heavy manpower requirements and unacceptable time delays characteristic of manual radar operations of the period. After the U. S. Air Force accepted the Summer Study recommendation in December 1952, Lincoln Laboratory was contracted to deliver ten radar sets by 30 April 1953, a period of less than five months. F. Robert Naka was assigned the task of developing the automated radar signal processing and alarm system. The article reviews the primary author’s experiences with this challenging radar project. While the technical problems sound primitive in view of today’s radar capabilities, they were met and solved at a pace that was easily ten times faster than today’s Department of Defense developments. In 1951 the u. s. air force sponsored Project Charles, a study chaired by F. Wheeler Loomis that examined the ability of the Soviet Union to attack the United States with nuclear weapons carried by manned bombers [1]. The study noted the inadequacy of the evolving air-defense network to meet this threat and urged immediate attention to the problem. The 1952 Summer Study group, chaired by MIT’s Jerrold R. Zacharias, recommended that a network of surveillance radars be deployed north of the 70 th parallel from Alaska across the northern reaches of Canada to Newfoundland [2]. This system, the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, was proposed as a critical component of defense against manned bombers attacking across the arctic circle, by providing early detection and warning to a central point in th...|$|R
