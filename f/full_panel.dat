2500|$|Melville and his {{supporters}} enjoyed some temporary successes—most notably in the Golden Act of 1592, which gave parliamentary approval to Presbyterian courts. James VI, who succeeded to the English throne in 1603 as James I, believed that Presbyterianism was incompatible with monarchy, declaring [...] "No bishop, no king" [...] and by skillful manipulation of both church and state, steadily reintroduced parliamentary and then diocesan episcopacy.

2500|$|Less {{than two}} weeks before the {{proposed}} move date, NUCC requested that Woodinville once again provide the public park property for use by TC4 for a period of 60 days. If the city was unwilling, the church publicly announced a plan to relocate on church property for 90 days without further permit procedures. The city council declined to make the park available and informed the church that it would face a full legal response and code enforcement effort if it went ahead with the move. [...] Despite these warnings, NUCC allowed TC4 to relocate to church property on May 13. The city filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order with King County Superior Court on May 12, which was denied by Judge Palmer Robinson after reviewing the city's briefing and hearing oral argument. Instead the judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the city from taking code enforcement action until a May 24 hearing, thus allowing TC4 to move onto church property, subject to certain conditions. [...] Woodinville filed for injunctive relief, breach of contract, and collection of damages with the King County Superior Court. [...] On May 30, Judge Charles Mertel ordered the sides to mediation to be conducted daily while the case was being heard. [...] This mediation failed to result in a settlement. The city also sought financial restitution for private and public security costs. On June 9, Judge Mertel ruled the encampment and church were in violation of their 2004 agreement with the city and ordered the encampment to vacate the site by midnight June 17. On June 13, NUCC and SHARE/WHEEL filed an appeal with the state Court of Appeals arguing that the city's land use code is an unconstitutional infringement upon the church's religious expression, that the church did not violate the 2004 agreement between the church and city, and that the church was denied its constitutional right to a trial by jury. [...] On June 16 the Washington State Court of Appeals issued a stay of the trial court's decision pending the resolution of the appeal. The City appealed the stay, but the stay was affirmed by a <b>full</b> <b>panel</b> of appellate judges. [...] The City's request for attorney fees was subsequently denied by Judge Mertel. Additionally, a Northeast District Judge in Redmond dismissed 28 misdemeanor citations from the city against a SHARE/WHEEL employee by ruling that the city was [...] "without authority" [...] to issue the citations. On February 26, 2007, Judge David Steiner ordered Woodinville to pay the $8,388 in attorneys' fees needed to defend the SHARE employee.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} industry generates {{a substantial amount}} of solid waste. Cutting building materials into smaller pieces to fit the design is one of the sources of waste in new construction. This type of waste is known as leftover or residual. Drywall leftover is an example of such waste. Currently, contractors do not perform a detailed analysis of how many drywall panels would be required. Moreover, they do not use a consistent system for reusing their scrap and often cut a needed piece from a brand new panel instead of using available scrap. Building Information Model (BIM), as an object-oriented representation of the building contains all the required data and can be utilized to provide drywall crews with layouts indicating how to cut the panels into the required pieces so the leftover could be reduced. Also, some commercially available software applications, such as Autodesk Revit provide a platform to automate processes such as optimization by implementing algorithms through their Application Programming Interface (API). Similar problems have been studied in other fields and industries. Bin packing problem in mathematics and Nesting process in the cutting industry are examples of such research. As the result, automated optimization methods that utilize Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are introduced to address these problems. There is an opportunity to apply Evolutionary Algorithms to solve a similar problem in the {{construction industry}}. This study investigates if it is feasible to implement EA-based optimization methods on a BIM platform to develop an automated optimization tool. In light of available tools and methods, an automated optimization tool is developed as a Revit add-in. It extracts geometrical data from BIM and receives dimensions of available drywall panel(s) from the user. The algorithm, finds the most desirable arrangement of panels and the number of <b>full</b> <b>panels</b> is calculated. The outline of smaller pieces that need to be cut out of <b>full</b> <b>panels</b> are also determined. Then by utilizing an EA-based optimization method, it generates the cutting layouts. The add-in is tested on a certain number of simple models for several iterations and the generated cutting layouts show very optimal leftover. On a very specific model containing twenty pieces that need to be cut out of <b>full</b> <b>panels,</b> the add-in application spent 100 minutes to generate the cutting layouts, which resulted in 36 % reduction in the leftover, compared to the layouts generated in the initial iterations. The test proved that the proposed algorithm is able to optimize cutting layouts. It demonstrates that utilizing such optimization algorithm on a BIM platform could be considered as an effective way to reduce the material waste...|$|R
