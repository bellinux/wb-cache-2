50|$|In 1997, the {{official}} standards were revised {{to restrict the}} Select grade to A maturity carcasses, and to raise the minimum marbling score to qualify for Choice to modest for B maturity cattle. These changes were implemented to improve the uniformity and consistency of the grading system.Yield grades are intended to estimate the pounds of boneless closely trimmed retail cuts from the carcass. Closely trimmed refers to approximately ¼ inch of <b>external</b> <b>fat.</b> Yield grade is determined by considering 4 carcass characteristics: <b>external</b> <b>fat,</b> Kidney, pelvic and heart fat (KPH), Ribeye area (REA), and Hot carcass weight (HCW). The amount of <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> is measured at the ribbed surface between the 12th and 13th ribs.

An untrained consumer panel assessed meat appearance, aroma, tenderness, juiciness, taste and overall liking. Results showed no compositional alterations (P > 0. 05) to omega- 3 fatty acids due to cooking treatment, whereas on absolute terms (mg/ 100 g muscle) omega- 3 fatty acids significantly (P < 0. 05) increased.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Twenty beef carcass sides varying in USDA quality and yield grades ere selected from commercial packing plants to study the physical and chemical composition of beef retail cuts. Thirteen cuts (in sets of four) were fabricated and assigned to one of four treatments: (1) 0. 3 cm <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> trim, raw; (2) 0. 0 cm <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> trim, cooked; (3) 0. 3 cm <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> trim, cooked; and (4) 0. 6 cm <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> trim, cooked. Retail cuts assigned to the cooked treatment were either braised, broiled, or roasted. Both the cooked and raw cuts were dissected into separable lean, <b>external</b> <b>fat,</b> seam fat, and waste (heavy connective tissue and bone). Chemical analyses were conducted on the separable lean to determine fat, moisture, protein, and ash content. In addition, cooking yields and fat retention were calculated using raw versus cooked data. Dissection data suggested that percentage separable lean increased as cuts were trimmed of <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> cover. Choice retail cuts had a higher percentage of seam fat than Select retail cuts. Arm roasts proved to yield the lowest percentage of separable lean, as well as the most seam fat and waste, even if all the <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> was removed before cooking. Trimming cuts of <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> before cooking had few significant (P < 0. 05) effects on chemical fat, moisture, protein, or ash content within a cut. The eye of round roasts showed a difference (P < 0. 05) between the 0. 0 cm and 0. 6 cm treatments for fat content. As anticipated, retail cuts from the Choice quality grade had higher chemical fat contents than Select cuts. Few significant differences were found for cooking yields and fat retention as influenced by USDA quality grade or trim level. Retail cuts that were braised had numerically lower cooking yields and percentage moisture than cuts that were roasted or broiled regardless of quality grade or trim level. This study was designed to sample retail cuts with <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> trim levels found in the retail case today and to replace existing data that may be outdated.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to update the existing nutritional data available in the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference by providing revised nutritional information on the round and loin cuts evaluated in Phase III of the Nutrient Database Improvement Project. A total of 20 carcasses were selected from three packing plants across the United States, and round and loin subprimals from these carcasses were collected and transported to Texas A&M University. These subprimals were fabricated 14 to 21 d postmortem, dissected either raw or cooked, and divided to determine the amount of separable lean, separable fat, and refuse amounts per cut. Separable lean from these cuts was homogenized and proximate analyses were conducted in order to determine percent total chemical fat, protein, moisture, and ash. Cooking yields and fat retention values were determined for the cuts that were grilled and roasted. Cuts with <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> had higher cooking yields than cuts with <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> removed. Cuts with <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> had higher fat retention values than the cuts with no <b>external</b> <b>fat.</b> Dissection data indicated that cuts trimmed to lower levels of <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> had the highest values for percent lean and the lowest values for percent seam and <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> and bone-in cuts had the lowest values for percent lean and the highest values for percent refuse. Proximate analyses indicated a decrease in percent moisture as the percentage of total chemical fat increased. Also, round cuts evaluated in the study contained a lower percentage of total chemical fat than loin cuts on a raw basis. When total chemical fat was stratified by USDA quality grade, it was evident that there was a clear separation between upper Choice, lower Choice, and Select cuts.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence {{that most of}} the fear expressed by consumers in terms of the link between cholesterol in the diet and heart disease is, amongst others, related to the amount of fat in red meat and dairy produce.

A major challenge ahead of the beef industry is to supply a product that complies with the demands of more sophisticated and health conscious consumers. But, even if the beef industry could respond positively to consumers ’ needs, it is uncertain whether consumers would pay more for beef containing less fat. In this paper the willingness of consumers to pay for less fat in selected beef cuts (T-bone and rump) was investigated with a log-linear hedonic price model.

The main contribution of Mobiflage lies in its first incorporation of hidden volumes technique to the Android devices. It works as follows: First, it fills the external storage with random data. Second, it creates two volumes, a public volume for storing public non-sensitive data, applications and settings, and a hidden volume for storing sensitive data. Correspondingly, there are two operation modes, a public mode and a PDE mode. The public mode is used to manage the public volume for daily use, providing storage encryption without deniability. In this mode, the data are encrypted with a decoy key, which is derived from a decoy password. The user will be asked to provide the decoy password during the booting in order to enter the public mode. The PDE mode is used to manage the hidden volume which stores sensitive data whose existence needs to be denied when being coerced. In this mode, the data are encrypted with a true key, which is derived from a true password. The user should provide the true password during system boot to activate the PDE mode. The exact location of the hidden volume is derived from the true password.|$|R

Feeder lambs (n= 90) were selected from three breed types (Commercial Finewool, Suffolk X Commercial Finewool first cross (Fl cross) and Suffolk) to represent the current market supply in Texas. Three wethers and three ewes from each breed type were assigned randomly to one of five yield grade treatment groups (n= 18), devised to simulate the fat thickness ranges designated by the USDA yield grade equation. The lambs were evaluated periodically and visually appraised by a team of three experienced livestock evaluators. They were slaughtered at staggered intervals, according to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, when the evaluators had determined that an individual lamb had reached its assigned fat thickness. Before slaughter, certain linear measurements were obtained for each lamb, and live weights were recorded. All carcasses were evaluated for USDA quality and yield grade characteristics by trained carcass evaluators at 48 h postmortem. Additional carcass measurements and characteristics were recorded. Carcasses were fabricated into a rough leg, rough loin, rough rack, rough shoulder, neck, right and left breasts, right and left plates. Kidney and pelvic fat (KP) was removed from the rough leg and rough loin following breaking. The rough primals were then split into left and right sides, and the leg, loin, rack, and shoulder from {{the left side of the}} carcass were fabricated into closely trimmed retail cuts, lean trim, bone, and <b>fat</b> (<b>external,</b> seam, and internal).

A 100 - X 3 -m beach seine was used to sample four beach study areas from July 1977 through December 1978, and a 222 -m lampara net was used to sample two channel study areas from March 1978 through October 1978. Approximately 2. 2 million hatchery salmon were released into Yaquina Bay in 1977, and 9. 6 million were released in 1978. Tags, fin clips, dye marks, scales, species, release date, <b>external</b> parasites, visceral <b>fat,</b> size, and fin erosion {{were used to determine}} hatchery or wild origin of individual salmonids in the catch. Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), chum (0. keta), and coho (0. kisutch) salmon, in decreasing order, were the most abundant wild salmonid species, and coho salmon were the most abundant hatchery species. In 1978 wild populations of chum and coho salmon were present in the estuary for 2 - 3 mo (March-June), and wild Chinook were present during 9 mo (January, April-November). Increase in mean length of wild chum and Chinook, and decrease in mean length of wild coho, indicated that wild chum and Chinook utilized the estuary as a rearing area, and wild coho did not. Lack of overlap in peak migration periods of wild chum (early April), coho (mid May), and chinook (late July-early August) suggests the need to minimize overlap in utilization of the estuary by hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids. The length of residence of hatchery coho in Yaquina Bay was described by the equation: N=N 0 e-kt. The "residency half-life" (E® 2) ranged from 1. 7 to 9. 0 days for different No release groups of hatchery coho in 1977 and 1978. Juvenile hatchery coho that remained for an extended period (1 - 3 mo) in Yaquina Bay during 1977 increased in mean length from 11. 5 cm FL in mid July to 21. 0 cm FL in October. Some individuals within summer release groups of hatchery chinook also remained in the estuary for extended periods (> 2 mo) a Groups of juvenile hatchery coho and chinook released into Yaquina Bay earlier in the year (June-August) remained in the estuary for longer periods than groups released later in the year (September-October), Overlap in food habits of hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids in the estuary was C ften high, although overlap was found to vary with species, time, habitat, space, length of estuarine residence, and prey abundance. In terms of biomass, larval and juvenile fish (Clupeidae, Engraulidae, and Osmeridae) were the most important prey organisms of hatchery and wild coho and chinook salmon in Yaquina Bay. Approximately 58 fish species were captured at the study areas in 1977 and 1978, and 17 were identified in the stomach contents of hatchery and wild salmonids. Overlap in spatial and temporal utilization and in food habits of hatchery and wild juvenile salmon in the estuary indicates that the potential for competition between these groups does exist, should space or food resources become a limiting factor. To reduce overlap in spatial and temporal utilization, consideration should be given to not releasing hatchery salmon during peak migration periods of wild chum, coho, and chinook salmon. To reduce length of residence of hatchery coho and chinook released after May, mid to late summer releases should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Since current Australian {{nutrient}} {{composition data}} for lamb and beef {{were collected in}} the early 80 s and 90 s respectively, production and butchering practices have changed in response to consumer demand for lean meat. Beef and lamb nutrient composition data are required for different levels of fat trim since {{there is a wide}} variation in the amount of separable fat in retail beef and lamb cuts (1) (2). <b>External</b> <b>fat</b> width (mm) can provide a visual guide for use in food composition tables (2). To obtain updated nutrient data on Australian red meat for the Australian Food Composition database, 15 beef, 11 lamb, four veal and two mutton cuts, representing the most popular red meat cuts, were sampled and analysed in July and August 2002. Two purchases (approximately 500 g) of each of the cuts were purchased at 10 different retail outlets, including supermarkets and butchers, in different socioeconomic areas of Sydney and Melbourne. One representative portion from the first purchase was selected for <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> measurement (mm). The whole purchase was designated for gross composition and chemical analysis of the raw sample. The second purchase was cooked and then used for gross composition and chemical analyses. All meat cuts were cooked as purchased, with separable fat intact, using low fat cooking methods (without addition of fat or oil). The table below summarises key features of the new data, compared to previous published Australian data. Preliminary analysis of the results shows that mutton has a similar nutritional profile to lamb and that the fatty acid composition of internal and external beef fat is similar. Iron and zinc levels for beef and lamb appear to be comparable to those reported in previous nutrient composition data. Accurate nutrient composition data are essential for assessing dietar...|$|E
40|$|Lambs sired by Hampshire rams {{and from}} western ewes were {{individually}} slaughtered {{as they reached}} 96 lbs. live weight. Quality and quantity factors were evaluated after carcasses were chilled 48 hours. Carcasses were broken into wholesale cuts and weights obtained. The leg and loin were trimmed of <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> in excess of 3 / 8 inch and trimmed weights were taken. Ewe lambs dressed heavier carcasses and a higher dressing %,' but the extra carcass weight was due to higher finish. Wether and ewe lamb carcasses showed higher conformation scores and higher U. S. D. A. grades, apparently due to more fat. Fat and lean from ram carcasses was noticeably less firm than from wethers and ewes. Lowest rib eye marbling scores were noted in ram carcasses, highest scores in ewe carcasses, with intermediate values in wethers...|$|E
40|$|The Iowa State University Department of Animal Science has {{scanned the}} Iowa Cattlemen’s Association (ICA) {{centrally}} tested bulls {{for the past}} six years. As the beef industry moves to value-based marketing, more emphasis will be placed on carcass yield and quality traits in genetic selection decisions. Databases must be designed that will allow the beef industry to develop appropriate adjustment factors for the raw measurements. The ribeye area (REA) and percentage-fat measurements are adjusted to 365 days using a linear age-adjustment formula. The formulas are breed-specific and determined from the ICA bull-scanning database. <b>External</b> <b>fat</b> thickness is not adjusted. The common endpoint allows for a more direct comparison of the bulls. Sufficient realtime ultrasound data taken on the ICA test bulls exist to develop linear age-adjustment factors for at least three breeds: Angus, Charolais, and Simmental...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of growth rate on some beef performance characteristics in Czech Fleckvieh heifers. Growth performance characteristics included age at slaughter (months) and daily weight gain (g). The observed beef performance characteristics were carcass weight, conformation class (SEUROP) and <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> deposition. The experimental group consisted of 480 heifers. The animals were assigned into three groups (A, B, C) based on age at slaughter. Group A consisted of 68 animals with the age at slaughter 15 – 21 months, group B 296 animals, age 22 – 28 months and group C 116 animals, age 29 – 35 months. A greater age at slaughter was significantly associated with a greater carcass weight which grew from 250. 78 [*]kg in group A to 317. 69 [*]kg in group C. The net weight gain decreased with age from 424. 06 [*]g in group A to 346. 41 [*]g in group C, the conformation improved from 4. 46 in group A to 4. 17 in group C and the <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> deposition increased from 2. 5 in group A to 2. 78 in group C. The dataset was again split into three groups differing in the daily weight gain (I, II, III). Group I consisted of 120 heifers with the daily gain up to 599 [*]g, group II 303 animals with the daily gain of 600 – 799 [*]g and group III only 57 animals with the gain of 800 [*]g and more. A growing weight gain was significantly associated with a greater carcass weight (from 260. 40 [*]kg in group I to 338. 66 in group III), a greater net weight gain (from 306. 29 [*]g in group I to 491. 45 [*]g in group III), improved conformation (from 4. 75 in group I to 3. 70 in group III) and the fat deposition was greater, too (from 2. 35 in group I to 2. 89 in group III) ...|$|E
40|$|The Agricultural Marketing Service {{proposed}} a revision to the yield grade standards {{to provide the}} industry with an option regarding the retention or removal of kidney and pelvic fat (KPF) depending on market requirements. The proposal was subsequently withdrawn. The present yield grades are determined by consideration of <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> thickness, hot carcass wt, ribeye area, and estimated percent KPF. The proposed revision would eliminate consideration of KPF in the determination of yield grades. The present study used 2, 550 observations of retail yield of carcasses obtained from steers with genetically diverse growth rates and fattening characteristics to: 1) examine by yield grade the frequency, mean yield grade, and mean cutability for the present USDA 1980 equation, the present USDA 1980 equation omitting KPF, and the proposed newly developed equation (USDA 1984);and 2) compare precision of the USDA 1980 equation and the proposed equation (USDA 1984) for estimating yield...|$|E
40|$|The Bear {{subculture}} {{is a part}} of the {{gay male}} community that embraces a wide range of body types and sizes. The Bear subculture provides a refuge from fat stigma for Bears and their admirers. However, the sexualization of size creates a culture where physical activity and nutrition are not commonly discussed. Utilizing seven semistructured interviews and participant observation, this study investigated the relationship between body image, obesity, sexual minority stigma, and their impact on the physical health decisions in the Bear community. Although the Bear community provided some resilience to <b>external</b> <b>fat</b> stigmatization, individuals still struggled with internalized fat shame and devaluation of their bodies. Many avoided some physical activity for fear of stigmatization, and neglected medical advice that conflicted with Bear subcultural values. This research explores the complex relationships between physical health, obesity stigma, and sexual minority stigma and paves the way for more holistic physical health interventions...|$|E
