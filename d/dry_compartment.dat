5000|$|Each {{submarine}} is {{fitted with}} 6 × 533 mm torpedo tubes, and 4 × 650 mm torpedo tubes. [...] The very large 650 mm tubes {{can be used}} for laying mines, larger submarine-launched cruise missiles, or swimmer delivery vehicles, and with liners the tubes could be used for standard torpedoes and submarine-launched missiles. According to the German Defense Ministry the 650 mm tubes are to have a liner installed for firing 533 mm UGM-84 Harpoon missiles although the Dolphin class already has six tubes of the 533 mm size. [...] The boats were first armed with Atlas Elektronik DM2A3 torpedoes using wire-guided active homing to deliver a 260 kg warhead at a maximum speed of 35 kn to a target over 13 km away, in passive homing mode a speed of 22 kn and a range up to 28 km is possible. Israel has also procured the DM2A4 torpedo, successor to their DM2A3s, which are electrically propelled, equipped with fiber optic communications and has countermeasure resistant signals processing and mission logic.

According to Defense Industry Daily the IDAS torpedo tube launched anti-helicopter missile, designed to defend against airborne threats while submerged in shallow water found in the Mediterranean where escape to depth is often not possible, is under development for the Dolphin and 212 classes.|$|E
40|$|Patterns of root {{abscisic acid}} (ABA) {{accumulation}} ([ABA](root)), root water potential (psi(root)), and root water uptake (RWU), {{and their impact}} on xylem sap ABA concentration ([X-ABA]) were measured under vertical partial root-zone drying (VPRD, upper compartment dry, lower compartment wet) and horizontal partial root-zone drying (HPRD, two lateral compartments: one dry, the other wet) of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). When water was withheld from the <b>dry</b> <b>compartment</b> for 0 - 10 d, RWU and Psi(root) were similarly lower in the <b>dry</b> <b>compartment</b> when soil volumetric water content dropped below 0. 22 cm(3) cm(- 3) for both spatial distributions of soil moisture. However, [ABA](root) increased in response to decreasing Psi(root) in the <b>dry</b> <b>compartment</b> only for HPRD, resulting in much higher ABA accumulation than in VPRD. The position of the sampled roots (similar to 4 cm closer to the surface in the <b>dry</b> <b>compartment</b> of VPRD than in HPRD) might account for this difference, since older (upper) roots may accumulate less ABA in response to decreased Psi(root) than younger (deeper) roots. This would explain differences in root ABA accumulation patterns under vertical and horizontal soil moisture gradients reported in the literature. In our experiment, these differences in root ABA accumulation did not influence [X-ABA], since the RWU fraction (and thus ABA export to shoots) from the <b>dry</b> <b>compartment</b> dramatically decreased simultaneously with any increase in [ABA](root). Thus, HPRD might better trigger a long-distance ABA signal than VPRD under conditions allowing simultaneous high [ABA](root) and relatively high RWU fraction...|$|E

40|$|Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) {{plants were}} grown {{in either a}} {{glasshouse}} (GH) or a controlled environment cabinet (CEC) to assess the effects of partial rootzone drying (PRD) on biomass allocation. Control and PRD plants received the same amounts of water. In control plants, water was equally distributed between two compartments of a split-root system. In PRD plants, only one compartment was watered while the other was allowed to dry. At {{the end of each}} drying cycle, wet and <b>dry</b> <b>compartments</b> were alternated. In the GH, total biomass did not differ between PRD and control plants after four cycles of PRD, but PRD increased root biomass by 55 % as resources were partitioned away from shoot organs. In the CEC, leaf water potential did not differ between treatments at the end of either of two cycles of PRD, but stomatal conductance of PRD plants was 20 % less {{at the end of the}} first cycle than at the beginning. After two cycles of PRD in the CEC, biomass did not differ between PRD and control plants, but PRD increased root biomass by 19 % over the control plants. The promotion of root biomass in PRD plants was associated with the alternation of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>compartments,</b> with increased root biomass occurring in the re-watered compartment after previous exposure to soil drying. Promotion of root biomass in field-grown PRD plants may allow the root system to access resources (water and nutrients) that would otherwise be unavailable to control plants.

At the end of vegetative and during generative stage of development, half of the root system was exposed to drought, while {{the remainder of the}} root system was irrigated. One PRD treatment took c. 10 days and during this period the soil water content in the dry root side was reduced to 30 %. After this, the treatment was reversed, allowing the previously <b>dry</b> <b>compartment</b> to be well-watered and the well-watered compartment to dry down. In control plants both compartments were watered daily to drip point throughout the experimental period. During experimental period the following measurements were done: plant height, leaf number and area, number of flower trusses, number and diameter of fruit leaf gas exchange (photosynthesis and transpiration), leaf water potential leaf apoplastic pH and water-use efficiency (WUE). Obtained results of plants height and leaf number and area showed that, as a consequence of PRD treatment, the growth of whole plants was reduced, but not fruit, although WUE was increased. These results pointed out that with PRD technique it is possible to reduce irrigation water without significant reduction effect on tomato yield...|$|E

40|$|Partial root-zone drying (PRD) is {{predicted}} to increase ABA concentration in the xylem sap ([X-ABA]) without changing leaf water status, thus partially closing the stomata which may enhance plant water use efficiency. Predicting ([X-ABA]) from soil moisture and root distribution data are essential to optimize the application of this technique. Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) plants were grown in split pots, designed to allow {{a wide range of}} root mass distribution to either compartment, and PRD was applied. [X-ABA] was best predicted with an exponential model using the weighted (by root water uptake fraction - RWUF) average of root ABA concentration ([R-ABA]) in each compartment. This confirmed previous results reporting that a model accounting for RWUF is the best predictor of [X-ABA]. RWUF was equal to root mass fraction (RMF) when soil volumetric water content (θv) in the <b>dry</b> <b>compartment</b> was above 0. 18 cm 3 cm- 3, linearly related to RMF when θv 0. 7, and null otherwise. [R-ABA] in the dry side had basal values (of 100 - 150 ng g- 1 DW) when θv> 0. 18 and increased linearly with RMF above that threshold. Therefore, the proportion of roots in dry soil affected [X-ABA] by increasing both root water uptake fraction and ABA accumulation. [R-ABA] in the wet side was also stable when the dry side had θv> 0. 18 but was linearly related to local θv above that threshold and not to RMF. Simulation modelling showed that irrigating more than 1 / 3 of the total root mass during PRD had little impact on [X-ABA]...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{effects of}} soil moisture heterogeneity on plant physiology and gene expression in roots and leaves, three treatments were implemented in sunflower plants growing with roots split between two compartments: a control (C) treatment supplying 100 % of plant evapotranspiration, and two treatments receiving 50 % of plant evapotranspiration, either evenly distributed to both compartments (deficit irrigation - DI) or unevenly distributed to ensure distinct {{wet and dry}} compartments (partial rootzone drying - PRD). Plants receiving {{the same amount of}} water responded differently under the two irrigation systems. After 3 days, evapotranspiration was similar in C and DI, but 20 % less in PRD, concomitant with decreased leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)) and increased leaf xylem ABA concentration. Six water-stress responsive genes were highly induced in roots growing in the drying soil compartment of PRD plants, and their expression was best correlated with local soil water content. On the other hand, foliar gene expression differed significantly from that of the root and correlated better with xylem ABA concentration and Psi(leaf). While the PRD irrigation strategy triggered stronger physiological and molecular responses, suggesting a more intense and systemic stress reaction due to local dehydration of the <b>dry</b> <b>compartment</b> of PRD plants, the DI strategy resulted in similar water savings without strongly inducing these responses. Correlating physiological and molecular responses in PRD/DI plants may provide insights into the severity and location of water deficits and may enable a better understanding of long-distance signalling mechanisms.

Four treatments were imposed: (i) adequate irrigation in both compartments (WW, controls); (ii) adequate irrigation in one compartment and drought {{in the other}} compartment (WD); (iii) drought in both compartments (DD); and (iv) half of the root system severed and the remainder kept well-watered (root excision, RE). Predawn leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, soil-to-leaf specific hydraulic conductance, and root and leaf growth decreased in DD-treated seedlings, which also displayed severe leaf shedding (30 % loss in leaf area). The DD treatment also resulted in increased concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA) and its glucose ester in the xylem sap of roots and shoots compared to concentrations in control seedlings (about 200 versus 20 nM). Despite the difference in xylem sap concentrations, total ABA flux to the shoots was similar in the two treatments (1 – 2 pmol ABA m– 2 leaf area s– 1) {{as a result of}} reduced transpiration in the DD-treated seedlings. Compared with root growth in control plants, root growth increased in the RE-treated plants and decreased in the <b>drying</b> <b>compartment</b> of the WD treatment; however, the RE and WD treatments only slightly reduced leaf expansion, and had no detectable effects on shoot water relations or ABA concentrations of the root and shoot xylem sap.

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cells}} (PEFC) remain the main fuel cell technology for electric power trains in automobiles. Therefore this technology {{has benefited from}} a huge research effort over the past decades. However, still some fundamental properties and interactions of PEFC electrode/electrolyte interface remain elusive due to the experimental difficulty of analysis. One of the major challenges in the development PEFC is to exploit the whole capacity that inheres a given membrane electrode assembly (MEA) {{as well as to}} ascertain superior reliability. In practice, the water management and the corresponding local mass transport effects have to be optimized. Suboptimal operation leads to heterogeneous current distributions, which reduce the efficiency of a MEA and hence that of a PEFC. In order to investigate factors limiting the performance, the DLR has developed several measurement and visualization techniques to determine the local current density distribution in fuel cells without interfering with the cell operation. This method is applied to investigate oscillatory fluctuations of a single proton exchange membrane fuel cell which appear if pronounced humidity differences exist between anode (wet) to cathode (<b>dry)</b> <b>compartments.</b> An insight into the transitions between high and low current operation points is obtained by current density distributions at distinct times indicating a propagating active area with defined boundaries. The observations are in agreement with assuming a liquid water reservoir and changing water fluxes to the cathode due to distinct water content dependent electro-osmotic drag rates and permeation rates (corresponding to liquid-vapour permeation). The results are discussed with regards to water management of fuel cells. Our research also comprises the characterization of fundamental processes like the conductivity of fuel cell membranes on the nanometer scale by conductive atomic force microscopy. We have investigated the ionic conductivity of different solid electrolyte membranes - mostly perfluorinated sulfonic acid membranes - for fuel cell application by contact mode as well as with different tapping mode atomic force microscopy techniques for several years. This methodological approach yields high resolution images of the conductive surface structure and – by investigating cross-sections – gives insight into the bulk structure and the conducting network.

Methods - This study quantified shoot and root development {{and patterns of}} water and nitrate capture of two lettuce cultivars subjected to temporary drought at two development stages (Trial 1) or to continuous, localized drought and/or nitrate shortage (Trial 2). Results - In Trial 1, early drought slowed down shoot and root growth, whereas late drought enhanced root proliferation in the top 0. 1 m. Nitrate capture during drought was sustained by increased nitrate inflow from deeper layers. Plants did not recover fully from drought after re-watering. In Trial 2, root proliferation was stimulated in the <b>drier</b> soil <b>compartment</b> partially compensating reduced water availability and nitrate mobility. Under nitrate shortage, root proliferation was enhanced in the compartment where nitrate was more abundant, irrespective of water availability.

Four irrigation treatments comprising a 2 x 2 factorial experiment of irrigation volume and placement were imposed over a 30 -day period: control (C) [> 100 % of crop evapotranspiration (ET[subscript c]) ] applied to both containers; PRD 100 (> 100 % ET[subscript c]) applied to one container only; and two treatments receiving 50 % ET[subscript c] applied to either one (PRD 50) or both containers (DI 50). Irrigation between PRD (partial rootzone <b>drying)</b> root <b>compartments</b> was alternated when θv reached ~ 35 % of field capacity. Maximum daily sap flow of the irrigated roots of PRD 100 exceeded that of C roots throughout the experimental period. Pre-dawn water potential (ψ[subscript pd]) was similar between C and PRD 100; however, daily water use and mid-day gas exchange of PRD 100 was 30 % lower. Slightly higher [ABA[subscript leaf]] was observed in PRD 100, but the effect was not significant and could not explain the observed reductions in leaf gas exchange. Both 50 % ET[subscript c] treatments had similar, but lower θv,ψpd, and gas exchange, and higher [ABA[subscript leaf]] than C and PRD 100. Regardless of treatment, the container having the lower θv of a split-rooted system correlated poorly with [ABA[subscript leaf]], but when θv of both containers or θv of the container possessing the higher soil moisture was used, the relationship markedly improved.

40|$|Split root {{experiments}} {{have the potential}} to disentangle water transport in roots and soil, enabling the investigation of the water uptake pattern of a root system. Interpretation of the experimental data assumes that water flow between the split soil compartments does not occur. Another approach to investigate root water uptake is by numerical simulations combining soil and root water flow depending on the parameterization and description of the root system. Our aim is to demonstrate the synergisms that emerge from combining split root experiments with simulations. We show how growing root architectures derived from temporally repeated X-ray CT scanning can be implemented in numerical soil-plant models. Faba beans were grown with and without split layers and exposed to a single drought period during which plant and soil water status were measured. Root architectures were reconstructed from CT scans and used in the model R-SWMS (root-soil water movement and solute transport) to simulate water potentials in soil and roots in 3 D as well as water uptake by growing roots in different depths. CT scans revealed that root development was considerably lower with split layers compared to without. This coincided with a reduction of transpiration, stomatal conductance and shoot growth. Simulated predawn water potentials were lower in the presence of split layers. Simulations showed that this was caused by an increased resistance to vertical water flow in the soil by the split layers. Comparison between measured and simulated soil water potentials proved that the split layers were not perfectly isolating and that redistribution of water from the lower, wetter <b>compartments</b> to the <b>drier</b> upper <b>compartments</b> took place, thus water losses were not equal to the root water uptake from those compartments. Still, the layers increased the resistance to vertical flow which resulted in lower simulated collar water potentials that led to reduced stomatal conductance and growth...|$|R
