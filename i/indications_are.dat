5|$|Purportedly born in Weston on the {{outskirts}} of Bath, Ælfheah became a monk early in life. His birth took place around 953. He first entered the monastery of Deerhurst, but then moved to Bath, where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity, and rose to become abbot of Bath Abbey. The 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury recorded that Ælfheah was a monk and prior at Glastonbury Abbey, but this is not accepted by all historians. <b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> that Ælfheah became abbot at Bath by 982, perhaps as early as around 977. He perhaps shared authority with his predecessor Æscwig after 968.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> {{that society}} in North Britain {{contained}} relatively {{large numbers of}} slaves, often taken in war and raids, or bought, as St. Patrick indicated the Picts were doing from the Britons in Southern Scotland. Slavery probably reached relatively far down in society, with most rural households containing some slaves. Because they were taken relatively young and were usually racially indistinguishable from their masters, many slaves {{would have been more}} integrated into their societies of capture than their societies of origin, in terms of both culture and language. Living and working beside their owners they in practice may have become members of a household without the inconvenience of the partible inheritance rights that divided estates. Where there is better evidence from England and elsewhere, it was common for such slaves who survived to middle age to gain their freedom, with such freedmen often remaining clients of the families of their former masters.|$|E

40|$|Several non-flight {{qualification}} test radiators were inspected using flash thermography. Flash thermography data analysis used raw and second derivative images to detect anomalies (Echotherm and Mosaic). Simple contrast evolutions were plotted for the detected anomalies {{to help in}} anomaly characterization. Many out-of-family <b>indications</b> <b>were</b> noted. Some out-of-family <b>indications</b> <b>were</b> classified as cold spot <b>indications</b> and <b>are</b> due to additional adhesive or adhesive layer behind the facesheet. Some out-of-family <b>indications</b> <b>were</b> classified as hot spot <b>indications</b> and <b>are</b> due to void, unbond or lack of adhesive behind the facesheet. The IR inspection helped in assessing expected manufacturing quality of the radiators...|$|R
50|$|In medicine, an <b>indication</b> <b>is</b> a valid {{reason to}} use a certain test, medication, procedure, or surgery. The {{opposite}} of an <b>indication</b> <b>is</b> a contraindication, a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment because it could harm a patient.|$|R
50|$|Oral {{pleconaril}} was ViroPharma's first compound, licensed from Sanofi in 1995. Pleconaril {{is active}} against viruses in the picornavirus family. ViroPharma's first <b>indication</b> <b>was</b> for enteroviral meningitis, but that <b>indication</b> <b>was</b> abandoned when the clinical trials did not demonstrate efficacy.|$|R
25|$|In fact, <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> {{that black}} Americans also practiced family {{planning}} to a comparable {{degree in the}} post-slavery period, and several factors seem to have influenced a desire for smaller families among various demographic groups in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Very little {{information}} is available regarding the flags carried by early American Marines, although <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> that the Grand Union Flag was carried ashore by the battalion led by Captain Samuel Nicholas on New Providence Island, 3 March 1776. It {{is quite possible that}} the Gadsden flag was also carried on this expedition.|$|E
25|$|Nimesulide is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{with pain}} medication and fever reducing properties. Its approved <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> {{the treatment of}} acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis, and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old.

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{and original}} form of double light colour light signal provides three <b>indications,</b> that <b>is</b> Clear (green over green), Caution (green over red) and Stop (red over red). A fourth indication, known as Medium, {{is indicated by}} green over yellow. This equates to the [...] "double yellow" [...] in British multiple aspect signalling. The Medium <b>indication</b> <b>was</b> introduced in June 1926, {{three months after the}} first double yellow <b>indication</b> <b>was</b> used in the UK.|$|R

25|$|The root {{is known}} to be a {{powerful}} emetic. A proteolytic enzyme known as pedilanthain can be extracted from the plant's latex, and has been shown in experiments to be effective against intestinal worms and to reduce inflammation when ingested. In 1995, a galactose-specific lectin was purified from the plant's latex, and <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> that it might be useful in combatting diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|The line is {{monitored}} from the Operations Control Center (OCC). Responsibility for controlling service {{is shared by}} the control room and field personnel along the right of way. Track circuit and signal <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> not transmitted to the operational personnel sites. In lieu of track circuit indications, the AVI system is displayed {{in the control room}} to provide a periodic update to train position wherever AVI detectors exist. The AVI system user interface was solely text based until the current control room was opened, in which a new schematic display based on AVI data was instituted. Track circuit <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> available digitally in signal houses at the Park Street interlocking, at the new North Station interlocking, and at the new Kenmore interlocking, but are not transmitted to OCC. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle location tracking on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines. The first real-time data—location data on the surface lines—became available in October 2014. Full tracking is expected by early 2015.|$|E
25|$|Most {{capacitors}} have numbers {{printed on}} their bodies to indicate their electrical characteristics. Larger capacitors like electrolytics usually display the actual capacitance together with the unit, for example, 220 μF. Smaller capacitors like ceramics, however, use a shorthand-notation consisting of three digits and a letter, where the digits indicate the capacitance in pF, calculated as XY × 10Z for digits XYZ, and the letter indicates the tolerance. Common tolerance <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> J, K, and M for ±5%, ±10%, and ±20%, respectively.|$|E

25|$|In November 2003 Air New Zealand {{extended}} the successful low-cost domestic Express concept to trans-Tasman routes. Early <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> that this move has also proved successful, {{with an estimated}} 10% increase of bookings {{in the first few}} months of operation. On 30 June 2004 the airline commenced non-stop services from Auckland to San Francisco, the first new international destination for eight years. In September 2004 Air New Zealand was named Best Long Haul Airline in the seventh annual Conde Nast Traveller UK Readers' Awards.|$|E
25|$|This {{modality}} {{is suitable}} for young and pregnant people. Indications for thyroidectomy can be separated into absolute indications or relative indications. These indications aid in deciding which people would benefit most from surgery. The absolute <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> a large goiter (especially when compressing the trachea), suspicious nodules or suspected cancer (to pathologically examine the thyroid), and people with ophthalmopathy and additionally {{if it is the}} person's preferred method of treatment or if refusing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment. Pregnancy is advised to be delayed for 6 months after radioactive iodine treatment.|$|E
25|$|What of {{the latest}} {{currents}} of thought? Are they likely to lead to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy? The <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> not all encouraging. Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray published a book in 1994 clearly directed at policy, just as Jensen and others had in the 1960s and 1970s. The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life (New York: Free Press 1994) teamed a psychologist with a conservative policy advocate to try to prove that both the class structure and the racial divide in the United States result from genetically determined differences in intelligence and ability.|$|E

40|$|We study {{qualitative}} indications for d. c. {{representations of}} closed sets in and functions on Hilbert spaces. The first <b>indication</b> <b>is</b> {{an index of}} nonconvexity which {{can be regarded as}} a measure for the degree of nonconvexity. We show that a closed set is weakly closed if this <b>indication</b> <b>is</b> finite. Using this result we can prove the solvability of nonconvex minimization problems. By duality a minimization problem on a feasible set in which this <b>indication</b> <b>is</b> low, can be reduced to a quasi-concave minimization over a convex set in a low-dimensional space. The second <b>indication</b> <b>is</b> the separability which can be incorporated in solving dual problems. Both the index of nonconvexity and the separability can be characteristics to "good" d. c. representations. For practical computation we present a notion of clouds which enables us to obtain a good d. c. representation for a class of nonconvex sets. Using a generalized Caratheodory's theorem we present various applications of clouds. ...|$|R
25|$|During World War II, Pramoedya (like many Indonesian Nationalists, Sukarno and Suharto among them) {{at first}} {{supported}} the occupying forces of Imperial Japan. He believed the Japanese {{to be the}} lesser of two evils, compared to the Dutch. He worked as a typist for a Japanese newspaper in Jakarta. As the war went on, however, Indonesians were dismayed by the austerity of wartime rationing and by increasingly harsh measures taken by the Japanese military. The Nationalist forces loyal to Sukarno switched their support to the incoming Allies against Japan; all <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> that Pramoedya did as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> that it {{probably}} had large seasonal changes in discharge, evident by cross-bedded sandstones deposited at stages of lower flow, although whilst the flow was seasonal, it is perhaps doubtful if this system was ephemeral in nature for there is relatively little evidence of any large-scale aeolian sandstones in the basinal settings of the Midlands. It is clear that more locally sourced material such as carboniferous limestone and reworked earlier Triassic sandstone from the Clent Formation just south of Birmingham were also important components of the river systems as they flowed northwards giving some indication of the relief of the basin margins.|$|E
25|$|Protected <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> {{treated as}} {{intellectual}} property rights by the Customs Regulation 1383/2003 (Regulation concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain {{intellectual property rights}} and the measures to be taken against goods found to have infringed such rights), and infringing goods may be seized by customs on import. Within the European Union, enforcement measures vary: infringement may be treated as counterfeit, misleading advertising, passing off or even as a question of public health. Outside Europe, the protection of PGS products usually require bilateral agreements between the EU and the importing countries, while protected indications may not always supersede other intellectual property rights such as trademarks.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} stock market {{indicators}} in the United States {{and other countries}} provide {{an indication of the}} market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds. The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data. He estimates that privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had more value than publicly held firms, in 2004.|$|E
25|$|In 1732 the Admiralty {{decided to}} ask the Master Shipwrights {{in each of the}} Royal dockyards to report to them on how best they thought the ships could be improved. The responses, when they finally arrived, were conservative, {{offering}} only minor adjustments to certain dimensions. There was little agreement between the changes proposed, and no further progress was made until May 1733 when Sir Jacob Ackworth of the Navy Board — the Surveyor of the Navy at the time — proposed to the Admiralty some changes to the dimensions of the 50-gun and 60-gun ships, most notably an increase in breadth. The Admiralty accepted these proposals, and the ones that followed in later months for the other types, and these new dimensions became the effective new Establishment, though they never technically superseded the 1719 dimensions; there was no 1733 Establishment. <b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> that the Admiralty desired more far-reaching reforms that what was actually implemented, but {{due in part to the}} absence of anyone with practical shipbuilding knowledge on the Board, the Board of Admiralty lacked the ability to realise them.|$|E
25|$|The 'red plan' {{targeted}} {{victims and}} detailed action {{to be taken}} against them. The scenario, as described by Max Coleman in A Crime Against Humanity: Analysing the Repression of the Apartheid State, was as follows:Step 1: A person or a target would be identified as an enemy of the State. A cell member would then be instructed to monitor the 'target'.Step 2: A project - i.e. the elimination of a target would be registered with the co-ordinator. The co-ordinator would then have the project authorised by the regional manager and the managing director.Step 3: The CCB member would then do a reconnaissance to study the target's movements with a view to eliminating him or her.Step 4: The operative would propose the most practical method to the managing director. If the director felt this method was efficient, he would sign the proposal at what was called an 'in-house' meeting. There adjustments could be made to the plan before it was approved. The budget would be considered and finance would be made available for the project. The finance would come from the budget the Defence Force allocated to CCB activities. <b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> that money was always paid in cash.Step 5: The co-ordinator would be requested to make available the necessary arms and ammunition such as limpet mines, poison and/or live ammunition or other logistical support such as transport, etc.Step 6: The project would be carried out and the target would be eliminated. To do this the cell member could engage the assistance of what were termed 'unconscious members'. These were essentially underworld criminals who would, for money, kill as instructed. These 'unconscious' members were never told of the motive or the SADF connection - a false motive was usually supplied.|$|E
