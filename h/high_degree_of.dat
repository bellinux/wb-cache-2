40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{overlapping}} generations framework, calibrated to four Southern European countries, we analyze {{the relationship between}} tax evasion, determined endogenously, and financial repression. We show that <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> tax evasion within a country, resulting from {{a higher level of}} corruption and a lower penalty rate, yields <b>higher</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> financial repression as a social optimum. However, a <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> tax evasion, due to a lower tax rate, reduces the severity of financial restriction. Underground Economy; Tax evasion; Macroeconomic Policy. ...|$|R
