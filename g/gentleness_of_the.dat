[...] The similarities between the triads found in the former Baekje and Goguryeo kingdoms suggest that the introduction of such images came from both Goguryeo itself as well as China. [...] An example of the [...] influence of the Northern Wei style is the statue now at the National [...] Museum of Korea. [...] This image, probably once {{a part of a}} single-mandorla triad, has robes draped in the same style as the Yong'a Buddha. [...] However, the [...] Baekje-specific [...] modifications, such as the <b>gentleness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face, Omega-like folds in the under robe, and a sense of stability exhibited in the expansiveness of the robes as they flare out, clearly differentiate this image from those from Goguryeo.|$|E

That {{there is}} a Sacred classic literature, running {{parallel}} {{with that of the}} Hebrews, and coalescing in the symbolic legends of mediæval Christendom, is shown in the most tender and impressive way by the independent, yet similar, influence of Virgil upon Dante, and upon Bishop Gawaine Douglas. At earlier dates, the teaching of every master trained in the Eastern schools was necessarily grafted on the wisdom of the Greek mythology; and thus the story of the Nemean Lion, with the aid of Athena in its conquest, is the real root-stock of the legend of St. Jerome's companion, conquered by the healing <b>gentleness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spirit of Life.|$|E

60|$|In both cases, therefore, {{the grand}} {{outline of the}} villa is the same; but in one we have it set off by contrast, in the other by assimilation; and we must {{work out in the}} {{architecture}} of each edifice the principle on which we have begun. Commencing with that in which we are to work by contrast: the vertical crags must be the result of violence, and the influence of destruction, of distortion, of torture, to speak strongly, must be evident in their every line. We free the building from this influence, and give it repose, gracefulness, and ease; and we have a contrast of feeling as well as of line, by which the desirable attributes are rendered evident in both objects, while the duration of neither energy being allowed, there can be no disagreeable effect upon the spectator, who will not shrink from the terror of the crags, nor feel a want of excitement in the <b>gentleness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E

60|$|Lingard looked {{downward}} {{where the}} water could be seen, gliding past the ship's side, moving smoothly, streaked with lines of froth, across the illumined circle thrown round the brig by the lights on her poop. Air bubbles sparkled, lines of darkness, ripples of glitter appeared, glided, went astern without a splash, without a trickle, without a plaint, without a break. The unchecked <b>gentleness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow captured the eye by a subtle spell, fastened insidiously upon the mind a disturbing sense of the irretrievable. The ebbing of the sea athwart the lonely sheen of flames resembled the eternal ebb-tide of time; and when at last Lingard looked up, the knowledge of that noiseless passage of the waters produced on his mind a bewildering effect. For a moment the speck of light lost in vast obscurity the brig, the boat, the hidden coast, the Shallows, the very walls and roof of darkness--the seen and the unseen alike seemed to be gliding smoothly onward through the enormous gloom of space. Then, with a great mental effort, he brought everything to a sudden standstill; and only the froth and bubbles went on streaming past ceaselessly, unchecked {{by the power of}} his will.|$|E
60|$|It {{seems that}} the good officer--not more true to the king his master than indulgent towards the {{prisoner}} which that same loyalty made--had left orders that Israel should be supplied with whatever liquor he wanted that night. So, calling for the can again and again, Israel invites the two soldiers to drink and be merry. At length, a wag of the company proposes that Israel should entertain the public with a jig, he (the wag) having heard that the Yankees were extraordinary dancers. A fiddle is brought in, and poor Israel takes the floor. Not a little cut to think that these people should so unfeelingly seek to be diverted {{at the expense of}} an unfortunate prisoner, Israel, while jigging it up and down, still conspires away at his private plot, resolving ere long to give the enemy a touch of certain Yankee steps, as yet undreamed of in their simple philosophy. They would not permit any cessation of his dancing till he had danced himself into a perfect sweat, so that the drops fell from his lank and flaxen hair. But Israel, with much of the <b>gentleness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dove, is not wholly without the wisdom of the serpent. Pleased to see the flowing bowl, he congratulates himself that his own state of perspiration prevents it from producing any intoxicating effect upon him.|$|E
6000|$|First, {{as regards}} the general tone of the Letters. You {{tell me that the}} {{majority}} of the comments you have received have been hostile--people not taking their medicine without making wry faces. I am only surprised at the <b>gentleness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Letters, and I believe that if anyone will take the trouble to put down for himself on paper the sum of their contents, he will find it as difficult to gainsay as for careless readers it is easy to cavil at. On the other hand, the [...] "hostile spirit" [...] is readily provoked by the way in which some of the teaching of the Letters is put. Passages like the sixth paragraph in Letter X. appear an objectionable joke to some--perhaps to most--people; they do not see that it is really a serious jest, so put for brevity's sake, and that Ruskin might have put the same note to it as he has put to a passage in the [...] "Crown of Wild Olive," [...] p. 85, 8vo ed.: [...] "Quite serious all this, though it reads like jest." [...] I remember once asking Ruskin if his apparent joking in some Oxford lectures was not likely to lessen his influence, and he at once said to me, [...] "Remember that most of my apparent jokes are serious, ghastly jests." [...] I think he would be less often misunderstood, if this were more often understood.|$|E
2500|$|Author Robert Farris Thompson, {{professor}} of art history at Yale University, suggests that Itutu, which he translates as 'mystic coolness,' {{is one of three}} pillars of a religious philosophy created in the 15th century by Yoruba and Igbo civilizations of West Africa. Cool, or Itutu, contained meanings <b>of</b> conciliation and <b>gentleness</b> <b>of</b> character, of generosity and grace, and the ability to defuse fights and disputes. It also was associated with physical beauty. In Yoruba culture, Itutu is connected to water, because to the Yoruba <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> coolness retained its physical connotation of temperature. He cites a definition <b>of</b> cool from <b>the</b> Gola people <b>of</b> Liberia, who define it as the ability to be mentally calm or detached, in an other-worldly fashion, from one's circumstances, to be nonchalant in situations where emotionalism or eagerness would be natural and expected.
