5|$|After {{the communists}} {{took over the}} {{short-lived}} First Republic of Armenia and ARF leaders were exiled, the Dashnaks moved their base of operations to where the Armenian diaspora had settled. With the large <b>influx</b> of Armenian refugees in the Levant, the ARF established a strong political structure in Lebanon {{and to a lesser}} extent, Syria. From 1921 to 1990, the Dashnaktsutiun established political structures in more than 200 states including the USA, where another large <b>influx</b> of Armenians settled.|$|E

40|$|Toroidal asymmetries in {{divertor}} {{carbon and}} lithium <b>influxes</b> {{were observed in}} NSTX, due to toroidal differences in surface composition, tile leading edges, externally-applied three-dimensional (3 D) fields and toroidally-localized edge plasma modifications due to radio frequency heating. Understanding toroidal asymmetries in impurity <b>influxes</b> is critical {{for the evaluation of}} total impurity sources, often inferred from measurements with a limited toroidal coverage. The toroidally-asymmetric lithium deposition induced asymmetries in divertor lithium <b>influxes.</b> Enhanced impurity <b>influxes</b> at the leading edge of divertor tiles were the main cause of carbon toroidal asymmetries and were enhanced during edge localized modes. Externally-applied 3 D fields led to strike point splitting and helical lobes observed in divertor impurity emission, but marginal changes to the toroidally-averaged impurity <b>influxes.</b> Power coupled to the scrape-off layer SOL plasma during radio frequency (RF) heating of H-mode discharges enhanced impurity <b>influxes</b> along the non-axisymmetric divertor footprint of flux tubes connecting to plasma in front of the RF antenna...|$|R

40|$|Temporary {{protection}} mechanisms emerged in Europe in the 1990 s {{in response to}} mass <b>influxes</b> of asylum seekers. The <b>influxes</b> of asylum seekers from Yugoslavia, fleeing conflicts and violence resulting from the break-up of that country, have been closely associated with its emergence. In {{the light of the}} developments in that period, and in particular the responses of European states to the Yugoslavian <b>influxes,</b> this paper reviews the emergence of temporary protection. It reviews the convergence of European norms which lead EU states to agree the Temporary Protection Directive in 2001. The paper juxtaposes the 1990 s Yugoslavian <b>influxes</b> and responses, with the 2015 European refugee crisis and the responses of the EU. These responses have included arrangements to relocate asylum seekers from states under the most pressure but have excluded temporary protection. The omission of temporary protection is consistent with the findings in this paper, which show that EU states came to disfavour temporary protection as a response to asylum crises. The paper concludes that while EU states did commit to a set of standards for temporary protection, they did not commit to implementation of temporary protection...|$|R

30|$|In {{this present}} study we {{will focus on}} the {{analysis}} of the results obtained with modified passive probes. First, we explain the well-known linear and exponential methods [4, 9 – 11] and the underlying assumptions in detail, before we show for a typical measurement why these methods are not suitable for energy <b>influxes</b> in the order of 100  W/cm 2. Finally, we introduce a novel method by combining the linear and the exponential methods and show that this approach is suitable for the analysis of high energy <b>influxes</b> by a passive calorimetric probe.|$|R

5|$|Sinification of the Yue and Dian tribes {{was brought}} about by a {{combination}} of Han imperial military power, regular Han Chinese settlement and an <b>influx</b> of Han Chinese refugees. The military invasions and an <b>influx</b> Han Chinese immigrants created a culture that merged Han Chinese traditions with indigenous elements. Archaeological digs in the area reveal the extent of Han Chinese influence. Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou, Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after Chinese styles by the Western Han.
