Que se vayan del Canal (<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> just leave from the Canal) and Quiero Sembrar un Maíz (I want to plant corn in the Canal Zone) were the songs of the protests against the constant abuse by the United States.|$|E
2500|$|On October 17, 2008, Bachmann gave an {{interview}} on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews {{in support of the}} presidential campaign of Senator John McCain that brought the Minnesota 6th Congressional District race national attention. During the interview she criticized Barack Obama for his association with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers, saying [...] "...usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are... I am very concerned that he [...] may have anti-American views." [...] She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by Bill Ayers before discussing his association with Barack Obama, arguing that [...] "Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with." [...] Matthews followed up by asking [...] "But he [...] is a Senator from the State of Illinois; he's {{one of the members of}} Congress you suspect of being anti-American. How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?" [...] Bachmann answered, [...] "What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would...</b> I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they pro-America, or anti-America. I think people would love to see an exposé like that." ...|$|E

50|$|Tommy Kirk starred {{and later}} {{recalled}} about the movie:This was his Kelly's {{attempt to do}} a sympathetic dramatisation of a Lieutenant Calley-type character (My Lai massacre) coming home and portraying his bitterness, alienation and unhappiness at being fingered as a murderer, a baby killer and a monster. That's who I played. I'm not completely embarrassed by the film, but after I saw it, <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have cut some things. Some of it was pretty stinko. Other things weren't so bad. The movie {{as a whole was}} a failure, but it wasn't trash.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{should never}} have gone away. I'm out of {{practise}} in lying. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> get it over! Just a block more and--my baby!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lady Bertram, [...] "but I wish he was {{not going}} away. They are all going away, I think. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> stay at home." ...|$|E

60|$|No, {{let me be}} honest. When I went in I {{had seen}} {{that there was a}} deucedly pretty girl sitting in that {{particular}} seat, so I had taken the next one. What happened now was that I began, as it were, to drink her in. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> turn the lights up so that I could see her better. She was rather small, with great big eyes and a ripping smile. It was a shame to let all that run to seed, so to speak, in semi-darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{can they}} be going to do now?" [...] Tom said. [...] "Some fresh piece of homage, I should guess. <b>I</b> do <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> leave us alone. It is {{annoying}} enough {{to be treated as}} a god, without being disturbed by these constant worshippings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, nay,' said Mr. Tadpole with a chuckle, 'I don't {{think we}} shall find the Church {{attacked}} {{again in a}} hurry. <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> try! A good Church cry before a registration,' he continued, rubbing his hands; 'eh, my Lord, I think that would do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She looked up, amazed again. 'I must! I don't like it! But I couldn't {{ever have}} a happy Christmas if I didn't tell! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> come that I might have it over.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How cunning they are! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> let me {{put them}} with the kits, and have a nursery full of babies. Wouldn't it be nice to see them all grow up?" [...] said Daisy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Cecily, {{what will}} she do? <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> go, for I feel {{sure that she}} will think it her duty to hold out against him, till she has her father's sanction; she will seem hard, and he--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut! tut! It is from Lady Morsley, {{asking me}} to the Lord-Lieutenant's ball. I cannot {{possibly}} accept. It is very kind of them, but <b>I</b> do <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> leave me alone. Very well, Jones. I shall write. Do you know, Robert, I am often very unhappy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Phonny, {{when they}} were fairly on the way, [...] "we will have a good time. This is just what I like. I {{would rather have a}} good ride on horseback than any thing else. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> let me go alone sometimes." ...|$|R
60|$|Being now in part {{removed from}} my old station, I {{seemed to be}} in a fair way of {{retiring}} from my old acquaintances, and consequently from the vile, abominable trade I had driven so long; so that the door seemed to be, as it were, particularly open to my reformation, if I had any mind to it in earnest; but, for all that, some of my old friends, as I had used to call them, inquired me out, and came to visit me at Kensington, and that more frequently than <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do; but it being once known where I was, there was no avoiding it, unless I would have downright refused and affronted them; and I was not yet in earnest enough with my resolutions to go that length.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{told you}} I was very sorry,' said Jane, 'only <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not all {{be so hard}} upon me. Robert owns {{that he should not}} have said such things if he did not wish them to be repeated.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Although you and Mr. Thomas are so {{sure the}} {{discovery}} {{will be a}} source of great wealth, I can't feel much interest in it while Fred is in danger. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> go to some city, rather than remain so near home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know them}} only too well," [...] she replied. [...] "They have stolen {{so many of}} our {{chickens}} and so much garden truck that my husband {{is going to make a}} complaint against them. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> leave the neighborhood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I shall {{keep my eyes}} on all points," [...] said he, [...] "as far as I can. I {{begin to}} feel a spirit of fight rising up within me. If I thought I could keep them off until Rynders gets here, <b>I</b> almost <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> then come. <b>I</b> would like to kill a lot of them." ...|$|R
5000|$|The poetic mood of {{the first}} intermezzo from Op. 119 belies its vague title. In a letter from May 1893 to Clara Schumann, Brahms wrote: [...] "I am tempted to copy out a small piano piece for you, because I {{would like to know}} how you agree with it. It is teeming with dissonances! These may well be correct and can be explained—but maybe they won’t please your palate, and now <b>I</b> <b>wished,</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be less correct, but more appetizing and {{agreeable}} to your taste. The little piece is exceptionally melancholic and ‘to be played very slowly’ is not an understatement. Every bar and every note must sound like a ritardando, as if one wanted to suck melancholy out of each and every one, lustily and with pleasure out of these very dissonances! Good Lord, this description will surely awaken your desire!" ...|$|R
6000|$|While I was {{dressing}} a small parcel {{was brought}} up, {{which had been}} left at the door for me. It contained a note and a small jewel-box. The note was from Messrs. Hunt and Roskell, saying, [...] "That they had received orders from Mr. Harmer, of Canterbury, to send me a cross, the choice {{of which he had}} left with them, and a small chain to suspend it round my neck. That they trusted the jewel would give me satisfaction; but that, if <b>I</b> <b>wished,</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> exchange it for any other in their shop, if I would favour them with a call." [...] The contents of the case were a small cross, composed entirely of very large diamonds, of the value of which I had no idea, but which looked very lovely, and a small chain to hang it round my neck. I said nothing to Ada, although the door was open, as <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> to surprise her.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must find}} her," [...] said Lord Roehampton; [...] "you know her haunts. Ah! what a delight {{it is to}} be in this air and this scene after those dreadful boxes! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> turn us out. I think they must soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{let us be}} off," [...] another said. [...] "I am sick already {{of these}} sands and that big lump of stone. I hear the boats are going up every day, {{and if they do}} not move us soon the {{infantry}} will be there before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{from what}} he said they lodged here together, but the other two went somewhere else the day after you were brought in, so that the place should be quiet, but they come in by turns to sit up with you at night. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> take us with them on this expedition, Dick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not you, Ippe; you're {{not half}} such a fool as he is. Just go boldly, {{and do your}} best. Look as fierce and wild as you can, and make awful faces. There's nothing like {{frightening}} people! Howl as much as possible, and gasp sometimes. I have seen a good deal done in that way. <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> try to make an angekok of me. I would astonish them." ...|$|R
60|$|While {{the ship}} rode here there {{happened}} a most desperate mutiny among the men, upon account of some deficiency in their allowance, {{which came to}} that height that they threatened the captain to set him on shore, and go back with the ship to Goa. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> with all my heart, for I was full of mischief in my head, and ready enough to do any. So, though I was but a boy, as they called me, yet I prompted the mischief all I could, and embarked in it so openly, that I escaped very little being hanged {{in the first and}} most early part of my life; for the captain had some notice that there was a design laid by some of the company to murder him; and having, partly by money and promises, and partly by threatening and torture, brought two fellows to confess the particulars, and the names of the persons concerned, they were presently apprehended, till, one accusing another, no less than sixteen men were seized and put into irons, whereof I was one.|$|R
6000|$|Marnham laughed scornfully. [...] "Ah! I understand," [...] he said. [...] "Too {{clean and}} straight. Complications might ensue {{and the rest}} of it. Well, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to God <b>they</b> <b>would,</b> for I know the Anscombes, or used to, and I know the genus called Rodd." ...|$|R
60|$|May 29.--The Lockharts were {{to appear}} at nine o'clock, but it is past four, and they come not. There has been easterly wind, and a swell of the sea {{at the mouth of}} the Firth, but {{nevertheless}} <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> come. The machinery is liable to accidents, and they may be delayed thus.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> search into it whose {{power can}} punish it. But this, with submission, I presume to say: The king is thereby {{defrauded}} and horribly abused, the true intent {{and meaning of}} Acts of Parliament evaded, the nation involved in debt by fatal deficiencies and interests, fellow-subjects abused, and new inventions for taxes occasioned.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nasty," [...] Skinner agreed. [...] "I sha'n't mind {{it as soon}} as we go at the beggars, {{but this}} doing nothing is, as you say, trying. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> make up their minds and come out to us, or if they cannot get up their pluck enough to do it, that we should sally out and attack them." ...|$|E
5000|$|He was {{eventually}} {{sentenced to a}} total of 268 years in prison. Pereira would go on to say [...] "I was possessed by an evil force." [...] and [...] "I am a person with a good and a bad personality. Sometimes I am not able to dominate this dark side. I pray, I pray, but I cannot resist and then I chase after women. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not go with me into the park, that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> run away." [...] After being caught he claimed he was about to start cannibalizing his victims.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic editor Lindsay Planer {{wrote about}} {{the success of the}} song: [...] "Like much of the Motown empire at the time, the title track's {{multimedia}} exposure, coupled with strong crossover appeal, ensured that [...] "Ben" [...] scored the artist his first Pop Singles' chart-topper" [...] and she highlighted the track. Rolling Stone editor, Vince Aletti was not satisfied: [...] "The title song is lovely, no doubt, and Michael packs it with a surprising amount of feeling (his delivery of [...] "They don't see you as <b>I</b> do/I <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> try to" [...] still tears me up) but it's all a little too thick for my tastes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ellen Cushing of the East Bay Express {{reported}} that the demographics had become [...] "homogenous" [...] and that the demographic change was [...] "an ironic twist for a school that was originally intended to serve American Indians — and which is still thought of by many as a haven for a population that's struggled mightily with institutional oppression." [...] Cushing said that [...] "one prominent member of the Bay Area American-Indian community" [...] who asked to be anonymous said that many Native Americans feel upset by the school's name, and [...] "If anything, <b>I</b> just <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> change their name — it's misleading, and potentially damaging to our community." ...|$|R
