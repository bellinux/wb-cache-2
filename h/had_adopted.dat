This period has been seen one in which a clear national identity emerged in Scotland, as well as significant distinctions between different regions of the country which would be particularly significant in the period of the Reformation.|$|E

50|$|The {{setting of}} the amount of related party charges is {{commonly}} referred to as transfer pricing. Many jurisdictions have become sensitive to the potential for shifting profits with transfer pricing, and <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> rules regulating setting or testing of prices or allowance of deductions or inclusion of income for related party transactions. Many jurisdictions <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> broadly similar transfer pricing rules. The OECD <b>has</b> <b>adopted</b> (subject to specific country reservations) fairly comprehensive guidelines. These guidelines <b>have</b> been <b>adopted</b> with little modification by many countries. Notably, the U.S. and Canada <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> rules which depart in some material respects from OECD guidelines, generally by providing more detailed rules.|$|R

5|$|Daniel Boone {{was honored}} with a 6-cent stamp in the American Folklore Series on September 26, 1968, at Frankfort, Kentucky, {{where he was}} buried. He was a famous frontiersman in the {{development}} of Virginia, Kentucky and the trans-Appalachian west. A wall of roughly-hewn boards displays the tools of Boone's trade—a Pennsylvania rifle, a powder horn, and a knife. The pipe tomahawk represents that the Shawnees <b>had</b> <b>adopted</b> Boone. His name and birth date were carved on the wall.|$|E

5|$|In 6BC, on {{the verge}} of {{accepting}} command in the East and becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to Rhodes. The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear. Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus <b>had</b> <b>adopted</b> Julia's sons by Agrippa Gaius and Lucius, and seemed to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Germanic tribes {{who in the}} {{following}} centuries invaded the Roman Empire <b>had</b> <b>adopted</b> Christianity in its Arian form, which the Catholic Church declared heretical. The resulting religious discord between Germanic rulers and Catholic subjects was avoided when, in 497, Clovis I, the Frankish ruler, converted to orthodox Catholicism, allying himself with the papacy and the monasteries. The Visigoths in Spain followed his lead in 589, and the Lombards in Italy {{in the course of}} the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|On the 31 July the Third Battle of Ypres {{began and}} the unit was heavily involved. 56 was tasked with air superiority {{operations}} to allow RFC bomber and reconnaissance units {{to operate with}} relative freedom.

Their units were also a collection of highly successful aces. The S.E.5s engaged in battle with the German fighters throughout the summer.|$|E

5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant must submit evidence showing that the applicant <b>had</b> <b>adopted</b> the mark in good faith, that the applicant <b>had</b> <b>adopted</b> the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E

5|$|Adam Michael Goldstein {{was born}} on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – {{both of whom were}} Jewish – had been unable to {{conceive}} children naturally, and they <b>had</b> <b>adopted</b> Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having extramarital sex with a man. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily disclosed to him that he was not the biological father of her baby.|$|E
5|$|After Varus' {{defeat in}} Germania in the 1st century, Rome <b>had</b> <b>adopted</b> a largely {{defensive}} strategy {{along the border}} with Germania, constructing a line of defences known as limes along the Rhine. Although the exact historicity is unclear, since the Romans often assigned one name to several distinct tribal groups, or conversely applied several names to a single group at different times, some mix of Germanic peoples, Celts, and tribes of mixed Celto-Germanic ethnicity were settled in the lands of Germania from the 1st century onwards. The Cherusci, Bructeri, Tencteri, Usipi, Marsi, and Chatti of Varus' time had by the 3rd century either evolved into or been displaced by a confederacy or alliance of Germanic tribes collectively known as the Alamanni, first mentioned by Cassius Dio describing the campaign of Caracalla in 213 AD.|$|E

In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Akroinon {{was a major}} {{success for}} the Byzantines, {{as it was the}} first {{large-scale}} victory they had scored in a pitched battle against the Arabs. Seeing it as evidence of God's renewed favour, the victory also served to strengthen Leo's belief in the policy of iconoclasm that he <b>had</b> <b>adopted</b> some years before. In the immediate aftermath, this success opened up the way for a more aggressive stance by the Byzantines, who in 741 attacked the major Arab base of Melitene. In 742 and 743, the Umayyads were able to exploit a civil war between Constantine V and Artabasdos and raid into Anatolia with relative impunity, but the Arab sources do not report any major achievements.|$|E
5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s <b>had</b> <b>adopted</b> the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E
