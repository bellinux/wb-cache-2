The selective formation of 2 -chlorodecane is attributed to proton transfer from heptane radical cations to decane molecules, (n-C 7 H 16. + + n-C 10 H 22 [...] > 1 -C 7 H 15. + n-C 10 H 23 +), followed by neutralization of the so-formed protonated decanes by chloride ions upon warming.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the online-coupling of size {{exclusion}} chromatography (SEC) and liquid chromatography at critical conditions (LCCC) with NMR spectroscopy in order to characterize polymers and determine their molar masses. In this regard it was the aim to establish the coupled techniques that way that they were working with common chromatographic conditions, e. g. sample concentration, flow rate and solvents. The measurements should result in quantitative characterizations. The difficulty with NMR measurements on the flowing medium (onflow) was that nuclei only have a limited residence time in the detection cell, while NMR spectroscopy has to wait for relaxation of the nuclei during accumulation of the spectra. Conclusively, NMR measurement parameters should fulfill the given contrary conditions. To find a suitable set of NMR parameters, the behaviour of nuclei in the magnetic field under flow conditions was evaluated, especially regarding T 1 relaxation and its influence on signal intensities. By varying the flow rate, the pulse repetition time and the pulse angle {{it was found that}} quantitative results were obtainable only by using uncommon chromatographic conditions or not useful NMR parameters. However, based on these results a method was developed to evaluate and correct the errors in not quantitative NMR data. Therefore, it was possible to quantify data from SEC-NMR and LCCC-NMR measurements although they were performed with not quantitative conditions. Thus, the evaluation of the reciprocal influences of chromatographic and NMR spectroscopic parameters resulted in a new method in HPLC-NMR applications. In the following, a new onflow SEC-NMR coupling was developed and presented by characterizing a number of polystyrene-polymethyl methacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) and polyisopren-polymethyl methacrylate (PI-b-PMMA) block copolymers. In all cases, THF was used as solvent at a flow rate of 0. 8 mL. min- 1. In the onflow NMR spectra, signals of all blocks could be identified over the entire elution period: PS blocks were quantified by the signals of the aromatic protons, PMMA blocks by the signals of the a-CH 3 group and PI by the signals of the olefinic protons. Thus, SEC chromatograms could be obtained directly from the SEC-NMR data for all blocks of the PS-b-PMMA and PI-b-PMMA copolymers {{as well as for the}} copolymers themselves. In addition, the microstructure of PMMA blocks could be analyzed in dependence on retention time, while for PI the different isomeric species of isoprene units in the polymer chains could by characterized. For the copolymers, chemical heterogeneities could be calculated directly from the chromatograms. Calibration of the SEC-NMR system with defined polymer standard samples allowed for molar mass determination. For one of the PI-b-PMMA copolymers a method was developed to separate coeluting fractions of co- and homopolymers by a mathematical procedure. For this, knowledge of the chemical heterogeneity of the sample was essential. The possibility to distinguish between the different species in copolymers is a significant advantage of NMR spectroscopy. As an alternative, a series of different detectors can be used (multiple detection, e. g. combined UV and refractive index detection). However, multiple detection is time consuming due to additional calibrations and mathematical efforts. The use of NMR spectroscopy is furthermore beneficial when the distinction of different species by multiple detection is impossible (e. g. microstructure heterogeneities). With respect to copolymer molar masses, a good agreement between onflow SEC-NMR and SEC-RI-UV was found. However, number average molar masses Mn determined by onflow SEC-NMR were smaller due to the influence of the large detection cell. The new onflow SEC-NMR method uses calibrations for molar mass determinations as it is common in SEC and is therefore a relative procedure. By NMR detection, molar masses can be calculated also in an absolute way, when NMR signals of end or linking groups of the polymers can be identified over the elution period. This was possible for four short PI-b-PMMA copolymers which were linked by a diphenylethylene (DPE) group each. The corresponding NMR signals could be used as an internal reference for direct block length calculation. The resulting absolute molar masses were smaller than those determined by the relative method. The interpretation of this finding was that the hydrodynamic volumes of the blocks did not contribute simply additive to the block copolymer volumes but that additional repulsive effects result in increased hydrodynamic volumes of the block copolymers. Another new online-SEC-NMR method developed and presented in this thesis was called fractionated SEC-NMR. Hereby, SEC peaks were identified with a UV detector and then directed to a number of capillary loops for fractionation. After the chromatography was finished, the pump was used to transfer each collected fraction sequentially to the NMR flow probe where measurements were performed without a flowing mobile phase. Consequently, the nuclei had sufficient time for full relaxation during accumulation of a NMR spectrum. The fractionated SEC-NMR had all advantages of the onflow method and additionally provided correct Mn values. Moreover, it also allowed for the detection of insensitive nuclei which was proved with a deuterated PS-b-PMMA copolymer (2 H detection). The coupling of LCCC and NMR was applied to separate and characterize blends of different PI samples. This work continued and extended a work which was presented in a former thesis by Pritish Sinha (TU Darmstadt, Germany, 2009). The blends contained PI samples which were dominated by 1, 4 -isoprene units as well as samples which were built mainly by 3, 4 -isoprene. Critical conditions for PI(1, 4) samples were used which simultaneously led to SEC elution of the PI(3, 4) samples. This allowed for the separation and characterization of the mixtures. The NMR signals of the olefinic protons were used to obtain chromatograms for all isomeric species of the isoprene units in the polymer chains as well as the <b>isomeric</b> <b>compositions</b> in dependence on retention time. The separation could be further improved by a mathematical procedure. In this way, the compositions of the mixtures of samples could be efficiently calculated via the isomer amounts. Molar mass determination for the PI(3, 4) samples could be performed on the basis of a calibration curve. It was found in all cases that the resulting Mn values were significantly to small. This was caused by the 1, 4 -isomers in the PI(3, 4) samples which stretched the chromatograms in the direction of the PI(1, 4) critical retention time. Due to this finding, molar mass determination from LCCC-NMR data is limited. In the last chapter the short PI-b-PMMA copolymers have been analyzed by LCCC-NMR with PI eluting in critical mode and PMMA in SEC regime. Molar masses for the PMMA blocks were calculated on the basis of a calibration curve. Alternatively, molar mass determination was possible from direct block length calculation by using the DPE signals as internal reference. The resulting values from the calibration method were too small especially in case of Mn. The chromatographic effect causing this was also found and discussed for the PI blends. In contrast to that finding, the internal referencing procedure by the DPE signals was not influenced by that effect and hence resulted in realistic molar masses. Furthermore, very good accordance was found to the molar masses determined absolutely from SEC-NMR measurements. Consequently, effects leading to peak shape deformation or retention time shift have no influence on the absolute molar mass determination method. This can be explained by the fact that it does not rely on calibration curves which are not necessarily influenced in the same way as the samples. For using the absolute method it is essential to detect signals of end or linking groups which for small polymers is possible by using NMR detection. Finally, an electronic reference signal was implemented in the LCCC-NMR spectra which allowed for conversion of the chromatograms to molar amount and to mass related curves. It was seen that for depiction of LCCC-NMR chromatograms substance amounts in the order of 10 - 8 mol to 10 - 7 mol and 10 - 6 g to 10 - 5 g, respectively, per onflow spectrum were sufficient. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der online-Kopplung von Größenausschluss- Chromatographie (SEC) und Chromatographie unter kritischen Bedingungen (LCCC) mit der NMR-Spektroskopie zum Zwecke der Charakterisierung und Molmassenbestimmung von Polymeren. Dabei wurde besonders darauf Wert gelegt, die Kopplungen so auszulegen, dass SEC-NMR- und LCCC-NMR-Messungen hinsichtlich der Probenkonzentration, der Flussrate und der Lösungsmittel unter chromatographisch üblichen Bedingungen durchgeführt werden konnten. Die erhaltenen Resultate sollten quantitativ verwertbar und interpretierbar sein. Die Schwierigkeit bei NMR-Messungen am fließenden Medium (onflow) bestand dabei darin, dass sich Kerne nur für eine begrenzte Zeit innerhalb der Detektionszelle befanden, die NMR-Spektroskopie bei der Akkumulation von Messdaten jedoch die zur Kernrelaxation benötigte Zeit berücksichtigen musste. NMR-Messparameter sollten folglich den genannten konträren Voraussetzungen gerecht werden können. Um die geforderten Messparameter festlegen zu können, wurde zunächst untersucht, wie sich Kerne unter Flussbedingungen im Magnetfeld verhalten, insbesondere hinsichtlich der T 1 -Relaxation und deren Auswirkung auf die gemessene Signalintensität.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{first use of}} {{synchrotron}} radiation, continuously tunable from 8 to 15 eV, for flame-sampling photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS). Synchrotron radiation offers important advantages {{over the use of}} pulsed vacuum ultraviolet lasers for PIMS; these include superior signal-to-noise, soft ionization, and access to photon energies outside the limited tuning ranges of current VUV laser sources. Near-threshold photoionization efficiency measurements were used to determine the absolute concentrations of the allene and propyne isomers of C 3 H 4 in low-pressure laminar ethylene–oxygen and benzene–oxygen flames. Similar measurements of the <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition</b> of C 2 H 4 O species in a fuel-rich ethylene–oxygen flame revealed the presence of substantial concentrations of ethenol (vinyl alcohol) and acetaldehyde. Ethenol has not been previously detected in hydrocarbon flames. Absolute photoionization cross sections were measured for ethylene, allene, propyne, and acetaldehyde, using propene as a calibration standard. PIE curves are presented for several additional reaction intermediates prominent in hydrocarbon flames...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount and}} <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition</b> of urinary biliverdin in rabbits were {{analysed}} by h. p. l. c. Physiological values were maintained after the injection of haemin. On the other hand, when haemoglobins from several mammalian species were injected into rabbits, the excretion of biliverdin-IX alpha and biliverdin-IX beta were increased 6 - 18 -fold and 32 - 66 -fold respectively over physiological excretion. Injection of myoglobin {{resulted in a}} 44 -fold increase in excretion of the IX alpha-isomer. Coupled oxidation with ascorbate of haemoglobin and myoglobin by oxygen produced mainly the IX alpha- and IX beta-isomers from haemoglobin and the IX alpha-isomer from myoglobin. The destruction of part of the haem from injected haemoproteins by non-enzymic chemical degradation would account for the observed respective increases in the excretion of biliverdin isomers. The excretion of biliverdin isomers after the injection of phenylhydrazine into rabbits {{was similar to that}} after the injection of haemoglobin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Soy bean contain soy isoflavones {{which have}} an effect on {{different}} metabolic disorders in human. In this study we have analysed <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition</b> of isoflavones in soy bean and investigated distribution of this substances between different product under soy bean processing. Using mass-spectroscopy and NMR analysis we have detected two main isomers in soy bean daidzin and genistin. It was shown that isoflavone fraction is extracted to alcohol solution in processing of protein concentrate. Having analysed products of protein isolate processing we detected that isoflavones were extracted to alkaline solution during protein extraction. Only about 17 % of isoflavones have been remaining in protein isolate. Main of them were in whey water after protein precipitation. And it is possible to elicit them according to standart procedure using extraction by ethylacetate and precipitation by chloroform. Taking into account our results we are proposing the scheme of soy bean processing with isoflavone concentrate producing...|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} optical (NLO) {{response of}} three -conjugated azobenzene (AB) derivatives was investigated under picosecond laser excitation {{by means of}} the Z-scan technique to evaluate the effect of an ethynyl-based conjugated spacer on the NLO properties of ABs. All modules possessed large third-order nonlinearity, but unexpectedly it was the less extended AB derivative that exhibited the largest NLO response. This finding has been confirmed by means of DFT calculations and was attributed to a higher cis/trans ratio of the particular AB derivative in its investigated photoequilibrated state. Furthermore, the influence of the amount of cis isomer on the third-order nonlinear susceptibility [((3)) ] of the less extended AB derivative has been thoroughly investigated. Specifically, modulation of the NLO response has been successfully achieved by tuning the <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition</b> of the investigated photostationary state. These results highlighted the cis-dependent increase of the NLO response to support the general idea that such compounds can be used for multistep switching NLO materials...|$|E
40|$|A two-step {{synthesis}} of spiro(2. 4) hepta- 1, 4, 6 -triene 1 is described. The starting material 2 was synthesized by irradiation of diazocyclopentadiene {{in the presence}} of (2 -bromovinyl) trimethylsilane. The predominant formation of the trans isomer probably reflects the <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition</b> of the starting alkene (cis:trans ratio ≈ 10 : 90). Elimination of 2 using CsF in dimethyl sulfoxide yielded 1. (DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED [...] . PLEASE SEE MAI) Spiro (2. 4) hepta- 1, 4, 6 -triene is remarkably stable. 1 H and 13 C NMR data could be obtained at room temperature. The infrared spectrum exhibits a moderately strong absorption at 1713 cm- 1 characteristic of cyclopropenes. The ultraviolet spectrum of spiro (2. 4) hepta- 1, 4, 6 -triene recorded in methanol has λ max = 254 nm, very close to that reported (257 nm) for 3. This observation is in conflict with theoretical predictions which claim that 1 will experience a small hypsochromic shift resulting from spiroconjugation. (DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED [...] .

In dark-adapted bR deconvolution of the ethylenic mode into bands assigned to the all-trans (1526 cm- 1) and 13 -cis (1534 cm- 1) isomers yields a 13 -cis to all-trans ratio equal to 1 at ambient pressure (Schulte et al., 1995, Appl. Spectrosc. 49 : 80 - 83). Detailed spectroscopic evidence is presented that at high pressure the equilibrium is shifted toward the 13 -cis isomers and that the light to dark adaptation kinetics is accelerated. The change in <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition</b> with temperature and pressure as well as the kinetics support a two-state model activation volumes of - 16 ml/mol for the transition of 13 -cis to all-trans and - 22 ml/mol for the reverse process. These compare with a conformational volume difference of 6. 6 ml/mol, which may be attributed to the ionization of one or two residues or the formation of three hydrogen bonds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractApplication of the kinetic method {{based on}} the {{dissociation}} of transition metal centered cluster ions is extended from chiral analysis (Tao, W. A.; Zhang, D.; Nikolaev, E. N.; Cooks, R. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 10598) to quantitative analysis of isomeric mixtures, including those with Leu/Ile substitutions. Copper(II) -bound complexes of pairs of peptide isomers are generated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and the trimeric complex [CuII(ref) 2 (A) − H]+ (analyte A, a mixture of isomeric peptides; reference compound ref, usually a peptide) is caused to undergo collisional dissociation. Competitive loss of the neutral reference compound or the neutral analyte yields two ionic products and the ratio of rates of the two competitive dissociations, viz. the product ion branching ratio R is shown to depend strongly on the regiochemistry of the analyte in the precursor [CuII(A) (ref) 2 − H]+ complex ion. Calibration curves are constructed by relating the branching ratio measured by the kinetic method, to the <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition</b> of the mixture to allow rapid quantitative isomer analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The risk {{of chronic}} {{diseases}} {{has been shown}} to be inversely related to tomato intake and the lycopene levels in serum and tissue. Cis-isomers represent approximately 50 %– 80 % of serum lycopene, while dietary lycopene maintains the isomeric ratio present in the plant sources with about 95 % of all-trans-lycopene. Supercritical CO 2 extraction (S-CO 2) has been extensively developed to extract lycopene from tomato and tomato processing wastes, for food or pharmaceutical industries, also by using additional plant sources as co-matrices. We compared two S-CO 2 -extracted oleoresins (from tomato and tomato/hazelnut matrices), which showed an oil-solid bi-phasic appearance, a higher cis-lycopene content, and enhanced antioxidant ability compared with the traditional solvent extracts. Heat-treating, in the range of 60 – 100 °C, led to changes in the lycopene <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition</b> and to enhanced antioxidant activity in both types of oleoresins. The greater stability has been related to peculiar lycopene isomer composition and to the lipid environment. The results indicate these oleoresins are a good source of potentially healthful lycopene...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} the application of the biodegradation test proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) “Biodegradability in sea water” Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) 835. 3160, to Linear Alkylbenzene Sulphonate (LAS), the synthetic surfactant with the highest consumption volume on a world-wide basis. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been employed for the separation and quantification of the different homologues and isomers of the surfactant. Water from the Bay of Cádiz (South–West of the Iberian peninsula) has been used as test medium. The results indicate how both lag and t 50 time shows a significant linear relationship with the length of the alkyl chain of the homologue; the effect of this is that the homologues of longer chain length not only begin to degrade first but also degrade at a faster rate. Regarding the <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition,</b> it is observed that as the percentage of biodegradation increases, there is an increase in the proportion of internal isomers, in comparison with the isomeric relationships of the original test substanc...|$|E
40|$|Cardiolipin is a {{class of}} {{mitochondrial}} specific phospholipid, which is intricately involved in mitochondrial functionality. Differences in cardiolipin species exist {{in a variety of}} tissues and diseases. It has been demonstrated that the cardiolipin profile is a key modulator of the functions of many mitochondrial proteins. However, the chemical mechanism(s) leading to normal and/or pathological distribution of cardiolipin species remain elusive. Herein, we describe a novel approach for investigating the molecular mechanism of cardiolipin remodeling through a dynamic simulation. This approach applied data from shotgun lipidomic analyses of the heart, liver, brain, and lung mitochondrial lipidomes to model cardiolipin remodeling, including relative content, regiospecificity, and <b>isomeric</b> <b>composition</b> of cardiolipin species. Generated cardiolipin profiles were nearly identical to those determined by shotgun lipidomics. Importantly, the simulated isomeric compositions of cardiolipin species were further substantiated through product ion analysis. Finally, unique enzymatic activities involved in cardiolipin remodeling were assessed from the parameters used in the dynamic simulation of cardiolipin profiles. Collectively, we described, verified, and demonstrated a novel approach by integrating both lipidomic analysis and dynamic simulation to study cardiolipin biology. We believe this study provides a foundation to investigate cardiolipin metabolism and bioenergetic homeostasis in normal and disease states...|$|E
