This is done by weighing the difficulties involved in implementing a carbon tax against the benefits that it could bring. Key difficulties discussed include the treatment of stockpiled emissions credits that exist within the New Emissions Trading Scheme and the changing treatment of agriculture and <b>forestry.</b> <b>Potential</b> benefits of a carbon tax include reduced administrative and transactional costs, revenue generation and insulation from vested interests.

40|$|Global {{society is}} moving towards action to reduce {{anthropogenic}} greenhouse gas emissions. This {{can be expensive}} and socially disruptive in countries like the United States where {{the vast majority of}} emissions arise from electrical energy generation and petroleum usage. Agricultural and forest carbon sequestration along with development of other greenhouse gas offsets may help hold costs and disruption down. However sequestration exhibits saturation and non permanence that may influence this role. We examine the dynamic role that the agricultural and forest sectors can play in emissions offsets and mitigation. A 100 year modeling analysis, depicting U. S. agricultural and forest sectoral activities is applied to simulate agricultural and <b>forestry</b> <b>potential</b> mitigation response. The results reveal that agriculture and forestry can play an important role principally through cropland soil sequestration, afforestation and biofuel provision. However the importance of these strategies varies with price and time. At low carbon prices and in the near term agricultural soils are most important in the longer term and at high prices powerplant feedstock biofuels dominate. Ignoring saturation leads to an overstatement of the potential importance of sequestration strategies. Nevertheless the results show that the agricultural and forest sectors may serve as an important bridge to the future helping to hold costs down until energy emissions related technology develops. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{existence}} of planted kauri at DK provides a special opportunity {{to better understand}} the ecology and <b>forestry</b> <b>potential</b> of one of New Zealand’s iconic species well outside its current natural range. Similarity in ring-width patterns among trees at DK shows a consistent response to the environment. The average growth rate of DK trees is comparable to other plantations situated much further north, an exceptional result given that DK is > 20 % cooler, > 40 % drier and receives > 200 less sunshine hours each year than most of the current natural range of kauri. A period of continuous, rapid growth occurred prior to 1983 but has consistently slowed since then, probably reflecting competition for light. This is may suggest the onset of the ‘self thinning’ process, well documented for kauri. A corresponding decrease in tree-ring δ 13 C since 1983 could also be explained by increased light competition, creating a ‘reverse juvenile effect’, which serves as a dendrochemical analogy for the self-thinning evident ring-width signal. The onset of growth decline is much earlier (26 [*]±[*] 5.6  years) than modelling predicts, which may reflect site specific influences related to enhanced light competition and/or climatic stress due to the reduced temperature, rainfall and sunshine hours for DK compared North Island locations. Nonetheless, the success of the DK plantation suggests that kauri can be successfully grown in sheltered sites well south of its natural range, although stand density may need to be slightly lower than northern plantations to avoid early onset self-thinning.|$|E
40|$|Global {{climate change}} poses great risks to poor people whose {{livelihoods}} depend {{directly on the}} use of natural resources. Mitigation of the adverse effects of climate change is a high priority on the international agenda. Carbon trading, under the Kyoto Protocol as well as outside the protocol, is growing rapidly from a small base and is expected to increase dramatically under present trends. However, developing countries, in particular Sub-Saharan Africa, remain marginalized in global carbon markets, with Africa’s market share constituting less than 1 percent (excluding South Africa and North African countries). The potential for mitigation through agriculture in the African region is estimated at 17 percent of the global total, and the economic potential (i. e. considering carbon prices) is estimated at 10 percent of the total global mitigation potential. Similarly, Africa’s <b>forestry</b> <b>potential</b> per year is 14 percent of the global total, and the avoided-deforestation potential accounts for 29 percent of the global total. Appropriate climate-change policies are needed to unleash this huge potential for pro-poor mitigation investment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Such policies should focus on increasing the profitability of environmentally sustainable practices that generate income for small producers and create investment flows for rural communities. Pro-poor investments, community development, new research, and capacity building can all help integrate the agriculture, forestry, and land-use systems of developing countries into the carbon trading system, both generating income gains and advancing environmental security. Achieving this result will require effective integration, from the global governance of carbon trading to the sectoral and micro-level design of markets and contracts, as well as investment in community management. Streamlining the measurement and enforcement of offsets, financial flows, and carbon credits for investors is also needed. This review paper begins with an overview of global carbon markets, including opportunities for carbon trading, and the current involvement of developing countries, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. This is followed by an assessment of the mitigation potential and options involving agriculture, land use, and forestry. The major constraints to the participation of Sub-Saharan Africa in global carbon markets are discussed, and options for integrating the region into global carbon markets are proposed.
