The expression of bumblebee, Bombus ignitus, venom serine protease (VSP) by Beauveria bassiana (ERL 1170) induced melanization of yellow spotted <b>longicorn</b> <b>beetles</b> (Psacothea hilaris) as an over-reactive immune response, and caused substantially earlier mortality in beet armyworm (Spodopetra exigua) larvae when compared to the wild type.

Sequence analyses of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene suggests that lineages of mitochondrial haplotypes split approximately in the same era.

40|$|The role of cuticular {{chemicals}} in mating behavior and their chemical components were studied in two sympatric flower-visiting <b>longicorn</b> <b>beetles,</b> Pidonia grallatrix and P. takechii. Mating experiments revealed that female cuticular chemicals elicit male mating behavior and that males can discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific females {{on the basis}} of contact chemicals. GC-MS analyses of whole-body extracts in the two species and both sexes determined that extracts contained a series of hydrocarbons including n-alkanes, n-alkenes, and methylalkanes. The relative abundance of some hydrocarbons differed between species and sexes, and canonical discriminant analysis showed discrimination of species and sex could be made unambiguously with several compounds. These results imply that the difference in cuticular hydrocarbons facilitates the premating isolation of sympatric Pidonia species...|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} Melaleuca, {{especially}} M. alternifolia, are cultivated {{for the production}} of tea tree oil, and in plantations are susceptible to a number of insect pests. The most significant of these is the Chrysomelid, Paropsisterna tigrina, but other beetles, cutworm caterpillars (Agrotis species), psyllids, mole crickets (Gryllotalpa), and others cause significant damage. More than 100 species of insects are known to feed on melaleucas. Native stands have fewer predators, but tea tree sawfly (Pterygophorus species) and <b>longicorn</b> <b>beetles</b> are often found. Melaleucas are also susceptible to myrtle rust (Puccinia psidii) which can result in damage to soft plant material and the death of highly susceptible hosts. Myrtle rust is common in eastern Australia, including Tasmania and has been detected in the Tiwi Islands.|$|R

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of insects visit the flowers of Bursaria spinosa, the most {{important}} pollinators of which appear to be beetles of several families. Common visitors recorded from field work around Armidale were jewel beetle species such as Curis splendens and Stigmodera inflata; <b>longicorn</b> <b>beetles</b> including Amphirhoe sloanei and Tropocalymma dimidiatum; scarab beetles; and tumbling flower beetles. Beetles and scoliid wasps all carried significant amounts of pollen. Other visitors such as flies and butterflies carried much lower amounts. The larvae of the jewel beetle species Astraeus crassus live in tunnels in dead and dying branches. Caterpillars which feed on Bursaria spinosa include Proselena annosana, two-ribbed arctiid (Palaeosia bicosta) and bark looper moth (Ectropis subtinctaria), while those of the clouded footman (Anestia ombrophanes) graze on algae and lichens which grow on the branches.|$|R

60|$|A {{very brief}} sketch of these {{phenomena}} will be given, chiefly {{to show that}} the same principle prevails throughout nature, and that, wherever a rather extensive group is protected, either by distastefulness or offensive weapons, there are usually some species of edible and inoffensive groups that gain protection by imitating them. It has been already stated that the Telephoridae, Lampyridae, and other families of soft-winged beetles, are distasteful; and as they abound {{in all parts of the}} world, and especially in the tropics, it is not surprising that insects of many other groups should imitate them. This is especially the case with the <b>longicorn</b> <b>beetles,</b> which are much persecuted by insectivorous birds; and everywhere in tropical regions some of these are to be found so completely disguised as to be mistaken for species of the protected groups. Numbers of these imitations have been already recorded by Mr. Bates and myself, but I will here refer to a few others.|$|R
6000|$|Wasps and {{bees are}} often closely imitated by insects of other orders. Many <b>longicorn</b> <b>beetles</b> {{in the tropics}} exactly mimic wasps, bees, or ants. In Borneo a large black wasp, whose wings have a broad white patch near the apex (Mygnimia aviculus), is closely imitated by a heteromerous beetle (Coloborhombus fasciatipennis), which, {{contrary}} to the general habit of beetles, keeps its wings expanded {{in order to show}} the white patch on their apex, the wing-coverts being reduced to small oval scales, as shown in the figure. This is a most remarkable instance of mimicry, because the beetle has had to acquire so many characters which are unknown among its allies (except in another species from Java)--the expanded wings, the white band on them, and the oval scale-like elytra.[109] Another remarkable case has been noted by Mr. Neville Goodman, in Egypt, where a common hornet (Vespa orientalis) is exactly imitated in colour, size, shape, attitude when at rest, and mode of flight, by a beetle of the genus Laphria.[110] ...|$|R
