5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E

The amplifier <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> low distortion to display its input accurately (it must be linear), and it has to recover quickly from overloads.
