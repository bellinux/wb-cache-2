40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate bird responses to flavophospholipol at higher doses than those recommended by the Brazilian legislation. A trial was conducted with 900 male broilers divided into five doses of flavophospholipol: 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg. The performance evaluation was conducted weekly until 42 days of age. The evaluated parameters were: weight gain, <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> corrected for mortality, feed intake and mortality. At the end of experimental period, birds supplemented with growth promoter differed from the negative control for weight gain and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> in the period from 1 to 42 days. Body weight gain and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> were significantly higher for birds fed 16 mg/kg of flavophospholipol, compared with treatment without the growth promoter in the period from 1 to 21 days. In the accumulated period from 22 to 42 days, all doses were different for the negative control for <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> and body weight gain. The performance improvement was maximized at the dosage of 10. 1 mg/kg for <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio and 10. 9 mg/kg for body weight gain by regression analysis.

40|$|Today, {{fish farming}} faces an {{increasing}} demand in fish products, but also various environmental challenges. Genetic improvement in growth rate and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio {{is known to}} be an efficient way to increase production and increase efficiency in fish farming. The environmental consequences of genetic improvement in growth rate and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio, however, are unknown. In this study, we investigated the environmental consequences of genetic improvement in growth rate and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio in an African catfish farm, using Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). In RAS, total fish production of the farm is limited by rearing density or by the capacity to treat dissolved nitrogen. To evaluate the environmental consequences of genetic improvement in growth rate and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio, we combined life cycle assessment and bioeconomic modelling of genetic response to selection. We explored different impact categories, such as climate change, eutrophication, acidification and energy use, and we expressed impacts per ton of fish produced. Results show that the environmental impact of genetic improvement in growth rate and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio varies among impact categories and depends on the factor limiting production at farm level (i. e. rearing density or nitrogen treatment capacity). Genetic improvement of <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio reduces environmental impacts in each scenario tested, while improving growth rate reduces environmental impacts only when rearing density limits farm production. Environmental responses to genetic selection were generally positive and show similar trends as previously determined economic responses to genetic improvement in growth rate and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio in RAS. These results suggest that genetic improvement of growth rate and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio for species kept in RAS will benefit both the environmental impacts and the economics of the production system. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The intense {{selection}} process for economic traits {{conducted by the}} poultry breeding programs has been caused several changes in broiler meat quality. A database belonging to a selection program of a broiler male line was used to estimate heritability and genetic correlations for <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio and meat quality traits, which were: initial and final pH, lightness, drip loss, thawing loss and shear force. Two-trait analyses were performed and the components of co(variance) and genetic parameters were determined using the Bayesian approach and the GIBBS 3 F 90 software. The heritability estimate found for <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio (0. 52) showed high influence of direct additive genetic effects on the expression of this trait; therefore, this trait is {{able to respond to}} selection. The genetic correlation estimates obtained (- 0. 50 to 0. 33) were indicative of important associations between <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio and meat quality traits. The selection to improve <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio may cause injury in greater or lesser degree for L*, drip loss (DL), thawing loss (TL) and shear force (SF) in broilers. It is recommended the monitoring of consequences of <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> ratio used as selection criteria or meat quality traits in broilers, due to its unfavorable indirect selection for these variables in this population.
