2500|$|Manufacturing the B-29 was {{a complex}} task. It {{involved}} four main-assembly factories: {{a pair of}} Boeing operated plants at Renton, Washington (Boeing Renton), and Wichita, Kansas (now Spirit AeroSystems), a Bell plant at Marietta, Georgia ("Bell-Atlanta"), and a Martin plant at Omaha, Nebraska ("Martin-Omaha" [...] - Offutt Field). Thousands of subcontractors {{were involved in the}} project. The first prototype made its maiden flight from Boeing Field, Seattle on 21 September 1942. [...] The combined effects of the aircraft's highly advanced design, challenging requirements, and immense pressure for production, hurried development and caused setbacks. The second prototype, which, unlike the unarmed first, was fitted with a Sperry defensive armament system using remote-controlled gun turrets sighted by periscopes, first flew on 30 December 1942, this flight being terminated due to a serious engine fire. On 18 February 1943, the second prototype, flying out of Boeing Field in Seattle, experienced an engine fire and crashed. [...] The crash killed Boeing test pilot Edmund T. Allen and his 10-man crew, 20 workers at the Frye Meat Packing Plant and a Seattle firefighter. Changes to the production craft came so often and so fast that in early 1944, B-29s flew from the production lines directly to modification depots for extensive rebuilds to incorporate the latest changes. AAF-contracted modification centers and its own air <b>depot</b> <b>system</b> struggled to handle the scope of the requirements. Some facilities lacked hangars capable of housing the giant B-29, requiring outdoor work in freezing cold weather, further delaying necessary modification. By the end of 1943, although almost 100 aircraft had been delivered, only 15 were airworthy. This prompted an intervention by General Hap Arnold to resolve the problem, with production personnel being sent from the factories to the modification centers to speed availability of sufficient aircraft to equip the first Bomb Groups in {{what became known as the}} [...] "Battle of Kansas". This resulted in 150 aircraft being modified in the five weeks between 10 March and 15 April 1944.|$|E

40|$|The reduced {{injection}} frequency and more nearly constant serum concentrations afforded by sustained release devices have been exploited for the chronic delivery of several therapeutic peptides via poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) microspheres. The clinical {{success of these}} formulations has motivated the exploration of similar <b>depot</b> <b>systems</b> for chronic protein delivery; however, this application has not been fully realized in practice. Problems with the delivery of unmodified proteins in PLG <b>depot</b> <b>systems</b> include high initial “burst” release and irreversible adsorption of protein to the biodegradable polymer.

One promising approach is the covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to the protein prior to encapsulation in the PLG microspheres.

Martinet served during the reign of Louis XIV and made way to French conquest in the Holy Roman Empire. He was a severe drillmaster, which made him unpopular among his troops.

He also introduced the bayonet into the French army and the <b>depot</b> <b>system,</b> which put a stop to the army feeding off the enemy land, making war more humane.
