6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> the old gent's rage?" [...] asked Duane, {{watching}} the innkeeper. He {{scratched his head}} dubiously. He was sincere, and Duane believed in his honesty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Except Mr. Sherlock Holmes," [...] said my companion, with a {{somewhat}} bitter smile. [...] "Well, let us hear about it. What {{sort of a}} job <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>DID</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> her, my dear?" [...] Mrs. March {{demanded the}} instant she was beyond their hearing. [...] "I must say, you didn't spare {{yourself}} in the cause; you did bravely. What is she like?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, the {{greatest}} statesmen {{have had their}} distractions. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> my hereditary talent? That's a tremendous force." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this, White Buffalo?" [...] asked Dave, {{after they}} had left the Indian village a goodly {{distance}} behind them.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, this is strange, {{to say the}} least,” remarked Phil, {{after they}} had called out several times. “What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it, Roger?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{what right}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> him a votive offering? By what right did you seek to consecrate a child unborn to a claustral life without {{thought of his}} character, without reck of the desires that should be his? By what right did you make {{yourself}} the arbiter {{of the future of}} a man unborn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wha--what did {{you think}} of him? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> him?' she panted. I was too taken aback for the moment to reply. Her voice broke as she stooped to the dog at her knees. 'O Harvey, Harvey! You utterly {{worthless}} old devil!' she cried, and the dog cringed and abased himself in servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon. I made to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he said, [...] "I am not cynical. I {{simply have}} a {{weakness}} for the truth. You will find it rather a hard material to collect if you set out in earnest. But to return to Wrayson. Let {{me ask you a}} question. We are all friends of his, more or less intimate friends. You would all of you scout the idea of his having any share in the murder of Morris Barnes. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> his evidence at the inquest this afternoon? What do you think of his whole deportment and condition?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A jolly good morrow indeed," [...] said Sir John, {{turning a}} shade paler. [...] "And now, daughter, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's mighty queer, {{to say the}} least," [...] {{observed}} Roger, {{after they}} had taken their departure. [...] "Dave, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Four times five will do handsomely, will it?" [...] said Mr. Jaggers, {{knitting}} his brows. [...] "Now, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> {{four times}} five?" ...|$|R
60|$|You erred, it {{cannot be}} denied, {{with your eyes}} open. Knowing Lydia and Kitty so intimately as you did, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> them almost {{insignificant}} characters? With Lydia for a heroine you might have gone far; and, had you devoted three volumes, and the chief of your time, to the passions of Kitty, you might have held your own, even now, in the circulating library. How Lyddy, perched on {{a corner of the}} roof, first beheld her Wickham; how, on her challenge, he climbed up by a ladder to her side; how they kissed, caressed, swung on gates together, met at odd seasons, in strange places, and finally eloped: all this might have been put in the mouth of a jealous elder sister, say Elizabeth, and you would not have been less popular than several favourites of our time. Had you cast the whole narrative into the present tense, and lingered lovingly over the thickness of Mary's legs and the softness of Kitty's cheeks, and the blonde fluffiness of Wickham's whiskers, you would have left a romance still dear to young ladies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} Mrs. Cavendish," [...] {{continued}} Poirot. [...] "That's another {{who is not}} telling all she knows! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> her attitude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Mulford, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> her?" [...] {{he called}} {{out as soon as}} the mate {{announced}} that he saw the strange vessel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] asked Sam, whose {{religious}} education {{had not been}} attended to {{as well as that}} of his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bent, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> thet?" [...] asked Lem, as {{he waved}} his hand toward the house. [...] "Buster Jack ridin' up with Sheriff Burley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} devilish in this, Watson," [...] said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it all, then, Hawkins?" [...] {{asked the}} captain, with a troubled face. [...] "What {{is your own}} theory on the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] asked Paul, impatiently, as he {{bent over}} to examine the object as it lay in his younger brother's palm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Many things; {{more than}} I can tell you--things you've only {{to think of}} for yourself. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> all that I've done for myself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make,</b> Mr Nickleby,' said Tim, {{taking his}} pen {{out of his}} mouth, 'what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> four hundred and twenty-seven times three {{thousand}} two hundred and thirty-eight?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> hear that? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> hear that? There's {{my voice}} over there, and here I am here! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] whispered Sticky-toes.|$|R
6000|$|... "This stumps me," [...] {{declared}} the senator's son. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think Shadow and Plum {{are up to}} something between them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never make}} {{exception}}s. An exception disproves the rule. Have {{you ever had}} occasion to study character in handwriting? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this fellow's scribble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It assuredly is a mystery," [...] said Captain Putnam at last. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it, Mr. Strong?" [...] {{he asked}} {{of his second}} assistant.|$|R
6000|$|... "The string is {{exceedingly}} interesting," [...] he remarked, {{holding it up}} to the light and sniffing at it. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this string, Lestrade?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> him?" [...] asked Cecilia, {{returning}} a {{short time}} afterwards from a visit of investigation as to the sufficiency of Bessie's bedclothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lenore, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this?" [...] queried Anderson, {{turning to}} show her a small cake of some gray substance, soft and wet to the touch.|$|R
6000|$|... "And it {{is filled}} with natives," [...] added Phil. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this?" [...] he added, turning to Billy Dill. [...] "Are they coming here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but," [...] said Dan triumphantly, [...] "if {{you believe}} God answers prayers about {{particular}} things, it was Peter's prayer He answered. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Sahibs {{praying to}} a bull!" [...] What {{in the world}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> that?' said Bennett. [...] "'Disciple of a holy man!" [...] Is the boy mad?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It has {{certainly}} a character of its own. There are points of distinction about it. That {{change in the}} footprints, for example. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is queer, {{to say the}} least," [...] remarked Tom as {{they came}} to a halt in a small clearing. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it, Dick?" ...|$|R
6000|$|TARLETON. Singularly {{beautiful}} woman Summerhays. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> her? She {{must be a}} princess. Whats this family of warriors and statesmen that risk their lives every day? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A most {{extraordinary}} letter. Are all parents incurably mad? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] said the Head, handing a closely written eight pages to the Reverend John.|$|R
