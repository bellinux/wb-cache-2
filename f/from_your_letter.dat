2500|$|On {{the night}} of the murder, 16/17 December 1916, Rasputin was invited to Felix's {{apartment}} at the Moika Palace. He was told that Irina would be in residence and Rasputin would have an opportunity to meet her. Rasputin had often expressed interest in meeting the beautiful 21-year-old princess. Irina, however, was on a visit to the Crimea. Irina had been aware that Felix had talked about eliminating Rasputin and it was originally intended that she participate in the murder. [...] "You too must take part in it," [...] Felix wrote to her before the murder. [...] "Dm(itri) Pavl(ovich) knows all about it and is helping. It will all take place in the middle of December, when Dm(itri) comes back." [...] In late November 1916, Irina wrote to Felix: [...] "Thanks for your insane letter. I didn't understand the half of it. I see that you're planning to do something wild. Please take care and do not get mixed up in any shady business. The dirtiest thing is that you have decided to do it all without me. I don't see how I can take part in it now, since it's all arranged... In a word, be careful. I see <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> that you're in a state of wild enthusiasm and ready to climb a wall... I'll be in Petrograd on the 12th or 13th, so don't dare do anything without me, or else I won't come at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is what I {{understood}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters</b> to me, my dear Aristides. I {{am willing}} to leave the general argument for the present. But I should like to ask Mr. Thrall a question, and I hope it won't be offensive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am distressed for thee, {{my brother}} Jonathan!" [...] I have suffered, Clarinda, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter.</b> My soul was in arms at the sad perusal; I dreaded that I had acted wrong. If I have robbed you of a friend,[71] God forgive me! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>From</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> {{you seem}} to have taken an active feeling, to say the least, in this matter, that I would {{like to talk to you}} about. I could write, but do not want to do so. Why not come down here and see me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, my dear Cuthbert, I am glad {{indeed to}} see you, though <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> I had hardly hoped {{to do so}} for some little time. Come in, come in; my wife will be delighted to see you. Dinner is just on the table, so you have arrived at {{precisely}} the right moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I know <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters,</b> and <b>from</b> {{the fact}} of my absence from you making me think more about you, as much about you as those present. I very much enjoy a letter from Joan, which gives me a kind of tableau vivant of you all. That helps me to realize the home life; so do the photographs, they help in the same way. But <b>your</b> <b>letters,</b> {{and the fact that}} I think so much about them, and about you, are my real helps.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as {{it should}} be," [...] said Mr. John Knightley, [...] "and just as I hoped it was <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters.</b> Her wish of shewing you {{attention}} could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I {{had no idea of}} the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was not {{my fault}} {{that you did not}} see me sooner. I wrote to you that I only got <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> a month ago. You never {{answered}} the second I wrote you <b>from</b> Rome. <b>Your</b> <b>letter</b> lay there at the post ever so long, and was forwarded to me at Naples." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Cynthia answered, not in {{the least}} {{surprised}} by the admission, [...] "he did not tell me--but he will if I ask him. I guessed it <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter.</b> I heard that he had come back to-day, and I went to Coniston to see him, and he told me--he had been defeated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pity," [...] said Jack Bruce. [...] "If you'd {{mentioned}} {{that it was}} Joe who'd been training you, he {{would probably have been}} much more for it. You see, he couldn't know whether you were any good or not <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter.</b> But if you'd told him that Joe Bevan and Hunt both thought you good, he'd have seen there was something in it." ...|$|E
60|$|We are heartily glad {{to learn}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter,</b> just received, that, in all probability, by this time, {{you must have}} left the unhappy country in which you have been so long residing. I {{should not have been}} sorry if you had entered a little more into Peninsular politics; for what is going on there is {{shocking}} to humanity, and one would be glad to see anything like an opening for the termination of these unnatural troubles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing will persuade me that I didn't know {{everything}} about you, uncle. You are just exactly what I knew you would be in look, and voice, in manner and ways and everything. Of course, it is partly from what I remember, but I really did not see {{a great deal of}} you in those days; it is <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters,</b> I think, entirely that I knew all about you, and exactly what you were. Do you mean to say that I am not just what you thought I should be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Edgar," [...] {{he exclaimed}} as he warmly embraced him, [...] "where have you sprung <b>from?</b> <b>Your</b> last <b>letter</b> was <b>from</b> Smyrna three months ago. Mother," [...] he went on, turning round, [...] "let me {{introduce}} your boy to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I learn <b>from</b> <b>your</b> lord's <b>letter</b> {{that you}} will be, as usual, under pay from him while you are with me. I shall pay you as much more. 'Tis meet that, if you render me service, I should see that you are comfortable, and well contented." ...|$|R
60|$|Robert {{wrote in}} a playful vein to Kate, and you must {{not and will not}} care for that. He had {{understood}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> that you and the majority had all, like the 'Athenæum,' understood the 'Curse for a Nation' to be directed against England. Robert was furious about the 'Athenæum'; no other word describes him, and I thought that both I and Mr. Chorley would perish together, seeing that even the accusation (such a one!) made me infamous, it seemed.|$|E
6000|$|I {{now take}} it for granted that your father has {{forbidden}} our union; indeed this is the only conclusion that I can draw <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter.</b> Ferdinand, I can bear this, even this. Sustained by your affection, I will trust to time, to events, to the kindness of my friends, and to that overruling Providence, which will not desert affections so pure as ours, to bring about sooner or later some happier result. Confident in your love, I can live in solitude, and devote myself to your memory, I------ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Both {{myself and}} friend, then, are of opinion that {{little or nothing}} can be done toward tracing the parties you mention, until the place of their {{temporary}} residence after they left Aldborough has been discovered first. If this can be done, the sooner it is done the better. Judging <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter,</b> some weeks must have passed since the lawyer received his information that they had shifted their quarters. As they are both remarkable-looking people, the strangers who may have assisted them on their travels have probably not forgotten them yet. Nevertheless, expedition is desirable.|$|E
5000|$|Husayn and his {{followers}} were two days away from Kufa when they were intercepted by the vanguard of Yazid's army; about 1,000 men led by Hurr ibn Riahy. Husayn asked the army, [...] "With us or against us?" [...] They replied: [...] "Of course against you, oh Aba Abd Allah!" [...] Husayn ibn Ali said: [...] "If you are different from what I received <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters</b> and <b>from</b> <b>your</b> messengers then I will return to where I came from." [...] Their leader, Hurr, refused Husayn's request to let him return to Medina. The caravan of Muhammad's family arrived at Karbala on Muharram 2, 61 AH (October 2, 680 AD). They were forced to pitch a camp on the dry, bare land and Hurr stationed his army nearby.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, yes, I'm so glad, my child, that you've {{got over}} safe. It is all ready, and {{everything}} so well arranged, that nothing but misfortune could hinder you settling as, with God's grace, becomes 'ee. Close to your mother's door a'most, 'twill {{be a great}} blessing, I'm sure; and I was very glad to find <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters</b> that you'd held your word sacred. That's right--make your word your bond always. Mrs. Wace {{seems to be a}} sensible woman. I hope the Lord will do for her as he's doing for you no long time hence. And how did 'ee get over the terrible journey from Tor- upon-Sea to Pen-zephyr? Once you'd done with the railway, of course, you seemed quite at home. Well, Baptista, conduct yourself seemly, and all will be well.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! that is {{a subject}} which I have not forgotten,' replied Coningsby. 'I know <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters</b> how deeply it has engaged your thoughts. I confess to you that it has often filled mine with perplexity and depression. When we were at Eton, and both of us {{impregnated}} with the contrary prejudices in which we had been brought up, there was still between us one common ground of sympathy and trust; we reposed with confidence and affection in the bosom of our Church. Time and thought, with both of us, have only matured the spontaneous veneration of our boyhood. But time and thought have also shown me that the Church of our heart {{is not in a}} position, as regards the community, consonant with its original and essential character, or with the welfare of the nation.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But Lord Castlewell {{came in the}} way, and I {{supposed}} [...] him {{naturally to}} be as beautiful and gracious as he is [...] gorgeous and rich. But though you say nothing about him [...] there does creep out <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> some kind of idea [...] {{that he is not}} quite so beautiful in your eyes as was [...] poor Frank. Remember that poor Frank has to wear two blue [...] shirts a week and no more, in order to save the washing! [...] How many does Lord Castlewell wear? How many will he wear [...] when he is a marquis? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guessed as much, of course, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter,</b> Mr. Carnegie," [...] Isabel said, {{playing with}} her fan with downcast eyes, as he pressed his offer upon her; [...] "and I really didn't {{know whether it was}} right of me to come here without showing it to mamma and asking her advice about it. But I'm quite sure I oughtn't to give you an answer at once, because I've seen so very little of you. Let us leave the {{question}} open for a little. It's asking so much to ask one for a definite reply on such a very short acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{to begin}} with: I gather <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> {{that you have}} wisely decided to try the Thorpe Ambrose experiment, and to secure, if you can, an {{excellent}} position at starting by becoming a member of Major Milroy's household. If the circumstances turn against you, and some other woman gets the governess's place (about which I shall have something more to say presently), you will then {{have no choice but}} to make Mr. Armadale's acquaintance in some other character. In any case, you will want my assistance; and the first question, therefore, to set at rest between us is the question of what I am willing to do, and what I can do, to help you.|$|E
5000|$|To the Dearest Friend in the World: No {{woman in}} the world is happier than I am. I know that you are now to come to me and be my own. I can tell <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters</b> that you are the man I want. It does not take one long to tell when to like a person, and you I like better than anyone in the world, I know. Think how we will enjoy each other's company. You, the sweetest man in the whole world. We will be all alone with each other. Can you {{conceive}} of anything nicer? I think of you constantly. When I hear your name mentioned, and this is when one of the dear children speaks of you, or I hear myself humming it with the words of an old love song, it is beautiful music to my ears.My heart beats in wild rapture for you, My Andrew, I love you. Come prepared to stay forever.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{gathered}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> last <b>letter</b> that Miss Yelverton was {{to pay you}} a {{visit this}} autumn, in your capacity of her guardian. If she is already with you, pray move heaven and earth to keep her at The Glen Tower till I come back. Do you anticipate my confession from this entreaty? My dear, dear father, all my hopes rest on that one darling treasure which you are guarding perhaps, at this moment, under your own roof--all my happiness depends on making Jessie Yelverton my wife.|$|R

6000|$|We {{might be}} tempted to call good letter-writing one of “the little {{handicraft}} of an idle man”; but then two of the most perfect masters of the art were Cicero and Voltaire, two of the most occupied personages that ever lived. Of course, sentences emerge in Mr. Gladstone’s letters that are the fruits of his experience, well worthy of a note, as when he says to Dr. Pusey: “I doubt <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> whether you are aware of the virulence and intensity with which the poison of suspicion acts in public life. All that you say in your letter of yesterday I can readily believe, but I assure you it does not alter in the slightest degree the grounds on which my last letter was written.” ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have all}} here been made happy in hearing {{that you are}} so much better. I write now chiefly on account of a mistake which {{you seem to be}} under {{concerning}} Coleridge. I guess <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> that you suppose him to be appointed to the place of Secretary to Sir A. Ball. This {{is by no means the}} case. He is an occasional substitute for Mr. Chapman, who is secretary, and no doubt must have resumed his office long before this; as he had been expected every day some time before the date of C.'s last letter. The paragraph in the Paper (which we also saw) positively states that C. is appointed Secretary. This is an error, and has been merely put in upon common rumour.|$|E
6000|$|... "SIR--I {{have just}} {{received}} your mysterious letter. It {{has more than}} surprised, it has really alarmed me. After having made the friendliest advances to you on my side, I find myself suddenly shut out from your confidence in the most unintelligible, and, I must add, the most discourteous manner. It is quite impossible that I can allow the matter to rest where you have left it. The only conclusion I can draw <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> is that my confidence must have been abused in some way, and that you {{know a great deal}} more than you are willing to tell me. Speaking in the interest of my daughter's welfare, I request that you will inform me what the circumstances are which have prevented your seeing Mrs. Mandeville, and which have led to the withdrawal of the assistance that you unconditionally promised me in your letter of Monday last.|$|E
6000|$|DR. SIR,--We {{take the}} liberty to address you this, {{in place of}} a letter which we had {{recently}} written and was about to forward to you, not knowing your arrival home was expected so soon. We are desirous of obtaining from you a work of some kind, perhaps compiled <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters</b> <b>from</b> the East, &c., with such interesting additions as may be proper. We are the publishers of A. D. Richardson's works, and flatter ourselves that we can give an author as favorable terms and do as full justice to his productions as any other house in the country. We are perhaps the oldest subscription house in the country, and have never failed to give a book an immense circulation. We sold about 100,000 copies of Richardson's F. D. & E. (Field, Dungeon and Escape) and are now printing 41,000, of [...] "Beyond the Mississippi," [...] and large orders ahead. If you have any thought of writing a book, or could be induced to do so, we should be pleased to see you; and will do so. Will you do us the favor to reply at once, at your earliest convenience.|$|R
6000|$|Dearest Ferdinand, I {{wish to be}} calm. <b>Your</b> <b>letter</b> {{occasions}} me {{very serious}} uneasiness. I quarrel not with its tone of affection. It is fond, very fond, and there were moments when I could have melted over such expressions; but, Ferdinand, it is not candid. Why are we separated? For a purpose. Is that purpose effected? Were I to judge only <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>letters,</b> I should even suppose that you had not spoken to your father; but that is, of course, impossible. Your father disapproves of our union. I feel it; I know it; I was even prepared for it. Come, then, and speak to my father. It is due to me not to leave him any more in the dark; it will be better, believe me, for yourself, that he should share our confidence. Papa is not a rich man, but he loves his daughter. Let us make him our friend. Ah! why did I ever conceal anything from one so kind and good? In this moment of desolation, I feel, I keenly feel, my folly, my wickedness. I {{have no one to}} speak to, no one to console me. This constant struggle to conceal my feelings will kill me. It was painful when all was joy, but now, O Ferdinand! I can endure this life no longer. My brain is weak, my spirit perplexed and broken. I will not say if you love; but, Ferdinand, if you pity me, write, and write definitely, to your unhappy ...|$|R
