60|$|An {{accessibility}} to {{the sentiments of}} others on subjects of importance often accompanies feeble minds, yet {{it is not the}} less a true and constituent part of practical greatness, when it exists wholly free from that passiveness to impression which renders counsel itself injurious to certain characters, and from that weakness of heart which, in the literal sense of the word, is always craving advice. Exempt from all such imperfections, say rather in perfect harmony with the excellences that preclude them, this openness to the influxes of good sense and information, from whatever quarter they might come, equally characterised both Lord Nelson and Sir Alexander Ball, though each displayed it in the way best suited to his natural temper. The former with easy hand collected, as it passed by him, whatever could add to his own stores, appropriated what he could assimilate, and levied subsidies of knowledge from all the accidents of social life and familiar intercourse. Even at the jovial board, and in the height of unrestrained merriment, a casual suggestion, that flashed a new light on his mind, changed the boon companion into the hero and the man of genius; and with the most <b>graceful</b> <b>transition</b> he would make his company as serious as himself. When the taper of his genius seemed extinguished, it was still surrounded by an inflammable atmosphere of its own, and rekindled at the first approach of light, and not seldom at a distance which made it seem to flame up self-revived. In Sir Alexander Ball, the same excellence was more an affair of system; and he would listen, even to weak men, with a patience, which, in so careful an economist of time, always demanded my admiration, and not seldom excited my wonder. It was one of his maxims, that a man may suggest what he cannot give; adding, that a wild or silly plan had more than once, from the vivid sense or distinct perception of its folly, occasioned him to see what ought to be done in a new light, or with a clearer insight. There is, indeed, a hopeless sterility, a mere negation of sense and thought, which, suggesting neither difference nor contrast, cannot even furnish hints for recollection. But on the other hand, there are minds so whimsically constituted, that they may sometimes be profitably interpreted by contraries, a process of which the great Tycho Brahe is said to have availed himself {{in the case of the}} little Lackwit, who used to sit and mutter at his feet while he was studying. A mind of this sort we may compare to a magnetic needle, the poles of which have been suddenly reversed by a flash of lightning, or other more obscure accident of nature. It may be safely concluded, that to those whose judgment or information he respected, Sir Alexander Ball did not content himself with giving access and attention. No! he seldom failed of consulting them whenever the subject permitted any disclosure; and where secrecy was necessary, he well knew how to acquire their opinion without exciting even a conjecture concerning his immediate object.|$|E

40|$|Gaits {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of the design method of robots heading to complex terrains. But research into optimal ways to transition between different gaits is still lacking, and is the primary motivation behind this research. An essential characteristic of gaits is periodicity, and considering that a novel notion of <b>graceful</b> <b>transition</b> is proposed: a <b>graceful</b> <b>transition</b> is one that has maximally persisting periodicity. This particular notion of persistence in the characteristic behavior can be generalized. Therefore, a comprehensive framework for the general problem of connecting any two trajectories of a dynamical system, with an underlying characteristic behavior, over a finite time interval and in a manner that the behavior persists maximally during the transition, is developed and presented. This transition is called the Gluskabi Raccordation, and the characteristic behavior is defined by a kernel representation. Along with establishing this framework, the kernel representations for some interesting characteristic behaviors are also identified. The problem of finding the Gluskabi Raccordations is then solved for different combinations of characteristic behaviors and dynamical systems, and compact widely applicable results are obtained. Lastly, the problem of finding graceful gait transitions is treated within this newly established broader framework, and these graceful gait transitions are obtained for the case of a two-piece worm model.

Specifically, we describe an interleaved imaging architecture comprising two collections of pixels. One set of pixels is monochromatic and high sensitivity; a second, interleaved set of pixels is trichromatic and lower sensitivity. The sensor implementation requires new image processing techniques that allow for <b>graceful</b> <b>transitions</b> between different operating conditions.

There is an urgent need to develop and deploy an approach to addressing and routing which solves these problems and allows scaling to several orders of magnitude larger than the existing Internet. However, it is necessary for any change to be deployed in an incremental manner, allowing <b>graceful</b> <b>transition</b> from the current Internet without disruption of service.

40|$|The {{construction}} grammar framework {{provides a}} rich formalism for {{the characterization of}} development in language acquisition, {{in part because it}} allows for a <b>graceful</b> <b>transition</b> from idiom-like holophrases, to fully abstract argument constructions. From the perspective of learning complexity, this means that rather than mastering the grammar used by an adult to generate or understand an utterance, the child can exploit more direct correspondences between fixed utterances and their meanings in the form of holophrases, and then progressively apply procedures for generalization in order to develop an abstract argument construction repertoire. The current chapter presents a neuro-computational model that addresses aspects of the construction grammar formalism, and uses this model to explain a possible trajectory from idiom-like holophrases to progressively more abstract argument constructions. The goal of the current research is thus to test a theory of form to meaning mapping that takes substantial input from the proposals of usage based construction grammar (Goldberg 1995, 1998; Croft 2001; Clark 2003, Tomasello 1999, 2003) analogical mapping from sentence to meaning (Fisher 1996), and cue coalitions that specify or identify the mappings (Bates et al. 1982).

In his readings of Hume, Gibbon, Johnson or Boswell, he would have found a philosophical approach to biography similar to his own. This approach implied a condensation of universal characteristics in the delineation of one single character, and an inextinguishable defence of the formative nature of all literature, inclusive of biography. The fact that Wollstonecraft had provided a variety of what the times considered scandals is of no matter to Godwin. Her mind and acts were in his view a consequence of her social and personal contingency - a view anchored in Political Justice - and it all could teach an example. My article shows how Godwin drank in the biographical tradition of his day, but also how his distinctive Dissenting insistence on detail, and his reckless adherence to truth - also remnants from Political Justice - marked his Memoirs of Mary Wollstonecraft as typical in his canon.

I present four examples {{from my own}} work, two large data analyses problems in fisheries, and two more abstract programming examples. Hopefully these will be of intrinsic interest, but together they encapsulate why I think useRs find R so invaluable. My thesis is that good data analysis and modelling require the practitioner to engage interactively with data, and that at some level programming becomes essential to this. This {{is essentially the same}} message as that presented in Chambers (1998, 2008), and the same idea implicitly underlies (Venables and Ripley, 2002).

Project X is a proposed high intensity proton facility intended to support a world-leading program in neutrino and flavor physics {{over the next two}} decades at Fermilab while also providing an upgrade path to drive a neutrino factory and/or a muon collider. Project X is an integral part of the Fermilab Roadmap as described in the Fermilab Steering Group Report of August 2007 and of the Intensity Frontier science program described in the P 5 report of May 2008. The primary elements of that research program to be supported by Project X include: (1) A neutrino beam for long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. A new 2 megawatt proton source with proton energies between 50 and 120 GeV would produce intense neutrino beams, directed toward a large detector located in a distant underground laboratory. (2) Kaon and muon based precision experiments running simultaneously with the neutrino program. These could include a world leading muon-to-electron conversion experiment and world leading rare kaon decay experiments.

This path requires that the new proton source have significant upgrade potential beyond the initial uses. This paper suggests that an implementation of Project X based on a CW linac can be part of a continuous synergistic transition from a muon physics program in the 'Booster era' to the Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider.

40|$|Masked {{proportional}} routing is {{an improved}} procedure for choosing links between adjacent nodes {{of a network}} {{for the purpose of}} transporting an entity from a source node ("A") to a destination node ("B"). The entity could be, for example, a physical object to be shipped, in which case the nodes would represent waypoints and the links would represent roads or other paths between waypoints. For another example, the entity could be a message or packet of data to be transmitted from A to B, in which case the nodes could be computer-controlled switching stations and the links could be communication channels between the stations. In yet another example, an entity could represent a workpiece while links and nodes could represent, respectively, manufacturing processes and stages in the progress of the workpiece towards a finished product. More generally, the nodes could represent states of an entity and the links could represent allowed transitions of the entity. The purpose of masked proportional routing and of related prior routing procedures is to schedule transitions of entities from their initial states ("A") to their final states ("B") in such a manner as to minimize a cost or to attain some other measure of optimality or efficiency. Masked proportional routing follows a distributed (in the sense of decentralized) approach to probabilistically or deterministically choosing the links. It was developed to satisfy a need for a routing procedure that 1. Does not always choose the same link(s), even for two instances characterized by identical estimated values of associated cost functions; 2. Enables a <b>graceful</b> <b>transition</b> from one set of links to another set of links as the circumstances of operation of the network change over time; 3.

40|$|Ouvrage (éditeur). Despite {{the fact}} that network {{operators}} and manufacturers face a major financial crisis, the size and importance of the Internet continue to grow at amazing speeds. At {{the core of the}} Internet, optical switches are replacing traditional switches, allowing data to flow at unprecedented speeds. At the edges, digital subscriber line (DSL) is becoming the technology of choice; within every home it is now possible to permanently connect multiple devices to the Internet. Wireless LAN (WLAN) hotspots are becoming commonplace, allowing people to connect to the Internet independent of whether they are flying in a plane, travelling on a train, or sitting on a terrace. Considering the importance of the Internet in our economic and daily life, it is remarkable that technologies to manage the Internet get limited attention. Since the late 1980 s, the Internet standard management framework has been based on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). In the ' 90 s, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defined several new versions; the latest one, SNMPv 3, has already been a full Internet standard for many years. However, despite its success, there is common agreement that SNMP technology will be unable to solve all future Internet management problems. Although it is likely that SNMP will remain the protocol of choice for many monitoring tasks, it is not the ideal technology for tasks such as configuration management. In fact, further progress in SNMP technology is unlikely to occur, and new versions of SNMP should no longer be expected. As argued in the October 2003 issue of IEEE Communications Magazine, the evolutionary approaches to enhancing SNMP failed, so it seems {{the time has come for}} revolutionary approaches. Of such approaches, the most promising ones build on Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Web services technologies. In this issue of this magazine, an overview of research and recent developments in that area will therefore be presented. The first article by George Pavlou et al. provides an overview of existing management technologies, such as open systems integration (OSI), SNMP, open distributed processing (ODP), and Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), and the potential of new technologies such as Web services. Based on the example of the TCP connection table, the authors show how to use these technologies for management purposes. Since there have been many discussions on the performance of XML and Web services technologies, the authors conclude with a performance comparison between SNMP, CORBA, and Web services. Of key importance in network and service management is the ability to define management information in a standardized way. In the past several languages have been defined for that purpose; examples are Guidelines for the Definition of Managed Objects (GDMO), Structure of Management Information (SMI), and MOF. Because of the existence of many tools, XML seems to be the most appropriate syntactic framework to define such information in the future. The second article, by Jorge E. López de Vergara et al., discusses the use of XML for that purpose and proposes the use of ontology languages to enhance the semantic expressiveness of management definitions. In particular, they propose the use of OWL, the Web Ontology Language. Even in revolutionary approaches, it remains important to allow <b>graceful</b> <b>transition</b> from current management information definitions toward future ones. The third article, by Torsten Klie and Frank Strauβ, discusses such a transition and shows how existing SMI management information base (MIB) modules can be converted into new XML schema definitions. Furthermore, the article presents an SNMP-to-XML gateway that allows the retrieval of XML encoded management information in heterogeneous environments. The fourth article, by Mi-Jung Choi et al., discusses the use of XML to facilitate IP configuration management. This topic is the subject of current standardization within the IETF Net- Conf Working Group. The article therefore starts with an overview of NetConf, and continues with presenting the specific XML-based configuration management system that was designed and implemented by the authors. The fifth article, by Lawrence Menten, discusses experiences in exploring and designing XML-based network management solutions for products ranging from smallresource-limited devices to high-capacity server-hosted control plane monitoring systems. The article concludes that the adoption of XML representations and tools for device management will dramatically improve the completeness, flexibility, and robustness of the management infrastructure on devices with both large resources and small. The last article, by Raouf Boutaba et al., is a good example of the potential use of Web services technology. The article presents the design and implementation of a user-controlled lightpath management system, which internally relies on XML and other Web services technologies, like SOAP and WSDL. This article provides an excellent proof that XML-based management is not only a topic for future research, but has already become an operational reality.

40|$|A {{classical}} and quantum mechanical generalized second law of thermodynamics in cosmology implies {{constraints on the}} effective equation of state of the universe {{in the form of}} energy conditions, obeyed by many known cosmological solutions, and is compatible with entropy bounds which forbid certain cosmological singularities. In string cosmology the second law provides new information about the existence of non-singular solutions, {{and the nature of the}} <b>graceful</b> exit <b>transition</b> from dilaton-driven inflation. Typeset using REVTEX 1 The existence of cosmological singularities and their nature has been intensely investigated, relying on the celebrated singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose [1], who concluded that if sources in Einstein’s equations obey certain energy conditions, cosmological singularities are inevitable. Entropy considerations were brought in only much later, when Bekenstein [2] argued that if the entropy of a visible part of the universe obeys the usual entropy bound from nearly flat space situations [3], certain cosmological singularitie...|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} second law in string cosmology {{accounts for}} geometric and quantum entropy {{in addition to}} ordinary sources of entropy. The proposed generalized second law forbids singular string cosmologies, under certain conditions, and forces a <b>graceful</b> exit <b>transition</b> from dilaton-driven inflation by bounding curvature and dilaton kinetic energy. Typeset using REVTEX 1 String theory is a consistent theory of quantum gravity, {{with the power to}} describe high curvature regions of space-time [1], and as such we could expect it to teach us about the fate of cosmological singularities, with the expectation that singularities are smoothed and turned into brief epochs of high curvature. However, many attempts to seduce an answer out of string theory regarding cosmological singularities have failed so far, even after the wave of recent new developments and results [2]. The reason is probably that most recent technical advancements in string theory rely heavily on supersymmetry, but generic time dependent solutions break all supersymmetries, and therefore known methods are less powerful whe...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{communication}} systems usually {{suffer from the}} threshold effect when channel signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR) fluctuates unpredictably in wireless and mobile scenarios. The SoftCast scheme, however, provides <b>graceful</b> quality <b>transition</b> in wide CSNR range. In SoftCast, input image is decorrelated by a transform and modulated directly to a dense constellation for transmission, leaving out the conventional quantization, entropy coding and channel coding. A key point of SoftCast is that the transmission power needs to be allocated among the transform coefficients unequally, according to the energy of coefficients. Importantly, the energy diversity used to guide power allocation should be shared between the sender and the receiver for correct decoding. This paper addresses the power distortion optimization problem, introducing a new adaptive chunk division scheme to describe the energy diversity among coefficients. A concrete algorithm is developed to determine the chunk boundaries that achieve optimal transmission power usage. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed scheme can improve the performance of the original SoftCast by 4 ∼ 8 dB using a smaller number of chunks. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
