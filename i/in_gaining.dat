In support of our interpretation of this effect in terms of global changes <b>in</b> <b>gain,</b> we further show that the measured pupillary and behavioral variables are strongly correlated with global changes in the strength and clustering of functional connectivity, as brain-wide fluctuations of gain would predict...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In precollicular decerebrate cats, the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) was {{intermittently}} recorded {{from the}} triceps brachii during sinusoidal roll tilt {{of the whole}} animal (at 0. 15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees), leading to selective stimulation of labyrinth receptors. This reflex, tested during and after a 3 -h period of sustained animal tilt at the same parameters indicated above, showed an adaptive increase <b>in</b> <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> some experiments but not in others. In a second group of experiments, however, rotation of the head (at 0. 15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees) {{was associated with a}} synchronous body rotation (at 0. 15 Hz, +/- 12. 5 degrees) which led to an additional neck input, due to 2. 5 degrees of out-phase body-to-head displacement. In these experiments, the VSR, tested every 10 - 15 min, consistently showed an adaptive increase <b>in</b> <b>gain</b> during and after a 3 -h period of sustained vestibular and neck stimulation. Microinjection into the cerebellar anterior vermis of beta-adrenergic agents (0. 25 mu l at 8 mu g/mu l saline) produced slight and short-lasting changes in the basic amplitude of the VSR, due to the neuromodulatory influence of these agents on the Purkinje cells activity. In addition, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol brought to the light an adaptive process in those experiments in which no adaptation occurred during a sustained roll tilt of the whole animal. On the other hand, the beta-adrenergic antagonists propranolol or sotalol either suppressed the increase <b>in</b> <b>gain</b> of the VSR which occurred in other experiments during sustained animal rotation, or prevented the occurrence of an adaptive increase <b>in</b> <b>gain</b> during a continuous out-phase head and body rotation. We conclude that the adaptive changes <b>in</b> <b>gain</b> of the VSR are facilitated by the noradrenergic system acting within the cerebellar cortex through beta-adrenoceptors...|$|R
5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then {{it may be that the}} marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>gaining</b> the throne for him.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{explicit}} grammar instruction on grammatical knowledge and writing proficiency in first-year students of French at a UK university. Previous research suggests that explicit grammar instruction results <b>in</b> <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> explicit knowledge and its application in specific grammar-related tasks, but there is less evidence that it results <b>in</b> <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> production tasks. A cohort of 12 students received a course in French grammar immediately prior to their university studies {{in order to determine}} whether a short but intensive burst of explicit instruction, a pedagogical approach hitherto unexamined in the literature, was sufficiently powerful to bring about an improvement in their grammatical knowledge and performance in production tasks. Participants were tested at three points over five months, and the results were compared with a group which did not receive the intervention. Our results support previous findings that explicit instruction leads to <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> some aspects of grammar tests but not <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> accuracy in either translation or free composition. Reasons for these findings are discussed in relation to theories of language development and the limitations of working memory. ...|$|R
5|$|As {{happened}} to {{other members of}} the royal family, Boril's ascension forced Strez and his closest supporters to flee, in that case to neighbouring Serbia, where he was welcomed by the reigning Stefan Nemanjić (1196–1228) in 1207 or early 1208. Even though Boril requested the extradition of Strez to Bulgaria, the Serbian ruler hoped to use Strez as a puppet <b>in</b> <b>gaining</b> Bulgarian-held territory. Stefan believed that Strez's royal ancestry and imperial aspirations would make it much easier to impose Serbian rule over Macedonia, Kosovo and Braničevo, as well as Belgrade, all captured by Bulgaria under Kaloyan. At the same time, Boril was unable to take military action against Strez and his Serbian patron, as he had suffered a major defeat {{at the hands of the}} Latins at Plovdiv. Stefan went as far as to become a blood brother of Strez in a ceremony which Stefan was hoping would secure Strez's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|As the {{two worlds}} begin to merge, Dusk and Alba reveal their {{plans to go to}} the ancient {{floating}} city known as Mysidia. Once the Warriors of Light arrive and meet the Elder of Mysidia, Sophia, the Avalon Empire attempt to strike Mysidia with their airship superweapon Heliogabalus. The warriors destroy the ship with the aid of Dr. Lugae, the living doll Argy, and Barbara and her dragons. Sophia then helps the warriors gain the last remaining crystal in the World of Light within the caves of Mysidia. After gaining the crystal's ability, Mysidia falls to the ground while simultaneously the Warriors of Darkness are aided by a mysterious man known as The Mask <b>in</b> <b>gaining</b> the last crystal fragment remaining in the World of Darkness. They succeed <b>in</b> <b>gaining</b> the fragment, however The Mask dies. Before his death, he reveals himself to be Elgo's other half that formed when the world split in two and asks the Warriors of Darkness {{to take care of his}} other Half as he dies. After both parties gain the fragments, the split world merges and both parties are reunited, however most of the people in the world have disappeared. Attempting to make a frontal attack to the Avalon Empire, the warriors discover a barrier protecting Avalon and eight gates across the world, linking to a realm called the Rift. Upon entering one of the gates, the warriors encounter a dark sphere in which Sophia explains it is a substance found only in the Rift known as Dark Matter, and that Avalon's goal is to harvest it for their evil purposes. Vata explains the Avalon Empire is guarding the dark matter across the world with their generals, who have been revived in undead forms. After collecting all eight pieces of the dark matter and defeating the undead generals, the dark matter fuses together, creating a new crystal and revealing that the crystal split the world to protect itself from the Empire's plans. The crystal then breaks the barrier that was protecting Avalon, allowing the warriors to enter.|$|E
