40|$|To {{evaluate}} two {{psychometric properties}} of the French versions of the <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Beliefs and <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Implementation scales, namely their internal consistency and construct validity. The <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Beliefs and <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Implementation scales developed by Melnyk et al. are recognised as valid, reliable instruments in English. However, no psychometric validation for their French versions existed. Secondary analysis of a cross sectional survey. Source data came from a cross-sectional descriptive study sample of 382 nurses and other allied healthcare providers. Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate internal consistency, and principal axis factor analysis and varimax rotation were computed to determine construct validity. The French <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Beliefs and <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Implementation scales showed excellent reliability, with Cronbach's alphas close to the scores established by Melnyk et al. 's original versions. Principal axis factor analysis showed medium-to-high factor loading scores without obtaining collinearity. Principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation of the 16 -item <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Beliefs scale resulted in a four-factor loading structure. Principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation of the 17 -item <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Implementation scale revealed a two-factor loading structure. Further research should attempt to understand why the French <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Implementation scale showed a two-factor loading structure but Melnyk et al. 's original has only one. The French versions of the <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Beliefs and <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Implementation scales can both be considered valid and reliable instruments for measuring <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice beliefs and implementation. The results suggest that the French <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Beliefs and <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice Implementation scales are valid and reliable and can therefore be used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} organisational strategies aimed at increasing professionals' confidence in <b>Evidence-Based</b> Practice, supporting its use and implementation...|$|R

50|$|According to {{this new}} theory, homeostatic {{imbalance}} includes the 'Circle of Discontent', a system of feedback loops linking weight gain, body dissatisfaction, negative affect and over-consumption. The theory is consistent with an extensive <b>evidence-base</b> of cross-sectional and prospective studies. A four-armed strategy to halt the obesity epidemic consists of: (1) Putting a stop to victim-blaming, stigma and discrimination; (2) Devalorizing the thin-ideal; (3) Reducing consumption of energy-dense, low nutrient foods and drinks; (4) Improving access to plant-based diets. If fully implemented, interventions designed to restore homeostasis would halt the obesity epidemic.|$|E
