6000|$|... "Good gracious!" [...] Sudden {{enlightenment}} {{came upon}} Sally. [...] "That photograph we were hunting for when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here!</b> Had you stolen {{it all the}} time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think he}} does himself no good by the habit that has {{increased}} upon him since <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> He is often very nervous--or I fancy so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's true," [...] he said, [...] "that when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> I was {{temporarily}} resting, so to speak; but didn't I go {{right out and}} grab the managership of your new hotel? Positively!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When my {{circumstances}} {{got to be}} not so good as formerly, through {{not being}} honestly dealt by, and <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to be custodian," [...] said the old man, [...] "--which was upwards of fifty years ago--where's my son William? More {{than half a century}} ago, William!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} in your service, Sir,' said Susan Nipper, with her usual rapidity, 'now twelve 'year a waiting on Miss Floy my own young lady who couldn't speak plain when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> and <b>I</b> was old in this house when Mrs Richards was new, I may not be Meethosalem, but I am not a child in arms.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{answer you}} civilly when {{you spoke to}} me some little time since. I mean when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> in <b>here</b> {{along with the rest}} of them. I apologize. Shake hands! How are you? Ready for the march?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When? It {{was hanging}} on its usual nail when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> this afternoon. I {{remember}} the door being open, and my glancing {{into the room}} casually. I am sure it was there then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you {{had asked}} me when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here,</b> I should have said no. I must say now - even at the hazard of {{appearing}} to make a pretence, and of justly awakening your incredulity - yes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I do {{not think}} they are, Matteo. I do not {{remember}} now, but I do know, when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here,</b> I was struck with {{the brightness of the}} stars, so I suppose {{there must have been a}} difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are an old friend, Doctor, and {{you will}} {{understand}} my case, and make more allowances for it than most people would. When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> out <b>here</b> <b>I</b> dare say you heard some sort of reports as to why I had left the army and had afterwards entered the Civil Service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How refreshingly {{healthy and}} well you look!" [...] {{a young man}} of some six and twenty years old, named Johnson, said. [...] "I was {{something}} like that, when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> out <b>here,</b> though you'd hardly think it now. Eight years of stewing, in this horrible hole, takes the life and spirits out of anyone.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't. You must {{listen to}} me <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to say what I have {{wanted to tell you}} for a long time. I love you, and I ask you to marry me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not as I am, but as I {{was when}} <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> too; as sanguine, giddy, youthful, inexperienced; flushed {{with the same}} restless and adventurous fancies; and full of the same qualities, fraught with the same {{capacity}} of leading on to good or evil.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She made {{a slight}} {{negative}} sign. He {{must have been}} observing her, putting two and two together. After a pause he said simply: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> I thought you were governess to these girls. My sister didn't {{say a word about}} you to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is fully}} that length of time," [...] said the ghost, [...] "since <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> Mine {{is not an}} {{ordinary}} case. But before I say anything more about it, {{let me ask you}} again if you are sure Mr. Hinckman will not return to-night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said, when {{he heard}} the cause of the uproar; [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> out <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> should have done the same, and should have {{regarded}} the certainty of being knocked on the head as cheerfully as you do. Eight years out here takes the enthusiasm out of a man, and I shall wait quietly to see whether we are to be transferred to Calcutta, or shipped back to England." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{was a great}} fan of Whiteman when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> down <b>here</b> from Boston. He was the <b>first</b> {{big name}} <b>I</b> {{actually}} followed around and met. I was having {{a love affair with}} New York when Whiteman commissioned me to write a tone poem. I walked around this city for six months absorbing the sights and sounds. And then suddenly it came to me. Once I plunged into it I finished it in two hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{keep track}} of the years," [...] said Miss Cuttenclip, laughing. [...] "You see, I don't grow up at all, but stay just the same as <b>I</b> was when <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> Perhaps I'm older even than you are, madam; but I couldn't say for sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Betteredge," [...] he said, [...] "how {{does the}} {{atmosphere}} of mystery and suspicion {{in which we are}} all living now, agree with you? Do you remember that morning when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> with the Moonstone? I wish to God we had thrown it into the quicksand!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Miss Dartle,' I returned, 'how shall I tell you, so {{that you}} will believe me, that I know of nothing in Steerforth {{different}} from what there was when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here?</b> I can think of nothing. I firmly believe there is nothing. I hardly understand even what you mean.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should call}} it the countess's," [...] he answered. [...] "It was the gossip of the county when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here,</b> but other curious things have {{happened}} among us to push it gradually out of memory. Most people, I really believe, have quite forgotten that the Countess of --- once served behind a baker's counter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{more than}} I do then. That's not what I've come for, but I shall be delighted if I humiliate {{you a little}} by the way. I've two things in mind, and I'll mention the most {{difficult}} <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> the other day--the day after my arrival in town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> out <b>here</b> from Toronto it {{was much}} the same with me, and there was nobody to teach me. It's {{fortunate}} that men are not very fastidious {{in this part of}} Canada. In any case I had, perhaps, better mention that while I would be glad to pay you at the usual rate and you would be required to help, you would live with us as one of the family. I want a companion. With my husband at work from sunup until dark, it's often lonely here. Besides, the arrangement would give you an opportunity for learning a little and finding out how you like the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barney winked expressively. [...] "Ah, boy, I wish I may niver have a worse. Ye see, when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>comed</b> <b>here,</b> {{about four}} months ago, I found that the mine was owned by an Irish gintleman; an', like all the race, he's a trump. He took to me at wance when he hear'd my voice, and then he took more to me when he comed to know me character; and says he to me wan day, `Barney,' says he, `I'm gittin' tired o' this kind o' life now, and if ye'll agree to stop here as overseer, and sind me the {{proceeds}} o' the mine to Rio Janeiro, a great city on the sea-coast an' the capital o' Brazil, I'll give ye a good share o' the profits. But,' says he, `ye'll need to pretind ye're a Roosian, or a Pole, or somethin' o' that kind; for the fellows in thim parts are great rascals, and there's a few Englishmen among them who would soon find out that ye're only a jack-tar before the mast and would chate ye at no allowance; but if ye could spake no language under the sun but the gibberish pecooliar to the unbeknown provinces o' Siberia, ye could escape detection as far as yer voice is consarned; and by lettin' yer beard grow as long as possible, and dressin' yersilf properly, ye might pass, and be as dignified as the great Mogul.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A week ago," [...] Mr. Blatherwick said, [...] "I {{should have}} replied that his lordship's {{state of mind}} was {{exactly the same as}} when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> But there has been a change for the worse during the last week. It {{commenced}} with his sudden, and I am bound to say, unfounded suspicions of Miss Merton, whom I believe to be a most estimable and worthy young lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> I swore I'd 'keep up my interests.' Very lofty! I read Browning, {{and went}} to Minneapolis for the theaters. I thought I was 'keeping up.' But I guess the Village Virus had me already. I was reading four copies of cheap fiction-magazines to one poem. I'd put off the Minneapolis trips till I simply had to go there {{on a lot of}} legal matters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know I did," [...] he admitted, [...] "and now I don't want to any more, do you see? It's this cursed {{place and}} this cursed life! One's feet seem {{always on the}} sands. I wouldn't have {{believed}} it when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> Don't tease me, Sophy," [...] he added, turning toward her suddenly. [...] "I am rather inclined to despise myself these last few weeks. Don't make me worse--don't make me loathe myself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did, indeed,' responded Bob Sawyer, 'and I {{was just}} going to say that I wasn't at home, but if you'd leave a message I'd be sure to give it to myself; for he don't know me; no more does the Lighting and Paving. I think the Church-rates guesses who I am, and I know the Water-works does, because I drew a tooth of his when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> down <b>here.</b> But <b>come</b> in, come in!' Chattering in this way, Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed Mr. Winkle into the back room, where, amusing himself by boring little {{circular}} caverns in the chimney-piece with a red-hot poker, sat no less a person than Mr. Benjamin Allen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not quite}} know," [...] she said. [...] "When <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> I angered Sator Throg, because I repulsed him. He {{ordered me to}} be thrown {{into one of the}} great pits in the inner gardens. It was filled with banths. In my own country I had been {{accustomed}} to command. Something in my voice, I do not know what, cowed the beasts as they sprang to attack me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are so cold, {{so distant}} now," [...] she said gently. [...] "We were such good friends when <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> Thanet {{is a strange}} country to me. It seems weird and unkind--the woods are dark and lonely, that {{persistent}} sound of the sea fills me with a strange kind of dread.... My home was among the Surrey hills you know.... It is far from here.... I cannot afford to lose a friend...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{am quite}} sure that is {{the upper end of}} the pillar that {{supports}} the island. I noticed it when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> It has been hollowed out, you see, and something has been burned in the basin, for the fire has left its marks. I wondered what was under the great basin and got several of the Skeezers to come up here and try to lift it for me. They were strong men, but could not move it at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> I {{was a young}} bird, {{and there}} was a smith's anvil in this place. But from that time no work has been done upon it, save that every evening I have pecked at it, till now there is not so much as the size of a nut {{remaining}} thereof. Yet all that time I have never once heard of the man you name. Still, there is a race of beasts older than I, and I will guide you to them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Todd almost whistled {{before she}} gave her answer. [...] "Why, Miss Mackenzie, that's where they dance and play cards, and where the girls flirt and the young men make fools of themselves. I don't go there very often myself, because I don't care about flirting, and I'm too old for dancing. As for cards, I get plenty of them at home. I think I did put down my name and paid {{something}} when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>here,</b> but that's ever so many years ago. I don't go to the assembly rooms now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Andrews sang in a soulful type voice; {{she told}} the Milwaukee Journal after moving to Nashville, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> down <b>here</b> from Akron and met {{different}} people who listened to my tape they all said , 'You sound so different'. Later on {{they said it was}} good, but at the time it made me feel really bad". One of the reasons for Andrews’ unique voice was a result of surgery that removed a tumor from her thyroid. Andrews revealed that after the surgery, [...] "They didn't tell me I wasn't supposed to sing or talk loud for a year. I started singing after the operation and it lowered on me. It used to be three or four octaves higher. Now when I talk everyone thinks I have a cold." ...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1952 season, Ostendarp played halfback for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. In an {{interview}} with The Montreal Gazette, Ostendarp discussed the process of adjusting to Canadian rules: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>came</b> up <b>here</b> and learned that you only had three downs in which to make 10 yards. I wondered if a team ever moved the sticks. All I could think of is {{how difficult it is}} in American football where there are four downs. But I soon saw that it could be done. In fact, I think three downs makes it a better game for the crowd." [...] Ostendarp made the adjustment to Canadian rules, led the Big Four in rushing yards, and received the Lord Calvert Trophy as the Most Valuable Player on the 1952 Alouettes team.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{travel at}} <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> down <b>here</b> by chance, and {{resolved}} to cut myself utterly adrift from my old life {{and see if}} I could not forget you. I was not very successful." [...] He smiled down into her eyes. [...] "And you were going away tomorrow. How perilously near we have been to not meeting! But {{how are we going}} to explain all this to our friends along shore?" ...|$|R
