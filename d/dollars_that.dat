5|$|Objects from Puerto Rico are {{constantly}} featured in specialized magazines, in both {{national and international}} distribution. The Puerto Rican <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> were collected by the government, were burned between January 16–24, 1925, drastically {{reducing the amount of}} surviving notes from the Bank of Puerto Rico. The Great Depression reduced their numbers further, since necessity prevented the collection of pesos in large denominations. Thus less than five exemplars are known to exist of the 100 and 200 peso banknotes issued by El Banco Español de Puerto Rico and the 5 and 10 dollars Series F bills published by the Bank of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{means of}} paying for the statue was a commemorative coin. In early 1899, the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $50,000 {{in the form of}} 100,000 commemorative half <b>dollars,</b> <b>that</b> could be sold to the public at a premium. Such a method had helped to finance (though with mixed success) the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Instead, Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3, 1899, a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50,000 silver one-dollar pieces to be granted to the commission. The bullion for the striking was to be purchased on the open market and was not to come from the Mint's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act, though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904. Congress placed a ceiling on the cost of the silver at $25,000. In the event, the United States Treasury bought 38,675.875 troy ounces of silver for $23,032.80. The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E

5|$|Gatorade, {{now owned}} by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty {{countries}} and over fifty various flavors. In contrast to the forty-three <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> Cade and his team spent {{to make the first}} experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted the evolution of a multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade's other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the GCF concerns the creation of the Fund's Private Sector Facility (PSF). Many of the developed countries represented on the GCF board advocate a PSF that appeals to capital markets, in particular the pension funds and other institutional investors that control trillions of <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> pass through Wall Street and other financial centers. They hope that the Fund will ultimately use a broad range of financial instruments.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to build the}} first stage of the East West Link was criticised as a misuse of public funds that should have been spent on public transport. Fristacky said the project would deprive Melbourne of billions of <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> were needed for the construction of the Melbourne airport railway, Doncaster railway line, Rowville line, Melbourne Metro and the Mernda rail extension. Public Transport Users Association president Tony Morton said the project would not solve Melbourne traffic problems and that the 2013 state Budget should have focused on badly needed rail upgrades.|$|E

25|$|From that time, through fresh {{sanguine}} {{predictions for}} {{improvements in the}} business climate and the Reading's overall performance, which allowed him to borrow more funds on a less grand scale {{and to get the}} McCalmonts to defer interest payments due; and maneuverings such as periodically paying workers in scrip—essentially promissory notes—instead of cash, Franklin Gowen continued to run the Reading. In early 1880, employees were paid in cash {{for the first time in}} sixteen months. Then, on Friday, May 22, 1880, two Coal & Iron Co. checks, intended to transfer cash to the railroad, bounced. Gowen offered railroad promissory notes to make the checks good, but the bank turned him down. McCalmont Brothers ignored Gowen's plea by cable for a fresh loan of a half million <b>dollars.</b> <b>That</b> same day the Reading announced suspension of payments on debt.|$|E
25|$|As a key {{facet of}} the {{public-private}} partnership with Sarasota, Angelos developed a unique “sisterhood city” integrated marketing approach {{to capitalize on the}} power of the Baltimore Orioles and Major League Baseball to create economic impact through tourism incubation for the city. The approach utilizes the Orioles’ multiplatform media assets to market Sarasota to consumers in the Mid-Atlantic region year-round. According to the Sarasota Convention and Visitors Bureau, visits and inquiries from Mid-Atlantic residents have increased by double-digits since the partnership began. The partnership was recognized by industry publication Sports Business Journal for providing the “marketing muscle” necessary to generate the tourist <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> are “more important than ever to making the spring training business equation work.” In late 2013, the Tampa Bay Business Journal heralded the results of the partnership in a cover story, describing the deal as a home run for Sarasota’s tourism industry.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the sense}} of the Constitution, bills of credit signify a paper medium of {{exchange}} intended to circulate between individuals, and between the Government and individuals, for the ordinary purposes of society. It is immaterial whether the quality of legal tender is imparted to such paper. Interest-bearing certificates in denominations up to ten <b>dollars</b> <b>that</b> were issued by loan offices established by the State of Missouri and made receivable in payment of taxes or other moneys due to the State, and in payment of the fees and salaries of state officers, were held to be bills of credit whose issuance was banned by this section. The States are not forbidden, however, to issue coupons receivable for taxes, nor to execute instruments binding themselves to pay money at a future day for services rendered or money borrowed. Bills issued by state banks are not bills of credit; it is immaterial that the State is the sole stockholder of the bank, that the officers of the bank were elected by the state legislature, or that the capital of the bank was raised by the sale of state bonds.|$|E

Among financists {{of the expedition}} was John A. Quitman, a former General in the United States Army who also participated in the Mexican–American War. López led the expedition with Gonzales as Chief of Staff. On the night of May 19, 1850, López gave the order to advance and Gonzales and his men attacked the Governor's palace. The expedition failed because it lacked the support from {{the people in the}} island who did not respond to the call of the filibusters and because they were no match for the Spanish military reinforcements. Gonzalez, López and their men returned to the Creole. Once the Creole was back at sea, it was chased by the Spanish warship Pizarro and changed its course. The Creole then headed for Key West, Florida, where Gonzalez spent three weeks recovering from wounds received in the incident. On December 16, 1850 Lopez, Gonzalez, Quitman {{and the members of the}} failed expedition were tried in New Orleans for having violated the laws of neutrality; after three attempts to convict them the prosecution was abandoned.|$|E

After performing on the program, Smith returned to Nashville that May to record demos by Anderson that he planned on pitching to other country artists. Anderson's manager Hubert Long brought the demo recording to RCA Victor Records, where producer Chet Atkins heard it.

It was mounted on a now-demolished Durst building at Sixth Avenue near 42nd Street (a block from Times Square), facing the north side of 42nd Street and Bryant Park. Built by the New York sign company Artkraft Strauss, the clock featured a dot-based segment display emulating the then-typical character resolution of 5-by-7. Similar to the second clock, the updating mechanism was such that the display was set to the estimated speed of debt growth (odometer-style) and adjusted weekly according to the latest numbers published by the United States Treasury. Seymour Durst vowed that the clock would [...] "be up as long as the debt or the city lasts," [...] and that [...] "if it bothers people, then it's working." ...|$|E
