50|$|Hydrodynamic {{bearings}} rely on bearing {{motion to}} suck fluid into the bearing, {{and may have}} high friction and short life at speeds lower than design, or during starts and stops. An external pump or secondary bearing {{may be used for}} startup and shutdown to prevent damage to the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearing.</b> A secondary bearing may have high friction and short operating life, but good overall service life if bearing starts and stops are infrequent.|$|E
50|$|Spiral groove thrust {{bearings}} produce the required pressure {{to keep the}} bearing surfaces lubricated and separated purely by the pumping effect of the grooves, whereas journal, conical and spherical forms also get extra pressure generation by the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearing</b> wedge action. When {{the parts of the}} bearings are rotated with respect to each other the grooves push the lubricant through the bearing between the surfaces causing an overall rise in the pressure.|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{bearings}} can be hydrostatically or hydrodynamically lubricated. Hydrostatically lubricated bearings are lubricated by {{an external}} pump that maintains a static amount of pressure. In a <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearing</b> {{the pressure in}} the oil film is maintained by {{the rotation of the}} journal. Hydrostatic bearings enter a hydrodynamic state when the journal is rotating. Hydrostatic bearings usually use oil, while hydrodynamic bearings can use oil or grease, however bearings can be designed to use whatever fluid is available, and several pump designs use the pumped fluid as a lubricant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearings</b> require greater care {{in design}} and {{operation}} than hydrostatic bearings. They are also more prone to initial wear because lubrication does not occur until there is rotation of the shaft. At low rotational speeds the lubrication may not attain complete separation between shaft and bushing. As a result, <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearings</b> may be aided by secondary bearings that support the shaft during start and stop periods, protecting the fine tolerance machined surfaces of the journal bearing. On the other hand, <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearings</b> are simpler to install and are less expensive.|$|R

50|$|Foil bearings, {{also known}} as foil-air bearings, are a type of air bearing. A shaft is {{supported}} by a compliant, spring-loaded foil journal lining. Once the shaft is spinning fast enough, the working fluid (usually air) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that there is no contact. The shaft and foil are separated by the air's high pressure which is generated by the rotation which pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects. A high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs. Unlike aerostatic or hydrostatic bearings, foil bearings require no external pressurisation system for the working fluid, so the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearing</b> is self-starting.|$|E
50|$|Lubrication of {{piston rings}} is {{difficult}} {{and has been a}} driving force to improvements in the quality of motor oil. The oil must survive high temperatures and harsh conditions with a high-speed sliding contact. Lubrication is particularly difficult as the rings have an oscillating motion rather than continuous rotation, as for a bearing journal. At the limits of piston movement, the ring stops and reverses direction. This disrupts the normal oil wedge effect of a <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearing,</b> leading to pronounced wear and the formation of a 'step' in the cylinder bore around the height of the upper ring. Noting that some sleeve valve engines suffered far less from such wear, complex designs such as a rotating cylinder liner have been considered, just to address this problem.|$|E
5000|$|With {{precision}} ground surfaces, any oil film {{applied to the}} surface will lack the means {{to adhere to the}} surface, especially between two mating parts of exceptional finish. [...] The oil film will be swept away leaving nothing but bare metal and the risk of seizure. Carefully scraping the surface will leave the original high quality surface intact, but provide many shallow depressions where the oil film can maintain its depth and surface tension. When scraping is used for this purpose it is more accurately called [...] "frosting", [...] "spotting" [...] or [...] "flaking" [...] as opposed to fully scraping an accurate surface. Typically a scraped surface is scraped to highly accurate flatness and then [...] "frosting" [...] is applied over it for oil retention. It is claimed to stop the so-called [...] "stick-slip" [...] phenomenon where a machine member might move in a jerky fashion rather than moving smoothly, allowing vibration and chatter. Such frosting will definitely increase oil retention but will also drastically reduce bearing area and capacity. [...] There is no possibility of achieving <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearing</b> performance on normal sliding machine ways. [...] The velocity is far too low. Most of the time the ways will run under boundary lubrication conditions while at the highest speeds it might achieve mixed lubrication. This makes oil additives important in ways lubrication.|$|E

5000|$|They can be broadly {{classified}} into two types: fluid dynamic bearings (also known as <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearings)</b> and hydrostatic bearings. Hydrostatic bearings are externally pressurized fluid bearings, where the fluid is usually oil, water or air, and the pressurization {{is done by}} a pump. <b>Hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearings</b> rely on the high speed of the [...] (the part of the shaft resting on the fluid) to pressurize the fluid in a wedge between the faces. Fluid bearings are frequently used in high load, high speed or high precision applications where ordinary ball bearings would have short life or cause high noise and vibration. They are also used increasingly to reduce cost. For example, hard disk drive motor fluid bearings are both quieter and cheaper than the ball bearings they replace.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{subject of}} {{investigations}} {{presented in this}} article is achieving the optimum attenuation of lateral vibration of rotors by means of two design variants of constraint elements: semiactive magnetorheological squeeze film dampers and actively controlled <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearings.</b> The damping effect of magnetorheological dampers is controlled by the change of magnetic flux generated in electric coils and of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearings</b> by the change of magnitude of the proportional gain of a feedback controller exciting movement of the bearing housings. In the developed mathematical models the rotor is considered as absolutely rigid and the controllable constraint elements are represented by force couplings. The rotor turns at constant angular speed, is loaded by its weight and in addition it is excited by a centrifugal force caused by the disc unbalance. In both design cases its lateral vibration is governed by a nonlinear equation of motion. The pressure distribution in the lubricating film in the magnetorheological squeeze film damper is described by a Reynolds equation modified for Bingham fluid whose yield shear stress depends on magnetic induction. The hydraulic forces acting in the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearings</b> are determined for the case of π-film cavitation and position of the bearing housings is adjusted by actuators activated by a proportional feedback controller. The aim of the analysis is to deal with approaches leading to minimizing amplitude of the rotor steady state vibration and magnitude of the force transmitted into the rotor casing and to compare efficiency of both design variants. The performed computer simulations show that the arrangement with the magnetorheological squeeze film damper gives better results in reducing magnitude of the transmitted force than those when the rotor is supported by <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>bearings</b> with actively controlled position of the bearing housings...|$|R
