5000|$|The {{pharmacology}} of 5α-reductase inhibition is complex, but {{involves the}} binding of NADPH to the enzyme {{followed by the}} substrate. Specific substrates include testosterone, progesterone, androstenedione, epitestosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, and <b>deoxycorticosterone.</b> The entire physiologic effect of their reduction is unknown, but likely related to their excretion or is itself physiologic. Beyond being a catalyst in the rate-limiting step in testosterone reduction, 5α-reductase isoforms I and II reduce progesterone to 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP) and <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> to dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC). In vitro and animal models suggest subsequent 3α-reduction of DHT, 5α-DHP and DHDOC lead to neurosteroid metabolites with effect on cerebral function. These neurosteroids, which include allopregnanolone, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), and 3α-androstanediol, act as potent positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors, and have anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anxiolytic, prosexual, and anticonvulsant effects. 5α-Dihydrocortisol {{is present in the}} aqueous humor of the eye, is synthesized in the lens, and might help make the aqueous humor itself. 5α-Dihydroaldosterone is a potent antinatriuretic agent, although different from aldosterone.

5000|$|Certain {{metabolites}} of progesterone and <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> are potent {{and selective}} positive allosteric modulators of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. [...] Hans Selye {{demonstrated in the}} 1940 that certain pregnane steroids could cause both anesthesia and sedation [...] but 40 years later the molecular mechanism emerged to explain their depressant effect. In a rat brain slice preparation, the synthetic steroidal anesthetic alphaxalone (5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20 dione) enhanced both stimulus-evoked inhibition {{and the effects of}} exogenously applied muscimol which is a GABAA selective agonist.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} conditions, with the {{exception}} of adrenalectomy, cause a large elevation of circulating aldosterone. Correspondingly, repeated administration of the mineralocorticosteroid hormone <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> acetate (DOCA) produces a moderate increase in HSD2 neuron activity (c-Fos) without any sodium or volume deficit. However, even after adrenalectomy, HSD2 neurons become activated by sodium deprivation, proving that MR activation is not necessary for their activity. Thus, aldosterone may be sufficient, but is not necessary for their activation, meaning that these neurons integrate additional neural or hormonal input signals.|$|E
50|$|Tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (abbreviated as THDOC; 3α,21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one), also {{referred}} to as allotetrahydrocorticosterone, is an endogenous neurosteroid. It is synthesized from the adrenal hormone <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> by the action of two enzymes, 5α-reductase type I and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. THDOC is a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and has sedative, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects. Changes in the normal levels of this steroid particularly during pregnancy and menstruation may be involved in some types of epilepsy (catamenial epilepsy) and premenstrual syndrome, as well as stress, anxiety and depression.|$|E
5000|$|Specific {{substrates}} include testosterone, progesterone, androstenedione, epitestosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, and <b>deoxycorticosterone.</b> Outside of dihydrotestosterone, much of {{the physiological}} role of 5α-reduced steroids is unknown. Beyond reducing testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, 5alpha-reductase enzyme isoforms I and II reduce progesterone to dihydroprogesterone (DHP) and <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> to dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC). In vitro and animal models suggest subsequent 3alpha-reduction of DHT, DHP and DHDOC lead to steroid metabolites with effects on cerebral function achieved by enhancing GABAergic inhibition. These neuroactive steroid derivatives enhance GABA via allosteric modulation at GABA(A) receptors and have anticonvulsant, antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, and also alter sexual and alcohol related behavior. 5α-dihydrocortisol {{is present in the}} aqueous humor of the eye, is synthesized in the lens, and might help make the aqueous humor itself. Allopregnanolone and THDOC are neurosteroids, with the latter having effects on the susceptibility of animals to seizures. In socially isolated mice, 5α-R1 is specifically down-regulated in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons that converge on the amygdala from cortical and hippocampal regions. This down-regulation may account for the appearance of behavioral disorders such as anxiety, aggression, and cognitive dysfunction. 5α-dihydroaldosterone is a potent antinatriuretic agent, although different from aldosterone.

50|$|Roxibolone {{has been}} found not to bind to the {{glucocorticoid}} receptor, {{and it has been}} suggested that the antiglucocorticoid activity of roxibolone and formebolone may instead be mediated by modulation of enzymatic processes. Indeed, 11α- and 11β-hydroxyprogesterone (formebolone and roxibolone being 11α- and 11β-hydroxylated (respectively) similarly) are known to be potent inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the potent endogenous glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone (from the precursors deoxycortisol and <b>deoxycorticosterone,</b> respectively). However, formebolone was found to be a very weak inhibitor of 11β-HSD type 2 (IC50 > 10 μM), although this specific isoenzyme of 11β-HSD is responsible for the inactivation of glucocorticoids rather than their production.|$|E
50|$|In rats, {{roxibolone}} counteracts the catabolic effects (control {{of nitrogen}} balance) and increased alkaline phosphatase levels {{induced by the}} potent glucocorticoid dexamethasone phosphate.

50|$|MPA {{has been}} found to act as a {{competitive}} inhibitor of rat 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD). This enzyme is essential for the transformation of progesterone, <b>deoxycorticosterone,</b> and DHT into inhibitory neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone, , and 3α-androstanediol, respectively. MPA is described as extremely potent in its inhibition of rat 3α-HSD, with an IC50 of 0.2 μM and a Ki (in rat testicular homogenates) of 0.42 μM. Inhibitory neurosteroids have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, and the blockade of their production could be causative of the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and irritability that have been associated with MPA treatment. Indeed, other drugs that are known to block the synthesis of these neurosteroids, such as 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride, have also been associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, {{it should be noted that}} inhibition of 3α-HSD by MPA does not appear to have been confirmed yet using human proteins, and the concentrations required with rat proteins are far above typical human therapeutic concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} {{to determine what}} part of the aldosterone biosynthetic pathway is stimulated by angiotensin and potassium. The availability of a method for isolating the early portion of the aldosterone pathway and a new method for measuring plasma <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> permitted the design of experiments to determine whether angiotensin and potassium stimulate the pathway before <b>deoxycorticosterone.</b> To eliminate ACTH-dependent steroid synthesis, the experiments were performed in subjects receiving constant dosage of dexamethasone. To minimize the intra-adrenal conversion of <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> to corticosterone, all subjects also received constant dosage of metyrapone. Plasma deoxycortisol was measured as an index of the activity of the zona fasciculata. In the absence of changes in plasma deoxycortisol, one may infer that changes in plasma <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> represent changes in function of zona glomerulosa, the site of aldosterone formation. Under these conditions, human subjects responded both to angiotensin and to potassium with significant increases in plasma <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> but without significant increases in plasma deoxycortisol. In contrast, small doses of ACTH given under similar conditions never induced increases in plasma <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> without simultaneously inducing large increases in plasma deoxycortisol. It is concluded that the aldosterone-stimulating effects of angiotensin and potassium are, at least in part, consequences of stimulation of the biosynthetic pathway at some point before the formation of <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> so as to increase the availability of aldosterone precursors...|$|E

40|$|The {{mineralocorticoid}} {{effects of}} liquorice are {{mediated by the}} inhibitory effects {{of one of its}} active components glycyrrhetinic acid on 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. However, liquorice is reputed to have many medicinal properties and also contains a number of other potentially biologically active compounds. Here we have investigated the wider effects of oral liquorice on steroidogenesis focussing particularly on possible inhibitory effects of glycyrrhetinic acid on adrenal sulfotransferase activity. Salivary steroids were profiled by ELISA in groups of normal male and female volunteers after consuming either liquorice-containing or non-liquorice-containing confectionary for one week. Cortisol and cortisone levels reflected expected inhibition of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 by glycyrrhetinic acid. Salivary aldosterone was decreased but <b>deoxycorticosterone,</b> dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone were increased. To assess whether glycyrrhetinic acid directly affected steroidogenesis, free and conjugated steroids were measured in incubates of adrenocortical H 295 cells, firstly, in {{the presence or absence of}} forskolin and secondly, with radiolabeled <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> or dehydroepiandrosterone. Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibited cortisone and enhanced cortisol synthesis consistent with 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 inhibition. Basal and forskolin-stimulated syntheses of <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> and dehydroepiandrosterone conjugates were also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner; glycyrrhetinic acid inhibited the conjugation of <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> and dehydroepiandrosterone with IC 50 values of 7 μM. Inhibition of <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> and dehydroepiandrosterone conjugation was apparent within 4 h of starting glycyrrhetinic acid treatment and was not associated with changes in the expression of SULT 2 A 1 mRNA. SULT 2 A 1 encodes the enzyme sulfotransferase 2 A 1 which is responsible for the sulfonation of <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> and dehydroepiandrosterone as well as pregnenolone and 17 -hydroxypregnenolone in human adrenal glands. We suggest that the glycyrrhetinic acid constituent of liquorice increases circulating and thereby, salivary levels of unconjugated <b>deoxycorticosterone</b> and dehydroepiandrosterone by inhibiting their conjugation at source within the adrenal cortex. This effect may contribute to the mineralocorticoid actions of glycyrrhetinic acid and gives substance to claims that liquorice also has androgenic properties. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
