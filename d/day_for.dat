5|$|Filming moved {{once again}} in January 2011 to the Druid Hills {{quadrant}} of Atlanta, which contains {{the headquarters of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage and reception area for the CDC's museum onsite. Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per <b>day</b> <b>for</b> production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 per <b>day</b> <b>for</b> their work. Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{measure and}} compare the {{duration}} of action of abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA. Design: Randomized, double-blind, contralateral (split-face) study. Setting: Two United States clinical sites. Participants: Twenty subjects with severe frontalis lines at maximum elevation. Measurements: Subjects randomly received equal volumes of abobotulinumtoxinA or onabotulinumtoxinA (0. 2 mL) in five injection points on contralateral sides of the frontalis (N= 40) using a dose ratio of 2. 5 : 1. 0 (total 25 U abobotulinumtoxinA: 10 U onabotulinumtoxinA), respectively. Subjects were evaluated using a 4 -point Frontalis Rating Scale and a new objective Frontalis Activity Measurement Standard <b>for</b> 210 <b>days</b> using predefined endpoints for efficacy. Results: Using the Frontalis Activity Measurement Standard, the median duration of “complete efficacy” was 72 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 56 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p= 0. 01), “full efficacy” was 103 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 87 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p< 0. 003), and “partial efficacy” was 105 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 99 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p= 0. 006). Using the Frontalis Rating Scale, the median duration of “complete efficacy” was 63 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 44 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p= 0. 006), “full efficacy” was 119 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 77 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p= 0. 005), and “partial efficacy” was 160 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 145 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p=NS). Adverse events included local bruising and occasional headache, but no significant inter-group differences. Conclusion: The contralateral Frontalis Activity Measurement Standard is well-suited for assessing the pharmacodynamic and clinical attributes of botulinum toxin type A {{and can be used}} to measure differences in the clinical properties of abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA. Using a dose ratio of 2. 5 : 1. 0, abobotulinumtoxinA displayed significantly longer duration of action than onabotulinumtoxinA...|$|R
