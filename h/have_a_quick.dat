After Keith tells Dean O’Dell {{that his wife}} is cheating on him with Veronica’s criminology professor, {{he pulls out a}} gun. Wallace and Piz find a drink that was tested positive for GHB, and Wallace and Piz dash to her dorm. Dean O’Dell finds and enters into the room in which his wife and the criminology professor are carrying on their affair as Veronica learns that they have tracked the wrong girl. Just as Mercer (Ryan Devlin) (the actual rapist) is about to rape his next victim, he abruptly learns that Veronica has changed places with his victim. Veronica tases Mercer, and they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> fight before Veronica escapes. She is let into Moe’s (Andrew McClain) room.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} June 1940, Germany had {{defeated}} Britain's {{allies on}} the continent, and on 30 June the OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl issued his review of options to increase pressure on Britain {{to agree to a}} negotiated peace. The first priority was to eliminate the RAF and gain air supremacy. Intensified air attacks against shipping and the economy could affect food supplies and civilian morale in the long term. Reprisal attacks of terror bombing had the potential to cause quicker capitulation, but the effect on morale was uncertain. Once the Luftwaffe had control of the air, and the UK economy had been weakened, an invasion would be a last resort or a final strike ("Todesstoss") after England had already been conquered, but could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> result. On the same day, the Luftwaffe Commander-in-Chief Hermann Göring issued his operational directive; to destroy the RAF, thus protecting German industry, and also to block overseas supplies to Britain. The German Supreme Command argued over the practicality of these options.|$|E

25|$|Raquel renews her {{friendship}} with Curly, who {{falls in love}} with her and proposes. Although Raquel accepts, she tells Des that she loves him, not Curly and decides to break off the engagement. The following year, Curly's boss Leo Firman (John Elmes) attempts to rape Raquel. She manages to escape and tells Curly, who attacks Leo. Raquel gives evidence of sexual harassment against him and Leo is fired. She and Curly grow closer in the aftermath. Though Raquel sleeps with Des again, he makes it clear that it was just a one-night stand, and Raquel accepts that she will never mean as much to Des as he does to her. Later that day, Raquel proposes to Curly. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> registry office wedding, and it is not until their honeymoon that Raquel admits what happened with Des. Curly forgives her, and their married life is initially happy. It does not last, however, and within a year Raquel leaves Curly to accept an aromatherapy job in Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} {{presented}} on 30 June, OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl reviewed options to increase pressure on Britain {{to agree to}} a negotiated peace. The first priority was to eliminate the Royal Air Force and gain air supremacy. Intensified air attacks against shipping and the economy could affect food supplies and civilian morale in the long term. Reprisal attacks of terror bombing had the potential to cause quicker capitulation but the effect on morale was uncertain. Once the Luftwaffe had control of the air, and the British economy had been weakened, an invasion would be a last resort or a final strike ("Todesstoss") after England had already been practically defeated, but could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> result. At a meeting that day, OKW Chief of Staff General Franz Halder heard from Secretary of State Ernst von Weizsäcker that Hitler had turned his attention to Russia. Halder met Admiral Otto Schniewind on 1 July, and they shared views without understanding each other's position. Both thought that air superiority was needed first, and could make the invasion unnecessary. They agreed that minefields and U-boats could limit the threat posed by the Royal Navy; Schniewind emphasised the significance of weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|Small Heath {{dominated}} the play against Sheffield United, but visiting goalkeeper William Foulke was on fine form, {{and his team}} had a one-goal lead at the interval. Mobley scored twice in the second half, and both were in controversial circumstances. After a United defender won the ball from Tommy Hands, Hands kicked out at him; the referee turned to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> word with Hands, meanwhile the ball fell to Mobley, standing in an offside position, who {{put it in the}} net, and the referee, who had not seen Mobley's offside, awarded the goal. Encouraged by this stroke of luck, Small Heath pressed, and from a Leake cross, Wheldon executed an overhead kick from which the ball rebounded off the crossbar to Mobley, again standing offside, who tapped it in for the winning goal. The victory left them needing only a draw from the final match of the season, at home to Sunderland, to avoid the test matches. In the event, they were outclassed. Though as usual the defence was satisfactory, the forwards' positioning was poor, Hallam and Walton were sadly missed, and they lacked anyone of influence to organise them. A 1–0 defeat, combined with Wolverhampton's 5–0 thrashing of Bolton Wanderers, confirmed Small Heath's participation in the test matches.|$|E

25|$|On 6 September 1688, Leopold I's forces {{under the}} Elector of Bavaria secured Belgrade for the Empire. With the Ottomans {{appearing}} close to collapse Louis XIV's ministers, Louvois and Colbert de Croissy, felt it essential to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> resolution along the German frontier before the Emperor {{turned from the}} Balkans to lead a comparatively united German Empire against France on the Rhine and reverse the Ratisbon settlement. On 24 September Louis published his manifesto, his Mémoire de raisons, listing his grievances: he demanded that the Truce of Ratisbon {{be turned into a}} permanent resolution, and that Fürstenburg be appointed Archbishop-Elector of Cologne. He also proposed to occupy the territories that he believed belonged to his sister-in-law regarding the Palatinate succession. The Emperor and the German princes, the Pope, and William of Orange were quite unwilling to grant these demands. For the Dutch in particular, Louis's control of Cologne and Liège would be strategically unacceptable, for with these territories in French hands the Spanish Netherlands 'buffer-zone' would be effectively bypassed. The day after Louis issued his manifesto – well before his enemies could have known its details – the main French army crossed the Rhine as a prelude to investing Philippsburg, the key post between Luxembourg (annexed in 1684) and Strasbourg (seized in 1681), and other Rhineland towns. This pre-emptive strike was intended to intimidate the German states into accepting his conditions, while encouraging the Ottoman Turks to continue their own struggle with the Emperor in the east.|$|E
500|$|Three main factors {{determine}} {{the quality of}} preserved material in a coal ball: the mineral constituents, {{the speed of the}} burial process, and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> burial with little decay and pressure are better preserved, although plant remains in most coal balls almost always show differing signs of decay and collapse. Coal balls containing quantities of iron sulfide have far lower preservation than coal balls permineralised by magnesium or calcium carbonate, which has earned iron sulfide the title [...] "chief curse of the coal ball hunter".|$|E
500|$|Alongside his {{intellectual}} pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket. As {{a small boy}} {{he had begun to}} visit Old Trafford Cricket Ground to watch Lancashire matches: [...] "The first cricketer I saw was A.C. MacLaren... I can still see the swing of MacLaren's bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised". In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. [...] "I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to let him <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene".|$|E

500|$|Named after {{musician}} Frank Zappa, the Zappa group {{formed in}} 2001, {{but did not}} appear in Meerkat Manor until the third series when the Whiskers became their new neighbours. Billed in the opening credits as [...] "the neighbors from hell", the fourteen-members-strong Zappa have multiple run-ins with the Whiskers throughout the series. [...] Led by dominant pair Lola and Frank, the Zappa <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> fight with the Whiskers in the first episode of the third series, but are forced to flee from the much larger group. When the Whiskers invaded the Zappa territory in search of Flower's missing pups, they ended up confiscating a Zappa burrow, claiming {{the part of the}} land as their territory. [...] The Zappa repeatedly tried to retake the stolen burrow, but all attempts ended in failure. In the middle of the series, while Lola was recovering from an injury, her sister Punk took over as dominant female. [...] The same day, Frank was disposed by Houdini and forced out of the group. Punk proved to be a greater risk taker than Lola, and again led the Zappa in a futile attack against the Whiskers. After Flower's death, the Zappa tried to commandeer a burrow that the Whiskers had just moved in, but the Zappa were again defeated and chased off.|$|E
500|$|The art {{style of}} the game world drew acclaim from many reviewers, who welcomed the {{departure}} from Oblivions Cyrodiil. Jason Schreier of Wired described the land of Skyrim as a [...] "Viking-inspired treasure trove of flavor and charm", noting its contrast to Cyrodiil, which he considered generic by comparison. The Staff at Edge magazine described Cyrodiil as a [...] "patchwork of varying terrains", praising the more consistent design of Skyrim. Shibley praised [...] "the lack of copy-and-paste level design that's plagued Bethesda's previous games,... giving a lived-in and handcrafted look to the world". Bedford noted that the improved graphical fidelity over Oblivion allowed the game world to feel more lifelike, praising the [...] "misty mountain setting, complete with swirling fog and high-altitude snowstorms". An editor for PC PowerPlay praised {{the diversity of the}} dungeon design. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer cited criticisms that Oblivion faced for repetitive dungeons, noting that [...] "the composition of each dungeon is largely unique and individualized" [...] in Skyrim. He also favored the design choice to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> route out of a dungeon leading from its last room, eliminating a problem he identified Oblivion as having, where the player would clear a dungeon and then have {{to go all the way}} back to the beginning to exit it. Many reviewers praised the large amount of things to do in the world outside of the main story. Tom Francis of PC Gamer noted that it was difficult to explore the world without becoming distracted by things to do, stating that, [...] "it's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, [...] a haunted fort".|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, {{the group}} {{released}} their third album,sold up 2.8 million copies worldwide Waking Up with the House on Fire (UK No.2, US No.26). Although Platinum {{in both the}} UK and the US, it was a commercial and critical disappointment compared to their first two albums. The album contained the hit single [...] "The War Song", which reached No.2 in the UK, and Top 20 in the US. Other singles like [...] "Mistake No.3" [...] (US No.33) and [...] "The Medal Song" [...] (UK No.32) would become modest hits.

2500|$|The best {{indicator}} of teacher quality, according to Dewey, {{is the ability}} to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses he or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers. [...] The explanation is simple. [...] They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with. [...] Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.36). [...] Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his {{childhood}} in Barcelona, Carreras's father, Josep Carreras i Soler, worked as a traffic policeman. He had originally been a French teacher. However, he had fought on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, and when the Franco government came into power in 1939, {{he was no longer}} allowed to teach. His mother, Antonia Coll i Saigi, ran a small hair-dressing salon, where, as a child, Carreras often sang to the customers in return for pocket money. He was very close to his mother, who was convinced that he would one day be a great singer, and her death from cancer when he was 18 affected him greatly. In José Carreras: A Life Story, he said that [...] "even now, every time I go on stage, I always, always, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> thought for her." [...] In 1971 Carreras married Mercedes Pérez. They had two children: a son, Albert (born in 1972), and a daughter, Julia (born in 1978). The marriage ended in divorce in 1992. In 2006, Carreras married Jutta Jäger, but separated from her in 2011. Carreras's nephew, David Giménez Carreras, is a conductor and Director of the Orquestra Simfònica del Vallès.
