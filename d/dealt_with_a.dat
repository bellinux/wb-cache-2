5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. The patent <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in the finished game, so to defuse the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wider range of themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004–2005 pilot season, a {{pilot was}} {{announced}} named Untitled Tina Fey Project. The 30 Rock pilot {{focused on the}} boss of a variety show who must manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer. The storyline evolved into one that <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> head writer of a variety show who dealt with both of the stars, {{as well as the}} show's new network executive. 30 Rock was officially given the green light to air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order.|$|E

5|$|Each <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} {{aspect of}} the tests. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement experiments, and Argonne National Laboratory did gamma ray measurements. Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design and install the timing and firing systems. Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to San Pedro, California, and loaded on the weapon assembly ship USS Curtiss, in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the expenditure of three cores in the tests.|$|E
5|$|Star {{continued}} expanding, and Jo brought aboard Chinese director Wu Tsun, {{whose first}} film {{for the company}} was Lintah Darat. It had begun production before the release of Tjioeng Wanara and <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family torn apart by dealings with a loan shark. This production received positive reviews. Star then produced a sequel to Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, again with Wu at the helm, and drew the journalist Saeroen as writer. In this film, titled Pah Wongso Tersangka, Star emphasised comedy, relying on the interactions between Waldy, Pah Wongso, and the comedian Sarip.|$|E
5|$|Written by Marc Platt, this {{unsolicited}} {{story was}} submitted to script editor Robert Holmes in late 1975 and <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sentient star using the Time Lord libraries {{as a means}} of invading Gallifrey. Holmes felt that it lacked action and drama, and was in need of a proper antagonist. Even so, Robert Holmes thought that Fires of the Starmind had more potential than most of the other amateur submissions and he encouraged Marc Platt to continue writing. Fires of the Starmind was rejected on 15 December.|$|E

5|$|Kim {{solidified}} his {{break with}} cinematic realism by following The Housemaid {{with two more}} films exploring styles and mixing genres, radically new for Korean cinema at the time. The Sea Knows (1961) transcended {{its roots in the}} standard anti-Japanese World War II film to become a distinctive examination of humanity, sadism, greed, lust for power and sexuality. The box-office success of this film enabled Kim to buy his first house, in the Namsan district of Seoul. Goryeojang (1963), <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> similar subject matter as The Ballad of Narayama (1983), directed by Shohei Imamura, a filmmaker with whom Kim has often been compared. Kim's version of the story is marked by his mixing of genres. For example, he frames the storywhich deals with an ancient tradition in which elders were abandoned to diewithin a modern lecture on birth control.|$|E
5|$|Reibey was funding {{all of the}} {{construction}} costs. When the structure was mostly complete a scandal erupted around him. He was alleged to have indecently <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> married woman. Her husband raised the issue with the bishop, then in 1870 with no action by the Church again with the Church of England Synod in England. Reibey subsequently took libel action but his complaint was dismissed and the Jury largely held that the allegations against him were true. Apart from these allegations, Reibey's wife's health had been declining, his property had been declining in value, and he wrote {{that he had been}} considering relinquishing the Archdeaconship for a while. After only a few years the lack of funds provided left only one person working on the site. All work ceased in 1870, by which time the walls were unfinished and the building still lacked a roof. Though the church was incomplete both Reibey and his wife Catherine were buried in a graveyard at the building's rear.|$|E
5|$|Romney used a {{bully pulpit}} {{approach}} towards promoting his agenda, staging well-organized media events to appeal {{directly to the}} public rather than pushing his proposals in behind-doors sessions with the state legislature. He <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> public crisis of confidence in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years of negotiating the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E
5000|$|Chew Heong v. United States (1884): This was {{the only}} one of the five cases decided against the government. This <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Amendment to the Chinese Exclusion Act {{requiring}} re-entry certificates.|$|R

50|$|Quie {{was elected}} {{governor}} of Minnesota in 1978. During his single term, he <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> extreme budget crisis, {{and made some}} very tough and unpopular choices. He opted not to run again in 1982.|$|R
5|$|Situated along vital air and sea {{lanes of}} {{communication}} {{in the middle of}} the Mediterranean, Crete was of considerable strategic importance to both sides and, after the conclusion of the campaign in Greece, the Allies fully expected that the Germans would attempt an invasion. The 4th Brigade was stationed as a reserve force in the area around Galatas with the 18th Battalion near the newly established general hospital. When the airborne invasion began on 20 May, the battalion quickly <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> company of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) that landed near them. It carried out mopping up operations and patrolled the area for the next two days before assisting the 19th Battalion in an attack on Fallschirmjäger that had established a strong defensive position nearby.|$|E
5|$|The NFL's {{struggle}} against the AAFC generated stress on wages, attendance, marketing, and by 1949, it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years. Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless. In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had {{a negative impact on}} the sale of home tickets. Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL's first television contract—the 1949 championship game. Simultaneously, he <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lawsuit from Bill Radovich, who had been blacklisted for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC. Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell.|$|E
5|$|Under John, Walter {{continued}} to be active in ecclesiastical affairs, and in September 1200 held a provincial church council at London. This council set forth 14canons, or decrees, which <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number of subjects, including doctrinal concerns, financial affairs, and {{the duties of the}} clergy. It drew heavily on earlier church decrees, including those of the Third Lateran Council of 1179. Walter also interceded with Pope Innocent III in 1200, mediating between the pope and the king over a royal dispute with the Cistercians. Walter's intercession prevented the dispute from escalating, and kept the pope from imposing sanctions on the king for his threats to the Cistercians. It was in 1200 that the church court records of the archdiocese of Canterbury began to be recorded and kept, although after Walter's death in 1205 the records become sparse until the 14th century.|$|E

5|$|Although Mapenor's time as bishop was short– {{just over}} two years– over 20 of his {{charters}} survive. These include a number for Leominster Priory and Reading Abbey. He also <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dispute over the rights of a Norman abbey, Lyre Abbey, over churches it possessed in the diocese of Hereford, settling it by making the churches part of a prebend in Hereford Cathedral held by the abbot of Lire. Mapenor supported the new king Henry III {{in his efforts to}} suppress the rebellion begun under Henry's father, King John. Mapenor was with the forces of the king before the Battle of Lincoln in May 1217. The bishop was also present when the king and Llywelyn of Gwynedd, a Welsh prince, concluded a peace treaty at Worcester in March 1218. The king employed Mapenor in April as a diplomatic escort, ordering the bishop to bring some of the southern Welsh princes to Woodstock to swear fealty to Henry III. In June of that year, Mapenor attended the consecration of the new Worcester Cathedral. He was the recipient of {{one of a series of}} writs sent to bishops to stop the persecution of Jews. These writs may have resulted from a decision of the king's council to oppose some acts of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, which placed restrictions on Jews.|$|E
5|$|In a rare change, Milligan's run on {{the title}} starts with John living in {{domestic}} bliss with a nurse, Phoebe. Over {{the course of the}} first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a Babylonian demon. Over the course of the run, John <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> demon taking revenge on people involved in the Liverpool dockers' strike gone insane and sought help from Shade, The Changing Man, after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian, and traveled to India {{to try to find a}} way of saving her. Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.|$|E
25|$|Owen Wister's The Virginian, a 1902 seminal {{novel in}} {{the genre of}} Western novels in the United States <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fictional {{treatment}} of the Johnson County War and frontier lynchings in the West.|$|E
