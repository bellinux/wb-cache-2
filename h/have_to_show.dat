25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she can teach her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus says you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus. The Knight removes his helm, who is then revealed to be Arthur.|$|E

500|$|As Steam {{has grown}} in popularity, many other {{competing}} services have been surfacing trying to emulate their success. The most notable major competitors are Electronic Arts' (EA) Origin service, Ubisoft's Uplay, Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net, and CD Projekt's GOG.com. Battle.net competes as a publisher exclusive platform, while GOG.com's catalog includes {{many of the same}} titles as Steam but offers them in a DRM-free platform. Upon launch of EA's Origin in 2011, several EA-published titles were no longer available for sale, and users feared that future EA titles would be limited to Origin's service.

Newell stated [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> EA it’s a smart decision to have EA games on Steam, and we’re going to try to show them that."

500|$|Despite {{doing well}} in his A-level examinations, because of his report from Harrow {{he was unable to}} obtain a place at any university. After working as a {{gardener}} for two years, and a stint as an office worker which he loathed, he discovered that he enjoyed acting and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). During his time there he appeared in numerous theatre productions, including the lead roles of Gregers Werle in Ibsen's The Wild Duck, Marcus Andronicus in Titus Andronicus, and Stephen Daedalus in an adaptation of James Joyce's novel Ulysses. However, he was disappointed to find that he was treated [...] "like a nonce" [...] for being an Old Harrovian. He also made himself more unpopular by being outspoken and taking on roles in his second and third years despite the practice being forbidden by school policy. One of these was his first break into film – the 2001 horror-thriller The Hole. Fox feels that in landing the role his name [...] "probably helped – it's a combination of timing, luck and contacts". Nonetheless, [...] "the name opens some doors, but then you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you can do the job".|$|E

Signing a two-year deal with Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "I {{think it will}} benefit {{me to have a}} fresh start, play in front of new people and show what I can do. I feel I'm better than this level but I've got to show that and we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that as a team". His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter would add to his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E
500|$|Petr Harmáček (known online by the alias [...] "Harmy") {{had watched}} a dubbed {{version of the}} {{original}} cut of Star Wars {{at the age of}} six, and had then seen the Special Editions of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi on their 1997 release. Although initially admiring them, he became disappointed when he learnt how much the films had been changed retroactively; he argued that replacing the original effects with re-composited digital effects was [...] "an act of cultural vandalism". A fan of the original trilogy, he had written his undergraduate thesis on their cultural impact. After seeing a trailer for Adywan's cut of The Empire Strikes Back, Harmáček was inspired to create a version of the film that [...] "undid" [...] the post-1977 changes and restored the theatrical releases in high-definition. He described his motivation as: [...] "I {{wanted to be able to}} show people who haven't seen Star Wars yet, like my little brother or my girlfriend, the original, Oscar-winning version, but I didn't want to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it to them in bad quality." [...] Harmáček's edits were the first to recreate the theatrical releases in HD.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Australian {{producer}} Ian Collie {{produced a}} documentary film on P. L. Travers titled The Shadow of [...] "Mary Poppins". During the documentary's production, Collie {{noticed that there}} was [...] "an obvious biopic there" [...] and convinced Essential Media and Entertainment to develop a feature film with Sue Smith writing the screenplay. The project {{attracted the attention of}} BBC Films, which decided to finance the project, and Ruby Films' Alison Owen, who subsequently hired Kelly Marcel to co-write the screenplay with Smith. Marcel's drafts removed a subplot involving Travers and her son, and divided the story into a two-part narrative: the creative conflict between Travers and Walt Disney, and her dealings with her childhood issues, describing it as [...] "a story about the pain of a little girl who suffered, and the grown woman who allowed herself to let go". Marcel's version, however, featured certain intellectual property rights of music and imagery which would be impossible to use without permission from The Walt Disney Company. [...] "There was always that elephant in the room, which is Disney," [...] Collie recalled. [...] "We knew Walt Disney was a key character in the film and we wanted to use quite a bit of the music. We knew we'd eventually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Disney." [...] In early 2010, Robert B. Sherman provided producer Alison Owen with an advance copy of a salient chapter from his then upcoming book release, [...] [...] The chapter entitled, [...] "'Tween Pavement and Stars" [...] contained characterizations and anecdotes which proved seminal to Marcel's script rewrite, in particular, the anecdote about there not being the color red in London. In July 2011, while attending the Ischia Film Festival, Owen met with Corky Hale, who offered to present the screenplay to Richard M. Sherman. Sherman read the screenplay and gave the producers his support. Later that year, Marcel and Smith's screenplay was listed in Franklin Leonard's The Black List, voted by producers {{as one of the best}} screenplays that were not in production.|$|E
