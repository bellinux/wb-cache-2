40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the {{communication}} process through which experts and decision makers integrate their domain specific knowledge in decision making situations and argues {{for the benefit of}} software-supported visualization of contributions. Understanding both decision making and knowledge integration as communicative processes, we present a short review of literature on the concept of knowledge integration. Based on this review, we present a model for knowledge integration and <b>discuss</b> <b>an</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> which provides a first empirical evaluation of the model. In the proposed model, knowledge integration is reflected by the resolution of four conversational challenges – equal participation, big picture thinking, establishing common ground, and constructive conflict. We argue that the modality of the conversation impacts on the importance of the single elements of knowledge integration. We show that – when supporting conversations with an interactive visualization tool –- conversation partners rely more on the construction of the big picture and of the common ground, and less on conflict and equal participation. Furthermore, the handling of conflict is more constructive than in the nonsupported situation. An experimental study tests and confirms both the model for knowledge integration and the moderation effect of the use of the interactive visual tool...|$|E

40|$|Traumatic {{injury is}} the leading cause of death among young adults and children, {{accounting}} for 5 million deaths worldwide on an annual basis. In Sweden alone, 2500 individuals succumb to traumatic injuries yearly. Beyond the burden of death, injuries contribute to a large proportion of disability. Hemorrhagic shock and severe abdominal injuries are frequent causes of preventable death after trauma, whereas early recognition and proper treatment of these conditions improve survival considerably. The aim of this thesis is to review some aspects of abdominal injuries and fluid therapy in hemorrhagic shock. Paper I evaluated the population-based incidence and injury severity of the most frequently injured abdominal organ, the liver, in the County of Stockholm comprising 1. 75 million inhabitants. Cases of liver injuries were retrieved from the National Board of Forensic Medicine and the Public Health and Medical Services Committee Register (in-patients register). The results show a relatively low incidence of liver injuries in the studied population (2. 95 / 100, 000). The hazard of liver injury in the County was calculated to be 0. 003 % per annum. Grade II and III injuries prevail. Nonoperative management was applied in 54 % of patients. Only simple operative measures were employed in the 32 % of surgically explored patients. No complex hepatic injuries were operated upon. The nonoperative management of liver injuries is mounting and is currently employed around the world. The objective of paper II was to describe a simplified surgical algorithm for the treatment of lowvelocity duodenal gunshot injuries currently in use in a large South African civilian trauma center and to verify its validity by measuring morbidity and mortality. Seventy-five consecutive patients with gunshot injuries to the duodenum were reviewed. Primary repair was performed in 86 %, a resection and re-anastomosis in 11 % and pancreatoduodenectomy in 3 % of patients. The overall morbidity and mortality was 58 % and 28 %, respectively. Most civilian low-velocity duodenal gunshot injuries are treated with simple primary repair resulting in overall morbidity, mortality, and duodenum-related complication rates comparable to those in reports where more complex surgical procedures are employed. Primary repair is also applicable in the majority of combined pancreatic and duodenal gunshot wounds. Few previous studies have been conducted on prehospital management of hypotensive trauma patients in Stockholm County and therefore a retrospective review of these patients is discussed in paper III. We found that the mean time interval at the scene of injury (19 min) exceeded Prehospital Trauma Life Supports general guidelines (10 min). Most of the hypotensive trauma patients were fluidresuscitated on the scene of injury regardless of the type, mechanism, or severity of injury. A predefined fluid resuscitation regimen is not employed in hypotensive trauma victims with different types of injuries. The outcome was worsened by male gender, progressive age and an Injury Severity Score > 20. In paper IV, we <b>discuss</b> <b>an</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> on a porcine model of near-lethal liver injury associated with hemorrhagic shock. We hypothesized that early intravenous fluid therapy does not improve shortterm survival, the volume of intraabdominal hemorrhage, and aortic and visceral hemodynamics. We found no differences in these parameters when animals were randomized into early or delayed resuscitation groups, receiving intravenous hypertonic saline dextran either 20 minutes or 40 minutes after trauma. We concluded that rebleeding after severe liver injury occurs infrequently; hepatic hemodynamics and short-term survival were not improved by the early initiation of fluid therapy...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{different}} approaches {{of the use}} of black box modelling techniques for piezoelectric actuators are particularly addressed, regardless of the employed technique/algorithm. A modelling approach in this paper refers to two matters: the first, the role of black box techniques in modelling (i. e. if physics-based techniques are also involved in modelling; if so, how and to what extent). From this aspect, the spectrum of approaches ranges from those merged with/inspired by classical phenomenological models to an approach based on purely system identification-based techniques. The second aspect of modelling approaches, in this article, is the input variables to the model. Current and previous values of input voltage, previous values of the output (displacement), derivatives and extremum values of the system's input/output have been used as the inputs to the model so far. Both aforementioned aspects of modelling approaches are addressed appropriately in this article, and various modelling approaches in the literature are categorized and presented in a uniform and comparable manner, so that readers can easily identify research trends in this area and the gaps in the literature. One of the identified unanswered questions in the literature is whether the extremum values of the system's input/output should/should not be used as an input to black box models of piezoelectric actuators. There are works in the literature which have/have not used the aforementioned input variables, but there is no published investigation to evidently answer the proposed question.

40|$|Decision tree {{induction}} {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used classification approaches. It constructs a tree in which an internal node is split based on values of a selected attribute. Depending on the attribute selected at each level of the tree, a training dataset could lead to many different trees. Consequently, it is possible that an unseen case is classified into different and conflict classes using different trees. On the other hand, recently developed association rule based classifications are able to generate more interesting and useful roles than decision trees. However, the large number of rules without appropriate data structure brings the issue of efficiency. In this paper, we propose to unify decision tree classification with association-based classification using generalized decision trees (GDT). GDT generalizes the concept of decision tree to encode all interesting classification rules discovered based on association in a tree form. It inherits the merits of both approaches and removes their drawbacks. The data structure and related algorithms are <b>discussed.</b> Results of <b>an</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> are presented to indicate the advantages of GDT...|$|R
30|$|Regarding code-based prioritization, Zhou et al. (2012) compare failure-detection {{capabilities}} of the Jaccard-distance-based ART and Manhattan-distance-based ART. The authors use branch coverage information and the results showed that, for code-based test suites, Manhattan distance {{is more effective than}} Jaccard (2012). Jeffrey and Gupta (2006) propose an algorithm that prioritizes test cases based on coverage of statements in relevant slices and <b>discuss</b> insights from <b>an</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> that considers also total coverage. Moreover, Do et al. (2010) present a series of controlled experiments evaluating the effects of time constraints and faultiness levels on {{the costs and benefits of}} test case prioritization techniques. They define faultiness level as a variable that manipulates the numbers of faults (mutants) randomly placed in applications. They consider three faultiness levels: FL 1 involves cases in which mutant groups contain from 1 to 5 faults; the second level, FL 2, involves cases in which mutant groups contain from 6 to 10 faults; and FL 3, involves cases in which mutant groups contain from 11 to 15 faults. The results show that time constraints can significantly influence both the cost and effectiveness. Moreover, when there are time constraints, the effects of increased faultiness are stronger.|$|R
40|$|The present chapter {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the application of Attenuated total reflection - Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) to the environmentally important mineral - aqueous electrolyte interface. At these interfaces the important adsorption processes occur that limit the availability of potentially toxic solutes. These retention processes may retard for example the migration of solutes in aquifer systems or even immobilize them on the aquifer material, which is usually a natural mineral. We give an introduction to the approach and {{an overview of}} its possible applicability (and in this context its use in contributing {{to the understanding of the}} acid-base chemistry of (oxy) (hydr) oxide mineral surfaces, the adsorption of anions and cations like the uranyl-ion, and the formation of ternary surface complexes can be mentioned in general).

30|$|Sepsis, {{as well as}} burns, causes transcapillary leakage of plasma, {{reducing}} the circulating plasma volume [16, 17]. <b>As</b> <b>discussed</b> above, <b>experimental</b> <b>studies</b> have shown that vitamin C reduces local oedema and leakage of plasma markers. However, these findings {{do not necessarily reflect}} a decrease in plasma volume loss, and so far, no study has specifically investigated the effect of vitamin C treatment on plasma volume. In the present study, we therefore tested the hypothesis that vitamin C would reduce the loss of plasma volume in the early stage of sepsis. Treatment was initiated 3 h after induction of sepsis, a more clinically relevant time point than used in most studies found in the current literature, where treatment was started either before or closely after injury (e.g. sepsis, burns). Different dose regimes have been used in previous studies. Beneficial effects on microcirculation have been shown with low-dose treatment [1, 2], but it seems that higher doses are needed to counteract microvascular leakage. We chose to compare two different treatment regimes, both previously shown to be effective to prevent capillary leakage - one with a small bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion [9, 10] and one with a high bolus dose as single treatment [4, 6]. A sham group that underwent the same surgical procedure, but received no treatment, was also included in the study.|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{cementation}} of soft clays {{has been}} used for several years for different ground improvement projects. Although considerable work has been done to develop advanced machinery and techniques for the implementation of artificial cementation, less knowledge is available on the mechanisms involving the formation of the artificial structure and the resulting mechanical behaviour. The primary objectives of the present work were to investigate the formation of microstructure in artificially cemented material with Portland cement, find the relationships between cementitious bonding and clay mineralogy, and create constitutive frameworks for predicting the mechanical behaviour of cement-treated clays. Qualitative and quantitative microstructural characterisation of reconstituted and cemented material has been performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The results confirmed the transformation of the void microstructure from a bimodal, dispersed material into a unimodal, flocculated material due to artificial cementation. The addition of cement was found {{to reduce the amount of}} macro-pores within the cemented material, resulting in a significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity. A further parametric study was conducted on data obtained in the laboratory by the author combined with those found in the literature, to investigate the effect of clay mineralogy on artificial cementation. The results indicated the major influence of the activity of the clay, along with the cement and water content, on the results of the cement treatment. The observed variations in the mechanical behaviour with respect to mineralogy and the important effect of curing time have been explained in terms of the pozzolanic reactions, and the limitations of applying Abrams’ law to cement-admixed clays are <b>discussed.</b> In addition, <b>an</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> has been conducted to investigate the yielding and stress-strain behaviour of artificially cemented Ottawa clay and to compare it with the behaviour of the same soil in its naturally structured state. The results indicate that although the natural clay exhibits a meta-stable structure, resulting in an abrupt post-yield loss of strength, the artificially cemented material undergoes a more gradual breakage of the cementitious bonds. This allows for the use of the critical state concept, along with a pseudo-normal compression line, to develop a constitutive model for the artificially cemented material...|$|R
