5|$|Greater Manchester Police {{operate a}} Video Intelligence Unit, whose plainclothes {{officers}} confront and video certain freed prisoners {{as they leave}} prison after serving their sentences. They also record footage of people involved in anti-social behaviour on the streets. The aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> other police officers up to date information on the appearance {{of people who have}} broken the law. Video footage thus collected is constantly replayed on TV screens in rooms where officers complete their paperwork. Footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto YouTube in an attempt to catch people they believe have reoffended.|$|E
5|$|In March 1972, the Mount Saint Peter Parish Council {{was first}} elected. The group {{consists}} of eighteen elected members and it advises and assists the pastor in important decisions concerning {{the affairs of}} the church. It prides itself on having the ability to guide the parish in its mission of following Christ. The main purpose of the council <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the pastor an insight into what the parish community thinks and how it feels about different issues. All of the parish activities must go through the four standing committees, which are the Liturgy, Education, Apostolic Work, and Temporalities.|$|E

The Supporters Co-Op also assists in running the Stockport County Appearance Number (SCAN) Scheme where every player who has played a senior professional game is recognised with a unique framed certificate and a number which show their position in the list of players to make their debut for the club.|$|E

5|$|At the Sabre store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to put on}} a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Dwight assigns the members of his team various tasks: Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is to act like a hipster to make the Sabre Pyramid more appealing, Cathy (Lindsey Broad) is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a presentation to wow the critics, and Todd Packer (David Koechner) is to play the part of a sexual predator— much to Packer's chagrin. As the grand opening progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) using his old cell phone instead of his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim— who imitate Kelly and his mother respectively in an attempt to calm him down— leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named vice president by Nellie.|$|E
5|$|One way of {{addressing}} carbon leakage <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009). This {{acts as a}} subsidy for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the Garnaut Climate Change Review as it considered there were no circumstances that justify it and that governments could deal with market failure or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits. The economically efficient option would, however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries. A problem with border adjustments is {{that they might be}} used as a disguise for trade protectionism. Some types of border adjustment may also not prevent emissions leakage.|$|E
