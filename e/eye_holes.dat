25|$|The {{northern}} (funerary/mortuary) {{temple was}} {{on the north side}} of the pyramid and faced the north stars, which the king wished to join in eternity. This structure provided a place in which the daily rituals and offerings to the dead could be performed, and was the cult center for the king. To the east of the temple is the serdab, which is a small enclosed structure that housed the ka statue. The king’s ka inhabited the ka statue in order to benefit from daily ceremonies like the opening of the mouth, a ceremony that allowed him to breathe and eat, and the burning of incense. He witnessed these ceremonies through two small <b>eye</b> <b>holes</b> cut in the north wall of the serdab. This temple appeared {{on the north side of}} the pyramid throughout the Third Dynasty, as the king wished to go north to become one of the eternal stars in the North Sky that never set. In the Fourth Dynasty, when there was a religious shift to an emphasis on rebirth and eternity achieved through the sun, the temple was moved to the east side of the temple where the sun rises, so that through association the king may be reborn every day.|$|E

"But {{your father}} and Sir Lorredan of Genoa, who {{commanded}} the Christopher, fought upon the high poop, {{so that all the}} fleet stopped to watch it, and the King himself cried aloud at the sight, for Sir Lorredan was a famous man-at-arms and bore himself very stoutly that day, and many a knight envied your father that he should have chanced upon so excellent a person. But your father bore him back and struck him such a blow with a mace that he turned the helmet half round on his head, so that he could no longer see through the <b>eye</b> <b>holes,</b> and Sir Lorredan threw down his sword and gave himself to ransom. But your father took him by the helmet and twisted it until he had it straight upon his head. Then, when he could see once again, he handed him his sword, and prayed him that he would rest himself and then continue, for it was great profit and joy to see any gentleman carry himself so well. So they sat together and rested by the rail of the poop; but even as they raised their hands again your father was struck by a stone from a mangonel and so died." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} {{for the detection of}} the iris center. Starting from a learning base that only contains people in frontal view and looking in front of them, our model (based on 2 : 5 D Active Appearance Models (AAM)) is capable of capturing the iris movements for both people in frontal view and with different head poses. We merge an iris model and a local <b>eye</b> model where <b>holes</b> are put in the place of the white-iris region. The iris texture slides under the <b>eye</b> <b>hole</b> permitting to synthesize and thus analyze any gaze direction. We propose a multi-objective optimization technique to deal with large head poses.

40|$|Purpose: The {{pathogenesis}} of macular pucker and macular holes {{is poorly}} understood. Anomalous posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and vitreoschisis {{have been proposed}} as possible mechanisms. This study used clinical imaging to seek vitreoschisis and study the topographic features of macular pucker and macular holes. Methods: Combined optical coherence tomography and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (OCT/SLO) was performed in 45 <b>eyes</b> with macular <b>hole</b> and 44 <b>eyes</b> with macular pucker. Longitudinal imaging was used to identify vitreoschisis and measure retinal thickness. The topographic features of <b>eyes</b> with macular <b>hole</b> with eccentric macular contraction were compared to 24 eyes with unifocal macular pucker using coronal plane imaging. Results: Vitreoschisis was detected in 24 of 45 eyes (53. 3 %) with macular hole and 19 of 44 (43. 2 %) with macular pucker. Retinal contraction was detected eccentrically in the macula of 18 of 45 eyes (40 %) with macular <b>hole.</b> In <b>eyes</b> with macular <b>hole</b> with unifocal retinal contraction, the average surface area of contraction (23. 12 ± 18. 79 mm 2) was significantly smaller than in eyes with macular pucker (63. 20 ± 23. 68 mm 2; P =. 006). The distance {{from the center of}} retinal contraction {{to the center of the}} macula was significantly greater in <b>eyes</b> with macular <b>hole</b> (8. 64 ± 2. 33 mm) than eyes with macular pucker (4. 45 ± 1. 90 mm; P =. 0001). Conclusion: Vitreoschisis was detected in about half of all <b>eyes</b> with macular <b>hole</b> and macular pucker. The topographic and structural features in <b>eyes</b> with macular <b>hole</b> with retinal contraction differed in comparison to eyes with macular pucker alone, suggesting that although each condition may begin with anomalous PVD, differences in subsequent cell migration and proliferation probably result in the different clinical appearances detected in this study.

5000|$|On February 17, 1979, Parent {{suffered}} a career-ending eye injury {{in a game}} against the New York Rangers.

He retired at age 34, an age considered to be [...] "still in athletic prime" [...] for goaltenders. This incident, as well as the ending of Gerry Desjardins' career when a puck struck his eye in 1977, led many NHL goalies to switch from fibreglass facemasks toward the cage and helmet style, and resulted in many amateur and junior leagues banning fibreglass masks altogether, mandating the helmet/cage combo.|$|R
5000|$|The {{versions}} of the game suffer from a fatal flaw in which the scoring mechanism is easily exploited. A [...] "hit" [...] in a particular scoring hole may be registered simply by inserting a finger (or any other appropriately sized object) into said hole. It is thus possible to repeatedly insert one's finger into the bulls <b>eye</b> <b>hole</b> during a game session and achieve an unrealistically high score. Though this could be (partially) remedied by forcing the scores to register only after the ball has traversed a certain length of chute specific to each hole, Hasbro (or their successors) have yet to implement this change to the game. Concluding, any high scores you may encounter if playing a used version of the game {{should be treated as}} suspect.|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical effect of photocoagulation with 532 nm frequency-doubled laser {{in patients with}} retinal hole. METHODS: Seventy-two cases(78 <b>eyes)</b> with retinal <b>holes</b> were treated with 532 nm frequency-doubled laser. All the eyes were divided according to the quadrants of location of retinal holes {{and the size of}} retinal hole and existence of local retinal detachment accompanying retinal holes. Statistical analysis was made on these data. RESULTS: 1) The retinal holes were located in the upper quadrants of retina in 44 eyes and there were also retinal holes located in the lower quadrants of retina in 31 eyes(there were 3 <b>eyes</b> with retinal <b>holes</b> both located in the upper and lower quadrants of retina, which were not included in control group). The difference of photocoagulation effect between the two groups was statistically significant. 2) The retinal holes diameter ≤ 2 papilla diameter(PD) were present in 37 <b>eyes,</b> the <b>holes</b> diameter of retina > 2 PD were seen in 41 eyes, the difference of photocoagulation effect between the two groups was statistically significant. 3) Retinal holes without local retinal detachment were observed in 45 <b>eyes,</b> retinal <b>holes</b> with local retinal detachment were seen in 33 eyes, the difference of photocoagulation effect between the two groups was statistically significant. CONCLUSION:Photocoagulation with 532 nm frequency-doubled laser is effective and safe to treat retinal holes. The effect is better in patients with retinal holes in the upper quadrants and with the retinal holes diameter ≤ 2 PD and without local retinal detachment...|$|R
