40|$|Includes bibliographyIn {{the first}} quarter of 2004, bond flows {{remained}} strong as issuers rushed to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Emerging market issuance stood at US$ 24. 4 billion, a 15 % increase from the US$ 20. 7 billion issued in {{the first quarter}} of 2003 and the highest quarterly supply in the last three <b>years.</b> Almost <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>years</b> expected sovereign issuance materialized in the first three months. By region, Latin America had the most issuance this quarter with US$ 11. 6 billion (47. 3 % of all emerging market debt issuance). However, in the near future, a tightening of liquidity by major industrialized countries is looming. Thus, the acceleration of net capital flows to emerging markets is beginning to slow as the prospect of higher short-term interest rates has made investors more cautious and triggered deleveraging across a wide range of markets. A rising of interest rates, especially as those foreshadowed by the United States, will negatively affect capital flows to emerging markets, particularly if they are enacted sooner and less gradually than anticipated. In order to counteract the latter scenario, emerging markets will have to rely on strengthening fiscal and monetary policies. The quality of policies in emerging markets, generally speaking, has improved in recent years to include flexible exchange rates (except in Venezuela and Ecuador), budget surpluses (the highest in Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela), large international reserve buffers, and greater policy response. Yet, policy slippage remains an element of uncertainty. The momentum to implement further needed measures could be challenged, especially if the acceleration in growth currently forecast by the government and others fails to materialize. This is a plausible scenario: less investment leads to less growth...|$|R

The index that underlies this report allows countries and regions to be compared across two broad categories: Regulatory Framework and Practices, which examines regulatory and market-entry conditions, and Supporting Institutional Framework, which assesses business practices and client interaction. The Microscope was originally developed for countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region in 2007 and was expanded into a global study in 2009. Most of the research for this report, which included surveys, interviews and desk analysis, was conducted in the first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 2011. <b>This</b> <b>year's</b> Microscope builds on last year's study, but significantly improves it by utilising a new methodology, increasing the number of interviews conducted per country, and featuring financial performance data to provide context for each country's scores. ...|$|R
