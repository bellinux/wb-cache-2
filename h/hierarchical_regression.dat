50|$|To {{examine the}} effects of using {{animation}} in news report by what was then called Next Media Animation on young viewers, the School of Communication of Hong Kong Baptist University conducted two studies in 2011. For the first study, an experiment with 153 college students as participants was conducted to compare the perceived credibility of news reports with and without melodramatic animation. The results show that the animation format neither enhances nor dampens news credibility. However, they also show that sound effects reduce the credibility of news reports using melodramatic animation. The perceived credibility was also related to the credibility of the news organization and the medium dependency of the viewer. The other study adopts uses and gratifications theory and surveys 312 college students to investigate their viewing of animated-news. Seven motives were identified, which included social interaction, relaxation, information-seeking,entertainment, pastime,interpersonal learning and companionship, for viewing such animated-news videos. Results from a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> suggest predictive relationships among personality characteristics, the seven motives and the effects of perceived news credibility and newsworthiness, and the intention to share such animated news videos with others.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Occupational studies often involve {{multiple}} comparisons {{and therefore}} suffer from false positive findings. Semi-Bayes adjustment methods have sometimes {{been used to}} address this issue. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> is a more general approach, including Semi-Bayes adjustment as a special case, that aims at improving the validity of standard maximum-likelihood estimates {{in the presence of}} multiple comparisons by incorporating similarities between the exposures of interest in a second-stage model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We re-analysed data from an occupational case-control study of lung cancer, applying <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression.</b> In the second-stage model, we included the exposure to three known lung carcinogens (asbestos, chromium and silica) for each occupation, under the assumption that occupations entailing similar carcinogenic exposures are associated with similar risks of lung cancer. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> estimates had smaller confidence intervals than maximum-likelihood estimates. The shrinkage toward the null was stronger for extreme, less stable estimates (e. g., "specialised farmers": maximum-likelihood OR: 3. 44, 95 %CI 0. 90 - 13. 17; <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> OR: 1. 53, 95 %CI 0. 63 - 3. 68). Unlike Semi-Bayes adjustment toward the global mean, <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> did not shrink all the ORs towards the null (e. g., "Metal smelting, converting and refining furnacemen": maximum-likelihood OR: 1. 07, Semi-Bayes OR: 1. 06, <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> OR: 1. 26). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> could be a valuable tool in occupational studies in which disease risk is estimated for a large amount of occupations when we have information available on the key carcinogenic exposures involved in each occupation. With the constant progress in exposure assessment methods in occupational settings and the availability of Job Exposure Matrices, it should become easier to apply this approach...|$|E
40|$|Research reports {{indicate}} that approximately one third of retirees have difficulties adjusting to retirement. Depression is one possible consequence of adjustment difficulty. The present study was aimed at determining the general and sex-specific effects for how dispositional coping strategies and the two components of personal control predict depression in recent retirees. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>regressions</b> were run separately for each sex while controlling {{for the effects of}} subjective stress and demographic variables. The research participants were 188 women and 159 men who had been retired for a maximum of four years alter at least 20 years of full time employment. Results showed that both variables of control were negatively associated with depression scores in both sexes; however, in the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regressions,</b> mastery did not predict statistically significant variance in men's depression scores beyond the variance explained by demographics and stress. For the women low emotion-focused coping and high avoidance significantly predicted higher depression scores. Only high avoidance predicted the men's depression scores. When the interactions between coping and control factors were entered in the last step, they did not explain statistically significant additional variance for either sex, but the results suggested sex-specific interactions which may guide future research. Results also suggest how coping strategy effectiveness may be interpreted in the context of personal control to account for men's and women's individual differences in resilience during the retirement transition...|$|R

40|$|Exposure lagging and exposure-time window {{analysis}} are 2 widely used approaches {{to allow for}} induction and latency periods in analyses of exposure-disease associations. Exposure lagging implies a strong parametric assumption about the temporal evolution of the exposure-disease association. An exposure-time window analysis allows for a more flexible description of temporal variation in exposure effects but may result in unstable risk estimates that are sensitive to how windows are defined. The authors describe a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> approach that combines time window analysis with a parametric latency model. They illustrate this approach using data from 2 occupational cohort studies: studies of lung cancer mortality among 1) asbestos textile workers and 2) uranium miners. For each cohort, an exposure-time window analysis was compared with a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> analysis with shrinkage toward a simpler, second-stage parametric latency model. In each cohort analysis, there is sub-stantial stability gained in time window-specific estimates of association by using a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> ap-proach. The proposed <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> model couples a time window analysis with a parametric latency model; this approach provides a way to stabilize risk estimates derived from a time window analysis {{and a way to}} reduce bias arising from misspecification of a parametric latency model. cohort studies; hierarchical model; latency; neoplasms; regression Abbreviations: CI, credible interval; DIC, deviance information criterion; ERR, excess relative risk; WLM, working-level months...|$|E
40|$|In a {{hierarchical}} or fixed-order regression analysis, {{the independent variables}} are entered into the regression equation in a prespecified order. Such an analysis is often performed when the extra amount of variance accounted for in a dependent variable by a specific independent variable is {{the main focus of}} interest (e. g., Cohen & Cohen, 1983). For example, in the area of reading achievement, there is a general interest in the specific abilities that predict reading development. Because these specific abilities are often correlated with more general abilities, such as verbal intelligence, the latter abilities are controlled for first (e. g., Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994). An additional reason for performing a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> analysis is that, in these research applications, as well as in many others, the independent variables are often highly correlated. When correlated independent variables are included simultaneously in the regression model, multicollinearity arises (Cohen & Cohen, 1983). Though regularly used with observed variables, <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> analysis has not been performed with latent variables. In most applications of structural equation modeling (SEM), the latent predictors have been entered simultaneously into the regression model, although in several cases <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> analysis would have been the more appropriate approach (e. g., Guthrie et al., 1998; Normandeau & Guay, 1998; Wagner et al., 1994; Wagner et al., 1997). In this article we describe how a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regression</b> analysis may be conducted in SEM.

While {{migration}} decision-making {{has long}} been studied using mover-stayer models and standard re-gression models, they do not well handle small- and large-scale heterogeneities (migration propensities).

Using Wisconsin’s 5 % Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) file from Census 2000 for a two-level hierarchy – individual/household level and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level, we take a fresh look at how a hierarchical logit model can improve migration studies by including demographic, socio-economic, and biogeophysical factors.

40|$|Background: Health care funding levels differ {{significantly}} across geographic regions, {{but there is}} little correlation between regional funding levels and outcomes of elderly Medicare beneficiaries. Our goal was to determine whether this relationship holds true in a non-Medicare population cared for in a large integrated health care system with a capitated budget allocation system. Methods: We explored the association between health care funding and risk-adjusted mortality in the 22 Veterans Affairs (VA) geographic Networks over a six-year time period. Allocations to Networks were adjusted for illness burden using Diagnostic Cost Groups. To test the association between funding and risk-adjusted three-year mortality, we ran logistic regressions with single-year patient cohorts, as well as <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regressions</b> on a six year longitudinal data set, clustering on VA Network. Results: A $ 1000 increase in funding per unit of patient illness burden was associated with a 2 - 8 % reduction in three-year mortality in cross sectional regressions. However, in longitudinal <b>hierarchical</b> <b>regressions</b> clustering on Network, the significant effect of funding level was eliminated. Conclusions: When longitudinal data are used, the significant cross sectional effect of funding levels on mortality disappear. Thus, the factors driving differences in mortality are Network effects, although part of the Network effect may be due to past levels of funding. Our results provide a caution for cross sectional examinations of the association between regional health care funding levels and health outcomes. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
