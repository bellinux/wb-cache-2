500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} on Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later, but after Drake forwent the song, he insisted that Songz include it on Ready. Songz stated in an interview what fan reception to the track mostly had been that he should put a verse in on [...] "Successful", but Songz told BallerStatus, [...] "I was like, 'That's my homie's song.' Then initially, Drake {{came up to me}} with the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's going to be a waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' So we put the verse on there just to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more presence on the record for it to be on my album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place. I had this beat sitting here that I love so much, and I didn't know what to do with it..." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is an electropop-influenced disco track. Minogue's breathy and whisper-y vocal {{delivery}} and the electronic {{production of the}} song make it similar to [...] "I Believe in You", a single from Minogue's greatest hits album Ultimate Kylie (2004). Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue invites her lover to dance with her, beginning with a line in which she softly sings [...] "Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance? I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?". During the anthemic chorus of the song, which is backed by a warbling synthesizer riff, Minogue asserts that her previous relationships do not [...] "compare" [...] to her present one, singing [...] "All the lovers that have gone before, they don't compare to you/ Don't be frightened, just <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more/ They don't compare, all the lovers." [...] UK-based music website Popjustice opined that the song is [...] "not really about relaxing while you dance, it's about relaxing into a relationship." [...] Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog felt the [...] "elegiac" [...] and sad-toned chorus [...] "makes the verses transform from a straightforward plea for dancefloor action into what sounds like a demand that everyone join Kylie for one last dance before things become spoiled forever." [...] The song features a bridge section in which Minogue again asks her lover to dance with her, after which an electronic breakdown takes place. According to the sheet music of the song published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is composed in the key of C major and follows a midtempo of 142 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the key of G3 to A4.|$|E
2500|$|After the Allies began {{digging a}} new trench against the inner defenses, Dubreton {{launched}} a sortie without warning on 5 October. The attackers killed and wounded almost 150 Allies and carried off or spoiled {{much of their}} equipment. No sooner had Wellington resumed siege operations than Dubreton struck again. At 2am on the 8th, with perfect timing, the French swarmed out of the fort and inflicted 184 casualties while suffering small losses. Rain began to fall in sheets, flooding the siege trenches. The British guns on the hornwork ran so low on ammunition that French cannonballs were retrieved and reused. Wellington wrote, [...] "This is altogether the most difficult job I ever had in hand with such trifling means. God send that they may <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nine {{government}} {{witnesses were}} {{called by the}} prosecution. Army Captain Robert Snyder, John Threadcraft, a former army officer, and FBI agent John Jefferson testified first. As Snyder testified that Siddiqui had been arrested with a handwritten note outlining plans to attack various US sites, she interjected: [...] "Since I'll never {{get a chance to}} speak... If you were in a secret prison... or your children were tortured... <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> credit, this is not a list of targets against New York. I was never planning to bomb it. You're lying." [...] The court also heard from FBI agent John Jefferson and Ahmed Gul, an army interpreter, who recounted their struggle with her. The judge disallowed as evidence her possession of chemicals and terror manuals and her alleged ties to al-Qaeda because they could have created an inappropriate bias.|$|E
