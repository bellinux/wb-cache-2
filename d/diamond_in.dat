5|$|In the United States, {{diamonds}} {{have been}} found in Arkansas, Colorado and Montana. In 2004, a startling discovery of a microscopic <b>diamond</b> <b>in</b> the United States led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of Montana.|$|E
5|$|During the growth, {{the chamber}} {{materials}} are etched {{off by the}} plasma and can incorporate into the growing <b>diamond.</b> <b>In</b> particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or {{moved away from the}} substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.|$|E

5|$|The usual form of <b>diamond</b> <b>in</b> {{cutting tools}} is micrometer-sized grains {{dispersed}} {{in a metal}} matrix (usually cobalt) sintered onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools {{can be found in}} mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work has been done to coat metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.|$|E
5|$|When the Americans arrived, the British {{made every}} effort to include them in the athletics. Space was allotted on the sports fields to provide a {{football}} field and a baseball <b>diamond.</b> <b>In</b> short order, the division developed a baseball league that played 17 games during the summer of 1918. Texas won the division championship, but lost to a visiting team from American naval headquarters in London. Football games occurred throughout the fall.|$|E
5|$|In 1772, the French {{scientist}} Antoine Lavoisier used a lens {{to concentrate}} {{the rays of}} the sun on a <b>diamond</b> <b>in</b> an atmosphere of oxygen, and showed that the only product of the combustion was carbon dioxide, proving that diamond is composed of carbon. Later in 1797, the English chemist Smithson Tennant repeated and expanded that experiment. By demonstrating that burning diamond and graphite releases the same amount of gas, he established the chemical equivalence of these substances.|$|E

Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10nm is also reported to have Vickers hardness comparable or higher than diamond.

5|$|The four {{ships that}} {{remained}} with the Mediterranean Fleet sank three Italian submarines in 1940 while escorting Malta convoys and larger warships of the fleet. Several {{participated in the}} Battles of Calabria and Cape Spartivento that year. Duncan joined Force H at Gibraltar in October and escorted that group. Dainty was sunk by German bombers in February 1941 and <b>Diamond</b> <b>in</b> April while evacuating Allied personnel from Greece. Defender had to be scuttled in July when she was crippled by a German bomber when returning from escorting a convoy to Tobruk.

They sank two German submarines before being assigned to the UK to protect Allied shipping during Operation Overlord. They sank three more submarines before the end of the war and were paid off in 1945. Duncan was scrapped 1945–49 and Decoy during 1946.|$|E
