The significance of the proposed reform of competition policy 3 Consider the following questions: Which policy applies to all sectors of the economy? Which policy has extra-territorial application and may penalise companies based in countries far away from the European Union? In which policy can the European Commission enter and search the premises of any company anywhere in the EU and eventually impose fines on them of up to 10 % of their world-wide turnover? In which policy does the EC Treaty empower the Commission to issue decisions or directives to member states without prior approval of the Council or Parliament? In which policy must the member states ask for authorisation by the Commission before implementing national measures? In which policy does the Commission have to deal with more than 1, 300 cases per year? Which policy is enforced directly by the Commission? Which policy is enforced with an implementing regulation that dates back to the very early years of the Community and has not changed yet? The common answer to all these questions is “competition policy”. This policy, whose objectives and enforcement procedures have remained virtually unchanged since the inception of the European Community, is now being modernised and decentralised...|$|R

The function of block exemptions is to <b>exempt</b> certain <b>agreements</b> from the prohibition of distortion of competition. The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects related to the concept of block exemptions. First chapter is an introduction into the topic of protection of competition and explains basic principles and terminology. Chapter two deals with other exemptions from prohibition of distorting competition. The chapter is divided into four subchapters. The first one analyzes four aspects of the exemption under Article 101 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The second subchapter focuses on de minimis rule. Third subchapter deals with exemption in agriculture sector. Finally, the problem of block exemptions is briefly introduced. Third chapter follows the historic development of the concept of block exemptions both in European law and Czech law. Firstly, it describes the reasons for introduction of block exemptions by the Commission and then it focuses on the change of approach in year 2004, when ex post control was introduced.

With Bangladesh, Nepal saw an opportunity to obtain access to port facilities in the Bay of Bengal to bolster foreign trade - something it had sought when Bangladesh was part of Pakistan, to limited success. Bilateral relations improved considerably when the 1975 military coup in Bangladesh brought to power a government that distanced the country from India, with both nations seeking to counter the influence of their largest neighbour. In April 1976, both nations signed bilateral agreements to develop trade, transit and civil aviation. The transit <b>agreement</b> <b>exempted</b> all traffic-in-transit from duties and other charges. Six points of entry and exit for Nepalese traffic were set up.

40|$|On 1 June 2010, a new Block Exemption Regulation (BER) and new Guidelines {{that affect}} the {{practical}} use of selective distribution systems enter into force. The BER <b>exempts</b> vertical <b>agreements,</b> such as selective distribution agreements, from the prohibition of Article 101 (1) TFEU. It is significant for individual market players to obtain knowledge of what impact the new BER and the new Guidelines have for the practical use of selective distribution systems. The Commission has amended the new BER and the new Guidelines {{in the light of}} the development the last decade. Two main changes are noticed {{that affect the}} content of the new legislative documents. Firstly, it is established that many distributors have obtained larger market shares. Secondly, it is stated that Internet sales have increased largely. The basic principles of the new versions of the BER and the Guidelines are identical with the former versions but the present changes are although noticeable for companies and their selective distribution systems. The new BER contains a new market share rule that is more restrictive than the corresponding rule in the former BER. However, the new market share rule is not an expression of a less tolerant approach towards selective distribution systems; rather an amendment necessary due to the development of distributors’ market shares. The growth of distribution in the Internet the last ten years is reflected in the new Guidelines. The Commission’s approach towards the Internet as a distribution method seems in general to be positive. It is noticeable that the Commission wants that parties of selective distribution agreements shall be able to benefit from all the positive effects of online sales at the same time as the Commission tries to preserve the positive effects of selective distribution. This thesis describes and examines the practical use of selective distribution systems. Different reasons for companies to use selective distribution systems and effects of the new BER and Guidelines are in particular examined...|$|R

The main aim of my thesis is to analyze and describe {{the development of an}} approach to block exemptions and to present how the block exemptions work in practice. Generally, block exemptions are issued in the form of Block Exemption Regulations according to Article 101 (3) TFEU. The wording of this provision specifies the conditions under which certain types of <b>agreements</b> may be <b>exempted</b> from the prohibition set by Article 101 (1) TFEU.

The thesis is composed of six chapters. The first two chapters are introductory. Chapter One refers to the protection of competition in general. Subsequently, Chapter Two deals with main exemptions from the prohibition of restrictive agreements, such as <b>agreements</b> <b>exempted</b> from the prohibition under Article 101 (3) TFEU or the de minimis rule of exemption from the prohibition.

40|$|In 2002, the USA {{asked all}} {{countries}} to sign <b>agreements</b> <b>exempting</b> US citizens from prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and threatened economic sanctions if they refused. Some countries yielded to this pressure even after ratifying the ICC Statute, while others chose to honor their original commitments.

This article provides an explanation of state vulnerability to attempts of influence {{through the lens of}} economic sanctions. Assessing the success of sanctions is difficult because of the selection bias in the instances of the use of such strategies observed by the researcher. Since all countries were asked to sign such agreements, one can observe exactly which signed, whether sanctions were enforced, and how quickly countries responded to such pressure. Arguments about sources of influence - shared interests, economic and security dependence, and domestic politics - are tested using an original dataset collected on country decisions to sign bilateral immunity agreements (BIAs). The authors find support for some existing explanations, including relative power and the relationship of dependency, while previously held beliefs about alliance and security relationships appear to be less influential on decisions to ratify BIAs. These findings have implications for existing research programs on economic sanctions, international organizations, and power politics...|$|R

Her configuration, and that of the following V-5 and V-6, resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific.
