40|$|A new {{understanding}} {{of the consequences of}} how ecosystem elements are interconnected is emerging from the development and application of Ecological Network Analysis. The relative importance of indirect effects is central to this understanding, and the ratio of <b>indirect</b> <b>flow</b> to direct flow (I/D) is one indicator of their importance. Two methods have been proposed for calculating this indicator. The unit approach shows what would happen if each system member had a unit input or output, while the realized technique determines the ratio using the observed system inputs or outputs. When using the unit method, the input oriented and output oriented ratios can be different, potentially leading to conflicting results. However, we show that the input and output oriented I/D ratios are identical using the realized method when the system is at steady state.

A multicommodity flow, where each commodity is of single-origin-single-destination type, moves on the network according to its linear objective function c. Gateways are used by the network administrator to reroute flows by obliging each commodity to detour from its c-optimal path and pass by its assigned gateway. Gateways are located and assigned by the administrator so that the resulting c-optimal flows on the detours minimize the administrator’s objective function r. Gateways thus provide the administrator with a mechanism for <b>indirect</b> <b>flow</b> control, so that the flow value according to r is improved with respect to the unregulated scenario.

30|$|In general it {{can become}} {{challenging}} to adopt economic tools adequately in health care environments because the relationship between supplier and customer is not as straightforward as in usual business industries. One major reason for the more complicated situation in health care systems is the triangular flow {{of goods and services}} among patient, physician and insurer: While patients receive a service from the physician (or the medical unit), they reimburse the insurer via the insuring fee. While physicians (or the medical unit) receive a reimbursement from the insurer, they treat the patient, and while the insurer receives payments from the patient, the reimbursement is forwarded to the physician. Thus, there is always an <b>indirect</b> <b>flow</b> of goods and services, rendering health care environments and all of their participants very susceptible to known quality control as well as economic dilemmas (e.g. principal agent, ex post and ex ante moral hazard, adverse selection, information asymmetry). The aforementioned triangular relationship in health care {{is also one of the}} major reasons why the “patient” may not (or cannot) be reduced to an ordinary “customer”.

Ecological network {{analysis was used to}} track the integral (direct + <b>indirect)</b> <b>flows</b> and to compare the contribution of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>flows</b> at both the scale of each component and of the whole urban system during the period from 1996 to 2012.

The integral flow from Industry to Atmosphere, which was consistently at 200 Gg, was the largest at five time points; the flow from Household to Sewage treatment grew fastest, and in 2012, increased to 5. 9 times its 1996 value; the flow from Industry to Farmland decreased most obviously, and in 2012, it decreased to 12. 9 % of the value in 1996. Moreover, the indirect effects were dominant for the whole system in Beijing with a ratio of <b>indirect</b> to direct <b>flow</b> equal to 1. 2.

40|$|Information flow {{analysis}} is a static analysis {{that is used}} to ensure that a classic security policy – confidentiality – is satisfied by a program. Confidentiality is an end-to-end policy: given a program with different levels of inputs, some sensitive (High) and some public (Low), where Low, High are levels in a security lattice Low ≤ High, the policy states that no information about High inputs should flow to (i. e., be leaked to) Low outputs. Confidentiality can be ensured by checking for the indistinguishability property: “No information is leaked, if two runs of a program are indistinguishable on Low variables”. There can be different ways of information flow: direct flow due to the direct assignment of one variable to the other, <b>indirect</b> <b>flow</b> in which information flows via a control variable in a conditional or loop. Object oriented programs have some more flows due to pointer aliasing and dynamic dispatch.

In this paper we focus on an important but neglected aspect of knowledge transfer from academic research involving the <b>indirect</b> <b>flow</b> to entrepreneurship by individuals with a university education background who become involved in new venture creation by means of corporate spinoffs (CSO) after gaining industrial experience, rather than leaving university employment to found a new venture as an academic spinoff.

This leads us to posit that the average performance of CSOs will be higher than comparable USOs, but the gains from founder's prior experiences will be relatively higher among USOs whose founders lack the corporate context.

40|$|Abstract: Human {{intestinal}} infections by Shiga toxin (Stx) -producing Escherichia coli cause hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), {{which represents}} {{the main cause of}} acute renal failure in early childhood. In HUS, Stx released in the gut enter the bloodstream and are targeted to renal endothelium. The mechanism of toxin delivery is still a matter of debate, although the role of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) as a Stx carrier has been indicated. The aim of this paper was to better define the interactions between Stx and human PMN. Direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>flow</b> cytometric analysis and binding experiments with radiolabeled toxins demonstrated that Stx bind to the surface of human mature PMN but not to immature PMN from G-CSF-treated donors. The use of the human myeloid leukemia cell (HL- 60) model for inducible cell differentiation confirmed that the toxin binding occurs only after granulocytic differentiation. Stx binding caused a delay of the spontaneous apoptosis of PMN, as shown by the delayed appearance of apoptotic nuclei and activation of caspase 3 and by the higher number of cells negative to the annexin V-binding assay after 48 h. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis of mixed Stxpositive and Stx-negative PMN populations showed that the toxins were transferred from positive to negative PMN. The delayed, spontaneous apoptosis and the passage of the toxic ligand from older PMN to new, mature cells entering the circulation from the bone marrow may explain the previously reported persistence of Stx in the blood of childre...|$|E

Therefore, those models fail to examine the water utilization efficiency from an integral view.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of the origin of raw materials, dramatic shifts can be observed over the analyzed time period. The share of raw materials that were extracted within the territory of the EU fell significantly from 68  % in 1995 to 35  % in 2011. This illustrates that today around two-thirds of the raw materials that are directly and indirectly needed to satisfy European final demand is extracted in other world regions. As illustrated in Fig.  1 (bottom), the most significant shift occurred between the EU and China, which in 2011 already contributed an equal amount of raw materials related to EU’s final demand for goods and services. This particular pattern is closely related to the current development stage of China, which—as a fast-growing emerging market—is in the process of building up its housing, transport and energy infrastructure. On the one hand, this leads to significant amounts of raw materials required for investments and capital formation, which dominate China’s own material footprint (see Giljum et al. 2015). On the other hand, construction materials also serve as indirect inputs to manufacturing industries, which produce goods exported to the EU (see also Wang et al. 2014; Wiedmann et al. 2015). This <b>indirect</b> <b>flow</b> of construction materials grew from around 230 million tonnes in 1995 to more than 3 billion tonnes in 2011 and was thus far above flows of other key raw materials extracted in China and serving EU final demand, such as coal (394 million tonnes) or iron ores (157 million tonnes).|$|E

The goal of this project is to design and implement a modular, low profile, scalable and solar-powered system to offer an on-site heat source. Operating temperatures on the target range of this project create the possibility of providing a renewable source of heat to a number of thermally activated technologies such as refrigeration, air-conditioning, power generation, desalination, water treatment and others. This thesis presents three heat transfer models that were built to conduct a preliminary performance assessment of three concentrating solar thermal units. Each solar thermal unit is comprised of an optical concentrator and a thermal element. The optical element is a non-imaging, reflective concentrator in the family of the compound parabolic concentrators (CPC). The thermal element includes a solar radiation absorber that transfers heat to a fluid, and an evacuated glass tube that encloses the absorber.

40|$|Through May of 1993, a {{sequence}} of reservoir flow tests has been conducted at our Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock (HDR) test site {{as part of the}} Long-Term Flow Testing (LTFT) program. This testing, which extended over an aggregate period of about 8 months, has demonstrated several significant features concerning HDR reservoirs that taken together reflect very positively on the future development of the HDR concept into a viable commercial reality. Of most significance is the demonstrated self-regulating nature of the flow through such a reservoir. Both temperature and tracer data indicate that the flow, rather than concentrating in a few potential direct flow paths, progressively shifted towards more <b>indirect</b> <b>flow</b> paths as the test proceeded. This self-regulating mechanism {{may be related to the}} strongly temperature-dependent viscosity of water. Measurements have shown that the reservoir flow impedance is concentrated in the near-wellbore region surrounding the production well. This situation may well be a blessing in disguise since this suggests that the distance between injection and production wells can be significantly increased, with a greatly enhanced access to fractured hot rock, without an undue impedance penalty. However, since the multiply interconnected joints within the HDR reservoir are held open by fluid pressure (pressurepropping), a higher mean reservoir pressure is the obvious path to increased productivity while still retaining the distributed nature of the flow. Other significant observations include a very small rate of reservoir water loss that was still declining at the end of the flow testing, and a set of temperature measurements in the production well that show no significant temperature drawdown during the period of testing...|$|E
40|$|Contagious bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is {{a severe}} {{respiratory}} disease of cattle that causes economic loses {{of up to}} 40 million Euros annually in sub-Saharan Africa. The preferred method of control is vaccination however the currently available vaccine confers insufficient and short term immunity hence there is {{need to develop a}} better vaccine. The disease is caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm) a pathogen that belongs to a group of closely related pathogens, the M. mycoides cluster. Mmm only causes pneumonia in cattle and related species but not in sheep or goats, suggesting that there must be a specific interaction between bovine lung cells and Mmm. Calves younger than six months on the other hand do not develop pneumonia but rather arthritis and associated lameness. The aim of thesis is to assess the adherence of Mmm to host cells and to further identifiy Mmm specific monoclonal antibodies that block this binding. This is the first study to describe the adhesion process for Mmm. Our hypothesis is that prevention of binding between Mmm and bovine lung epithelial cells in vivo will prevent severe disease. The identification of the Mycoplasma adhesin(s) that mediate this interaction could be candidate vaccine targets. The specific objectives of this study are to assess the manifestation of CBPP in 7 month old calves and to compare in- contact and intubation methods of infection, establish an <b>indirect</b> <b>flow</b> cytometry assay to measure Mycoplasma adherence to different host cells and produce a panel of Mmm- specific monoclonal antibodies, and select for mAbs that inhibit Mmm adherence to bovine lung epithelial cells; select carbohydrate substances with different functional groups and test their ability to inhibit Mmm cyto-adherence. The antigens to antibodies that inhibit adherence could be potential vaccine candidatesAcknowledgements [...] i List of abbreviations [...] . ii Summary [...] . iv Samenvatting [...] vi Chapter 1 : Literature review on Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides [...] 1 Aim and objectives of the thesis [...] 17 Chapter 2 : Manifestation of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia in 7 - month-old calves infected via bronchoscope [...] 19 Chapter 3 : Cyto-adherence of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides to bovine lung epithelial cells [...] . 29 Chapter 4 : Characterization of Mmm cyto-adherence through inhibition by specific antibodies and carbohydrate substances [...] 45 Chapter 5 :Conclusions and perspectives [...] 63 References [...] 68 Racheal Aye CV [...] 84 nrpages: 83 status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{we suggest}} {{not only a}} direct effect of network {{externalities}} on adoption, but also an indirect effect as well. Specifically, we posit that direct and indirect network effects will strengthen the positive relationship between the fit of CRM for its task and the adoption of CRM in organizations. While there is no CRM or software-based research to support our posit, prior research on food service has shown traceability can create positive network externalities in a supply chain that can moderate the willingness of manufacturers to pay for technologies needed to undertake the innovation [69]. Also, Wareham et al. [76] found that network externalities {{have an impact on}} supply chain performance and can lead to more efficient, direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>flows</b> in information.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMandatory Access Control {{is really}} poorly {{supported}} by Cloud environments. Our paper proposes {{extensions of the}} OpenNebula Cloud {{in order to provide}} an advanced MAC protection of the virtual machines hosted by the different nodes of the Cloud. Thus, unique SELinx security labels are associated with the virtual machines and their ressources. The instanciations and migrations of the virtual machines maintain those unique security labels. Moreover, PIGA-Virt provides a unified way to control the information flows within a virtual machine but also between multiple virtual machines. SELinux controls the direct flows. PIGA-Virt adds advanced controls. Thus, a PIGA protection rule can control several direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>flows.</b> The benchmarks of PIGA-Virt show that our Trusted OpenNebula Cloud is efficient regarding the quality of the protection...|$|R
40|$|A {{variant of}} the Mobile Ambient calculus, called Boundary Ambients, is introduced, {{supporting}} the modelling of multi-level security policies. Ambients that may guarantee to properly protect their content are explicitly identified as boundaries: a boundary {{can be seen as}} a resource access manager for confidential data. In this setting, absence of direct information leakage is granted as soon as the initial process satisfies some syntactic conditions. We then give a new notion of non-interference for Boundary Ambients aiming at capturing <b>indirect</b> <b>flows,</b> too. We design a Control Flow Analysis that computes an over-approximation of all ambients that may be affected at run-time by high-level data and we show that this static analysis can be used to enforce non-interference, i. e., to statically detect that no (direct or indirect) information leakage is ever possible at run-time. ...|$|R
