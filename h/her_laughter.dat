25|$|Ciara Carroll {{served as}} a regular {{assistant}} during D'Arcy's time as presenter. She would arrive at the studio to announce new competitions, provide observations from behind the camera and <b>her</b> <b>laughter</b> could often {{be heard in the}} background as Zig and Zag accused her of being responsible for breaking winds. She would also include herself during many other features throughout the day. During the Dempsey years, The Den assistant was Celine, who would later present Jo Maxi when D'Arcy departed that programme to succeed Ian Dempsey.|$|E
25|$|The Prince wanders {{for some}} time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat {{appointed}} by Aglaya as their meeting place. <b>Her</b> <b>laughter</b> wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastassya Filippovna, and they talk for a long time about the letters Aglaya has received. In the letters, Nastassya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin, but Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastassya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastassya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is not in love with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters back in her face, and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters with dread, and later that day Nastassya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her.|$|E
500|$|Ashida co-starred with actor Kenichi Matsuyama in the manga {{adaptation}} Usagi Drop. [...] She {{played the}} main character Rin, and was widely praised for her performance. The film's director, Sabu, praised her, saying that <b>her</b> <b>laughter</b> [...] "was always echoing throughout the set, creating a peaceful atmosphere inside the set". The Japan Times reviewer Mark Schilling said that she [...] "seamlessly accomplishes her evolution from forlorn waif to perky if unusually perceptive kid, while effortlessly charming everyone.". Mana Ashida won the [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] award at the 54th Blue Ribbon Awards. She was the youngest person to receive this award, beating the 1983 record set by actress Tomoyo Harada.|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{you drop}} me, {{somebody}} would find {{me on the}} rocks," [...] Peters replied in a breathless voice, and Flora tried to stop <b>her</b> wild <b>laughter.</b> <b>Her</b> control was vanishing and the scene was ludicrous. Peters had looked grotesque while he wriggled in Bob's grasp and now his coolness supplied a last touch of grim humor.|$|R
500|$|The song's lyrics {{allude to}} his {{supposed}} relationship with Mariah Carey, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof {{he claims to}} have of the couple. The song begins [...] "Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied seeing me. Now I'm pissed off," [...] before describing Carey's impersonation of him in her video, [...] "Oh gee, is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?/ Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out." [...] Eminem continues describing a near-sexual encounter with the singer, threatening to release voice-mails and pictures he still has in his possession. Additionally, the song features a females voice, unknown whether or not Carey's, where she calls herself Mary Poppins, as well as several intervals of <b>her</b> <b>laughter.</b>|$|E
500|$|When Homer is mowing {{his lawn}} with obvious frustration, his next-door {{neighbor}} Ned Flanders invites {{him into his}} basement rumpus room for a beer. Upon seeing Ned's house and observing his exaggeratedly perfect relationships {{with his wife and}} son, Homer erupts at Ned, accusing him of showing off. Ned angrily asks Homer to leave in response. Later, however, he feels guilty and writes a letter to Homer saying that he is really sorry and that he loves him as a brother. [...] Homer is amused by Ned's sentimentality and reads the letter to the family at the breakfast table. Marge is not happy with the family's reaction, despite being unable to control <b>her</b> <b>laughter,</b> and chastises Homer for making light of Ned's sincere apology. Afterward, Homer takes Bart and Maggie to Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre for a round of miniature golf. They unexpectedly run into Ned and his son Todd and end up going golfing together.|$|E
500|$|The Academy {{recognized}} {{hard rock}} music artists {{for the first}} time in 1989 with the category Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental, combining two of the most popular music genres of the 1980s. Metallica, who were expected to win the inaugural award for their album ...And Justice for All, lost to Jethro Tull whose album Crest of a Knave won instead. Also beating out Jane's Addiction, Iggy Pop, as well as AC/DC. The presenters Lita Ford and Alice Cooper slightly confused, somewhat dejected way in which Cooper announced Jethro Tull's victory, as Ford quickly self-stifled <b>her</b> <b>laughter,</b> the boos from the crowd, and the even more confusion after reaction by Ian Anderson (who wasn't present to accept the trophy, which he thought his band had earned as a sort of lifetime-achievement commemoration). [...] This choice led to widespread criticism of the Academy, as journalists suggested that Jethro Tull's music did not belong in either the hard rock or heavy metal genres. In response, the Academy separated the genres creating the categories Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance. This incident is often considered an example of the Grammy Awards being out of touch with popular sentiment, and was named the biggest upset in Grammy history by Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

500|$|After Carey premiered [...] "Obsessed" [...] on June 16, 2009, {{the media}} frenzied and began speculating {{the song was}} {{targeting}} at Eminem, due to its lyrics and overall message. Following the song's accompanying music video, which featured Carey playing a role that resembled the rapper, critics considered it Carey's response to Eminem's [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". Soon after both the song and video's release, the rapper released another song, titled [...] "The Warning" [...] on July 30, 2009, which he {{claimed to be a}} retaliation. The song's lyrics allude to his supposed relationship with the singer, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof he claims to have of the couple. The song begins [...] "Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied seeing me.

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Abraham was 100 {{years old when}} Isaac was born, and Sarah remarked that God had brought <b>her</b> <b>laughter</b> and {{everyone}} would laugh with her about her bearing Abraham a child in his old age. Abraham held a great feast {{on the day that}} Sarah weaned Isaac. Sarah saw Hagar's son Ishmael playing, and Sarah told Abraham to cast Hagar and Ishmael out, saying that Ishmael would not share in Abraham's inheritance with Isaac. Sarah's words greatly distressed Abraham, but God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do whatever Sarah told him, for Isaac would carry on Abraham's line, and God would make a nation of Ishmael, too. Early the next morning, Abraham placed some bread and water on Hagar's shoulder, together with Ishmael, and sent them away. Hagar and Ishmael wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba, and when the water ran out, she left the child under a bush, sat down about two bowshots away so as not to see the child die, and burst into tears. God heard the cry of the boy, and an angel called to Hagar, saying not to fear, for God had heeded the boy's cry, and would make of him a great nation. Then God opened her eyes to a well of water, and she and the boy drank. God was with Ishmael and he grew up in the wilderness and became a bowman. Ishmael lived in the wilderness of Paran, and Hagar got him an Egyptian wife. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the first open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here.|$|E

60|$|Now Rachel rose to {{her feet}} again and laughed, but it was not the mad {{laughter}} that had scared Ishmael and the Zulus; it was <b>her</b> own <b>laughter,</b> that of a healthy, cultured woman.|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes she darted {{along the}} road so swiftly that she was nearly out of sight, then she came {{tripping}} back to greet them with <b>her</b> silvery <b>laughter.</b> But once she came back more sedately, to say: ...|$|R
60|$|I was of two minds. <b>Her</b> <b>laughter</b> was {{delightful}} to the ear, {{there was}} such a mellowness, and healthiness, and frankness about it. On the other hand, that it should be directed at my misfortune was exasperating. I suppose my perplexity showed in my face, for when she had eased <b>her</b> <b>laughter</b> and looked at me with a sobering countenance, she immediately went off into more peals.|$|E
60|$|Now Rosamund laughed out, and {{the sweet}} sound of <b>her</b> <b>laughter</b> was strange in that solemn place and hour.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{still at}} the same metaphor," [...] he returned, with a keen glance at her face.
