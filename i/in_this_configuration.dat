5|$|In the {{iconography}} of Kashmir, during the 8th and 9th centuries, the gods of Hindu Trimurti - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - each are depicted with three heads. In a sculpture displayed in the Metropolitan Art Museum of New York, the four-headed Brahma as well as Shiva are shown with three visible heads. Vishnu is depicted as Vaikuntha Chaturmurti <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>configuration,</b> with three visible heads.|$|E

5|$|As {{prescribed}} in the Jayakhya-Samhita, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti may be {{depicted as}} riding his vehicle (vahana) Garuda too, though {{these images are}} rarer. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>configuration,</b> the god holds a sword, a lotus, a mace or a conch and the chakra. Generally, on four feathers of Garuda sit four female figures, two {{on either side of}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The identity of the female figures is uncertain. They are interpreted as two goddesses (possibly consorts of Vishnu - Lakshmi and Bhumi) and two female attendants. The Jayakhya-Samhita mentions that four goddesses Lakshmi, Kirti, Jaya and Maya as the female counterparts of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Rarely, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is accompanied with his consort Lakshmi, who sits on his left thigh. This form is called Lakshmi Vaikuntha in the Jayakhya-Samhita.|$|E
5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which acts like an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic fields <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>configuration</b> could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.|$|E

South Indian sculptures, like those from Madurai, feature only the couple and Vishnu. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>configuration,</b> Parvati is depicted in the centre with Vishnu on the left giving away her hand to Shiva on the right. Sometimes as in the Elephanta Caves, Parvati's biological father Himavan, instead of Vishnu, is depicted giving away his daughter to Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>configuration.</b> It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>configuration,</b> the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E
