50|$|This was {{the first}} American front-wheel drive car to be offered to the public, beating the Ruxton {{automobile}} by several months, in 1929. The brainchild of former Miller engineer Carl Van Ranst, its drive system borrowed from the Indianapolis 500-dominating racers, using the same de Dion layout and inboard brakes. This allowed it to be much lower than competing cars. Both stock cars and special bodies built on the Cord chassis by American and European coachbuilders won prizes in contests worldwide. The L-29 came with full instrumentation, including a temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, and speedometer on the left with a <b>gas</b> <b>gauge,</b> oil level gauge, and Ammeter {{on the right of}} the steering wheel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a micro power {{battery state of charge}} monitor. The novelty of this design lies in the extreme low power consumption and accurate prediction of the battery reserve time. The average current drawn is successfully limited to 60 µA, which is significantly smaller than those in currently available devices. The proposed design predicts the reserved battery charge with an accuracy of 5 % under different discharge conditions. The automated learning scheme using software is utilized. Protection of the battery against excessive current drain and usage outside the specified temperature range is incorporated. This paper details the proposed technique adopted for power reduction. The battery temperature and current sensing circuits are normally in power down mode, they go into active mode for the microcontroller to take measurements. An ON/OFF ratio of 1 : 153 is achieved which results in power reduction by a factor of 59. 30. The average current requirement of the proposed design is reduced from 3302. 79 µA to 55. 69 µA with the adoption of power reduction approach. The proposed design has been tested on a NiMH, NiCd and Li-Ion battery packs and the experimental results confirm the utility of the proposed design 1.

50|$|Having {{survived the}} Depression, Minneapolis-Honeywell was {{approached}} by the US military for engineering and manufacturing projects. In 1941, Minneapolis-Honeywell developed a superior tank periscope and camera stabilizers, {{as well as the}} C-1 autopilot. The C-1 revolutionized precision bombing in the war effort, and was used on the two B-29 bombers that dropped atomic bombs on Japan in 1945. The success of these projects led Minneapolis-Honeywell to open an Aero division in Chicago on October 5, 1942. This division was responsible {{for the development of the}} formation stick to control autopilots, more accurate <b>gas</b> <b>gauges</b> for planes, and the turbo supercharger. In 1950, Minneapolis-Honeywell’s Aero division was contracted for the controls on the first US nuclear submarine, USS Nautilus. The following year, the company acquired Intervox Company for their sonar, ultrasonics, and telemetry technologies. Honeywell also helped develop and manufacture the RUR-5 ASROC for the US Navy.In 1953, in cooperation with the USAF Wright-Air Development Center, Honeywell developed an automated control unit that could control an aircraft through various stages of a flight, from taxiing, to takeoff, to the point where the aircraft neared its destination and the pilot took over for landing. Called the Automatic Master Sequence Selector, the onboard control operated similarly to a player piano to relay instructions to the aircraft's autopilot at certain way points during the flight, significantly reducing the pilot's workload. Technologically, this effort had parallels to contemporary efforts in missile guidance and numerical control. Honeywell also developed the Wagtail missile with the USAF.|$|R
25|$|According to the USAFHD, {{there were}} 110 {{factories}} and 50,000 workers supporting the German war effort in Dresden {{at the time}} of the raid. These factories manufactured fuses and bombsights (at Zeiss Ikon A.G.), aircraft components, anti-aircraft guns, field guns, and small arms, poison gas, gears and differentials, electrical and X-ray apparatus, electric <b>gauges,</b> <b>gas</b> masks, Junkers aircraft engines, and Messerschmitt fighter cockpit parts.|$|R

5000|$|... 1975: Following the {{discontinuation}} of the Galaxie series after 1974, Ford {{sought to}} fill its place by expanding the LTD trim lineup. Above the Custom 500 was the standard LTD, the LTD Brougham, and newly introduced for 1975, the LTD Landau. [...] In {{an effort to}} comply with pending rollover standards (as well as to differentiate it from the Mercury Marquis), the two-door was converted from a hardtop to a coupe with wide B-pillars and a tall, narrow [...] "opera window" [...] (Chevrolet {{did the same thing}} in 1973 with the Caprice Coupe). More or less the Ford counterpart to the Mercury Grand Marquis, the LTD Landau featured rear fender skirts and various decor packages for additional luxury; it was distinguished by the return of hidden headlamps (exclusive to its trim level). Hidden headlamps were also shared with the LTD Country Squire wagon. The 429 engine was replaced by the 460 V8 sourced from Lincoln-Mercury for 1975. A catalytic converter now required the use of unleaded fuel, and the <b>gas</b> <b>gauge</b> and fuel filler sported warnings to this effect.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the funeral}} {{service of a}} noble General Authority, H. Verlan Andersen, a tribute was {{expressed}} by a son. He related that, years earlier, he had a special school date on a Saturday night. He borrowed from his father the family car. As he obtained the car keys {{and headed for the}} door, his father said, “Remember, tomorrow is Sunday. The car will need more gas before then. Be sure to fill the tank before coming home.”Elder Andersen’s son then related that the evening activity was wonderful. Friends met, refreshments were served, and all had a good time. In his exuberance, however, he failed to follow his father’s instruction and add fuel to the car’s tank before returning home. He simply forgot.Sunday morning dawned. Elder Andersen discovered the <b>gas</b> <b>gauge</b> showed empty. The son saw his father put the car keys on the table. In the Andersen family the Sabbath day was a day for worship and thanksgiving, and not for purchases.As the funeral message continued, Elder Andersen’s son declared, “I saw my father put on his coat, bid us good-bye, and walk the long distance to the chapel, that he might attend an early meeting.” Duty called. Truth was not held hostage to expedience.In concluding his funeral message, Elder Andersen’s son said, “No son ever was taught more effectively by his father than I was on that occasion.

50|$|In a {{magnetic}} gauge a float {{on the surface}} of the liquid contains a permanent magnet. The liquid is contained in a chamber of strong, non-magnetic material, avoiding the use of glass. The level indicator consists of a number of pivoting magnetic vanes arranged one above the other and placed close to the chamber containing the float. The two faces of the vanes are differently coloured. As the magnet passes up and down behind the vanes it cause them to rotate, displaying one colour for the region containing the liquid and another for the region containing <b>gas.</b> Magnetic <b>gauges</b> are stated in various manufacturers' literature to be most suitable for very high pressure and / or temperature and for aggressive liquids.|$|R

These included a blow-by meter, which measured the gas which escaped to the auto's crankcase, having passed by thepistons and piston rings. Another instrument employed was an exhaust <b>gas</b> analyzer. This <b>gauge</b> measured the combustion efficiency of the engine. A viscometer {{was used to test}} the body thickness of crankcase oil.|$|R
5000|$|The A12 Marathon and A11 Taxicab {{design was}} based on the 1956 Checker Model A8. The A8 was Checker's {{response}} to new New York City taxi laws that mandated taxis could not run on a chassis wheelbase longer than 120 in. The main difference between the A8 and A11/Marathon was the use of quad headlights in the latter. Checker cars and taxicabs used the same basic body and chassis design from 1956 until production ceased, as Morris Markin declared {{that there would be no}} major changes as long as there was a demand for the car. However, numerous alterations in the appearance of the cars were made throughout production, especially in the late 1960s and 1970s. Starting in 1967 an energy-absorbing steering column was fitted to meet safety regulations, similar in appearance to AMC's column. Round side marker lights on each fender were added in 1968. Seat belts were fitted as mandated by the US government, including shoulder belts on Checkers built after December 1967. The 1969 cars got high-rise headrests and 1970 models adopted the government-required steering column and shift lever lock. The 1974 Checkers eschewed the attractive, chrome-plated bumpers for girder-like, aluminum-painted units. The '75s featured the catalytic converter emissions device, which came with an [...] "Unleaded Fuel Only" [...] label for both <b>gas</b> <b>gauge</b> and fuel filler. During the 1970s Checkers adopted a standard Chevrolet steering column assembly, including steering wheel (without the [...] "Chevrolet" [...] badges), shift lever and ignition switch. The 1978 and later models can be identified when Chevrolet switched to a [...] "Delta Spoke" [...] steering wheel design, duly used on Checkers. The rear fold-down jump seats were also removed, as they failed all safety tests. Parallel-action windshield wipers also appeared on the '78s. The car had very poor gas mileage, as the tall front end and engine compartment had been designed for a Continental 226-cubic-inch inline six, which required the large engine compartment. Overall, Checker sales began shrinking in the 1970s, causing the company to reduce its production capacity. Limousines were dropped after 1970 and wagons followed in 1974. The standard- and long-wheelbase sedans remained until the end. This decline was due to a number of factors. First, the oil embargo of 1973-1974 (and later the 1979-1982 recession) caused the Big Three to lose consumer sales, and they attempted to make up for this by targeting the fleet market more aggressively. Checker could not hope to compete on price, which due to inflation had risen to almost $5000 by the middle of the decade. This was Buick and Chrysler territory, and a large sum for a dated car with unimpressive build quality. Safety and emissions requirements added further costs. Meanwhile, the company refused several proposals for a replacement to its 20-year-old design. Automobile production ceased in 1982 after Checker's output dropped to less than 1,000 vehicles per year.|$|E
