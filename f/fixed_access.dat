40|$|Channel Capacity is {{of primary}} {{importance}} in broadband <b>fixed</b> wireless <b>access</b> (BFWA) networks {{due to the}} ever increasing demand for multimedia services {{and the possibility of}} providing wireless Internet. One of the major factors limiting capacity in such systems is interference originating from adjacent terrestrial applications belonging to the same BFWA network or to another. Moreover, the performance of broadband <b>fixed</b> wireless <b>access</b> links operating above 10 GHz is predominantly controlled by rain attenuation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} the presentation of a physical model for the evaluation of the fraction of the time where the capacity distribution of a broadband <b>fixed</b> wireless <b>access</b> channel under rain fade conditions suffering from co-channel interference, non-exceeds a specified level in (bps/Hz). The proposed analysis examines the capacity distribution properties focusing on the spatial inhomogeneity of rainfall medium.

Its immediate applications are numerous, such as virtualization of mobile base stations, {{platform as a service}} (PaaS), content delivery networks (CDN), <b>fixed</b> <b>access</b> and home environments. The potential benefits of NFV is anticipated to be significant. Virtualization of network functions deployed on general purpose standardized hardware is expected to reduce capital and operational expenditures, and service and product introduction times. Many major network equipment vendors have announced support for NFV. This has coincided with NFV announcements from major software suppliers who provide the NFV platforms used by equipment suppliers to build their NFV products.|$|E
