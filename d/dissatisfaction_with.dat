5|$|A {{group of}} {{volunteer}} citizens in London's East End called the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters, {{partly because of}} <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the police effort.

5|$|As <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the secession grew, Ngalula {{and other}} South Kasaian émigrés in Léopoldville plotted to {{overthrow}} the regime in Bakwanga. In September 1962, the Léopoldville government appointed Albert Kankolongo as Special Commissioner (commissaire extraordinaire), giving him full military and civil power, to dismantle the local state. Ngalula approached Kankolongo to lead a mutiny and coup d'état against Kalonji.|$|E

30|$|Figure 10 {{shows that}} the WFO brings the largest level of satisfaction. Indeed, for a tight PDOR target of 5 % (see Figure 10 (a)), the <b>dissatisfaction</b> ratio <b>with</b> a high traffic load of 1120 [*]Kbps is equal to 18 % with the WFO versus 29.7 % {{with the best of}} the other {{scheduling}} schemes. If we set the PDOR target to 10 %, the <b>dissatisfaction</b> ratio <b>with</b> a high traffic load of 1120 [*]Kbps is 0 % with the WFO versus 13.8 % with the best of the other scheduling schemes (PF).|$|R

5|$|Likewise, {{the generous}} donativum {{bestowed}} upon the soldiers following his accession {{was expected to}} swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change. The Praetorians considered these measures insufficient, however, and demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused.

40|$|The Perestroikan {{movement}} {{in political science}} has never sought to have a unified program or agenda or any formal organizational existence. It has instead provided venues—public letters, conference panels and receptions, and especially a listserve—through which political scientists could air and debate their <b>dissatisfactions</b> <b>with</b> and their aspirations for the profession. Many concerns have surfaced, but the three most persistent have been calls for broader recognition of the contributions of non-quantitative methods, exhortations to pursue more substantively significant research topics, and advocacy of competitive elections in the American Political Science Association...|$|R
50|$|A fatwa {{calling for}} her {{beheading}} was {{issued by the}} mullahs of northern Nigeria, but was declared null and void by the relevant religious authorities in Saudi Arabia, and the Obasanjo faced an international public relations smearing (especially within journalistic circles) in the aftermath, which was not helped by the Amina Lawal controversy which had occurred prior to the riots, which had seen over 200 dead).

5000|$|Wilson is a satirical graphic {{novel by}} American {{cartoonist}} Daniel Clowes, published in 2010 by Drawn and Quarterly. Starring the misanthropic Wilson, {{the book is}} structured as 70 one-page gag strips, with days or even years passing between the strips. Clowes says, [...] "The story is really what you interpret happens in between each strip." [...] Wilson is condescending and supercilious, and insists on communicating his alienating <b>dissatisfactions</b> <b>with</b> all those he meets, even with strangers, and most often unsolicited. The middle-aged, divorced Wilson, who lives in Oakland, California, finds himself lonely, smug, and obsessed with his past.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the current <b>dissatisfactions</b> <b>with</b> the paradigm that has recently guided experimental social psychology—testing of theory-derived hypotheses {{by means of}} laboratory manipulational experiments. The emerging variant of doing field experiments {{does not meet the}} criticisms. It is argued that an adequate new paradigm will be a more radical departure involving, on the creative side, deriving hypotheses from a systems theory of social and cogni-tive structures that takes into account multiple and bidirectional causality among social variables. On the critical side, its hypotheses testing will be done in multivariate correlational designs with naturally fluctuating variables. Some steps toward this new paradigm are described in the form of seven koan...|$|R

5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|Charles K.

The budget escalated as various directors and writers got involved in the production, and actors expressed <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the project.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the reform was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans.

5|$|Due to {{increasing}} <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> Everman {{over the course}} of the Bleach tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and drove back to Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later claimed that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller. However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{by what he}} {{felt was}} too much individualism in the game, Schriner {{contemplated}} retiring from professional hockey in favour of taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league.

40|$|Serious {{analyses}} of media, especially popular media, {{and how those}} media are being negotiated can provide insight into broader social and political change. Media provide us with an arena where global meta-forces - globalization, politics, economics, etc. - intersect with daily life.

In this paper the role of Malay language cinema as being both a catalyst for and receiver of Malay lower middle class <b>dissatisfactions</b> <b>with</b> authority, {{especially in terms of}} the Malaysian government’s attempts at religious authority, bring new insights into the intersection between media, politics, religion, and society in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Using {{qualitative}} research methods, this Cardiff-based project investigates the perspectives that young Shia Muslims in Britain have today, towards {{the concept of}} religious authority, and how these perspectives and attitudes affect their lives. The study reveals the perceptions of British Shia Muslims {{on the issues of}} religious authority and its relevance vis-à-vis their own lives in the UK. The project’s findings expose stark contradictions in the attitudes of some British Shia, <b>with</b> their <b>dissatisfactions</b> <b>with</b> clerical religious authority on one hand, and a sense of compulsion to abide by their rulings on the other. The research opens up this relatively uncultivated area for further social science research within UK’s Shia population, particularly with regards to attitudes towards religious authority and its impact...|$|R

5|$|The Governor had a 61percent job {{approval}} rating in public polls after his initial fiscal actions in 2003, although {{his approval rating}} subsequently declined, driven in part by his frequent out-of-state travel. Romney's approval rating stood at 34percent in November 2006, ranking 48th of the 50 U.S. governors. <b>Dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> Romney's administration and the weak condition of the Republican state party were among several factors contributing to Democrat Deval Patrick's 20-point win over Republican Kerry Healey, Romney's lieutenant governor, in the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{declined}} to seek renomination in late 1820, citing ill health.

Owing to {{the small number of}} subjects, statistical power was inadequate to test effects quantitatively; however, the responses of the family caregivers to structured follow-up questions indicated many gains from group attendance. Attendance and participation rates were high once subjects were engaged; positive outcomes were reported by the carers, and they actively sought feedback of their <b>dissatisfactions</b> <b>with</b> mental health services to the relevant decision-makers. The results are relevant both in the area of preventive mental health care for carers, and in promoting collaboration between carers and professionals...|$|R
