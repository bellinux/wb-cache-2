50|$|Typically used in {{theatrical}} dimming, {{the controller}} sends volts to the device. The controlled lighting should scale its output {{so that at}} 10 V, the controlled light should be at 100% of its potential output, and at 0 V it should at 0% output (i.e., off). <b>Dimming</b> <b>devices</b> may be designed to respond in various patterns to the intermediate voltages, giving output curves that are linear for: voltage output, actual light output, power output, or perceived light output.|$|R
50|$|A {{lighting}} dimmer {{existed at}} the time, but was expensive, complicated, and necessitated the use of large rheostats, about 10 in (25 cm) in size. Though there were <b>dimming</b> <b>devices</b> already in use for theater lighting, they were far too big and bulky for use in homes. Spira successfully manipulated a thyristor, a solid-state semiconductor {{small enough to fit}} into the wall box that housed a standard light switch. Unlike theatrical dimmers, Spira's standalone device was small enough for home application.|$|R

Against the protest of Kennicott and Vida she mortgaged the association by sending to Minneapolis for a baby spotlight, a strip light, a <b>dimming</b> <b>device,</b> and blue and amber bulbs; and with the gloating rapture of a born painter first turned loose among colors, she spent absorbed evenings in grouping, dimming-painting with lights.|$|R

50|$|The ART is {{equipped}} with various sensors to assist the driver in following the route on a virtual track, or to make detours {{in the case of}} traffic jams. A Lane Departure Warning System helps to keep the vehicle in its lane and automatically warns, if it drifts away from the lane. A Collision Warning System supports the driver on keeping a safe distance with other vehicles on the road and if the proximity reduces below a given level, it alerts the driver by a warning sign. The Route Change Authorization is navigation device, which analyzes the traffic conditions on the chosen route and can recommend a detour to avoid traffic congestion. The Electronic Rearview Mirrors work with remotely adjustable cameras and provide a clearer view than conventional mirrors including an auto <b>dimming</b> <b>device</b> to reduce the glare.|$|R
50|$|The X10 {{protocol}} is slow. It takes roughly {{three quarters}} of a second to transmit a device address and a command. While generally not noticeable when using a tabletop controller, it becomes a noticeable problem when using 2-way switches or when utilizing some sort of computerized controller. The apparent delay can be lessened somewhat by using slower <b>device</b> <b>dim</b> rates. With more advanced modules another option is to use group control (lighting scene) extended commands. These allow adjusting several modules at once by a single command.|$|R
25|$|A <b>dimmer</b> is a <b>device</b> used to {{vary the}} average voltage applied to an instrument's lamp. The {{brightness}} of a lamp {{is proportional to}} its electric current, {{which in turn is}} proportional to the applied lamp voltage. When the applied voltage is decreased, a lamp's electric current will also decrease, thus reducing the light output from the lamp (dimming it). Conversely, a higher voltage will cause higher lamp current and increased (brighter) light output. Dimmers are frequently found in large enclosures called racks or dimmer racks that draw significant three-phase power. They are often removable modules that range from 20-ampere, 2.4-kilowatt to 100-ampere units.|$|R
40|$|Interactive {{handheld}} electronic displays use hydrogenated {{amorphous silicon}} (a-Si:H) thin film transistor (TFT) as a backplane and a Touch Screen Panel (TSP) on top as an input device. The low mobility and instability of a-Si:H TFT threshold voltage are major two issues for driving constant current as required for Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Ddiode (AMOLED) displays. Low mobility is compensated by increasing transistor width or resorting to more expensive material TFTs. On the other hand, the ever increasing threshold voltage shift degrades the drain current under electrical operation causing OLED display to dim. Mutual capacitive TSP, the current cell phone standard, requires two layers of metals and a dielectric {{to be put in}} front of the display, further <b>dimming</b> the <b>device</b> and adding to visual noise due to sun reflection, not to mention increased integration cost and decreased yield. This thesis focuses on the aforementioned technological hurdles of a handheld electronic display by proposing a dual-gate TFT used as an OLED current driving TFT and a novel phase response readout scheme that can be applied to a one metal track TSP. Our dual-gate TFT has shown on average 20 % increase in drive current over a single gate TFT fabricated in the same batch, attributed to the aid of a top channel to the convention bottom channel TFT. Furthermore the dual gate TFT shows three times the Poole-Frenkel current than the single gate TFT attributed to the increase in gate to drain overlap. The dual-gate TFT shows a 50 % improvement in threshold voltage shift over a single gate TFT at room temperature, but only ~ 8 % improvement under 75 ºC. This is an important observation as it shows an accelerated threshold voltage shift in the dual-gate. This difference in the rate of threshold voltage change under varying temperature is attributed to the difference in interface states, supporting Libsch and Kanicki’s multi-level temperature dependant dielectric trapping model. The phase response TSP readout scheme requires IC only {{on one side of the}} display. Cadence Spectre simulation results showed that both touch occurrence and touch position can be obtained using only one metal layer...|$|R
40|$|Ubiquitous systems {{imagined}} by Mark Weiser {{are emerging}} {{thanks to the}} development of embedded systems and plug-n-play protocols like the Universal Plug aNd Play (UPnP), the Intelligent Grouping and Resource Sharing (IGRS), the Device Pro le for Web Services (DPWS) and Apple Bonjour. Such protocols follow the service oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm and allow an automatic device and service discovery in a home network. Once devices are connected to the local network, applications deployed for example on a smart phone, a PC or a home gateway, discover the plug-n-play devices and act as control points. The aim of such applications is to orchestrate the interactions between the devices such as lights, TVs and printers, and their corresponding hosted services to accomplish a specific human daily task like printing a document or <b>dimming</b> a light. <b>Devices</b> supporting a plug-n-play protocol announce their hosted services each in its own description format and data content. Even similar devices supporting the same services represent their capabilities in a different representation format and content. Such heterogeneity along with the protocols layers diversity, prevent applications to use any available equivalent device on the network to accomplish a specific task. For instance, a UPnP printing application cannot interacts with an available DPWS printer on the network to print a document. Designing applications to support multiple protocols is time consuming since developers must implement the interaction with each device pro le and its own data description. Additionally, the deployed application must use multiple protocols stacks to interact with the device. More over, application vendors and telecoms operators need to orchestrate devices through a common application layer, independently from the protocol layers and the device description. To accomplish interoperability between plug-n-play devices and applications, we propose a generic approach which consists in automatically generating proxies based on an ontology alignment. The alignment contains the correspondences between two equivalent devices descriptions. Such correspondences actually represent the proxy behaviour which is used to provide interoperability between an application and a plug and play device. For instance, the generated proxy will announce itself on the network as a UPnP standard printer and will control the DPWS printer. Consequently, the UPnP printing application will interact transparently with the generated proxy which adapts and transfers the invocations to the real DPWS printer. We implemented a prototype as a proof of concept that we evaluated on several real UPnP and DPWS equivalent devices. Les protocoles plug-and-play couplés avec les architectures logicielles rendent nos maisons ubiquitaires. Les équipements domestiques qui supportent ces protocoles peuvent être détectés automatiquement, configurés et invoqués pour une tâche donnée. Actuellement, plusieurs protocoles coexistent dans la maison, mais les interactions entre les dispositifs ne peuvent pas être mises en action à moins que les appareils supportent le même protocole. En plus, les applications qui orchestrent ces dispositifs doivent connaître à l'avance les noms des services et dispositifs. Or, chaque protocole définit un profil standard par type d'appareil. Par conséquent, deux appareils ayant le même type et les mêmes fonctions mais qui supportent un protocole différent publient des interfaces qui sont souvent sémantiquement équivalentes mais syntaxiquement différentes. Ceci limite alors les applications à interagir avec un service similaire. Dans ce travail, nous présentons une méthode qui se base sur l'alignement d'ontologie et la génération automatique de mandataire pour parvenir à une adaptation dynamique de services...|$|R
