We {{have focused on the}} automated annotation of video recordings of university lectures. Most times these lectures are supported by a <b>desktop</b> <b>presentation</b> provided by the lecturer. This presentation in general contains an outline of the given lecture and thus, enables automated annotation of the corresponding video recording. We have implemented a tool for automated MPEG- 7 annotation of video recorded lectures, which enables efficient content based search within a video database. Given a particular search term our search engine prototype is able to deliver only the relevant sequences of the matching video recordings. ...|$|E

To realize those features in our automated video capturing system, we classify {{the purpose of}} a camerawork from two points of view: target and aspect-of-target. Then, we consider the correspondence between the classification and typical shots and cameraworks. We propose the virtual-frame control algorithm based on this idea, and the implementation in our video production system. We then show experimental results that verified our method through two kinds of experiments: virtual video capturing using CG animations and real video capturing of real presentations. 1...|$|R

This study used experimental methodology to test the possibility of positively influencing the dispositions of occupational educators toward desktop VR through application of prime theory in a context of supplantation and technology self-efficacy theory. Supraliminal bipolar primes were used to test whether a positive disposition more conducive to VR adoption could be created in a sample of 30 occupational educators prior to introduction of a <b>desktop</b> VR <b>presentation,</b> with “disposition ” defined as a pair of specific performance measures.

40|$|Abstract. In this contribution, we {{describe}} {{a system for}} Location-Aware Cross-Device Integration (LADI). LADI enhances interoperability between mobile and stationary computers by enabling the user to control the playback of multi-media objects on a <b>desktop</b> or <b>presentation</b> computer through an Android phone. The multimedia objects themselves {{can be stored in}} the Network Envi-ronment for Multimedia Objects (NEMO), on other cloud-based content deliv-ery systems, or locally on a PC. In contrast to most existing network-centric so-lutions for playback control, LADI takes a location-centric view. It is possible to access presentation computers independent of whether they are available on the same IP-subnet. The different devices communicate via XMPP. Access to a presentation system can be gained through scanning attached QR-codes or through automatic localization based on WLAN fingerprints. In addition, the system facilitates the integration of additional context aware services in general and location aware services in particular. This paper describes the concept be-hind LADI and provides some details on its prototypical implementation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{suggests}} that new tools and {{technology can be}} used for production of relevant data and insights from the study of human performance in simulator and field experiments. It examines some of the theoretical perspectives behind data collection and human performance assessment, and argues for a high resemblance of the real world and use of subject matter expertise in simulator studies. A model is proposed, suggesting that human performance measurement should be tightly coupled to the topic of study and have a close connection to the time line. This coupling requires new techniques for continuous data collection, and eye movement tracking has been identified as a promising basis for this type of measures. One way of improving realism is to create virtual environments allowing for controlling more of the environment surrounding the test subjects. New application areas for virtual environments are discussed for use in control room and field studies. The combination of wearable computing, virtual and augmented (the use of computers to overlay virtual information onto the real world) reality provides many new possibilities to present information to operators. In two experiments, virtual and augmented reality techniques were used to visualise radiation fields for operators in a contaminated nuclear environment. This way the operators could train for and execute their tasks in a way that minimised radiation exposure to the individual operator. Both experiments were successful in proving the concept of radiation visualisation. Virtual environments allow for early end-user feedback in the design and refurbishment of control room man-machine interfaces. The practical usability of VR in the control room setting was tested in two control room design experiments. The results show that with the right tools for solving the tasks under test, even <b>desktop</b> <b>presentations</b> of the virtual environment can provide sufficient resemblance of the real world. Computerised data collection was identified as a key factor for efficient data handling in simulator and field experiments. An Internet based questionnaire system was specified and implemented in parallel with the experimental work, and functionality was developed to fulfil the special needs of each new experimental setting. The result is a computer platform independent system capable of handling most types of data and test situations for data collection by Internet or local computer networks. dr. polit. dr. polit...|$|R

In 2003 / 2004 a survey was undertaken of institutions offering the courses and students enrolled in them. The focus for the survey of students was the extent to which their needs were met by the range of courses offered, the access arrangements and the availability and adequacy of support for their learning. The focus for the survey of institutions was on the range of courses offered and their outcomes, the curriculum design and course development process used, any collaborative arrangements, and the current academic and technical standards applied, including online delivery. The range and structure of courses offered at 17 institutions that completed the survey was similar, with the majority leading to one or more qualifications. The courses were mostly based on existing models and most material was developed inhouse. Two institutions offered online courses. All institutions reported that their free computing courses were approved at Academic Board level and that normal quality management systems applied. Free computing courses were offered in partnership or as part of an alliance with a number of other organisations. Several institutions were involved in some form of collaborative development as a result. The courses most offered free are keyboarding, word processing, spreadsheets, database, <b>desktop</b> publishing, <b>presentation</b> software, email and Internet.

40|$|The way we use {{computers}} has been heavily {{shaped by the}} dominant input methods of keyboard and mouse. Controlling a computer using speech has, not surprisingly, closely mimicked keyboard and mouse input. While {{it is good to}} tap existing knowledge, {{it is important not to}} let experience confine new methods of communication. The potential differences between speech input and keyboard and mouse input are akin to the differences between road and air travel. Following a road via airplane is faster than driving, but the real power of air travel is the ability to travel any route, including areas inaccessible by car, like large bodies of water, mountain ranges and polar regions. The real power of speech is the ability to command the computer in ways not possible using the keyboard and mouse alone. The keys to unleashing this potential are minimizing steps, making commands easy to remember, and enabling combinations. This paper includes speech command sequence demonstrations that show these principles in action. Demonstrations include word processing, tables and graphs, windows handling, cutting and pasting among documents, Internet navigation, email, speech links, a list utility and a virtual calculator.

Experiment involved 68 subjects, Serbian students that have used the interface for remote collaborative control to control CNC machine located in Portugal. Usability evaluation measures of the distributed remote user controlled manufacturing system, such as percentage of task completed, its accuracy and time to complete task, are measured on two types of “client” user interface (“Wall” and “Window”), in two modes of <b>presentation</b> (<b>desktop</b> and video beam), working individually or in small collaborative group consisted of two persons, results were statistically tested. Percentage of task completed is equal for both types of interfaces, while accuracy of task is significantly better for “Wall” interface. Time of task execution is longer for individuals when desktop is used comparing to video beam. There exist significant differences when work is conducted in groups via video beam and time is longer when desktop is used. Also, work time is longer with “Wall” interface. When working in group, work time is shorter than the time when working individually, whereby the working time on desktop is longer than on the video beam. Also, the time is longer when working individually using video beam, using “Wall” interface on desktop, and “Window” interface on video beam. These results show that group work consumes less time in most working options, giving the best results when working in collaborative small group on “Wall” interface via video beam...|$|R
