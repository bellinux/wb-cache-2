40|$|This PhD {{examines}} <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> in Wales, {{a marginal}} area for farming which is, {{at the same}} time, popular for tourism due to its high quality natural environment. This is a timely study {{as it is now}} over two decades since <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> was promoted through rural development policies as a way to support the farm household and revitalise rural economies. In the intervening years <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> has evolved and become a professional sector. It is therefore important to understand how the <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> sector has developed, and the impact that <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> has had on the farm household and wider rural economy. To date, there has been limited research in these areas. This PhD addresses these gaps. The study contributes to theory by examining <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> from Ploeg?s (2008) new peasantry perspective. It examines how peasant farming principles apply in the context of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> development and operation in the early twenty-first century. The premise of the study is that the new peasantry?s struggle for increased autonomy is achieved through the development of their resource base. The literature review compares Ploeg?s (2008) new peasantry theory to other approaches examining farm development, most notably entrepreneurship. It outlines why the new peasantry is the most suitable theoretical approach to examining <b>farm</b> <b>tourism.</b> Ploeg?s (2008) theoretical framework is then adapted in order to specifically examine <b>farm</b> <b>tourism.</b> The research profiles the new peasantry in the context of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> and finds that there are three significantly different groups operating <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> which benefit from it in different ways. These groups include diversifying farmers on larger and smaller farms, and lifestyle movers. The research identifies the resources that <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> operators have drawn upon in creating their <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> products. This provides an understanding of what the modern, multifunctional <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> product is, and in doing so broadens the definition of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism.</b> The research identifies four broad approaches taken to develop the <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> business facilities. These were based on whether the development approach followed, characterised peasant or capitalist behaviour, and whether or not growth was pursued. The research briefly examines market relationships, and finds that following a collaborative approach improves levels of trade. Finally, the research finds that, for the majority of operators, <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> has benefitted the farm household. The vast majority of operators report that <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> has been successful in achieving their overall goals, and that they plan to continue with <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> in the future. This suggests that <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> in Wales is a viable long term strategy. The research also finds that those taking advantage of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> opportunities in the twenty-first century are those in a more favourable financial position. From a policy perspective, findings show that rural development support has {{played a key role in}} assisting <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> business start-up and growth. However, grants are only available to those who already have access to financial resources and do little to support the struggling farmer. At the same time policy challenges hinder the <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> sector in Wales, preventing it from achieving its full potential. Recommendations have been made to address these issues. The adapted new peasantry framework has proved suitable and has provided new insights into <b>farm</b> <b>tourism.</b> The framework examines <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> development as a process, and provides an understanding of how operators? contexts will affect their progression through the framework and the degrees of peasant or capitalist behaviour that they exhibit. When applying the model, it is also important to recognise how policy influences the development of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism.</b> Therefore, the application of the model would need to factor in the specific policy environment of the study location.

40|$|Polish {{legislation}} lacks one {{broad and}} comprehensive definition of agricultural activity. Legal regulations concerning <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> in Poland are dispersed in different legislation acts. Therefore {{it is worthwhile}} taking a closer view {{on the notion of}} <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> as an agricultural activity, or activity related to agriculture as defined in Italian law. The main deliberations are focused on the analysis of the criteria that connect <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> with agricultural activity as set out in Act 96 / 2006 on <b>farm</b> <b>tourism.</b> Those criteria are variable, detailed and they precisely determine the boundaries within which <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> may be conducted. In the concluding remarks, de lege ferenda on the notion of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> in Polish law have been presented. The author points to the necessity (formulated already in the literature) of inserting into Polish legislation of the notion of agricultural activity. This should be performed in a systematic and coherent way, and the notion should include non only the traditional production activities but various related activities, such as <b>farm</b> <b>tourism,</b> as well.

It is now over two decades since <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> was promoted through rural development policies {{as a way to}} support the farm household and revitalise rural economies.

The premise of this theory is that the new peasantry?s struggle for autonomy and survival is achieved through the development of a self-controlled resource base and an avoidance of dependency relationships.

40|$|The {{marketing}} of farms for tourism and recreation purposes {{has been taking}} place for many years. Farmers have frequently sought to supplement their farm income through providing accommodation and recreation facilities to paying guests. This study concentrates on one state of Australia, Victoria, and has two main aims. The first aim {{is to develop a}} systems model of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> that reveals the roles played by various stakeholders. The second aim is to examine <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> from a systems perspective, and to explore the attitudes of both farmers and guests to their experiences. In addition, the comments of local government authorities are also investigated. The purpose of the study, in broad terms, is to develop a systems model of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> in Victoria, Australia. In order to do this, the study reviews the literature and then examines the evolution and development of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> in general, through a detailed analysis of the relationships between host farm operators and their visitors. is hoped that the present study will shed some light on an industry which has been largely ignored by most writers and researchers in the different disciplines represented in this topic. The research objectives are, firstly, to develop a systems model of farm tourism; secondly, to examine and describe the scope of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> in Victoria, {{from the point of view}} of the farmer; thirdly, to describe the evaluation of the <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> experience by the guests who have visited farms in Victoria; and, finally, to investigate the attitudes and involvement of local government bodies in Victoria to <b>farm</b> <b>tourism.</b> Tourism in general is examined, as well as the relationship between agriculture and tourism, leading to a discussion of the definition of rural tourism. General trends in rural tourism are identified, and their relevance to <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> is explained. The definition of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> is then covered, with commentary on the application of the characteristics of tourism to the <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> industry. Trends in farming are mentioned, which point to the importance of <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> as an alternative source of income for the farmer, and a useful form of diversification from farm operations, reducing dependence on one source of income.

40|$|Diversification to <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> is {{increasingly}} {{seen as a}} viable development strategy to promote a more diverse and sustainable rural economy and to counter declining farm incomes. However, {{our understanding of the}} dynamics of the modern <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> business and the entrepreneurial and competitive skills farmers require in making the transition from agriculture to a diversified - and service based - enterprise remains limited. Hence, the aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the range of skills and competencies that farmers in the North West of England identify as important when adopting a diversification strategy to <b>farm</b> <b>tourism.</b> The findings indicate that, whilst a range of managerial skills are valued by farmers, they lack many of the additional business and entrepreneurial competencies required for success. At the same time, however, this paper acknowledges the need to generate consensus on the requisite skill-set that <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> operators require, along with a need for a currently fragmented rural tourism literature to acknowledge the significance of rural entrepreneurship and the characteristics of successful farmers and <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> ventures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper explores {{how women}} use <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> {{as a vehicle}} for {{empowerment}} within the context of family farm agriculture. Drawing upon qualitative data of a farm women's agritourism network in southern France, we show that <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> enables women to cultivate personal empowerment strategies. <b>Farm</b> <b>tourism</b> allows women the opportunity to create a physical space for autonomy and individual creativity where they can pursue personal goals and overcome social isolation; in this way, it advances the process of empowerment. However, the process of empowerment is not without challenge. We demonstrate how the persistence of a patriarchal culture informed by an agrarian ideology can complicate this process. This study suggests that <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> permits women the possibility for constructing autonomous objectives which can lead to empowerment {{to the extent that they}} are acceptable to males and refrain from impeding male-led farming activity...|$|E

40|$|In {{many rural}} regions, tourism is {{accepted}} as {{a natural part of}} the socio-economic fabric juxtaposed with agriculture. It is clear that rural tourism is based on rural amenities; however, {{it is not clear how}} this relates to agriculture. Are these inter-relationships of mutual benefit, in the sense that while rural tourism provides the farmer with auxiliary funding to continue his/her agricultural activity, the latter is an important or even necessary component of rural tourism? Do active farms with rural tourism enjoy economies to scope and run their businesses more efficiently than firms with only a single activity? The focus of this paper is on these inter-relationships and their impact on the supply and demand for rural tourism accommodations. The demarcation between <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> and rural tourism is somewhat hazy. Nilsson (2002), in his work on <b>farm</b> <b>tourism,</b> defines <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> as a subset of rural tourism. According to him, rural tourism is based on the rural environment in general whereas <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> is based on the farm and the farmer. This means that within the framework of rural tourism, <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> enterprises are more closely related to agriculture than other rural tourism operations.

This study provides a qualitative examination {{of the experience of}} six <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> operators, whose businesses are performing well. The study examines the <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> operators? resources and capabilities and how these have contributed towards the performance of their businesses in order to provide examples to other farmers. The study identifies the key resources that farmers have drawn on in creating their tourism products and found these to be: a favourable location, the working farm, farm land and buildings, farm produce, the farm family, the farmer?s business ethos and the business?s reputation. It also highlights the market appeal of these resources to different tourist markets. The research also finds that this group of farmers has demonstrated the necessary capabilities to transform their resources into tourism products that meet evolving market needs. The study highlights that farmers have identified market gaps, niches and trends to cater for in developing their businesses and that they have focused on maintaining the quality and utility of their tourism product. It found that these factors have influenced their business performance. The study also examines the extent to which agriculture (in this case the working farm and farm produce) features as part of the <b>farm</b> <b>tourism</b> product.
