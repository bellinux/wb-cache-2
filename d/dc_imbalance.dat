40|$|A {{dendritic}} cell (<b>DC)</b> <b>imbalance</b> with a marked deficiency in CD 4 (-) 8 (+) DC occurs in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, {{a model of}} human autoimmune diabetes mellitus. Using a NOD congenic mouse strain, we find that this CD 4 (-) 8 (+) DC deficiency {{is associated with a}} gene segment on chromosome 4, which also encompasses non-MHC diabetes susceptibility loci. Treatment of NOD mice with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FL) enhances the level of CD 4 (-) 8 (+) DC, temporarily reversing the DC subtype imbalance. At the same time, fms-like tryosine kinase 3 ligand treatment blocks early stages of the diabetogenic process and with appropriately timed administration can completely prevent diabetes development. This points to a possible clinical use of FL to prevent autoimmune disease...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} explores {{methods of}} accurately measuring DC current flowing in a circuit sub-block or an entire chip. The major application demonstrated {{is a novel}} mixed-signal system to monitor <b>DC</b> current <b>imbalance</b> on the supply/ground lines of the stimulation circuitry in a neurostimulator implant chip, which indicates a fault {{that may lead to}} dangerous levels of DC current leaking into tissue. The system can detect all known failure modes that cause leakage current including ESD damage, fluid leaks and electrode/PCB/component shorts. Furthermore, the system is agnostic of {{the inner workings of the}} stimulation circuitry it monitors, and can be applied to highly complex implants containing any number of electrodes, without having to scale circuit area and power. The system is sensitive to <b>DC</b> current <b>imbalances</b> 50 - 56 dB smaller than the full-scale current, programmable in the range 0. 25 - 8 mA, yielding an absolute detection sensitivity of 0. 75 - 12 uA; sufficient to make it useful in current and future implants. Static and dynamic power consumption of the system in a typical implant scenario with 10 V stimulation supply are 0. 22 - 0. 49 mW and 0. 64 - 1. 17 mW respectively, while the supply/ground current sensors consume a total of up to 1 V of stimulation voltage headroom. The trade-off between sensitivity and headroom loss can be programmed digitally, as can all other aspects of the system. Practical guidelines on integrating the system into real implant systems are given. The system was developed and tested on a mainstream 0. 35 um CMOS process, with care taken to ensure mass-producibility. An essential part of this was the development of 2 - 3 ns latency HV digital level-shifters that outperform all prior designs. The supply/ground current sensor itself performed up to 22 dB better than comparable prior art. The level-shifter and the sensor have general applicability to many systems beyond neurostimulator implants...|$|R

The expressions combine IQ amplitude and phase <b>imbalances,</b> <b>DC</b> offsets along with phase noise. Both the Gaussian and the Tikhonov probability density function are utilized for the oscillator phase noise distribution. The explicit conditions when EVM computations based on Tikhonov distribution converge to a Gaussian based are investigated. Furthermore, {{the application of}} the proposed EVM expressions is demonstrated by including phase noise masks, providing a direct means to Phase Locked Loop/Voltage Controlled Oscillator design parameters.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the mobile}} {{communication}} standard GSM/EDGE, {{the base station}} can select one of eight training sequence codes as the midamble of the downlink transmitted bursts. If the receiving mobile station uses zero intermediate frequency sampling, the channel estimation is sensitive to the DC offset and IQ gain/phase imbalance of the RF transceiver. This letter shows for a common class of channel estimators that the sensitivity depends on the selected training sequence code. This sensitivity can become significant for 8 PSK modulation. Index Terms — GSM/EDGE receiver, channel estimation, IQ gain/phase <b>imbalance,</b> <b>DC</b> offset, 8 PSK modulation. I...|$|R
40|$|Direct-conversion {{receivers}} {{have attracted}} increased attention recently as they represent an interesting receiver topology in portable wireless environments, where power, cost, and size are critical design constraints. They suffer, however, from various front-end impairments, with I/Q <b>imbalance,</b> <b>DC</b> offset, and flicker noise {{being among the}} most serious ones. Various digital compensation algorithms have been proposed in the literature {{to cope with the}} adverse effects. Usually, these algorithms are analyzed by computer simulations in nearly infinitely precise arithmetic. A fixed-point finite wordlength implementation on DSPs, FPGAs, and ASICs typically results in a reduced performance. This paper investigates the performance degradation due to a finite wordlength of various compensation algorithms. The results obtained by bit-true simulations demonstrate that a moderate wordlength is sufficient to achieve results similar to infinite precision...|$|R
40|$|The {{scatterometer}} on-board ERS- 2, earth-observation satellite {{developed by}} the European Space Agency, is an active real aperture radar instrument designed to measure the backscatter coefficient 0 from the earth. Its main utility is to measure physical parameters such as wind speeds and directions over the sea surface. Due to malfunctions of the on-board gyroscopes and even though a new attitude and orbit control system is used, the yaw-orientation of the spacecraft still exhibits random variations from the nominal attitude. This unpredictable attitude requires re-developing the calibration chain of the scatterometer instrument. Distributed targets, such as the rain forest, are used to perform a relative calibration while transponders situated at known locations in Spain permit an absolute calibration of the instrument. The scope is to expose the obtained results and the improvements brought by the new chain regarding the absolute calibration. An analysis of the received echo with a sub-pixel resolution (better than the nominal resolution) allows getting accurate transponder localization. The localization error is used to determine, among other quantities, the antenna mounting angles errors. Since the signal emitted by the transponders is calibrated, radiometric calibration is also possible, including determination of a large set of parameters such as the absolute gain of each antenna. The raw data quality (such as <b>DC</b> offsets, gain <b>imbalance,</b> phase imbalance) and the spatial resolution are also compute...|$|R
40|$|The {{total loss}} of an {{inverter}} {{can be reduced}} by reducing switching losses and harmonics losses. However, the harmonics increases with the reduction of switching frequency and special technique is required to get the overall losses at minimum value. The minimum loss synchronous pulse width modulation described here uses a minimization criterion function {{to be used with}} low switching frequency while getting the acceptable harmonics for the medium voltage multiphase drives. The approach uses the fixed set of optimized switching patterns generated by the programmed technique by minimizing the criterion function. Weighed Total Harmonic Distortion normalized to DC link voltage is used as the minimization parameter as it {{is directly related to the}} harmonics in the system. In order to get the optimization angels fast for any value of modulation index, the real time pattern generation method is used instead of storing the values into the memory. This approach has the possibility of adding offsets to overcome the effects such as DC link balancing and transient normalization. The number of pulses required at low amplitude modulation becomes very high while keeping switching frequency at acceptable range. This makes the complication for the calculation as well as implementation of Synchronous Optimal PWM at low amplitude modulation. It is therefore, asynchronous space vector modulation is prioritized for the low amplitude modulation. The technique of interrupt signal is used to effectively switch from one method of modulation to the other whenever required. Multilevel inverter has inherent problem of <b>DC</b> link <b>imbalance,</b> which must be addressed in order to get smooth operation. Many alternatives are purposed for the balancing and choice has to be made to get it work for both asynchronous and synchronous modulation. Further, the transient stability needs to be addressed for the system as it might force the system out of the stability and leading to many technical flaws. The real time operation of the synchronous optimal modulation requires, fast processing and executing processor. As such, Virtex- 5 ppc 440 FX 30 T is used which can operate at very high frequency. During this thesis, such an advanced system is simulated using the advanced computing software s and is implemented in the lab. A six-phase induction machine with the rating of 11. 7 kW is used in the lab with the help of three-phase three-level inverter. Xilinx ISE suite is used as the medium to communicate between the hardware and software as well as to build the overall embedded system design...|$|R
40|$|Electric Avenue, {{located on}} the PSU campus along SW Montgomery Street, is a joint project between Portland General Electric, Portland State University (PSU) and the City of Portland. Launched in August 2011, Electric Avenue is {{intended}} as a research platform for understanding the impact electric vehicles have within {{the larger context of}} the city. For this research, we used Electric Avenue to investigate the impacts electric vehicles (EVs) may have on electric power distribution systems. Nonlinear loads, such as EV chargers, will often introduce power quality (PQ) issues within distribution circuits, which can have detrimental effects on system components. PQ encompasses several specific concepts such as harmonic distortion, <b>DC</b> offset, phase <b>imbalance,</b> and voltage deviations, among others, and these are quantified in myriad ways. For this study, we focus on harmonic currents since these have the potential to affect the lifetime of magnetic assets such as distribution transformers and instrument transformers. Utilities plan asset management by anticipating the nature of loads and selecting assets designed to handle those loads. A deeper understanding of these matters specific to EVs will aid utilities in the design of distribution systems and provide guidance for asset planning. A load 2 ̆ 7 s PQ affects magnetic assets because of the potential for insulation failure and core saturation. Understanding the PQ of nonlinear loads assists distribution engineers with the selection of k-factor ratings for distribution transformers, selection of CTs and VTs, protection settings and decisions regarding conductor ampacity. For this study, we measured the PQ of EV chargers, paying specific attention to total harmonic distortion (THD) of individual EV chargers and total demand distortion (TDD) of the Electric Avenue service. We also noted phase imbalance, phantom loading and other PQ issues observed during the course of our study. Our objective is to expand the electric utility industry’s understanding that EVs have on these issues...|$|R
