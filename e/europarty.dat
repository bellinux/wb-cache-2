40|$|Presented {{thesis is}} {{focusing}} on the dependence and relationship between <b>Europarties</b> and groups of the European Parliament and <b>Europarties</b> and national parties. The research is carried out on five Europarties: European People's Party (EPP), the Social Democratic Party (PES), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), the European Green Party (EGP) and the Party of the European Left (PEL) in the period 2004 - 2013 and it focuses on three areas: Europarties' financing, its leadership and autonomy in decision making. It presents several conclusions. Since 2004 <b>Europarties</b> became independent on the EP groups and more independent on the national parties {{in the area of}} financing in connection with the Regulation No. 2004 / 2003 regulating financing while their resources have been growing. On the other hand, all three organizational structures are still involved in the decision making as is shown on the example of nominations and subsequent elections of the so-called Spitzenkandidaten (candidates for the President of the European Commission) and the hierarchy within the European party families is similar to the hierarchy of its member parties.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the growing concern surrounding the EU's «democratic deficit» resulting from the expansion of the EU's competences. In particular it {{raises the question of whether}} the development of genuine <b>Europarties</b> competing in a European party system could be sufficient to promote and assure democratic government at EU level. The article discusses the ways in which integrated parties and party systems operate in «normal» democracies and perform functions that are conducive to a correct functioning of the political system. It then examines the current state of affairs at EU level, by assessing the nature and character of <b>Europarties</b> as well as whether a genuine European Party system exits in the Euro-arenas in which parties are expected to compete. Finally the paper analyses the potential impact of the political and institutional changes induced by and surrounding the Lisbon Treaty on <b>Europarties</b> and their system. The conclusions of such analysis are somewhat contradictory : while the development of a real European party system within might enhance accountability and responsiveness, it might come at the cost of the developing capacity of the parties to represent and articulate the diversity of voices that are found in the EU...|$|R
40|$|Published online before print October 2, 2013. Congruence in the European Parliament {{has been}} {{analyzed}} {{in terms of}} agreement between voters and national candidates/parties. The question whether voters and <b>Europarties</b> are congruent on major dimensions of contestation (left-right and European Union) remains unanswered. Acknowledging the ‘split-level’ structure of preference aggregation in the European Parliament, we theorize the interrelationships between these levels. Our model incorporates a typically neglected factor: the interplay between national parties and <b>Europarties.</b> We establish that voter–Europarty congruence is different from, and determined by, voter–national party congruence; moreover, national party–Europarty congruence moderates this relationship. Our findings shed {{new light on the}} quality of representation in the European Parliament and have key implications for understanding transnational democracy in the European Union...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{has several}} objetcs. The main {{objective}} is to answer the research question and seven hypotheses including elections to the European Parliament and MEPs behaviour from individual <b>europarties.</b> Some hypotheses include {{the participation of the}} electorate of the member states in elections to the EP, while others relate to participation of MEPs in voting, cohesion and coalitions that are formed in the parliament. Data on voting are obtained thanks to a project created by the London School of Economics. These data are already clearly adjusted, because official data on voting the European Parliament show in a form that could not be analyzed without software support. After the introduction follow two chapters, in which there is described theoretical framework involving the search of relevant sources on the European Parliament, describing his position within key institutions of the EU, its function, history, and empowerment to the election of MEPs to the <b>europarties.</b> The results show some charasteristic patterns in the European Parliament. MEPs in most cases hold the party line rather than national. However, there are some cases, where individual nations across <b>europarties</b> vote uniformly, even though this behavior in some of them oppose to the attitude of a majority of the party.

This meant that the <b>Europarties</b> can set up and fund legally separate affiliated think-tanks (the Eurofoundations) to aid them, although funding national parties remains forbidden. The revised regulation also gives <b>Europarties</b> the exclusive responsibility to campaign for the European elections and can use their funds for this purpose (their corresponding political groups of the European Parliament are strictly forbidden to campaign).|$|R

50|$|A European {{political}} party (formally, a {{political party}} at European level; informally a <b>Europarty)</b> {{is a type of}} political party organisation operating transnationally in Europe and in the institutions of the European Union. They are regulated and funded by the European Union and are usually made up of national parties, not individuals. Europarties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections and express themselves within the European Parliament by their affiliated political groups and their MEPs. Europarties, through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government, influence the decision-making process of the European Council. Europarties also work closely and co-ordinate with their affiliated members of the European Commission and, according to the Lisbon Treaty the <b>Europarty</b> that wins the European elections has the right to nominate to the European Council its candidate for President of the European Commission.|$|E

40|$|In {{classical}} party democracy, elections {{serve as}} an “instrument of democracy” (Powell 2000) : they are the mechanism to connect policy preferences of the electors (within the electoral arena) to the political production (within the legislative arena). At the European level the linkage seems to be lost because the political actors performing in the two arena {{are not the same}} and the logics of behaviour are quite different. The EU calls for truly “Europarties” to become more democratic in its procedural and substantive prerequisites and this entails not only a progressive emancipation of party structures at European level but also an integration between them. In fact, we will have full <b>Europarties</b> only when the two party structures at EU level are either independent from national parties and linked to each other: if intra- and extra- parliamentary faces become really European and connected entities, legislators will be accountable to voters and, consequently, democratic deficit will decline. The main aims of this paper are, firstly, to investigate if and to what extent political parties at European level are able to perform the electoral and legislative functions in the two separated arena and, secondly, if intra- and extra- parliamentary faces of the <b>Europarties</b> are still separated or, rather, have become integrated. In other words, I will delineate the process of institutionalization of the <b>Europarties</b> looking at their progressive autonomy from national parties and systemness/integration at European level (Panebianco 1988) ...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{transnational}} organisations {{also have}} a party-political dimension.

It is here argued that, if the national parties are successfully able to aggregate their programmes and agendas at the EU level, proposing different options to the European voters, the EU ‘democratic deficit’ {{might not be as}} severe as it is often lamented. It is found that the <b>Europarties,</b> despite the enlargements towards Central and Eastern Europe, are sufficiently coherent and different to seek to fulfil an expressive, or representative, function.
