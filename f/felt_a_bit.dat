5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
500|$|Concurring {{with this}} sentiment, GameSpy noted that using the stylus {{to play the}} game <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> strange. Eurogamer also {{expressed}} their disapproval of the control scheme, predicting it would lead to [...] "the coming years of physiotherapy on [...] arms". They were also unhappy with the game's [...] "flimsy" [...] multiplayer experience, noting that it is best used when played locally with friends who also have the game. X-Play had particularly negative sentiments about the game, stating, [...] "This feels like yet another genre shoehorned poorly onto hardware that just isn’t equipped to handle it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Beckinsale {{appeared}} in Winged Creatures, {{a film about}} how six different witnesses cope with {{the aftermath of a}} shooting. Beckinsale played a waitressing single mother in an ensemble cast which included Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, and Forest Whitaker. [...] "It was a really, really nice experience but it was quick," [...] said Beckinsale of the filming process. [...] "I just <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like I was shot through a cannon." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she played the role [...] "with a white trash verve" [...] and found her character's [...] "raw ache for that someone with money and respectability is palpable." [...] However, Dargis felt that Beckinsale and her cast mates have a [...] "tough time filling out characters that are at best abstractions of grief and often just clichés." [...] The film received a very limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles; it was released simultaneously on DVD.|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} season a 7.9 out of 10, feeling it [...] "had its up and downs, mixing in {{elements}} that worked (Daisy getting her Quake on, the Fitz and Simmons drama), elements {{we could have}} used more of (Secret Warriors!) and elements that just never felt right (Lincoln and his relationship with Daisy)." [...] Goldman also felt that {{the first half of}} the season was [...] "the stronger, more cohesive of the two halves" [...] as it aired the episode [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] which Goldman called [...] "the best hour of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date." [...] He criticized the pacing of the season, saying [...] "some episodes <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> jumbled and could have benefited from slowing down a bit—or simply not trying to do so much at once. Sometimes it was just a question of including too many characters or storylines in single episodes, causing some scenarios to not have time to breathe or get the proper build up they might have with more character-focused episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{joining the}} cast of Tangled, Moore was {{initially}} unaware that the film was slated to be Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature film. Since that time, she has received her ignorance with gratitude, explaining, [...] "I feel lucky because I would've probably <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more pressure had I known going into the recording process." [...] Moore hardly worked with co-stars Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, who provided the voices of Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel, respectively, never meeting Murphy and having only met Levi once to record their characters' duet [...] "I See the Light". Moore {{was surprised to learn}} that she would be isolated from her co-stars against initial expectations that [...] "we're all going to be chummy, hanging out at the studio laughing and going out to dinner together". Moore had little idea of what her character looked like because, in terms of visual aid, she was only provided with rough, incomplete sketches and storyboards, while [...] "everything else had to be explained" [...] by Howard and Greno. The majority of the images were created by Moore herself in her own mind.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2013, Koechlin {{appeared}} in a video entitled It's Your Fault, along with VJ Juhi Pandey. Dealing {{with the issue of}} sexual assaults on women, the video mocks the mindset that blames women for provoking rapes. It was created by All India Bakchod, and was released on their YouTube channel. It's Your Fault went viral, with over 150,000 views in two days. Koechlin's sole release in 2014 was Saif Ali Khan's Happy Ending, where she plays a comic role of a girl obsessed with Khan's character. She credited her performance in Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani for landing her the role. She said that people noticed her comic timing in the film, and that worked in her favour. The film, which Koechlin described as [...] "spoof on our film industry and on all the romantic comedies", opened to mixed reviews and was a box-office failure. Despite the film's mixed reception she garnered praise for her performance. Saurabh Dwivedi of India Today wrote that [...] "Koechlin steals the show with her perfect portrayal of a nagging girlfriend", and Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times noted that, although her character in the film <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> forced, she delivered a [...] "charming" [...] performance.|$|E
6000|$|Peter {{looked very}} humble {{and as if}} he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> foolish. [...] "Is--is--is it true that way down in the Sunny South I have a cousin who loves to spend {{his time in the}} water?" [...] stammered Peter.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Merry Little Breezes were right," [...] muttered Peter to himself, as Old Man Coyote trotted {{away in the}} {{direction}} of the Green Forest, and he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> wee <b>bit</b> ashamed to think that he had refused to believe them.|$|R

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} season an 8.3 out of 10, praising Atwell's performance, {{as well as}} the return of Dottie in the season and the {{additions}} of Ana Jarvis and Whitney Frost. Conversely, he felt Reggie Austin as Jason Wilkes was likable, but ultimately the [...] "character <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bland" [...] and that the humor in the season was pushed [...] "a bit too far". He concluded, [...] "I don't think [...] was quite as tightly-constructed as Season 1 and tonally, it sometimes wrestled with finding the right balance between the cool spy-action elements and the likable comedic aspect... But overall, it was another fun season filled with compelling characters—including a strong villain—and 1940s, Marvel-flavored spy heroics, which benefitted from the new visuals the Los Angeles setting gave it." [...] Molly Freeman, reviewing the season finale for Screen Rant, called the season as a whole [...] "Excellent", particularly praising the character development given to the character of Whitney Frost, but criticized the way that the season ended that character's storyline, stating that the finale [...] "does a disservice to all the character development of Whitney throughout season 2....for the sake of sweeping her aside as easily as possible and giving the other cast members more development and screen time. After watching Agent Carter develop Whitney as such a powerful and sympathetic villain earlier this season, the way the show wrapped up her storyline is a disappointment." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Mysteries of Westgate were mixed. 1UP.com's Jason Wilson {{said that}} the game's plot is [...] "an {{intriguing}} tale, and even after finishing the game, a number of encounters and plot points ring in my head ... but the story's poor stitching distracts from its arc—I felt like a great hand ... was pushing me through the plot, and the tale <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> muddled toward the end." [...] Brett Todd of GameSpot called the plot [...] "rough around the edges", while GameZone reviewer Michael Lafferty said, [...] "The game may have a disjointed storyline, but there are moments where humor shines through, and the game does take a few interesting plot twists. And {{the exploration of the}} city zones, the underground areas where the trolls abound, hold that sense of joyful discovery that make an RPG worth playing." [...] Numerous reviewers mentioned that the impact of the mask which drives the story is minimal, having little effect on the actual gameplay. Lafferty said the side quests were not necessarily optional, as they were often a source of additional gold, and a certain point in the game's plot required a substantial sum of it to proceed. GamesRadar's Rich McCormick praised the game's storyline and main quest as some of its best points. In a review for GameStar, Christian Schmidt thought that the game's appearance and humor were poor, but recommended it because of its strong storyline.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an 'A', saying [...] "Community is going {{away for a}} while, but it's going away with an episode that reminds me why I love the show so much. This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "At first, it <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> too harsh, but I {{went to the}} {{computer}} and went for something meditative rather than harsh. It {{was a very difficult}} scene.

3000|$|... (…) {{living in}} our Oxfordshire village, I had many friends, {{but all of}} them were English friends. I didn’t meet anybody from Poland or any other Eastern European country.

Everybody is brought up in their own culture and obviously it’s sometimes easier to talk to somebody who understands you at the same level.|$|R

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said this}} episode {{highlighted}} how the show excelts as portraying small town {{life in a}} comedic way without ridiculing small towns. Fowler said the Twilight jokes <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> stale, but he praised Aziz Ansari's performances and moments highlighting the supporting characters, like jokes {{at the expense of}} character Jerry Gergich and Ben's developing respect for Pawnee. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said the series, and [...] "Time Capsule" [...] in particular, accurately captures the details and flavors of the local governments and the public in small towns, even if they exaggerate them. Porter praised the pairing of Chris and Andy and said the two conflicting character personalities worked well together. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said he did not feel Will Forte's character was well integrated {{with the rest of the}} cast and that he dragged down the first episode of the series. However, Sepinwall said once Forte removed himself from Leslie's office, the episode had a [...] "terrific second half", and that the public hearing in particular displayed the strengths of the show. Joel Keller of TV Squad had the opposite view of Alan Sepinwall and felt Forte's character was the most interesting part of the episode, whereas the second half felt [...] "dragged down" [...] and less funny. Keller wrote, [...] "It just lasted a scene too long; we get it, the people in Pawnee are loopy." [...] Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said Parks and Recreation is [...] "at its best when its illustrating small-town life in America" [...] and that the public hearing meetings did so brilliantly. Sundermann praised Rob Lowe's performance and said the new additions of the Chris and Ben characters was [...] "exactly what the show needed to push itself to another level of silliness".|$|E

When we were actually lying down I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> humiliated but I also felt apprehensive about what was going to happen next. One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook my hand and a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, that we should be proud of what we'd done." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of April 2011, Kinect Sports {{has sold}} over three million units and {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, getting {{a rating of}} 8/10 from IGN, a 7.5/10 from GameSpot, and a 4/5 from G4TV's X-Play. Video game talk show Good Game gave the game a 7 out of 10 which praised that it didn't feel like a Wii sports game and that you actually had to use your whole body to play it however stating that the soccer <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> brain dead. Overall they said [...] "It's a solid sports collection to show off Kinect and it is presented well with lots of great licensed music." [...] Kinect Sports was also awarded Best Family Game in the Game British Academy Video Game Awards in 2011.|$|E

60|$|Frank was dazed {{at first}} by the glare and the noise; then he jumped out of bed, and tried for two things: whether the money was still safe in his pocket, and whether his brother was alive.

But I have to add, that as someone from Gaspée, from St-Octave-de-l'Avenir, I <b>felt</b> maybe <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more like <b>a</b> French-speaking outsider than a Quebecois.
