25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|In summer 2014, Allardyce signed midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté, left-back Aaron Cresswell, {{attacker}} Enner Valencia, right-back (on {{loan from}} Arsenal) Carl Jenkinson, striker Diafra Sakho, defensive midfielder Alex Song (on loan from Barcelona), midfielder Morgan Amalfitano, and forward Mauro Zárate. In October 2014, pundits like BBC's Robbie Savage were commenting about the team's [...] "more attractive and attacking playing style" [...] or [...] "the statistics [...] show {{the progress that}} West Ham have {{made in the last}} few months." [...] Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2014 after three wins for West Ham out of four games played that month. Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015, {{the final day of the}} season, after his contract was not renewed. Allardyce stated that [...] "I didn't want to stay. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either". His West Ham side had finished 12th in the 2014–15 season, one place higher than in the 2013–14 season.|$|E

No! not even the derivation! But the fashion's been set and in it you must be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll do {{something}} yet," [...] she said. [...] "Mr. Stephens said you would. Oh, I like you, Jane Lavinia, you dear thing! Sometimes I haven't liked you because you're nothing to look at, and <b>I</b> didn't <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> really do anything worthwhile.

6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of that. Wait till my rangers come back. I wouldn't be in your boots. Don't mistake me. <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{be accused}} of {{stealing}} another man's ideas or plan, but sure you've stolen these four claims.

6000|$|... "Well; {{you shall}} judge of that yourself;" [...] and Lady Staveley {{sat down on}} the sofa so that she was close to the chair which Madeline still occupied.

6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} {{anything}} so ridiculous in my life," [...] the lady exclaimed. [...] "No, I'm not blaming <b>you,</b> Reggie! <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have done anything else. But this woman, what a nerve she must have to imagine that she can do it!

6000|$|... "Well, {{and what}} right have you to crow over us on that score? <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hire {{a man in}} America for eighteen-pence a day instead of a dollar and a half, you would do it?

6000|$|In a {{sheltered}} nook they sat down, and she quickly [...] "repaired her drooping head and tricked her beams" [...] again. He {{could see her}} tearfully smiling through her veil.

6000|$|... "If {{you could}} have bandaged it up yourself," [...] said Wallace, [...] "you ought to have done so, though <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not. But now it is your duty to save her, as much as possible, from all other trouble. You ought to find {{amusement}} for yourself {{as much as you}} can, instead of calling upon her to amuse you, and you ought to be patient and gentle, and quiet and good-humored.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Grace; [...] "that was plain. You were firm {{when you}} thought I {{might be forced to}} marry Thorn, and when father agreed not to use his influence, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not use yours. Well, I'm glad you were angry; it was human, and your scrupulous {{fairness}} was not flattering." [...] She paused and, to Kit's relief, gave him a smile. [...] "After all, it would not have hurt to be urged to marry the man I did like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{thank you}} too much for your kindness, captain. I trust that when I get back you will call at Captain Dowsett's store in Tower Street, so that I may see you and again thank you; I know that the Captain himself will welcome you heartily when I tell him how kindly you have treated me. He will be almost as glad as I shall myself to see you. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not take him a message or letter from me now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No you didn't, Clavvy, {{not if you}} remember. But {{the fact}} is, <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> go high enough.

5000|$|Cook's novels have {{anticipated}} national controversy. In {{an interview with}} Stephen McDonald about the novel Shock, Cook admitted the book's timing was fortuitous: <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say that it's the most like Coma in fact that it deals with an issue that everybody seems to be concerned about. I wrote this book to address the stem cell issue, which the public really doesn't know anything about. Besides entertaining readers, my main {{goal is to get}} people interested in some of these issues, because it's the public that ultimately should be able to decide which way we ought to go in something as ethically questioning as stem cell research.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{tell you}} what," [...] Bob said; [...] "I {{have a good}} many friends, and people are always pleased with a present from the country. A box of fruit from Marbella is always welcome, for their flavour is {{considered}} excellent. It is well to throw a little fish, to catch a big one; and a present is like oil on the wheels of business. How many boxes of fruit will your boat carry? <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take twenty, and still have room to row?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} look so contrite, for <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not help it; and I am resigned," [...] he said. [...] "There. We will {{take all the}} rest for granted, and you must wait another year." [...] Then, {{although}} Haldane smiled again, he laid {{his hand on my}} shoulder in a very kindly fashion as he added; [...] "Lucille might, like her sister, have shone in London and Paris; but it seems she prefers the prairie--and, after all, I do not know that she has not chosen well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall draw fifty pounds," [...] Carry said positively. [...] "As you say, your outfit {{will really}} cost nothing; ten pounds {{will pay for}} your journey to Liverpool and your passage; that will leave you forty pounds in your pocket when you land. That is the very least you could do with, for you may find {{you will have to}} buy a horse, and though I believe they are very cheap out there, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not get one under ten pounds; and then there would be the saddle and bridle and food for the journey, and all sorts of things. I don't think forty pounds will be enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to let}} her go," [...] said Dora. [...] "Your {{sister would}} have a pretty opinion of me when she is ready to take her drive, and finds that I have let her horse run away; and, besides, I don't like to give up things. Do you like to give up things? I am sure you don't, for I saw you {{bringing}} this horse into the yard, and you were very determined about it. If I let her go, all your determination and trouble will have been for nothing. I should not like that. Come, come, you obstinate creature, just two steps forward. I have some lumps of sugar in my pocket which I keep to give to our horses, but of course I can't get it with both my hands occupied. I wish I had thought of the sugar. By the way, the sugar is not in my pocket; after all, {{it is in this}} little bag on my belt; <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> reach it." ...|$|R
6000|$|My dear Rice--Your amende Honorable I {{must call}} [...] "un surcroît d'Amitié," [...] for I am {{not at all}} {{sensible}} of anything but that you were unfortunately engaged and I was unfortunately in a hurry. I completely understand your feeling in this mistake, and find in it that balance of comfort which remains after regretting your uneasiness. I have long {{made up my mind}} to take for granted the genuine-heartedness of my friends, notwithstanding any temporary ambiguousness in their behaviour or their tongues, nothing of which however I had the least scent of this morning. I say completely understand; for I am everlastingly getting my mind into such-like painful trammels--and am even at this moment suffering under them {{in the case of a}} friend of ours.--I will tell you two most unfortunate and parallel slips--it seems down-right pre-intention--A friend says to me, [...] "Keats, I shall go and see Severn this week."--"Ah! (says I) you want him to take your Portrait."--And again, [...] "Keats," [...] says a friend, [...] "when will you come to town again?"--"I will," [...] says I, [...] "let you have the MS. next week." [...] In both these cases I appeared to attribute an interested motive to each of my friends' questions--the first made him flush, the second made him look angry:--and yet I am innocent in both cases; my mind leapt over every interval, to what I saw was per se a pleasant subject with him. You see I have no allowances to make--you see how far <b>I</b> am from <b>supposing</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> show me any neglect. I very much regret the long time I have been obliged to exile from you: for I have one or two rather pleasant occasions to confer upon with you. What I have heard from George is favourable--I expect a letter from the Settlement itself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'DEAR CONINGSBY, I {{very much}} fear {{that you must}} think me a very ungrateful fellow, because you have not heard from me before; but I was in hopes that I might get out and say to you what I feel; but whether I speak or write, it is quite {{impossible}} for me to make you understand the feelings of my heart to you. Now, I will say at once, that I have always liked you better than any fellow in the school, and always thought you the cleverest; indeed, I always thought that there was no one like you; but I never would say this or show this, because you never seemed to care for me, and because I was afraid you would think I merely wanted to con with you, as they used to say of some other fellows, whose names I will not mention, because they always tried to do so with Henry Sydney and you. I do not want this at all; but I want, though we may not speak to each other more than before, that we may be friends; and that you will always know that there is nothing I will not do for you, and that I like you better than any fellow at Eton. And I do not mean that this shall be only at Eton, but afterwards, wherever we may be, that you will always remember that there is nothing I will not do for you. Not because you saved my life, though that is a great thing, but because before that I would have done anything for you; only, for the cause above mentioned, I would not show it. I do not expect that we shall be more together than before; nor can <b>I</b> ever <b>suppose</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> like me as you like Henry Sydney and Buckhurst, or even as you like Vere; but still I hope you will always think of me with kindness now, and let me sign myself, if ever I do write to you, 'Your most attached, affectionate, and devoted friend, ...|$|R
