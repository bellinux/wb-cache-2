This experimental apparatus, published by Iwata et al., allows the characterization of semiconductors such as photovoltaics, {{as well as other}} photo-conductive materials. The experimental configuration utilizes a cantilever consisting of a bent optical fiber sharpened to a tip diameter of less than 100 nm, coated with an <b>ITO</b> <b>layer,</b> and a thin Au layer. Hence, the fiber probe acts as the AFM cantilever for force sensing, is optically conductive to record optical data, and electrically conductive to record current from the sample.
