He retired to South Bend, Indiana, where he died in 1984. A starting pitcher, Coveleski specialized in throwing the spitball, a pitch where the ball is altered with a <b>foreign</b> <b>substance</b> such as chewing tobacco. It was legal when his career began and outlawed in 1920, but {{he was one of}} 17 pitchers permitted to continue throwing the pitch.|$|E

This is useful for making the cell produce a <b>foreign</b> <b>substance,</b> or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} a novel technique based on machine vision for detection of <b>foreign</b> <b>substances</b> in injections. Mechanical control yields spin/stop movement of injections which helps to cause relative movement between <b>foreign</b> <b>substances</b> in liquid and an ampoule bottle. <b>Foreign</b> <b>substances</b> are classified into two categories: subsiding-slowly object and subsiding-fast object. A sequence of frames are captured by {{a camera and}} used to recognize <b>foreign</b> <b>substances.</b> After image preprocessing like noise reduction and motion detection, two different methods, Moving-object Clustering (MC) and Frame Difference, are proposed to detect the two categories respectively. MC is operated to cluster subsiding-slowly <b>foreign</b> <b>substances,</b> based on the invariant features of those objects. Frame Difference is defined to calculate the difference between two frames due to the change of subsiding-fast objects. 200 ampoule samples filled with injection are tested and the experimental result indicates that the approach can detect the visible <b>foreign</b> <b>substances</b> effectively...|$|R

Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game.

500|$|An {{antibody}} (Ab), {{also known}} as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells {{that is used by}} the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen, via the Fab's variable region. Each tip of the [...] "Y" [...] of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the <b>foreign</b> <b>substance.</b> The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region (located {{at the base of the}} [...] "Y"), which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions. The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system.|$|E

40|$|At {{the moment}} <b>foreign</b> <b>substances</b> in food are {{detected}} mainly by using mechanical and optical methods {{as well as}} ultrasonic technique and than they are removed from the further process. These techniques detect {{a large portion of}} the <b>foreign</b> <b>substances</b> due to their different mass (mechanical sieving), their different colour (optical method) and their different surface density (ultrasonic detection). Despite the numerous different methods a considerable portion of the <b>foreign</b> <b>substances</b> remain undetected. In order to recognise materials still undetected, a complementary detection method would be desirable removing the <b>foreign</b> <b>substances</b> not registered by the a. m. methods from the production process. In a project with 13 partner from the food industry, the Fraunhofer-Institut fur Holzforschung (WKI) and the Technische Universitat are trying to adapt thermography for the detection of foreign bodies in the food industry. After the initial tests turned out to be very promising for the differentiation of food stuffs and <b>foreign</b> <b>substances,</b> more and detailed investigation were carried out to develop suitable algorithms for automatic detection of foreign bodies. In order to achieve-besides the mere visual detection of foreign substances-also an automatic detection under production conditions, numerous experiences in image processing and pattern recognition are exploited. Results for the detection of foreign bodies will be presented at the conference showing the different advantages and disadvantages of using grey-level, statistical and morphological image processing techniques...|$|R

Although poisoning remained a prime suspicion, the pasty was not believed to be the source of the poison.

2500|$|Because {{baseball}} hitting is difficult, baseball rules {{prohibit the}} deliberate scratching or scuffing of a ball, or {{the application of}} any <b>foreign</b> <b>substance</b> that could conceivably affect the flight or visibility of a ball. Balls that are deliberately made more difficult to hit by applying foreign substances are often known as spitballs, regardless of the specific substance applied (such as Vaseline). Both spitballs and those that become scuffed or scratched through normal game play are immediately removed from play and never reused. The current rules regarding the condition of baseballs did not come into effect until 1920, {{after the death of}} Ray Chapman from being hit with a Carl Mays spitball. Before that point, the rules were similar to those still present in cricket. However, the new rules were not consistently enforced for several decades afterwards, and several pitchers (most notably Gaylord Perry) built careers around skirting these rules, doing such things as hiding nail files in their gloves or putting Vaseline {{on the underside of the}} peaks of their caps. In modern baseball, however, the prohibition against modifying the baseball in almost any way is strictly enforced and players found to be in violation of this rule are not only ejected from the game in which the infraction occurred, but are also subject to a suspension. The only substance applied to a baseball is the Delaware River mud formula that umpires rub in before a game to remove the [...] "shine" [...] from the ball and improve its grip. The pitcher is also allowed to use rosin on his hands (via a rosin bag) to improve his grip, and to blow on his hands in cold weather.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{introduction}} to The Womanist Reader, Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its {{main concern is}} not the black woman per se but rather the black woman {{is the point of}} origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. [...] "Purple is to Lavender" [...] illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss. Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In [...] "Purple is to Lavender", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty. They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino (Jain & Turner, pp.67–70). They go on to describe the concept of [...] "The Politics of Naming" [...] which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism (Jain & Turner, pp.73–75). Jain states: [...] "I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a <b>foreign</b> <b>substance</b> that I was being forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.68). Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels like she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, [...] "The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.73). This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: [...] "I don't choose womanism because it is [...] "better" [...] than feminism...I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it… because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see" [...] (quoted in Jain & Turner, pp.77–78).|$|E
