5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E

For the vast part of the last century, scientists have written off glial cells {{to be nothing more}} than the structure and foundations that hold the neurons in place. But now, there is direct evidence that correlates the number of glial cells in the brain with the amount of intelligence that any given species possesses. Future research will begin to shed light on the mysterious, yet increasingly crucial, role of glial cells.|$|E

In an interview with Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine in September 2008, Bear said that what inspired him to write City at the End of Time was the question, [...] "What if we're still primitive in our thinking ?", and this led to the idea for a story of [...] "a Universe that <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on and on, and how reality might have to be changed by that circumstance." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s the {{presence}} of women in rock, and in particular in heavy metal bands, was usually considered by press and fans more for glamour and sexual exploitation than for the musicianship showed. Doro Pesch {{was one of the}} few exceptions; her qualities as vocalist and songwriter in Warlock, her commitment in promoting their music and her avoidance of posturing as a sex symbol won the respect of a solid fan base in the expanding European metal scene of that period, ensuring a long string of favorable articles and covers on the principal European metal magazines. In an interview in 2006 Doro remembered how [...] "we lived in paradise and had not noticed it, (...) we thought at the time, that now it <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on and the success would continue automatically, (...) then came the great awakening".|$|E

500|$|... "Brian & Stewie" [...] is the 17th {{episode of}} the eighth season of the American {{animated}} television series Family Guy, and 150th {{episode of the}} series overall. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on May 2, 2010. The episode features anthropomorphic dog Brian and baby Stewie after they are accidentally trapped inside a bank vault over a weekend. The two are ultimately forced to reveal their true feelings about each other, and eventually go on to question each other's existence and purpose in life. Brian and Stewie become even closer {{to each other as}} time <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> climactically help each other survive being trapped inside the vault. The bottle episode breaks from the show's usual set-up, and is the only episode of the series not to feature any music or use any cutaway gags with Brian and Stewie being the only two characters featured in the entire episode. In repeats of the episode there is no main title sequence, nor is any music played over the end credits.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{episode of}} Sense and Sensibility {{features}} the moment Willoughby seduces Eliza, a young schoolgirl. Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the Western Mail {{that he wanted}} [...] "to do justice" [...] to Willoughby's back story, {{saying that it is}} [...] "quite interesting and steamy stuff like a lot of underage sex that <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> is just talked about. I want {{to put it on the}} screen." [...] Davies elaborated on this further in an interview with The Independent's Peter Chapman, saying that the seduction and abandonment of a schoolgirl in the novel needed dramatising. He believed readers [...] "hardly notice" [...] the moment, which he felt was very important. The writer noted that the series was [...] "more overtly sexual" [...] than previous adaptations of Austen's works and added, [...] "The novel is as much about sex and money as social conventions." [...] Davies also included a duel between Colonel Brandon and Willoughby in his screenplay, an event that was absent from Lee's film adaptation of the novel.|$|E
500|$|... "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. While reviewing Femme Fatale, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Spears [...] "does what pop stars invariably do {{in lieu of}} having a detectable character of their own: <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on about sex", while commenting that [...] "after a while, {{you get the feeling}} the lyricists just gave up trying in the face of her indifference: 'You got me kind of hot … Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,' she sings, which somehow makes you think not of thrillingly sweaty congress but the smell of boiled cabbage." [...] Contemporary critic Robert Christgau noted the songs on the album are [...] "such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy", saying that the singer is [...] "just too straight-faced" [...] on [...] "the nauseous 'Your body look so sick I think I got the flu'". A reviewer of Samesame.com.au compared the background vocals of the song to Kesha's [...] "Blow" [...] (2010), and noted [...] "guest rapper Sabi wish she was Nicki Minaj". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani considered [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] one of the album's [...] "best offerings", comparing the song to Christina Aguilera's [...] "Desnudate" [...] (2010).|$|E

500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E
