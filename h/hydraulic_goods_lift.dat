40|$|Aerodynamic {{predictions}} from supersonic linear {{theory and}} hypersonic impact theory {{were compared with}} experimental data for three hypersonic research airplane concepts over a Mach number range from 1. 10 to 2. 86.

Halls' lifts were also installed in buildings. During the 1930s Halls started to produced escalators under licence from a German company, with its products installed in Harrods and Selfridges, among other locations. In 1951, Halls {{were responsible for the}} modernisation of the Babbacombe Cliff Lift. They continued to make lifts and escalators until 1968 when that part of the business was sold to Otis.|$|R
40|$|A generic, transonic, supercritical, low aspect-ratio wing {{was tested}} at design {{incidence}} of 5 deg at Mach numbers from 0. 25 to 0. 96. Oil-flow {{studies at the}} design Mach number of 0. 85 showed local-flow separation, which, in retrospect, might have been avoided. At Mach 0. 82 with unseparated flow, the surface-flow angles were less than 10 deg. Predictions with the FLO 22 transonic potential code are <b>good.</b> <b>Lift</b> interference is strong without tunnel-wall suction.

2500|$|The tower has thirty two lifts for tenants to use, where 8 lifts serve roughly ten {{floors of}} the building. All tenant {{passenger}} lifts serve the ground floor and the following groups of floors ‚Äì floors 5‚Äì17, floors 18‚Äì28, floors 28‚Äì39 and floors 39‚Äì50 (note that level 5 is the first office floor {{and there is no}} level 13). In addition there are 2 firemen's lifts which serve all floors in the building. These have colour designations with blue being in the northeast core of the building and green being in the southwest. From the building's initial construction until late 2009 there were 2 large freight lifts at which point another was added. This lift was built inside a vacant lift shaft and has the designation GL37 (GL for <b>goods</b> <b>lift</b> and 37 as it is the 37th lift in the building). The tower uses 'Gearless Traction Elevators' by Otis. [...] These lifts were installed in 1990 (aside from GL37 ‚Äì 2009) using a gearless traction machine. [...] They have woven steel cables called hoisting ropes that are attached {{to the top of the}} lift cabin and wrapped around the drive sheave in special grooves. The other ends of the cables are attached to a counterweight that moves up and down in the hoistway on its own guiderails. It takes 40 seconds by lift from lobby to top floor (The Canary Wharf website has not been updated to include the new <b>goods</b> <b>lift</b> GL37).|$|R

40|$|The {{technique}} of modulation, or variable coefficients, is discussed and the analytical formulation is reviewed. Representative numerical {{results of the}} use of modulation are shown for the lifting and nonlifting cases. These results include the effects of modulation on peak acceleration, entry corridor, and heat absorption. Results are given for entry at satellite speed and escape speed. The indications are that coefficient modulation on a vehicle with <b>good</b> <b>lifting</b> capability offers the possibility of sizable loading reductions or, alternatively, wider corridors; thus, steep entries become practical from the loading standpoint. The amount of steepness depends on the acceptable heating penalty. The price of sizable fractions of the possible gains {{does not appear to be}} excessive.

50|$|The Goodsmaster {{range of}} <b>goods</b> <b>lift</b> is {{produced}} {{in a number of}} sizes, with a maximum capacity of 1500 kg. These are structure-supported systems provided with a load weighing device and alarm, and can be manned or unmanned. Unmanned lifts are controlled by a control panel installed at each floor level, with manned lifts having a panel located in the cabin. The Trolleylift range is of a similar specification, but with a maximum capacity of 300 kg. The Microlift range of dumb waiters has rated capacities of 50 kg and 100 kg, and is available in models designed for restricted headrooms and spaces. This includes a 'double decker' version, incorporating two cars in a single shaft.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of tip jet powered rotorcraft. The Percival P.74 was under-powered {{and could not}} fly. The Hiller YH-32 Hornet had <b>good</b> <b>lifting</b> capability but performed poorly otherwise. Other aircraft used auxiliary thrust for translational flight so that the tip jets could be shut down while the rotor autorotated. The experimental Fairey Jet Gyrodyne, 48-seat Fairey Rotodyne passenger prototypes and McDonnell XV-1 compound gyroplanes flew well using this method. Perhaps the most unusual design of this type was the Rotary Rocket Roton ATV, which was originally envisioned to take off using a rocket-tipped rotor. The French Sud-Ouest Djinn used unburnt compressed air to drive the rotor, which minimized noise and helped it become the only tip jet driven rotor helicopter to enter production.|$|R
