40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that {{moisture}} ingress in <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polymers</b> (GFRP) enhances the phenomenon of stress corrosion cracking in the fibers, and that this reaction is likely to proceed more rapidly at the weakest sites in the <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> surface, a fundamental law that would permit the valid extrapolation of stress rupture curves to long service lives is yet to be developed. As a result, design guidelines for <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polymers</b> components have been developed mainly on a prescriptive rather than of a performance basis. Based on the well established knowledge on the chemical behavior of glass and, in particular, that of glass flaws, a model that combines fracture mechanics, shear lag theory, and a probability model for flaw size is developed to describe the behavior of GFRP composites. The predicted results, although limited to rather idealized situations, are very encouraging. They suggest that, with only modest assumptions about material properties, it is possible to obtain mechanisms of GFRP breakdown, which correspond with observed experimental behavior. ...|$|R
