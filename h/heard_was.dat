5|$|Meanwhile Erika 'Rika' Wallen, born Lovisa Erika Jakobson in 1874 on a {{farm near}} Örebro Sweden, immigrated with her sister in 1891 to the United States. They {{traveled}} to Minneapolis, Minnesota to join their brother Carl Jakobson. There they changed their last name to Wallen to distinguish themselves from the many other Jacobsons and Jakobsons. After Carl died in an accident, the sisters moved to San Francisco, which they <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> booming. Rika {{took a job as}} a cook for the Hills Brothers coffee family, which lasted until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Omaha Police {{arrived at}} Westroads Mall about six minutes after {{receiving}} the first 911 call. During the entire 70 seconds of that first call, all the dispatcher <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> gunshots. Audio tapes and transcripts of the 911 calls, along with images captured by mall security surveillance cameras, were released by the police on December 7, 2007. In one 911 call, gunshots can be heard.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin {{attracted}} the attention of Bartholomew Iscanus, Bishop of Exeter, who made him archdeacon at Totnes in about 1161, after Baldwin's father's death. Baldwin was known as a canon lawyer during his holding of Totnes. He received a letter from John of Salisbury in 1167, complaining about Bartholomew's conduct during the Becket controversy. John accused Bartholomew of not properly supporting Thomas Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury in his dispute with the king, urging Baldwin to influence the bishop to increase his support, and not to sign any appeal by the English bishops against Becket. Other letters from John dealt with rumours concerning Roger, the Bishop of Worcester, who John had <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> speaking badly of Becket. John's purpose seems to have been to have Baldwin pass along a warning from Becket to Roger about his behaviour; John was a supporter of Becket's during the latter's exile. In 1169 Baldwin was once again peripherally involved in the Becket dispute, when he objected to Becket's excommunication of a number of noblemen and clergy for opposing Becket's cause. Baldwin's objection was not so much that they were excommunicated, but that no warning had been given that such an action was contemplated.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Dream Theater, Moore {{moved to}} Santa Fe, New Mexico and started writing {{material}} for his solo album. A demo tape known as Music Meant to Be <b>Heard</b> <b>was</b> shared among fans, and the songs included many spoken-word samples from interviews Moore recorded during his cross-country travels. Most {{of these songs}} were later released in 1999 on a limited-edition CD called This is a Recording.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, {{wishing to}} gain some {{advice on how to}} deal with the {{approaching}} European colonial powers, he invited a Scottish missionary, Frederick Stanley Arnot, who he had <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> in Angola, to come to his capital at Bunkeya, 180km west of the Luapula River. In 1886 Arnot arrived and was the first white person to settle in Katanga. After three years he went back to Britain to recruit more missionaries, including Charles Swan and Dan Crawford.|$|E

At 3:20 pm, Friesenhahn made the last connections to the detonator and twisted the handle, but nothing happened.

Both Friesenhahn and Bratge knew the dire consequences to them personally and to the German defensive situation if they failed to destroy the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Performers at {{previous}} Olympic {{opening ceremonies}} had occasionally synched to recordings {{of their own}} performance, such as the tenor Luciano Pavarotti at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, due to his pancreatic cancer.

The Sydney Symphony Orchestra appeared to perform at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but the music spectators <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> entirely pre-recorded, {{with some of the}} music pre-recorded by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{required}} to move through every rank below to achieve a higher rank. For example, many officers promote directly to sergeant without ever being senior officers. Also, many assistant chiefs are promoted directly from the rank of lieutenant. Councilman C.O. Bradford was promoted to assistant chief from the rank of sergeant.

25|$|Murray met no {{resistance}} at Whalers Gate, {{but as he}} approached Waireka {{he heard the sound}} of rapid firing towards the coast. He entrenched his men and opened fire on the Kaipopo pā with a rocket tube. The gunfire Murray <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> being exchanged between about 200 Māori warriors—who, armed mostly with double-barrel shotguns and some rifles, were firing from the cover of bush and flax in the river gully—and the militia and Volunteers, who had retreated to the safety of the farmhouse of settler John Jury. Most of the battle took place on the flat farm land below the pa.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} be <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> found to have been contravened in Kay Swee Pin v. Singapore Island Country Club (2008). The {{appellant}} had applied {{to be a member}} of the respondent club, and had declared in the application form that a certain individual was her spouse. Soon after, the club's general committee discovered that there were discrepancies in the appellant's marriage certificate. The general committee then charged the appellant with falsely declaring that the individual was her spouse, and referred the matter to the club's disciplinary committee which came to the opposite conclusion. The general committee declined to adopt the disciplinary committee's conclusion and subsequent recommendations, and terminated the appellant's membership. One of the grounds of the appeal was that there had been breaches of natural justice because, among other things, the appellant had not been given an opportunity to respond to the general committee in the first place. On the Court of Appeal's behalf, Chan Sek Keong C.J. ruled for the appellant. He held that if the general committee had wanted to be the primary fact finder, then it should have allowed the appellant to respond to the allegations of discrepancies in her marriage certificate. Moreover, since the disciplinary committee had heard the appellant and found her explanation credible, the general committee should have asked itself why the former had so concluded.|$|E

500|$|Later that year, Memphis {{city councilman}} E. C. Jones awarded Edwards and Farley with a {{certificate}} [...] "in appreciation of outstanding {{contributions to the}} community". Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones, who had previously appeared on The Political Cesspool. According to The Commercial Appeal, Jones had not listened to the show before the incident, and was unaware of its ideology. After a reporter informed him of the program's agenda, Jones initially refused to apologize. However, after another reporter confronted him with more details about the show's ideology, he changed his view, saying that he probably would not appear again. Carol Chumney, {{another member of the}} Memphis City Council, was also invited to appear on The Political Cesspool, but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show; Chumney said, [...] "what I <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> about advocating for prostitution... So I told them I had other commitments." ...|$|E

He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> my memories of my father.
