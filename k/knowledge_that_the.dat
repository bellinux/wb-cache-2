For 15 years ANA had operated in the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the {{references}} to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of £17,000 (updated value £) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a £7,000 loan guarantee (updated value £). With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907. One reason for Shackleton's sense of urgency was the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Polish explorer Henryk Arctowski was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS {{on the same day}} as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn.|$|E

5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though {{he knows that the}} Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{tactical}} draw, Antietam {{is considered a}} turning point {{of the war and}} a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the proclamation earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning {{to do so in the}} aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance.|$|E
5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the speaker is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> performers know {{the outcome of the}} event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E
40|$|This paper takes {{issues with}} a couple of recent {{arguments}} due to Ernest Sosa according to which (i) knowledge is the norm of assertion and (ii) <b>the</b> thesis <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> is specially valuable is equivalent to <b>the</b> thesis <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> is <b>the</b> norm of assertion.

5|$|The Joint Communique was not {{implemented}} {{and the situation}} continued to deteriorate, particularly after the Ngô family ordered South Vietnam's Special Forces to attack Buddhist pagodas across the country on 21 August. The U.S. condemned the raids, and began to cut aid to the Special Forces, which was effectively a private Ngô family army, {{in addition to other}} government programs that were closely identified with the ruling clan. Regarding such gestures as a green light, and safe in the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US would not intervene in Diệm's defense, the army staged a successful coup in November, resulting in the assassination of the president. The removal of Diệm resulted in a period of political instability, as a series of military juntas deposed one another. This led to a deterioration in the military situation as the communist Viet Cong made substantial gains against the ARVN, prompting the US to deploy hundreds of thousands of combat troops in 1965, escalating the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman-Albanian war {{continued}} through 1465 with Ballaban Badera meeting Skanderbeg at Vaikal, Meçad, Vaikal again, and Kashari. In the meantime, Mehmed continued to negotiate peace with Hungary and Venice. Skanderbeg found himself isolated during these negotiations, {{even if they}} did not succeed, as the conflicting powers temporarily ceased conflict. Furthermore, Ferdinand I of Naples did not send his promised forces and the Venetian forces under Cimarosto left Albania. During the autumn of 1465, Ottoman forces moved from the Morea and Bosnia in order to speed up the peace negotiations. Venice, however, refused peace and Skanderbeg believed that a new Albanian-Venetian campaign would begin. He kept Pal Engjëlli, his ambassador, in constant correspondence with the Signoria (Venetian Senate), which sent him to Albania to inform Skanderbeg that troops were being raised, although only 300 had been recruited at the time, with Cimarosto as the commander. Venice was also in the process of sending its provveditores in Albania Veneta 3,000 ducats to recruit men. They would also send four cannons, ten springalds, and ten barrels of gunpowder. Throughout April, rumors spread that the Ottomans were preparing to march into Albania. By 18 April 1466, Venice received <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans were heading towards Albania.|$|E
5|$|The {{progress}} of the war from September 1939 to the summer of 1941, with a few exceptions, seemed to validate the Luftwaffes pre-war focus on the offensive use of its fighter arm. The success of the Luftwaffe in the Norwegian Campaign and the battles of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece had vindicated this method. The Luftwaffe had defended German airspace by driving away enemy air power from Germany's borders and defeating their enemies in their own skies. The occupation of its opponent's territory denied Germany's enemies the bases to effectively strike at German targets by air. German daylight defences were rarely tested during this time. This run of events, and the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> RAF was only capable of short penetrations over France in daylight, led the Luftwaffe to believe Germany was invulnerable to attack. To maintain the offensive on the front line, bomber production dominated the air industry while the production of fighters was given less priority.|$|E

5|$|The {{venue for}} Il ritorno's première {{was at one}} time {{thought to be the}} Teatro Cassiano, but {{scholarly}} consensus considers it most likely that both the 1639–40 and 1640–41 performances were at the Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo. This view is supported by a study of the performance schedules for other Venice operas, and by the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Manelli company had severed its connection with the Teatro Cassiano before the 1639–40 season. The Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo, owned by the Grimani family, would also be the venue for the premières of Monteverdi's Le nozze d'Enea and Poppea. In terms of its staging Il ritorno is, says Carter, fairly undemanding, requiring three basic sets—a palace, a seascape and a woodland scene—which were more or less standard for early Venetian opera. It did, however, demand some spectacular special effects: the Phaecian ship turns to stone, an airborne chariot transports Minerva, a bolt of fire transforms Ulisse.|$|E
