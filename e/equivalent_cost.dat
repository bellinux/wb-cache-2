40|$|A new {{approach}} to minimise capital costs and energy usage in a district heating network is presented. The method comprises a two-stage programming model, which synthesises design and the optimal operation of a district heating network. Two different optimisation approaches—(a) minimising the annual total energy usage, and (b) minimising the <b>equivalent</b> annual <b>cost</b> of the heat network installation and operation—were examined and high and low temperatures district heating were investigated. For each optimisation approach, the minimum optimal annual total energy usage and minimum optimal <b>equivalent</b> annual <b>cost</b> were calculated and suitable pipe and pump sizes, taking into account different supply and return temperature regimes, target pressure losses and operating strategies within a district heating network were found. Design cases with minimum annual total energy usage and minimum <b>equivalent</b> annual <b>cost</b> used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. This in turn reduced the annual total energy usage and the <b>equivalent</b> annual <b>cost</b> and the suitable pipe and pump sizes were selected. In addition, {{it was observed that}} by reducing the water temperature, the annual total energy usage and the <b>equivalent</b> annual <b>cost</b> could be reduced further. However, the obtained design cases based on a low temperature had relatively larger pipe sizes and smaller pressure drops compared with design cases obtained for the high temperature district heating...|$|R

50|$|The 1997 Labour Party {{manifesto}} made {{a specific}} commitment {{to end the}} Conservatives’ internal market in health care, but in government they retained the split between purchasers and providers of healthcare. In 2000 the Labour Government agreed A Concordat with the Private and Voluntary Health Care Provider Sector with the Independent Healthcare Association. The intention was to increase capacity, particularly in elective care, where private provision was used to bring down waiting lists, in critical care, and in intermediate care facilities. This was followed, in April 2002,by the introduction of prospective payment with nationally set prices for acute, elective activity under ‘payment by results’. Under patient choice patients could opt for treatment by a private provider paid by the NHS. The NHS Plan {{led to the development}} of independent sector treatment centres which provide fast, pre-booked surgery and diagnostic tests for NHS funded patients separating scheduled treatment from emergency care. These centres played a role in reducing the price paid for ‘spot purchases’ with private providers.

The NHS Improvement Plan: Putting people at the heart of publicservices, published in 2004 there was an expectation that the independent sector would supply up to 15% of NHS services by 2008, but this figure was not reached.|$|E
50|$|German {{excavations}} {{made between}} 1905 and 1930 revealed {{all of the}} incomplete new temple and some carved fragments {{that belonged to the}} earlier temple and to associated statues. In 1979 came the biggest discovery by the German Archaeological Institute. On the left wall of the adyton, small very thin scratched lines were discovered. A closer examination brought the first ancient blueprint of a temple back to life. Starting just after the entrance on an area of 200 m2 were the blueprints and a roughly calculated estimate. The discovery and interpretation made by Lothar Haselberger led to some important information about the planning and the building phase of the Apollo Temple, notably that, in addition to meticulous use of geometry in scribing the profiles of mouldings, the architect permitted himself some intuitive adjustments, guided, but not bound, by the strict obligations imposed on him by the traditional geometry of the design; he transcended these self-imposed rules whenever his aesthetics demanded. Today it is known that three different contractors worked until the end. All three had the responsibility to get the material on site, place the stones, and do the first refinement. After that, a small part was left on every placed block, a small cachet with a special sign of the contractor which indicated that this particular block was not yet paid for. Further on, the inscriptions led to the information that one column would have taken 20,000 workdays to complete by one mason. There were more masons working per column, but {{just for the sake of}} calculation: the daily income of a stonemason was 2 drachmas, which is the cost of approx. 8.6 grams of silver. With that information one can calculate the bare craftsmanship cost of one column, which was 20,000 workdays × 8.6 grams of silver, equalling the <b>equivalent</b> <b>cost</b> of 172 kg of silver.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we measure}} trade costs for ECOWAS {{countries}} and infer {{their impact on}} trade flows.

The method expresses the trade cost parameters {{as a function of}} observable trade data. We find that over the period 1980 - 2003, the cost of trading within SSA was the highest, compared to other regional groups, at an average tariff equivalent of 271. 5 percent. On average ECOWAS countries traded with their trading partners at a tariff <b>equivalent</b> trade <b>cost</b> of 268. 2 percent, higher than countries from other regional blocs within and out of SSA. With regards to trade flow involving ECOWAS countries, estimates of tariff <b>equivalent</b> trade <b>costs</b> indicates that on average ECOWAS countries traded among each other at a lower cost than with other trading partners from economic blocs out of ECOWAS. This could be attributed to the positive impact of regional trade integration efforts.
