50|$|In Britain, {{preferred}} brewers' grains {{are often}} obtained from winter harvests and grown in low-nitrogen soil; in central Europe, no special changes {{are made for}} the grain-growing conditions and multi-step <b>decoction</b> <b>mashing</b> is favored instead.|$|E
50|$|In brewing, <b>decoction</b> <b>mashing</b> is the {{traditional}} method where {{a portion of the}} mash is removed to a separate vessel, boiled for a time and then returned to the main mash, raising the mash to the next temperature step.|$|E
50|$|While Live Oak uses {{industry}} standard step mashing {{for most of}} their beers, they use a more difficult and rarely used old world style of mashing known as <b>decoction</b> <b>mashing</b> for a few of their beers, most notably the Live Oak Pilz and the Oaktoberfest.|$|E
50|$|A <b>decoction</b> <b>mash</b> {{brings out}} a higher malt profile from the grains and is {{typically}} used in Bocks or Doppelbock-style beers.|$|R
50|$|Following Jim Koch’s great-great grandfather’s recipe, Samuel Adams {{continued}} to use traditional brewing processes, including <b>decoction</b> <b>mash</b> (a four vessel process) and krausening (a secondary fermentation). Boston Lager is also dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops.|$|R
500|$|The beer was {{variously}} produced {{using an}} infusion <b>mash</b> or a <b>decoction</b> <b>mash.</b> [...] Some {{of the traditional}} production methods of the style are known from undated records from the Grodzisk brewery. [...] These records describe an infusion mash that included a 30-minute acid rest at , a 30 to 60 minute protease rest at , an α-amylase rest for 30 minutes at , and a mash out at [...] [...] The wort was boiled for 90 to 120 minutes. [...] Approximately 80% of the hops were added after 15 minutes and the remaining 20% were added 30 minutes {{before the end of}} the boil.|$|R
50|$|Many dunkels have a {{distinctive}} malty flavour {{that comes from}} a special brewing technique called <b>decoction</b> <b>mashing.</b> Most commonly, dunkel beers are dark lagers, but the term is also used to refer to dark wheat beers such as Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel. Dunkel weizen is another term used to refer to dark wheat beers, which are fruity and sweet with more dark, roasted malts than their lighter counterpart, the hefeweizen.|$|E
5000|$|Mashing in (sometimes called [...] "doughing-in") is {{typically}} done between , but, for single-step infusion mashes, mashing in {{must be done}} between [...] for amylases {{to break down the}} grain's starch into sugars. The weight-to-weight ratio of strike water and grain varies from [...] for dark beers in single-step infusions to [...] or even , ratios more suitable for light-colored beers and <b>decoction</b> <b>mashing,</b> where much mash water is boiled off.|$|E
50|$|<b>Decoction</b> <b>mashing</b> {{is where}} a {{proportion}} of the grains are boiled {{and then returned to}} the mash, raising the temperature. The boiling extracts more starch from the grain by breaking down the cell walls of the grain. It can be classified into one-, two-, and three-step decoctions, depending on how many times part of the mash is drawn off to be boiled. It is a traditional method, and is common in German and Central European breweries. It was used out of necessity before the invention of thermometers allowed simpler step mashing. But the practice continues for many traditional beers because of the unique malty flavor it lends to the beer; boiling part of the grain results in Maillard reactions, which create melanoidins that lead to rich, malty flavours.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} used to reduce inflammation. A <b>decoction</b> of them (<b>mashing</b> and boiling) is used to treat abscesses. Leaf juice {{may be used to}} treat wounds.|$|R
50|$|Decoction is {{a method}} of {{extraction}} by boiling herbal or plant material to dissolve the chemicals of the material, which may include stems, roots, bark and rhizomes. <b>Decoction</b> involves first <b>mashing</b> the plant material to allow for maximum dissolution, and then boiling in water to extract oils, volatile organic compounds and other various chemical substances. Decoction {{can be used to}} make herbal teas, leaf teas, coffees, tinctures and similar solutions. Decoctions and infusions may produce liquids with differing chemical properties as the temperature and/or preparation difference may result in more oil-soluble chemicals in decoctions versus infusions. The process can also be applied to meats and vegetables to prepare bouillon or stock,though the term is typically only used to describe boiled plant extracts, usually for medicinal or scientific purposes.|$|R
50|$|According to legends, {{the history}} of theriac begins with the king Mithridates VI of Pontus who experimented with poisons and antidotes on his prisoners. His {{numerous}} toxicity experiments eventually led him to declare that he had discovered an antidote for every venomous reptile and poisonous substance. He mixed all the effective antidotes into a single one, mithridatium or mithridate. Mithridate contained opium, myrrh, saffron, ginger, cinnamon and castor, along with some forty other ingredients. When the Romans defeated him, his medical notes fell into their hands and Roman medici began to use them. Emperor Nero's physician Andromachus improved upon mithridatum by bringing {{the total number of}} ingredients to sixty four, including viper's flesh, a <b>mashed</b> <b>decoction</b> of which, first roasted then well aged, proved the most constant ingredient. Lise Manniche, however, links the origins of theriac to the ancient Egyptian kyphi recipe, which was also used medicinally.|$|R
5000|$|In brewing and distilling, mashing is {{the process}} of {{combining}} a mix of milled grain (typically malted barley with supplementary grains such as corn, sorghum, rye or wheat), known as the [...] "grain bill", and water, known as [...] "liquor", and heating this mixture. Mashing allows the enzymes in the malt to break down the starch in the grain into sugars, typically maltose to create a malty liquid called wort. There are two main methods—infusion mashing, in which the grains are heated in one vessel; and <b>decoction</b> <b>mashing,</b> in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature. Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably [...] ), and takes place in a [...] "mash tun"—an insulated brewing vessel with a false bottom. The end product of mashing is called a [...] "mash".|$|E
50|$|In step-infusion and <b>decoction</b> <b>mashing,</b> the mash {{is heated}} to {{different}} temperatures at which specific enzymes work optimally. The table at right shows the optimal temperature ranges {{for the enzymes}} brewers pay the most attention to and what material those enzymes break down. There is some contention in the brewing industry as to just what the optimal temperature is for these enzymes, as it is often very dependent on the pH of the mash, and its thickness. A thicker mash acts as a buffer for the enzymes. Once a step is passed, the enzymes active in that step are denatured by the increasing heat and become permanently inactive. The time spent transitioning between rests is preferably as short as possible; however, if the temperature is raised more than 1 °C per minute, enzymes may be prematurely denatured in the transition layer near heating elements.|$|E
50|$|In <b>decoction</b> <b>mashing,</b> {{part of the}} mash {{is taken}} out of the mash tun and placed in a cooker, where it is boiled for a period of time. This caramelizes some of the sugars, giving the beer a deeper flavor and color, and frees more {{starches}} from the grain, making for a more efficient extraction from the grains. The portion drawn off for decoction is calculated so that the next rest temperature is reached by simply putting the boiled portion back into the mash tun. Before drawing off for decoction, the mash is allowed to settle a bit, and the thicker part is typically taken out for decoction, as the enzymes have dissolved in the liquid, and the starches to be freed are in the grains, not the liquid. This thick mash is then boiled for around 15 minutes, and returned to the mash tun.|$|E
40|$|Barley and malt proteins, of {{infusion}} (IoB) and <b>decoction</b> (EBC) <b>mashing</b> worts as well {{as commercial}} wort and beer, obtained from the Castlemaine Perkins brewery, Brisbane, were gel filtered, with or without further treatments. A general, similar pattern of protein and peptide profiles emerged from barley malt and beer. This confirmed the widely assumed fact that beer proteins descend from barley, some transformed and others perhaps mostly unchanged by processing. In the gel-filtrate profiles, a maximum of 8 or 9 fractions were discerned. These fractions were collected and quantified for protein contents and amino acid compositions. The first four fractions contained the proteins and polypeptides of molecular weight higher than 14, 000. Consequently, the remaining fractions contain the smaller peptides (< 14, 000), that were completely removed by dialysis. The effects of processing on proteins and peptides varied contingent upon the type of processing step considered and the pre-chromatographic treatment. Malting was the most effective process remarkably increasing the soluble protein contents, especially the smaller peptide fractions and the colour development. This is the first report, {{as far as we}} are aware of, on the gel filtration profiles of wort and beer low molecular weight peptides including those of barley wort. The importance of the smaller peptides in foam formation and retention cannot be overemphasised. The amino acid composition of the fractions revealed much more diversity than was observed in the comparison of the profiles. Proline content of fraction 1 resembled that of barley soluble proteins while fractions F 2, F 3 and F 4 that of glutelin and only fraction 8 that of hordein. The latter, suggests that hordeins or, at least the peptide products rich in proline, are likely to be completely digested to amino acids, during malting. ...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{gluten-free}} beer is {{not produced}} in Hungary for coeliacs. The goal {{of our research}} was to develop brewery products made of domestically grown millet (Alföldi 1) and buckwheat (Oberon) {{that are similar to}} traditional beer of barley malt regarding taste, aroma, consistency, colour, foam stability and alcohol content. On a micromalting equipment malts were made of buckwheat and millet. Beer was produced on pilot plant scale (50 l) with <b>decoction</b> process (<b>mashing</b> program with rests at 50 °C, 65 °C and 72 °C) and was supplemented with a highly heat-stable bacterial α-amylase, a fungal α-amylase and β-glucanase. Malts were evaluated by congress mashing (extract content, extract difference, pH, and colour); wort and final beer analyses were performed as well (pH, extract, iodine test, FAN, colour, bitterness, alcohol and extract content). Finally, sensory characterization was carried out. Difficulties with lautering were encountered during the brewing process with buckwheat. The analytical results indicated that the buckwheat and millet beer had different values compared with a typical barley beer with regard to pH, FAN, fermentability, and total alcohol. The extracts of the buckwheat and millet wort were lower, resulting in a final attenuation of 61. 5 % and 73. 2 %. In laboratory experiments optimal temperature of β-amylase found in domestically grown buckwheat (64 °C) and millet (62 °C) was determined by detecting maltose production with HPLC. Data was used to set the rest temperature of the enzyme during mashing. Inhibiting effect of certain substances on proteolytic enzymes was investigated by measuring the extract, FAN, and soluble nitrogen contents. Inhibition was detected in case of both raw materials, although to a different extent. Inhibition is influenced by tannins and polyphenols found in the grain (Chethan et al., 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{deals with}} brewing beer by infusion and <b>decoction</b> technologies of <b>mash</b> production in microbreweries. Samples of two microbrewery beers are compared, namely Richard beer (Brno-Žebětín) produced {{in a double}} mash manner appropriate for the Czech brewing type, and beer samples taken at the laboratory microbrewery of Mendel University in Brno (MENDELU), where beer is produced in a simpler and less energy – demanding infusion method. At all the beer samples the basic analytical parameters of real extract, ethanol content, degree of fermentation and the extract of original hopped wort were measured using an automatic beer analyzer. The results {{coming out of the}} automatic beer analyzer are compared with the results of the beer samples analysis performed by liquid chromatography, by which the contents of oligosaccharides, maltose, glycerol and ethanol were measured. Both methods provide a number of analytical results for the comparison of decoction and infusion techniques, and analytical characteristics of both the brewing procedures. Emphasis is placed on statistical data processing and comparison of different types of beer and particular brews between each other, both in terms of production technology as well as beer sampling throughout the year...|$|R

50|$|The fruit-juice {{is used as}} a {{febrifuge}} and diuretic. The {{roots are}} well-known febrifuge on the Ivory Coast, being sometimes used with leaves of Ximenia, Premna hispida, Ficus sp., and Alchornea. They are pulped, boiled in water, and drunk, or used as a lotion or for baths. The bark {{is used as a}} purgative and in local applications for leprosy (Kerharo and Bouquet). The bark decoction is used for severe cough, causing relief through vomiting. The dry pulverized bark is applied as a dressing to the circumcision wound. The bark contains a certain amount of tannin. A <b>decoction</b> of the <b>mashed</b> leaves is used by the Ibos (Nigeria) for washing a swollen face. The leaves, ground with sugar, are rubbed on the mouth and gums. A leaf infusion is a common cough remedy or used as a laxative for fever with constipation. A leaf decoction is used for gonorrhea. The leaves with the leaves of Vitex quinata and Terminalia avicennoides, are used on the Ivory Coast for fresh wounds preventing inflammation. All these leaves are used for leprosy. Crushed with lemon they are effective for worms in children. With Alchornea leaves and lemon a gargle is made from the leaves. They are crushed to obtain the juice. A decoction of pounded leaves is used as an eye lotion and the juice pressed from young, warm leaves is given to children for stomach troubles. The young leaves are used as an infusion taken internally or as a warm astringent lotion by women in confinement in Sierra Leone. In the Congo the young leaves pounded to a frothy pulp are used as a bed for paralytics, who are then massaged with them to the accompaninent of incantations.In Suriname's traditional medicine, the infusion of the leaves is used as a treatment of eye inflammation, diarrhea and venereal diseases.|$|R
