5|$|Immediately {{after the}} coup, {{officers}} loyal to Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces, being imprisoned alongside Umran at Mezze prison. One {{of the first}} acts of Jadid's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence. Assad however, {{did not support the}} coup, and told Mansur al-Atrash, Jubran Majdalani, and other Aflaqites that he did not support Jadid's actions. Later, in an interview with Le Monde, Assad claimed that the military's intervention was regrettable because the Ba'ath Party was democratic, and that the disputes should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>resolved</b> in a democratic manner. However, Assad did view the actions as necessary, as it put an end, in his view, to the dictatorship of the National Command.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>resolved</b> while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E

5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>resolved,</b> the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's empennage failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in control authority. In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, the rotor hub failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was repairable, but it would be a year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again.|$|E
5|$|As with so {{many other}} parts of the myth, the {{resolution}} is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>resolved</b> into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.|$|E

There was a further attempt to dismiss Moscoe in January 2000, but this came to nothing.|$|E

25|$|Dudley Tunnel {{was popular}} with tourists, and was {{mentioned}} is guides to Dudley Castle written by The Rev. Luke Booker in 1825 and W. Harris is 1845. There were complaints that the tunnel was often blocked by unattended limestone boats, but this problem seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>resolved</b> by 1799, {{although there is}} no mention of how this was achieved. The tunnel was also affected by subsidence from local coal mining, and was regularly closed to allow repairs to be made. Working a loaded boat through the tunnel took about 4 hours, and this caused congestion. Various ways were considered to alleviate this, including rope haulage in 1840, but the cost of £6,000 was deemed to be too expensive. Subsidence in the Lapal tunnel was worse, and it was closed twice in 1801, and for four months in 1805.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} Jon Heyman listed the sale price at $570 million. At least one group whose {{approval}} was needed, Monarch Alternative Capital, {{refused to sign}} off on the sale. Monarch Alternative Capital, which purchased a portion of Hicks Sports Group's debt after HSG defaulted, believed Hicks passed up on a better purchase deal from Jim Crane, who was speculated by the December 29 email to have made a higher offer. The reported gap between creditors demands and payment offered by HSG was $270 million and $300 million and would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>resolved</b> if the amount Hicks was to receive from the land sale was lowered to increase the creditors for the debt. MLB's commissioner, Bud Selig, expressed his interest in the deal being approved by the creditors no later than April 9, 2010, and indicated that MLB could become more directly involved in the sale process.|$|E
25|$|From 2003 to 2009, the United Kingdom has had 37 {{cumulative}} {{cases of}} British nationals being abducted to Japan by a parent, {{none of which}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>resolved.</b> For a yearly figure, The Guardian newspaper reported that, for 2008 alone, there are 336 cases and estimated 470 children were abducted from the UK and taken abroad illegally, an increase of 20% from 2005 figures. Pakistan (30 cases) top the list followed by the US (23), Ireland (22) and Spain (21). Other abduction hotspots included Australia, France and Egypt. The cases of international parental abduction are not well published in U.K. due to reporting restrictions that apply to any cases involving the welfare of minors. However, the Guardian provided anecdotal evidence. A reporter attended a day in London family court. Eight out of 14 cases heard involved child abduction, which may indicate {{that the problem is}} widespread. 40% (134 out of the 336) of international abductions in 2008 involve countries that are not signatories to the Hague Convention. These include Bangladesh, Russia, Iraq and Nigeria. Moreover, the problem is expected to worsen as immigration and international marriage become common. Moreover, The Independent newspaper cites the Reunite International Child Abduction Centre which claims that 43% of parental abductions involve ethnic minority children taken abroad and often forced to marry. Moreover, cultural complicity, collusion and shame mean that many cases go unreported.|$|E
