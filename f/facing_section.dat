40|$|Historically, it {{has been}} {{believed}} that Christian formation occurs primarily {{in the context of}} worship. Because both traditional and contemporary worship services are routinely structured around the skills of persuasive rhetoric and logic, most worship services effectively ignore the impact of experiential, embodied knowledge. Recent research in neuroscience has proven that humans are sensory-motor-emotional-thinking beings who learn best when body, brain, and emotions are simultaneously engaged. A fresh paradigm for teaching, brain-based leaning, is proving to result in learning that is more memorable, more likely to result in long-term change in the behavior of the learner, and more likely to spur the learner to investigate the subject further. The Church needs to employ brain-based teaching methods in order to more effectively transmit the Gospel. This dissertation will concentrate on the use of such methods during worship services. Section 1 describes the discipling crisis the Church is presently <b>facing.</b> <b>Section</b> 2 describes discipling methods that have been and are currently being used. Section 3 describes and proposes the use of brain-based teaching methods as a more formative approach. Section 4 describes the artifact, a non-fiction book written to inform those who plan worship about the theory, use, and benefits of brain-based teaching, It describes how the methods can be employed throughout the worship service. Section 5 consists of the book proposal. Section 6 is the postscript. Section 7 is the artifact itself...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{will explore}} appropriate methodology for reinvigorating the Greater Ohio District of The Wesleyan Church {{by creating a}} new paradigm of mission and multiplication. Statistics show there is a declining number of congregations in The Wesleyan Church of North America, and specifically, within the Greater Ohio District. Local churches are being closed at a rapid rate and multi-faceted congregational multiplication is needed to replace these lost congregations and restore missional presence. The narrative of the District is one of fear, fatigue, and closed-mindedness; discriminatory against church multiplication due to nearly two decades of perceived failed attempts which resulted in massive financial losses and indebtedness. If the district is to survive and increase in presence, ministry, and mission, new congregations are needed. This can happen through multiple avenues, but this dissertation will make the claim {{that there must be}} an infusion of a new paradigm that will change the narrative of the District; that through biblical imperative, theological re-alignment, and a new missionally driven strategy, the declining District can be resuscitated and existing congregations can individually and collectively advance God’s Kingdom through birthing new congregations. Section 1 describes the crisis the District (and denomination) is presently <b>facing.</b> <b>Section</b> 2 will explore the practices and beliefs which can be, have been, or are currently being employed to rectify this crisis. Section 3 will describe the need for theological realignment and a synthesis of best practices for producing a paradigm of mission and multiplication which the author believes to be readily adaptable and ultimately effective for changing the narrative of Greater Ohio. These practices have been verified by the author’s extensive research of five districts within The Wesleyan Church in which this type of cultural shift is taking place. Sections 4 and 5 describe the artifact for the dissertation. This is a website specifically designed to help facilitate the goal of infusing a new paradigm for mission and multiplication into the District. Section 6 is the postscript in which the author will describe his journey in the development of this paper and expected results for the thoughts outlined in the thesis. Finally, the artifact is presented as described in sections 4 and 5...|$|E

In this study we localized the site and the cells {{that are responsible for}} {{the synthesis of}} murine dermal elastic fibers. SKH- 1 hairless mice were irradiated with UVB and the skin removed for light microscopy, electron microscopy, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and biochemical studies. In response to chronic low doses of UVB there was an initial moderate increase in tropoelastin mRNA in the papillary dermis. By contrast, there was a continuous marked elevation of collagen α 1 (I) message localizing to sites of inflammatory cell influx throughout the upper and lower dermis. After 25 wk of UV irradiation there was a 2 -fold increase in skin elastin, yet total collagen remained unchanged. Serial desmosine analysis from en <b>face</b> <b>sections</b> indicated the increase in elastin content was due to dermal elastic fibers, an increase in the size and number of the dermal cysts, and an increase in subpanniculus elastic fibers. Elastin stains of en <b>face</b> <b>sections</b> suggested that the elastic fibers in the upper dermis were exclusively derived from cells lining the epithelial root sheath and sebaceous glands. In response to UV irradiation, the elastic fibers increased in number and size, wrapping around these structures and aligning in both directions as long fibers parallel to the body axis. Electron micrographs indicated that modified epithelial cells in close proximity to the flattened epithelial cells that encircled the root sheath and sebaceous glands were the source of the elastic fibers...|$|R
