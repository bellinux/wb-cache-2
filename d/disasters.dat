5|$|At the October 13, 1992 Wrestling Challenge taping, Money Inc. faced The Natural <b>Disasters</b> in {{a rematch}} for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The match {{originally}} pitted the <b>Disasters</b> against the Nasty Boys, {{who were also}} managed by Hart, {{but at the last}} minute, Hart replaced them with Money Inc. Because of this, the Nasty Boys split with Hart and attacked Money Inc. before the match. Later on, the Headshrinkers interfered on behalf of Money Inc. and helped DiBiase make Earthquake submit to the Million Dollar Dream, thereby winning Money Inc. the Championship. After the match, the Nasty Boys again attacked Jimmy Hart. At the 1992 Survivor Series on November 25, Money Inc. and the Beverly Brothers faced the Nasty Boys and the Natural <b>Disasters</b> in an 8-man elimination tag team match. During the match, Money Inc. eliminated the Natural <b>Disasters,</b> but Jerry Sags of the Nasty Boys then pinned I.R.S. to win the match. This was the only major victory The Nasty Boys got over Money Inc., as they failed to win the tag team title in several shots on television and at house shows in late 1992 into early 1993.|$|E

30|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper explores local people’s knowledge on <b>disaster</b> risk reduction (DRR). Altogether, 124 local people from 18 to 74 years of age from randomly selected 19 districts of Nepal were interviewed focusing on various questions on <b>disaster</b> information, <b>disaster</b> knowledge, <b>disaster</b> readiness, <b>disaster</b> awareness, <b>disaster</b> adaptation, and <b>disaster</b> risk perception. The collected response data were statistically analyzed using histogram and independent sample t-tests to examine the DRR knowledge of people. An independent t-test analysis (Table 1) suggests that there is no statistically significant gender-based difference in <b>disaster</b> knowledge, <b>disaster</b> readiness, <b>disaster</b> awareness, and <b>disaster</b> risk perception of the surveyed people. <b>Disaster</b> adaptation capacity of the local people was evaluated and more than 60 percent of the respondents were determined to adapt state of <b>disaster</b> in the community.|$|R

30|$|To examine overall DRR {{knowledge}} of local people, histogram analysis, bivariate correlations and independent sample t-tests was conducted. Basically, the descriptive analyses helped {{to examine the}} relationship between <b>disaster</b> risk reduction initiatives of government of Nepal and the local people’s knowledge on DRR. Five key DRR issues were considered in our analysis: <b>disaster</b> knowledge, <b>disaster</b> readiness, <b>disaster</b> awareness, <b>disaster</b> adaptation, and <b>disaster</b> risk perception. Responses in these key issues were also evaluated with histogram analyses. A series of independent sample t-tests were also conducted to examine the effects of gender and <b>disaster</b> events. For this purpose, the five responses (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly agree, and I do not know) were rephrased. For example, if a respondent responded strongly agree for all five DRR issues, it was considered that he/she well understood of the <b>disaster</b> knowledge, he/she was very ready to tackle the state of <b>disaster,</b> he/she is well aware for <b>disaster</b> risks, he/she can well adapt state of <b>disaster</b> and he/she is well perceived <b>disaster</b> risk. Similarly, if a respondent responded strongly disagree for all five DRR issues; it was considered that he/she has no idea of the <b>disaster</b> knowledge, <b>disaster</b> readiness, <b>disaster</b> awareness, <b>disaster</b> adaptation and <b>disaster</b> risk perception.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a tag team elimination match, in which The Natural <b>Disasters</b> (Earthquake and Typhoon) teamed with the Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobbs) to face Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake). The rules stated that when any man was eliminated, his tag team partner {{would also be}} eliminated. Blake Beverly and Typhoon began the match, but Beau and Earthquake soon entered the ring as well. The Natural <b>Disasters</b> gained control of the match by attacking Blake Beverly, and the Nasty Boys entered the ring to assist the <b>Disasters.</b> Blake attacked Sags and tagged out of the match. Beau entered but was bodyslammed by Sags; Sags got distracted, however, which allowed Beau to suplex him and bring DiBiase into the match. Money Inc. took turns attacking Sags until Earthquake entered the ring. Earthquake performed an Earthquake splash by sitting on Beau Beverly to pin him and eliminate both Beverly Brothers. Earthquake fought DiBiase, but both men eventually left the ring and were replaced by their partners. Typhoon performed a splash on Schyster but was tripped by DiBiase. Schyster pinned Typhoon to eliminate The Natural <b>Disasters.</b> While Schyster was celebrating, Sags quickly pinned him to win the match for the Nasty Boys.|$|E

After decomposing the anomaly signals of precipitation and undulating signals of agriculture drought condition, four IMF components were obtained respectively. According to Guangdong’s practical situations, the four components can be interpreted to be four fluctuating cycles: light-disaster, medium <b>disaster,</b> heavy <b>disaster,</b> mega <b>disaster.</b> Their quasi-periods are: Light <b>disaster</b> for three years, medium <b>disaster</b> for 5 - 7 years, heavy <b>disaster</b> for 13 - 15 years and 26 - 28 years for mega <b>disaster.</b> To predict the next few years of drought in Guangdong province by the change cycles of medium <b>disaster,</b> heavy <b>disaster</b> and mega <b>disaster,</b> the results are as follows: medium <b>disaster</b> will happen between 2009 and 2011 and probably in 2010; heavy <b>disaster</b> will happen between 2017 and 2019 and probably in 2018; mega <b>disaster</b> will happen between 2030 and 2032, and probably in 2031...|$|R

30|$|In the <b>disaster</b> risk {{reduction}} approach, however, leaders {{are expected to}} do more than just respond to an emergency. This approach to <b>disaster</b> management emerged with the HFA in 2005. It strives to create a safe and sustainably growing city by means of reducing <b>disaster</b> risk and building resilience for the city. To achieve the goals of minimizing <b>disaster</b> risk and increasing resilience, local government leaders need to ensure that the following priorities of action are fully implemented and continually maintained: ensuring that <b>disaster</b> {{risk reduction}} is a priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation; identifying, assessing, and monitoring <b>disaster</b> risks and enhancing early warning; using knowledge, innovation and education to build a culture of safety and resilience; reducing the underlying risk factors; and strengthening <b>disaster</b> preparedness for effective response (UNISDR 2005). In the 2015 Sendai Framework these priorities of action were adjusted to accelerate the progress of <b>disaster</b> risk reduction and resilience building. These new priorities of action include: understanding <b>disaster</b> risk; strengthening <b>disaster</b> risk governance to manage <b>disaster</b> risk; investing in <b>disaster</b> risk reduction for resilience; and enhancing <b>disaster</b> preparedness for effective response and to “Build Back Better” in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (UNISDR 2015).|$|R
