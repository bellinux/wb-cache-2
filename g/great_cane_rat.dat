40|$|Biometrical {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out on 23 biometrical parameters of the testes and epididymis of the domesticated adult African <b>great</b> <b>cane</b> <b>rat</b> (Thryonomys swinderianus), {{also known as the}} grasscutter. The average weight and age of the cane rats used in the study were 1. 93 ± 0. 42 kg and 18. 80 ± 1. 39 months respectively, with an average testicular size of 18. 75 x 11. 33 mm. The average weights of the right and left testes were 1. 18 ± 0. 17 g and 1. 13 0. 16 g respectively, with a significant dif-ference (p< 0. 05). The average weights of the right and left epididymis were 0. 32 g ad 0. 30 g respectively, with no significant difference (p< 0. 05). There was a strong positive correla-tion (r = 0. 8214) between the age of the rats and the weight of the testes and epididymis. The average percentage body weights for the testes and epididymis were 0. 12 % and 0. 03 % respectively. Unlike testicular parameters, {{there was no significant difference}} (p< 0. 05) between the right and left epididymal param-eters. The results showed that the testes and epididymis of the cane rat are relatively small-er than those of comparable rodents. This work provides baseline data on the biometry of the testes and epididymis of the African great cane rats, thereby making available data useful in comparative regional anatomy and reproductive biology...|$|E

In males the ventral point of first incisor alveolus {{tends to be more}} cranial, whereas the mental foramen presented a more caudal displacement in females, which moreover demonstrated a more slender mandible. Main biomechanical points (mandibular ramus flexure) showed no differences between genders. It may be concluded that morphological differences the in the mandible of both sexes of T. swinderianus are not due to a functional reasons, as masticatory behaviour would be.

40|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>cane</b> <b>rat,</b> Thryonomys swinderianus, {{utilizes}} high fibrous {{plant material}} {{and is an}} important meat source in West Africa. An insight in its digestive physiology will enhance our understanding of its feeding habits. Digestibility coefficients of the food were determined during two seasons before the animals were euthanased. The distribution and concentrations of nutrients and energy {{in different parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract were determined at the time of day when animals practised coprophagy. Trial 1 diet in the wet season consisted of 36 % neutral detergent fibre (NDF), 11 % protein and 49 % dry matter, while the Trial 2 diet in the dry season consisted of 53 % NDF, 8 – 9 % protein and 89 % dry matter. The Trial 2 animals on the poor diet increased their daily nutrient intake, possibly increased the volume of digesta and practised frequently cophrophagy, so that faecal production was reduced and digestibility coefficients were relatively high. Coprophagy increased both protein and energy intake as soft pellets in the distal colon had higher protein and energy content than the hard faeces. Energy, protein and acid-detergent fibre were retained in the caecum of Trial 1 females and the caecum and proximal colon of the Trial 2 animals 16 hours after feeding, illustrating the importance of these two regions in the fermentation process. Water was absorbed in the distal colon as dry matter content of digesta increased 53 %, 4 % and 56 % from the proximal colon to the distal colon. Animals produced hard faeces with only 16 % and 5 % lower moisture content in the dry season, compared to that produced in the wet season, as water was not a limiting factor during the trials. It was concluded that an increase in daily food intake, an increase in coprophagy and the presence of a colonic separation mechanism (that retains small particles) enable the <b>greater</b> <b>cane</b> <b>rat</b> to utilize high fibrous plant material. These digestive strategies seem to be comparable to those observed in other hystricomorph rodents...|$|R

40|$|Pyramidal {{cells are}} characterised by {{markedly}} different sized dendritic trees, branching patterns and spine density across the cortical mantle. Moreover, pyramidal cells {{have been shown}} to differ in structure among homologous cortical areas in different species; however, most of these studies have been conducted in primates. Whilst pyramidal cells have been quantified in a few cortical areas in some other species there are, as yet, no uniform comparative data on pyramidal cell structure in a homologous cortical area among species in different Orders. Here we studied layer III pyramidal cells in V 1 of three species of rodents, the <b>greater</b> <b>cane</b> <b>rat,</b> highveld gerbil and four-striped mouse, by the same methodology used to sample data from layer III pyramidal cells in primates. The data reveal markedly different trends between rodents and primates: there is an appreciable increase in the size, branching complexity and number of spines in the dendritic trees of pyramidal cells with increasing size of V 1 in the brain in rodents, whereas there is relatively little difference in primates. Moreover, pyramidal cells in rodents are larger, more branched and more spinous than those in primates. For example, the dendritic trees of pyramidal cells in V 1 of the <b>cane</b> <b>rat</b> are nearly three times larger, and have more than ten times the number of spines in their basal dendritic trees, than those in V 1 of the macaque (7900 and 600, respectively), which has a V 1 40 times the size that of the <b>cane</b> <b>rat.</b> It remains to be determined to what extent these differences may result from developmental differences or reflect evolutionary and/or processing specializations...|$|R

50|$|The {{most diverse}} class of prey {{in the diet}} as known are mammals, with over 90 {{mammalian}} prey species reported. In the Cape Province, the 2.1 kg cape hare (Lepus capensis) reportedly dominates the prey selection, comprising about 53% of the foods selected. Other lagomorphs, namely the slightly smaller Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupestris), mildly larger African savanna hare (Lepus microtis) and the much larger 3.6 kg scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), are not infrequently taken both in {{and outside of the}} Cape area, but lagomorphs are not typically the main prey elsewhere. For the most part rodents are ignored as prey as they are probably too small despite martial eagles taking at times appreciable numbers of Cape (Xerus inauris) and unstriped ground squirrels (Xerus rutilus). However, rodents selected as prey have ranged in size from the 0.14 kg Southern African vlei rat (Otomys irroratus) to the 3.04 kg South African springhare (Pedetes capensis) and the 4 kg <b>greater</b> <b>cane</b> <b>rat</b> (Thryonomys swinderianus). There are records of predation on 0.28 kg (the second largest African bat) straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and galagos of various sizes (usually weighing a kilo or less) but otherwise mammalian prey they pursue tends to be relatively larger.Locally, large numbers are taken of any species of hyrax. The attractiveness of hyraxes as a prey resource may encourage martial eagles to vary their hunting techniques to potentially more time-consuming perch hunting so that they may capture rock hyraxes from rock formations and tree hyraxes from trees, contrary to their usual preference for capturing prey {{on the ground in the}} open after soaring high. Ranging in average mass from 2.2 to 3.14 kg, hyraxes can comprise a healthy meal for a family of martial eagle and are probably among the larger items that male eagles will regularly deliver to nests. Another miscellaneous mammal known to fall prey to martial eagles is the ground pangolin (Smutsia temminckii), although it is not clear the age pangolins that are preyed on and how they are dispatched, considering that adults weigh some 11.6 kg and have a hard keratin shell that is capable of withstanding lion (Panthera leo) jaws when in its rolled-up defensive posture. Although far less accomplished and prolific as a predator of monkeys than the crowned eagle, the martial eagle has been known to prey on at least 14 species of monkey. The monkeys to turn up most often as martial eagle prey are grivets (Chlorocebus aethiops), vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and malbroucks (Chlorocebus cynosuros), with mean body masses of 2.8 kg, 4.12 kg and 4.53 kg, respectively, because of their savanna-woods dwelling habits, tendencies to forage on the ground and their primarily diurnal activity. Similarly, the larger Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), at 8.13 kg, also dwells in similar habitats and so may be subject to occasional predaceous attacks. There’s evidence that these monkey species have specific alarm calls, distinct from those uttered in response to the presence of a leopard (Panthera pardus) for example, specifically for martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to prey on mangabeys, Cercopithecus sp., colobus monkeys and guerezas, presumably around forest clearings, but these are probably quantitatively rare as prey given their forest-dwelling habits. Predatory attacks by martial eagles have been reported as well for every species of baboon, although either mostly or entirely on young ones, and even on young chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). It has been claimed that juvenile monkeys are the most often selected as prey by martial eagles, even for species as small as vervet monkeys but little comprehensive analysis is known on this (the most accomplished primate predator, the crowned eagle, in Uganda, selects adult monkeys 52% of the time, juveniles 48% of the time). On the hand, at times, martial eagles may at times be able to dispatch adult male monkeys weighing 9 kg or more, such as patas monkeys and Tana River mangabeys (Cercocebus galeritus), in seldom cases.|$|R
