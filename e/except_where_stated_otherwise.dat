5|$|While {{inflation}} has eroded away {{the achievements of}} most films from the 1960s and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises, James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners {{in an era of}} much higher individual ticket prices. When properly adjusted for inflation, however, on that comparative scale Gone with the Wind—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis provides a methodology {{for use in}} addressing {{whether or not the}} Department of Defense should alter {{the way in which it}} distributes medications to eligible beneficiaries. The possibility of providing centralized mail-order services as a means of filling prescriptions for maintenance medications is examined. Two major trade-offs are involved. First, the creatior. of Kail Service Pharmacies (MSF) will provide better services to eligible beneficiaries, including those previously lacking access to prescription services. This will lead to increased demand and costs. A method is provided for determining demand and the cost of medications required to support this demand. Second, the addition of mail-order services may require large capital expenditures for facilities and equipment. The trade-off is system-wide savings in inventory and related costs resulting from the consolidation of prescription dispensing services. MSP system alternatives are examined using a net present value approach. Examples are hypothetical <b>except</b> <b>where</b> <b>stated</b> <b>otherwise.</b> [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

Signature Date Spoken dialogue systems accessed over the telephone network are rapidly becoming more popular {{as a means to}} reduce call-centre costs and improve customer experience. It is now technologically feasible to delegate repetitive and relatively simple tasks conducted in most telephone calls to automatic systems. Such a system uses speech recognition to take input from users. This work focuses on the speech generation component that a specific prototype system uses to convey audible speech output back to the user. Many commercial systems contain general text-to-speech synthesisers. Text-to-speech synthesis is a very active branch of speech processing. It aims to build machines that read text aloud. In some languages this has been a reality for almost two decades. While these synthesisers are often very understandable, they almost never sound natural. Th...|$|E

You will need to prepare the following in advance Tissue Protoplasts are best isolated from young protonemal tissue obtained from cellophane-overlay plates. It {{is very difficult to}} obtain protoplasts from gametophyte tissue. The Leeds lab. use tissue cultured on BCD + ammonium (using cellophane overlays) for 6 days at 25 o in continuous light. This gives about 500 mg fresh weight of tissue per plate. 5 - 6 day old tissue is optimal, and usually yields 2 - 4 ¥ 106 protoplast per plate of tissue. Older tissue may leave clumps of undigested tissue, which can act like glue and stick protoplasts together. One plate of tissue usually yields sufficient protoplasts to carry out 3 transformations.
