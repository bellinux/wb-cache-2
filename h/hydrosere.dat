40|$|Five Natura 2000 {{areas are}} located in Laag Holland. These areas than become {{subjected}} to the Nature Conservation Act, the current condition and possible negative effects from surrounding activities, therefore have to be assessed. As {{the focus of the}} government is on nitrogen, the nitrogen load in this area will be assess based on literature, expert knowledge and modelling. In Laag Holland the habitat type’s Wet heath and Transition mire are the nitrogen sensitive habitat types. The current nitrogen load is too high for vegetation development. Nitrogen reaches the system by surface water, atmospheric deposition and mineralization. The nitrogen load of the surface water, in addition to the phosphate and sulphate load, is too high for the initiation of new <b>hydroseres.</b> Local sources contribute to the nitrogen deposition, agricultural emissions contributes for 33 % to the average nitrogen deposition and up to 70 % of the average ammonia deposition. Road traffic contributes less, on average less than 5 %, but this can increase locally up to 25 %, of the total deposition. Industry contributes on average as well as locally less than 5 % to the total nitrogen deposition. 	 Source and effect related measures can be taken to reduce the nitrogen load or negative effects of nitrogen. However for long term conservation generic and European policies are needed to reduce the deposition load a nature reserves. Balancing of deposition is only a temporary solution as eventually the deposition has to decrease to the critical loads. The mineralization can be reduced by increased water supply with water low in nutrient concentrations, the effect of salinity only seems to be temporarily...|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} a <b>hydrosere</b> is Loch a' Mhuilin, located on the Isle of Arran, Scotland. This small lake lies behind a ridge of {{material}} deposited {{towards the end of}} the last Ice Age. The lake exhibits characteristic features of a <b>hydrosere,</b> the succession from a fresh water surface with small pioneer plant species to a sub-climax vegetation of alder and willow. The climax vegetation of oak and beech woodland has not been achieved due to the impact of human activities of clearing grazing land, as well as grazing by red deer and rabbits.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hydrosere</b> is a plant {{succession}} {{which occurs}} {{in an area}} of fresh water such as in oxbow lakes and kettle lakes. In time, an area of open freshwater will naturally dry out, ultimately becoming woodland. During this change, a range of different landtypes such as swamp and marsh will succeed each other.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrosere</b> is {{the primary}} {{succession}} sequence which develops in aquatic environments such as lakes and ponds. It results in conversion of water body and its community into a land community. The early changes are allogenic as inorganic particles such as sand and clay are washed from catchment areas and begin filling the basin of the water body. Later, remains of dead plants also fill up these bodies and contribute to further changes in the environment.|$|E
5000|$|The reserve, {{which is}} {{adjacent}} to Marbury Country Park, contains {{a range of}} habitats, with the reedbed, carr woodland and semi-natural broadleaved woodland demonstrating the various stages of <b>hydrosere</b> succession (a gradual change from open water to woodland). The open water contains a rich selection of plants, including water lilies, and provides valuable feeding and breeding habitat for kingfishers, little grebes and great crested grebes. The reedbed is almost exclusively composed of common reed and is a residence for summer birds such as reed and sedge warblers. In recent years the reedbed {{has been used as}} an over-wintering site by bittern, and the trust manages the reedbed for this secretive heron by cutting glades through the reeds to allow better feeding opportunities. The diminutive and shy lesser spotted woodpecker has also been seen occasionally in the reserve’s woodlands.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2007. Major: Water {{resources}} science. Advisor: Dr. Leonard C. Ferrington Jr. 2 {{computer files}} (PDF). Hardwood Creek is located {{northeast of the}} Twin Cities Metropolitan Area near Hugo, Minnesota. Upper portions of the stream {{have a long history}} of ditching that has substantially modified the flow regime and physical structure of the stream channel. Ditching has occurred at different intervals along segments of the stream, resulting in a mosaic of segments at varied stages of regression back to more normal channel structure in terms of sinuosity, habitat heterogeneity, and profile. Ditching is a physical disturbance to streams and is expected to modify stream habitats. Sites which have never been ditched, or have not been ditched recently, are expected to have greater habitat heterogeneity when compared to recently ditched sites. As a result, traditional sampling methods may not provide an accurate estimate of taxa richness. Dipnet (DN) and chironomid surface-floating pupal exuviae (SFPE) methods were employed to capture both chironomid and non-chironomid macroinvertebrates. The SFPE method detected more taxa over the entire project and on a site-to-site basis for both chironomid and non-chironomid taxa. For chironomids collected in June, the DN method was most effective across all sites, but at disturbed sites there was no difference between methods. In addition, the SFPE method exclusively collected 1. 2 to 8. 8 times as many non-chironomid macroinvertebrates, on a site-to-site basis, as the DN method. A separate analysis found the SFPE method exclusively collected twice as many chironomid genera as the DN method. To obtain a comprehensive estimate of taxa richness in ditches, all macroinvertebrates collected in SFPE samples need to be evaluated in conjunction with DN samples. The a priori test of the IDH to account for the longitudinal patterns of macroinvertebrate biodiversity, as a function of ditching-related disturbance, was also examined. The IDH was tested at the community, order, and family level to determine whether different levels of taxonomic scale would reveal differing levels of congruence with the IDH. I found the model does not account for the patterns of species richness and diversity, with the exception of one order and three families, the IDH was rejected. As a consequence of the IDH being rejected, a posteriori models were employed in an attempt to explain community composition in Hardwood Creek. The River Continuum Concept (RCC) was tested by analyzing the macroinvertebrate community using three similarity indices to test eight hypotheses. P-values ranged from 0. 488 to 0. 957 leading to the acceptance of all eight null hypotheses. The similarities of communities of adjacent sites did not conform to the prediction of the RCC that sites adjacent to each other should have the most similar community compositions. The failure to explain community composition patterns in Hardwood Creek led to the testing of more a posteriori models, hydroseres and management categories. Eight taxa were associated with a single <b>hydrosere.</b> Similarity indices generally supported the validity of the <b>hydrosere</b> classification based upon time since the last dredging event. However, the <b>hydrosere</b> models failed to explain patterns of taxa richness for most taxa. An alternative classification based on 303 d listing considerations and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) management strategies was also investigated. Based on this classification, the number of taxa at upstream and downstream sites was not significantly different. However, similarity indices generally supported the upstream and downstream management reaches. Poor water quality, substrate stability, and differences in aquatic vegetation among sample sites are probably the most important factors confounded with ditching in Hardwood C reek. The confounding factors likely played a role in the limited success of IDH, RCC, <b>hydrosere,</b> and management models to explain patterns of macroinvertebrate community composition in Hardwood Creek...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{hydrology}} {{and temperature}} can induce rapid changes in boreal wetland ecosystems. Factors such as <b>hydrosere,</b> permafrost, climate and human interference may disturb the prevailing mire vegetation, whereby a new dominant assemblage can develop. At {{the transition from}} one vegetation type to another, the old vegetation may be suppressed, die out or start to decay, and some time may pass until a new mire vegetation is fully established. Here, we demonstrate that diatoms may thrive during such transitions, creating isolated and shallow peat layers with significantly elevated biogenic silica content. Biogenic silica and other nutrients {{that would otherwise be}} lost during mineralization in runoff are in this way retained in the ecosystem. Our results imply that silica storage originating from diatoms can be expected to increase in today’s rapidly changing boreal wetlands. The impacts on transport of Si through boreal watersheds are currently unknown...|$|E
40|$|This {{mosaic of}} 20 pools and a scrape created in November 2012 {{is still in}} the first or {{migration}} stage of the <b>hydrosere</b> 1.

40|$|The {{study of}} plant {{succession}} {{provides information on}} vegetation dynamics of a region and, therefore, improves {{our understanding of the}} natural trends of present ecosystems. With this objective, plant succession based on palynology of a sediment profile in a swamp forest was studied on the Lower Northeast Slope of Serra Geral, Rio Grande do Sul. Samples were treated with HCl, HF, KOH and acetolysis; slides were mounted in glycerol-jelly. For each sample a minimum of 500 grains of pollen + pteridophyte and bryophyte spores was counted and other palynomorphs were counted in parallel. Tilia and Tilia Graph software were used to construct percentage and concentration diagrams, with three 14 C datings. The results show a local water reservoir {{in the beginning of the}} Holocene (± 9800 yrs.

40|$|In {{the years}} 1954 - 1957 The Foundation for Biocenological Research (Stichting tot Onderzoek van Levensgemeenschappen, S. O. L.) carried out an {{extensive}} {{study on the}} vegetation of about 125 former river beds in the Netherlands. They were situated along the great rivers and their branches, viz. Meuse, Oude Maas (“Old Meuse”), Heusdense Maas (“Heusden Meuse”), Rhine, Lek, Merwede, Waal and IJsel. The work {{was made possible by}} a grant of the Netherlands Organisation for Pure Research (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Zuiver Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, Z. W. O.). Dr. M. F. Mözer Bruijns proposed and supervised the investigation, and Dr. V. Westhoff took part in the interpretation of the results. The field work was carried out by A. J. Quené-Boterenbrood (1954 - 55), W. A. E. van Donselaar-ten Bokkel Huinink (1955 - 56), J. van Donselaar (1955 — 57), Ir. L. G. Kop (1956 - 57), P. J. Schroevers (1954 - 55) and E. E. van der Voo (1954 - 57). Our study had several aims. The collected material had to contribute to our knowledge of a number of plant species and communities, especially of those playing a part in the <b>hydrosere</b> found in various kinds of water. With respect to the communities it should comprise their floristic composition as well as a definition of their habitat. Moreover, the former river beds should be classified according to their plant communities as well as to their abiotical properties. This classification should be useful as a basis for the choice of future naturereserves (see Gorter and Westhoff, 1952; Van Donselaar, 1956; Westhoff and Leentvaar, 1957) ...|$|E
40|$|Water level {{fluctuations}} (WLF) can {{be important}} disturbances promoting {{the diversity of}} riparian plant communities, but are currently absent from many managed aquatic ecosystems. A lack of WLF is thought to reduce plant diversity and hamper <b>hydrosere</b> succession. However, a positive impact of WLF on plant diversity may crucially depend on nutrient availability {{and the presence of}} a potential ecosystem engineer, the floating plant Strati otes abides, that may provide structural support to riparian plants. We tested the interactive effects of 40 cm flooding, presence of S. abides and sediment nutrient availability (N and P) on growth and horizontal expansion of eight wetland plant species in a 10 week experiment. Seven out of eight species showed a significant elongation response to flooding. Compared to stagnant water levels, flooding in combination with high nutrient availability decreased horizontal expansion in two short species and increased it in two tall species, whereas flooding decreased horizontal expansion in two other short species under both nutrient levels. In this 10 week experiment, we observed no effect of S. abides on the measured plant parameters. This experiment shows short-term negative effects of flooding on most of the short species. On the long-term, we hypothesize that improvements in water quality and seedling recruitment due to drawdown may result in net positive effects of WLF in the riparian zone, but as the species that were rare in the field happened to be short, care should be taken to maintain rare species when allowing more WLF.

40|$|Many rare {{plant species}} occur in Dutch wet dune slacks, {{particularly}} in the Junco baltici-Schoenetum nigricantis. For nature management {{it is important to}} understand the processes controlling the presence of these basiphilous early successional communities, which is why we investigated vegetation and soil development during succession in coastal dune slacks. We compared 12 chronosequential stages of 0, 2, 4, 9, 10, 13, 25, 30, 43, 60, 70 and 85 yr in five different dune slack systems. In four of these locations turf had earlier been removed in order to restore the basiphilous pioneer stage. The main variation in the vegetation is related to the acidification/soil enrichment gradient and the salinity/maritime gradient. During succession, organic matter accumulates and acidification takes place. Maritime influence can buffer the soil and postpone the succession of basiphilous pioneer communities for many years. A significant correlation with age was found for 18 variables. Multiple regressions predicted changes in the vegetation (dependent variables: biomass, cover of Salix repens, Calamagrostis epigejos and Schoenus nigricans) as a function of acidification, organic matter accumulation, increase in available P and presence of Na in the soil. We conclude that natural ageing of the vegetation and the associated process of accumulation of biomass drive succession in this <b>hydrosere.</b> The underlying soil processes are acidification and organic matter accumulation. During succession dominance shifts from S. nigricans to S. repens or C. epigejos. Maintenance of the pioneer character of the habitat is only possible by local intervention or by natural or man-induced dune forming. The effect of sod-stripping depends on the environmental conditions and, in case of acidification, success is limited. Succession can be postponed by mowin...|$|E

Absolute datings show sediment infill started c. 3. 2 Ma and continued almost without interruptions {{as a result of}} the balance between tectonic subsidence and sediment infill. Analysis of downcore changes in lithology, grain size, facies, loss on ignition (LOI), and <b>hydrosere</b> vegetation at 20 -cm intervals along the core produced a 2200 -sample record of basin dynamics and lake level changes with a temporal resolution from c. 800 years (during the last 1. 5 Ma) to c. 2000 years (from 1. 5 to 3. 2 Ma). We recognized 11 discrete sedimentary facies that reflect 4 different depositional environments. Facies 1 and 2 correspond to lacustrine environment where the LOI is 20 %. A fluvio-lacustrine environment is represented by the facies 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9. A fluvial environment is reflected by facies 6, 8 and 10. Basin infill started with accumulation in a fluvio-lacustrine environment between 586 and 530 m below the present-day sediment surface of the basin. In the 530 - to 325 -m interval (c. 3 - 1. 5 Ma), the basin contained mainly shallow water and swamps, in combination with some fluvial activity. The 325 - 5 -m interval (1. 5 - 0. 028 Ma) shows almost uninterrupted lacustrine paleoenvironmental conditions. The uppermost 5 m reflect a fluvial paleoenvironment deposited by the Bogotá River and its tributaries. The downcore changing ratio between shallow water aquatics (Myriophyllum, Ludwigia, Polygonum, Cyperaceae) and aquatics of deeper water (Isoëtes) is indicative of lake level changes. Isoëtes as an indicator of high water levels is not consistent with fluvial and fluvio-lacustrine depositional regimes. Several lithological discontinuities, evidenced by the sharp transition from swamp deposits to fluvio-lacustrine and fluvial deposits, are present in the core, in the interval from 530 to 325 m in particular. It is plausible that swamp deposits have been eroded during episodes during which the water table quickly raised or during events of sudden coarse fluvial input into the basin. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{vegetation}} of about 125 former beds of the larger rivers in the Netherlands. It includes all communities of higher plants except the carrs, which are dealt with in a separate paper by Kop (1961). The investigation of the communities aimed at a knowledge of their floristic composition {{as well as at}} a definition of their habitat. The description and the classification of the units was carried out according to the concepts and methods of the Braun-Blanquet school (Braun-Blanquet, 1932, 1951; Becking, 1957). Moreover, among the former river beds types were recognized, characterized by a special set of communities and by correlated abiotical properties. A number of vegetation-units are described here for the first time, viz. The Polygoneto-Nymphoidetum (alliance Potamion) with the subass. typicum and the subass. potametosum pectinati. According to descriptions of vegetations found in the literature the subass. typicum is also present in former river beds of the Rhine in Germany about up to Bingen (LAUTERBRON, 1917); more to the south it is replaced by the Trapo-Nymphoidetum (OBERDORFER, 1957). The Sparganieto-Glycerietum fluitantis polygonetosum (alliance Glycerieto-Sparganion). The main difference with the habitat of the other subassociations (see MAAS, 1959), where the water is moving either permanently (brooks) or at least now and then (ditches), is that the vegetation is influenced by the current only during the shortlasting annual floods. The Cicuteto-Caricetum pseudocyperus (alliance Phragmition) is to be divided into two subassociations, viz. the subass. typicum and the subass. comaretosum. The main difference between the habitats of the two subassociations appears to be that the first is eutrophic and the second more mesotrophic. The Scirpetum triquetri et maritimi typhetosum (alliance Phragmition). In contrast with the other subassociations (see ZONNEVELD, 1960), this one occurs only in oligoto mesohalinic, stagnant water. The Caricetum elatae (alliance Magnocaricion) is revised. Carex hudsonii is the only characteristic species found throughout the area in which the association occurs. The community everywhere participates in the <b>hydrosere</b> on sand or peat. The following subdivision was made: Subass. typicum; the community is eutraphentous; according to the literature it is found in Switzerland (KOCH, 1926), S. Germany (OBERDORFER, 1957) and Belgium (LEBRUN c. s., 1949; VANDEN BERGHEN, 1952 a). Subass. comaretosum: more mesotraphentous than the subass. typicum; found in N. Germany (TÜXEN, 1937; PASSARGE, 1955 b) and the Netherlands. Of the Valerianeto-Filipenduletum (alliance Filipendulo-Petasition) two new subassocaitions are established, viz. : Subass. juncetosum; it is the replacing-community of a mesotraphentous variant of the Alnetum glutinosae. Subass. senecietosum; represented in the river forelands outside the tidal area; it replaces there an eutraphentous Salicion-community, and may be natural if the development of trees is prevented by ice-drift. Eight types of former river beds were distinguished. Two of these could be subdivided into some subtypes. Their classification according to their communities and their abiotical properties is summarized in table 26. Descriptions of habitats which more or less resemble one of these types of former river beds, are known {{from other parts of the}} Netherlands and from the adjoining parts of Germany and Belgium. However, as far as we know, of the types described by us, viz. those represented in the river forelands along the upper courses of the rivers, seem to differ from all habitats that have been described so far...|$|E
40|$|The world’s {{wetlands}} {{are known}} for being highly productive environments and supporting significant numbers of fauna and flora species that rely on the wetland’s primary productions for survival. However, they were historically used by humans for hunting and fishing, wetlands were considered wastelands, best used when drained and filled for agricultural, industrial and residential development. Despite now having {{a greater understanding of}} wetlands and their ecological importance, degradation of wetlands continues, mainly due to anthropogenic activities. Wetland restoration involves reconstructing natural sites that have been degraded or completely lost and re-establishing their functions and values as vital ecosystems. Important restoration components include control of invasive weeds, emphasis on the presence of locally native species and restoration of the hydrological component. The Wairio wetland is part of the largest wetland complex in the southern North Island and supports a number of native flora and fauna, of national and international importance. Wairio wetland has been destroyed by the effects of partial draining, unnatural hydrological control, clearing of native forest, construction of Parera Road separating once joined wetlands and the establishment of invasive willow trees and agricultural grasses. The co-management by the Department of Conservation and Ducks Unlimited, commenced in 2005, has begun a positive shift for the wetland. However, issues still remain due to the majority of the wetland still being used for farming, so there is no continuity between the three fenced restoration stages; artificial hydrological flow and water storage; and established willow trees along the wetland boundary. Most ephemeral wetland vegetation displays a strong pattern of zonation, through a sequence from open water to dry land, which is correlated in some way with the duration and periodicity of water inundation. This <b>hydrosere</b> reflects differences in the degree of adaptation to aquatic life of different plant species. Two studies are reported here, conducted in two areas at the Wairio wetland over two desiccation periods. The first study conducted during 2010 / 2011 at stage one, focused on determining the environmental conditions of peak abundance and limits to distribution of key native and exotic plant species along an environmental (hydrological) gradient. The second study, conducted in 2012 at stage three, further investigated the effect of topsoil removal on the plant community and was a comparison study with the initial study at stage one. Results indicated that the Wairio wetland plant communities display strong zonation patterns progressing from aquatic species, to turf communities, to exotic grass species. Over the two desiccation periods studied {{it was found that the}} introduced species most abundant in low soil moisture were common pasture grasses, especially yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), brown top (Agrostis capillaris) and tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) as well as purple clover (Trifolium pratense) and the high soil moisture invasive competitor was water plantain (Alisma spp.). We also found that topsoil excavation impacts the plant community; topsoil scraping in the high soil moisture areas leads to a more native dominated plant community, with the dominant species being water plantain (Alisma spp.) and Isolepis prolifera, but scraping in relatively low soil moisture areas encourages the exotic grass weed species to grow. Wairio wetland on the Eastern shore of Lake Wairarapa has been adversely affected by anthropogenic activities since the 1960 s. In 2005, Ducks Unlimited and the Department of Conservation signed a Land Management Agreement where Ducks Unlimited would commence the restoration of the wetland. Survival of trees planted during the first few years was variable. Here, I report on the design and monitoring of a large scale field experiment involving the planting of around 2, 500 trees of eight native wetland tree species Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Podocarpus totara, Cordyline australis, Olearia virgata, Pittosporum tenuifolium, Coprosma robusta, Coprosma propinqua and Leptospermum scoparium. The trees were subjected to different methods of site preparation and aftercare to determine the best combination of treatments for successful establishment of tree saplings. Treatments included the use or non-use of topsoil excavation, release spraying, weedmats, nurse trees (with two combinations of species) and different spacing between the nurse species. Survival and growth over the first six months was monitored. Preliminarily results showed survival of O. virgata and P. totara was influenced by surface water, but few immediate effects of treatments upon growth rates. Olearia virgata, however, grew best in wet areas that had been scraped free of topsoil or drier areas that had not been scraped. Monitoring over the next 18 months will give us a better understanding of which is the most costeffective combination of treatments. Early indications suggest high level survival under all treatments...|$|E
