DLA uses these estimates to determine expected costs and revenues at the distribution depots. Accurate workload forecasting allows DLA planners to establish appropriate surcharges for their services.

40|$|Abstract—Coercion {{resistance}} <b>and</b> <b>receipt</b> freeness are criti-cal {{properties for}} any voting system.

The framework is general enough to accommodate a wide range of definitions, including dealing with randomization attacks and forced abstention.

The effect of teaching on these attitudes was also evaluated. Data were collected by questionnaire. Previous experience with local anesthesia in a dental office did not affect students' attitudes toward administration <b>and</b> <b>receipt</b> of a local anesthetic injection from a classmate. Female students were more anxious about giving and receiving local anesthetic injections than male students. Didactic teaching decreased anxiety in relation to administration <b>and</b> <b>receipt</b> of a local anesthetic injection.

The comparative reproductive efficiency of 50 each <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born Friesian cows at Bhunikey (Pattoki), Harichand (Charsada) and Quetta (Baluchistan) was studied. It was concluded that age at first calving differed significantly at different locations (P< 0. 05) for <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows. The services per conception at Bhunikey and Quetta did not differ significantly for <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born but these differed significantly from <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born of Harichand. The service period of <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows at Bhunikey was significantly longer (P< 0. 05) than cows at Harichand and Quetta did not vary significantly in <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born except Harichand. There {{was no significant difference in}} milk yield of <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows at Quetta. However, at Bhunikey <b>and</b> Harichand, <b>imported</b> cows produced significantly (P< 0. 05) more milk than their progeny and all these classes produced significantly more milk than <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born at Quetta. Calving interval of <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows at Bhunikey was significantly longer (P< 0. 05) than the Harichand and Quetta but did not differ significantly for <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows.
