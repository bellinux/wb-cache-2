40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to introduce the concept of novel flat plate solar geyser with integrated heat exchanger and open loop passive system. The heat exchanger acts both as collector for solar radiations and as a heat exchanger its self for cold water beneath it. Contrary to the conventional flat plate solar collectors, water is in direct contact with the collector or <b>flat</b> <b>grooved</b> heat exchanger. A safety control box is installed to minimize hydraulic pressure of cold water reservoir on the <b>flat</b> <b>grooved</b> heat exchanger as contrary to tube a plate cannot sustain high pressures. The heat exchanger has circular grooves which adds in sustaining hydraulic pressure, increase heat exchanger exposed area to the sun and also cause turbulence in flowing cold water to increase heat rate.

40|$|Abstract: The {{pressure}} {{distribution in}} a <b>flat</b> spiral <b>groove</b> thrust bearing {{obtained from a}} straightforward solution of the Reynolds equation includes subatmospheric pressure in part of the grooved area. This is masked in the common theory {{based on the assumption}} of an infinite number of grooves. Furthermore, the negative contribution to the load capacity from this area is usually small, which may explain why the presence of subatmospheric pressure has not been given much attention in connectionwith these bearings. Subatmospheric pressure is, however, necessary for liquid-lubricated <b>flat</b> spiral <b>groove</b> thrust bearings of conventional design to work at all at low numbers of grooves, which in turn requires a non-zero cavitation pressure. Cavitation within individual grooves implies non-linearity in, for example, the relation between load capacity and rotational speed of the bearing and limits the obtainable load capacity. This is more pronounced and important to consider at low numbers of grooves (wide grooves) than at high numbers of grooves (narrow grooves), {{and it is difficult to}} determine for what number of grooves that reliable prediction of bearing performance can be expected. It depends on the actual value of the cavitation pressure and other parameters that are usually unknown or difficult to account for. To avoid this disadvantage a modified design of liquid-lubricated <b>flat</b> spiral <b>groove</b> thrust bearings is suggested...|$|R

40|$|Human {{skeletal}} {{stem cells}} (STRO- 1 positive/STRO- 1 +) respond to different topographical features in various ways. On {{a flat surface}} these cells spread and tend to develop a fibroblast-like morphology. On a microgrooved surface enriched skeletal stem cell populations prefer to stretch along the grooves, which affects their cellular structure and differentiation, a phenomenon known as contact guidance. Growth factors, hormones and chemicals can also stimulate cell differentiation. A traditional Chinese medicine, puerariae radix, has previously been observed to stimulate bone formation. The active ingredients {{have been identified as}} isoflavones with estrogen-like bioactivity. This study combined the effects of microgrooved topology and hormone-like isoflavones in the biodegradable polymer polycaprolactone (PCL). Human osteogenic cells (STRO- 1 +) were cultured on <b>flat</b> PCL, <b>grooved</b> PCL and puerariae powder-impregnated grooved PCL for 5 weeks. Coomassie staining indicated that cell growth and survival was similar on <b>flat</b> PCL, <b>grooved</b> PCL and grooved PCL impregnated with 1 wt. % or 2 wt. % puerariae powder. Grooved PCL impregnated with 2 wt. % puerariae powder was observed to have an influence on protein expression, as observed by positive osteocalcin staining. Protein expression profiles were analyzed by difference gel electrophoresis to identify proteins that showed modulation of expression in response to these different environments. Overall, our results suggest that puerariae powder has an additive effect, along with microgrooved topographical stimulation, to promote changes in the STRO- 1 + proteome that affect cell phenotype. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic forming (EMF) is a {{high speed}} forming {{technique}} {{that can be used}} for embossing fine surface features onto sheet metals. Here two coupled experimental and analytical studies show how interface conditions including rebound and friction affect the ability to create a component in impact forming. In the first part of this work high velocity is generated with the Uniform Pressure Actuator (UPA) and impact with a die emboss fine features in a nominally flat component. The primary objective of this work is to develop a modelling facility that guides experimental design nominally <b>flat</b> <b>grooved</b> components. Both shape fidelity and formability aspects are presently considered. In a second short study expansion of a round tube into a square hole is considered. Traditional modelling techniques solve a coupled system of equations with spatially varying electromagnetic fluxes controlling the dynamics of the plastic deformation. Because the magnetic pressure is spatially uniform, the flux equations are obviated from the coupled system rendering them computationally efficient. The calibration of contact mechanics that influence the rebound behaviour of the sheet metal remains as a difficult issue. The interfaces between various sheet metals and the metal die play a critical role in controlling the shape of the final product. The characterization of such an interface using appropriate calibrated friction coefficients is assessed. The role of magnetic pressure in reducing the sheet metal rebound is demonstrated via a comparison between results from mechanical and electromagnetic simulations. The influence of the channel geometry on final shape is illustrated through simulation and experiments...|$|R
