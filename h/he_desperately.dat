5|$|Louis XVIII {{negotiated}} Marie-Thérèse's {{release from}} her Paris prison in 1795. <b>He</b> <b>desperately</b> {{wanted her to}} marry her first cousin, Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, {{the son of the}} Count of Artois. Louis XVIII deceived his niece by telling her that her parents' last wishes were for her to marry Louis Antoine, and she duly agreed to her uncle-king's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, Linguswamy's Paiyaa released. A romantic road-trip film, {{featuring}} a blockbuster album by Yuvan Shankar Raja, {{it was very}} successful. For the first time, he enacted a character that lives in an urban area. He said that he accepted the film because <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> wanted to play a cool dude on screen. Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category. Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.|$|E

5000|$|Jonesy (Jack Pearson): Jonesy is {{a corrupt}} doofus. He's always {{getting into trouble}} more than anybody else. His best friend is Raff and <b>he's</b> <b>desperately</b> in love with Amber. His younger sister Annie humiliates him most of the time. He's not as cool as Annie.

Ferris later tries to save Sadiki from being kidnapped by Al-Saleem's henchmen but fails and sees his partner nearly {{killed in the}} {{subsequent}} car crash. Under interrogation, Sadiki denies any knowledge of the attack though he is later found beaten and killed. Ferris {{goes back to his}} apartment and finds out that Aisha has been kidnapped. <b>He</b> <b>desperately</b> asks Salaam for help, admitting he fabricated Omar Sadiki's terrorist cell and the attack. Salaam refuses to help because of Ferris earlier having lied to him.|$|E
5|$|Suleiman {{tried to}} {{reinforce}} his offensive, {{not knowing what}} had happened in the valley, but then Stephen, with the full support of his boyars, ordered a major attack. All his troops, together with peasants and heavy cavalry, attacked from all sides. Simultaneously, Moldavian buglers concealed behind Ottoman lines started to sound their bugles, and in great confusion some Ottoman units changed direction to face the sound. When the Moldavian army hit, Suleiman lost control of his army. <b>He</b> <b>desperately</b> tried to regain control, but was later forced to signal a retreat. The battle lasted for four days, with the last three days seeing the fleeing Ottoman army being pursued by the Moldavian light cavalry and the 2,000-strong Polish cavalry until they reached the town of Obluciţa (now Isaccea, Romania), in Dobruja.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{problem was not}} solved: Joseph's foreign policy dictated the expansion of Habsburg influence over German-speaking territories, and only this, he believed, would counter Prussia's growing strength in Imperial affairs. In 1785, Joseph again sought to make a territorial deal with Charles Theodore, again offering to trade portions of Bavarian territory for portions of the Austrian Netherlands. This time {{it would be a}} straight trade: territory for territory, not a partition. Although the Austrian Netherlands was a wealthy territory, it was a thorn in Joseph's side, opposing his administrative and bureaucratic reforms and devouring military and administrative resources <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> needed elsewhere in his realm. Despite its problems, Joseph could not afford to give up the Netherlands entirely, so his efforts to negotiate a partial territorial exchange guaranteed him some of the financial benefits of both his Netherlands possessions and the Bavarian territories.|$|E

5|$|The same year, Grant {{acquired}} a slave from his father-in-law, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones. In March 1859, Grant freed William, worth about $1,500, instead of selling {{him at a}} time when <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> needed money. Grant moved to St. Louis, taking on a partnership with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs working in real estate business as a bill collector, again without success, and at Julia's recommendation dissolved his partnership. In August, Grant applied for a position as county engineer, believing his education qualified him for the job. His application came with thirty-five notable recommendations, but Grant correctly assumed the position would be given on the basis of political affiliation and was passed over as he was believed to share his father-in-law's Democratic sentiments. In April 1860, Grant and his family moved north to Galena, accepting a position in his father's leather goods business run by his younger brothers Simpson and Orvil. In a few months, Ulysses paid off the debts he acquired in Missouri. Ulysses and family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of Galena.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} view {{of these}} events was proposed by a British historian, Stephen Christopher Rowell, where he believes that Gediminas never intended to become a Christian himself, since that would have offended the staunchly pagan inhabitants of Žemaitija and Aukštaitija. Both the pagans of Aukštaitija and the Orthodox Rus' threatened Gediminas with death if he decided to convert, where a similar scenario also happened to Mindaugas, which <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> wanted to avoid.|$|E
25|$|Edward is {{described}} in the book as being charming, polite, determined, and very stubborn. He is very protective over Bella and puts her safety, humanity and welfare before anything else. He often over-analyzes situations and {{has a tendency to}} overreact, especially in situations where Bella's safety is at risk. He retains some outdated speech from his human life in the early 20th century. Edward sees himself as a monster, and after falling in love with Bella, <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> wishes that he were human instead of a vampire.|$|E

Dana first meets {{him as a}} young accident-prone boy {{torn between}} an indulgent mother and a strict father and sees him grow to replace Tom Weylin as slave master. He is as needy as his mother, but possessive and controlling like his father. His arrogance and greediness leads to him to rape and impregnate his longtime friend Alice (Dana’s great-great-great-grandmother), making him Dana’s ancestor. <b>He</b> <b>desperately</b> seeks validation through Alice and Dana's love, but still views them as his property.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Charles' {{position}} was getting weaker and <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> needed Henrietta Maria to raise additional funds and troops from the continent. The campaigns of 1645 went poorly for the Royalists, however, and the capture, and subsequent publishing, of the correspondence between Henrietta Maria and Charles in 1645 following the Battle of Naseby proved hugely damaging to the royal cause. In two decisive engagements—the Battle of Naseby in June and the Battle of Langport in July—the Parliamentarians effectively destroyed Charles' armies. Finally, in May 1646 Charles sought shelter with a Presbyterian Scottish army at Southwell in Nottinghamshire.|$|E
25|$|On their date, Tender and Fertility {{ride the}} bus downtown, where a {{stranger}} rudely begins telling them facile jokes {{pointed at the}} Creedish mass suicide. Tender laughs at all the jokes, secretly wondering if the joker can tell he's Creedish. Fertility snaps at the joker for making fun of suicide. When the joker rises to exit the bus, Tender recognizes the man's pants as Creedish dress, and suddenly recognizes the man as Adam, his twin brother. Tender speaks Adam's name aloud, but when Adam asks if they are brothers, <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> denies it. After the bus incident, Fertility takes Tender to a department store that she presciently knows will catch on fire, but that she knows will not harm them. Fertility explains that she has the same talent as her brother for dreaming the future.|$|E

500|$|The game's story {{follows a}} middle-aged male virgin named Larry Laffer as <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> tries to [...] "get lucky" [...] in the fictional American city of Lost Wages. Land of the Lounge Lizards {{establishes}} several elements which recur {{in the later}} Larry games, including Larry's campy attire, perpetual bad luck with women, and penchant for double-entendres. The story and basic structure of the game are lifted from Softporn Adventure, a 1981 Apple II text adventure.|$|E

500|$|Bagramyan {{was well}} aware of the {{military}} situation at the Caucasus front during the first months of the world war. In the winter of 1914–15, the Imperial Russian Army was able to withstand and repel the Ottoman Empire's offensive at Sarikamish, and to take the fight to its territory. Bagramyan also began reading harrowing reports in the Russian press of what was taking place against his fellow kinsmen across the border: the Ottomans had embarked on a campaign to annihilate systematically their Armenian subjects. <b>He</b> <b>desperately</b> attempted to join the military effort but because he was only seventeen and a railway mechanic, he was not liable to be drafted.

[...] Despite his previous success—The Red Badge of Courage had gone through 14 printings in the United States and six in England—Crane {{was running out of}} money. [...] To survive financially, he worked at a feverish pitch, writing prolifically for both the English and the American markets. [...] He later remarked that he wrote The Monster [...] "under the spur of great need", as <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> required funds. [...] In August of that year, Crane and Cora were injured in a carriage accident while visiting friend Harold Frederic and his mistress Kate Lyon in Homefield, Kenley; after a week of recuperation, they followed the couple on vacation to Ireland, where Crane finished the story.|$|E
500|$|The {{repetitive}} visual {{design of}} Cybertron drew criticism from critics. Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{majority of the}} game entails walking through similar-looking corridors." [...] Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann also cited repetitive visuals, but conceded that [...] "the metallic world of Cybertron doesn't lend itself particularly well {{to a lot of}} environmental variety." [...] 1UP.com's Matt Miller also raised issue with the repetitive visuals, but provided a counterpoint in saying [...] "there are a host of features in place to save the game from spiraling into mediocrity." [...] John Hamblin of Eurogamer and Tom McShea of GameSpot also pointed out the game's vast lack of ammunition. [...] "Watching Lord Megatron repeatedly suffering the indignity of being shot at by drones while <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> scours the debris looking for an elusive ammo box [...] is just sad" [...] stated Hamblin. [...] He was further critical of the game's checkpoint system, which often leaves players in difficult situations upon respawning.|$|E
500|$|Allen {{spent the}} next several years {{involved}} in Vermont's political and military matters. While his family remained in Arlington, {{he spent most of his}} time either in Bennington or on the road, where he could avoid his wife's nagging. Shortly after his arrival, Vermont's Assembly passed the Banishment Act, a sweeping measure allowing for the confiscation and auction by the republic of property owned by known Tories. Allen was appointed to be one of the judges responsible for deciding whose property was subject to seizure under the law. (This law was so successful at collecting revenue that Vermont did not impose any taxes until 1781.) Allen personally escorted some of those convicted under the law to Albany, where he turned them over to General John Stark for transportation to the British lines. Some of these supposed Tories protested to New York Governor George Clinton that they were actually dispossessed Yorkers. Clinton, who considered Vermont to still be a part of New York, did not want to honor the actions of the Vermont tribunals; Stark, who had custody of the men, disagreed with Clinton. Eventually the dispute made its way to George Washington, who essentially agreed with Stark since <b>he</b> <b>desperately</b> needed the general's services. The prisoners were eventually transported to West Point, where they remained in [...] "easy imprisonment".|$|E
