500|$|Jackson's biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{has stated}} that the video is based on Jackson's real life. He used to walk alone at night looking for new friends, even {{at the peak of}} his musical popularity. The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room {{sometimes}} and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the {{compilation}} was released, Madonna was riding a wave of publicity {{as a result of}} the film Evita and her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes. Bray decided to cash-in the publicity for the release, although he knew that Madonna would never approve of the album. He said in an interview with Extra that Madonna would receive royalties for the release, and added [...] "There's nothing in these tapes that would be embarrassing, and <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> that she would like it as much as we do." [...] In the European countries, the album was re-titled as In the Beginning, featuring different artwork, and a re-arranged track list.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{previous}} album Off the Wall (1979) received strong {{critical acclaim}} {{and was also}} a commercial success, eventually selling over 20 million copies worldwide. The years between Off the Wall and Thriller were a transitional period for Jackson, a time of increased independence. The period saw the singer become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> {{to find someone to}} talk to. But I just end up coming home." [...] When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he hired John Branca as his manager.|$|E

500|$|Although Nash's {{high school}} coach, Ian Hyde-Lay, sent letters of inquiry and {{highlight}} reels on Nash's behalf to over 30 American universities, Nash was not recruited by any university, until Santa Clara coach Dick Davey requested video {{footage of the}} young guard. After watching Nash in person, Davey said he [...] "was nervous as hell <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> {{that no one else}} would see him. It didn't take a Nobel Prize winner to figure out this guy's pretty good. It was just a case of hoping that none of the big names came around."

500|$|One {{night while}} Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed {{into his room}} through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room {{screaming}} and shouting. Joseph {{said he wanted to}} teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom. By the early 1980s, he was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely.

500|$|Additionally, Stapleton and Paul Tassi of Forbes both {{took issue}} to Rocksteady's {{marketing}} of the Arkham Knight as an original character, as the moniker was original but the {{character in the}} role was not. Stapleton felt {{the problem was that}} the marketing for the character indicated it was a [...] "big mystery" [...] to his identity, but any [...] "moderately knowledgeable Batman fan could reasonably" [...] deduce the identity: [...] "We all already knew who the Arkham Knight was; we were <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> it wasn’t true because we wanted the original story we’d been promised." [...] Tassi criticized Rocksteady for promising a new character and insisting the identity [...] "would shock and amaze us all" [...] when it turned out to essentially be [...] "a renamed and recostumed version of a character that has already existed for years." ...|$|E

500|$|Music critic Robert Christgau said of McCartney {{and the new}} Wings album: [...] "When he's on, Paulie's {{abundant}} tunefulness {{passes for}} generosity. Here he's <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> something will stick." [...] In Melody Maker, Ray Coleman wrote that McCartney [...] "seems {{to be on a}} treadmill of banality". Coleman described [...] "Rockestra Theme" [...] and [...] "So Glad to See You Here" [...] as [...] "creditable, rolling, raunchy and at least efficient, with Paul's voice at its rocking best on the last named track", but concluded: [...] "This album gets Wings nowhere..." [...] Billboards reviewer gave Back to the Egg [...] "Spotlight" [...] status (meaning [...] "the most outstanding new product of the week's releases and that with the greatest potential for top of the chart placement") and commented: [...] "The music features typical McCartney fare of late with nothing here that will distinguish it as one of his classics. The arrangements, though, are interesting, encompassing a variety of styles." ...|$|E
500|$|Manning and the Colts {{introduced}} their now-signature no-huddle offense, {{and used}} it to great effect in a Week 1 rout of the Jets, 45–24. Two weeks later (Week 2 games were not played as scheduled due to the 9/11 attacks) the Colts advanced to 2–0 with a win over Buffalo, behind Manning's 421yards passing. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. However, the Colts lost the following week to New England, and continued their slide, losing their following two games. The Colts briefly rebounded, winning two games, but then lost 7 of their last 9, including a 40–21 home loss to the 49ers. After Manning threw a career-high four interceptions in that game, coach Jim Mora uttered his infamous [...] "Playoffs? Don't talk about playoffs. Are you kidding me. Playoffs? I'm <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> we can win a game, another game" [...] press conference. Despite the 6–10 record, Manning finished the season with , , and 4 rushing touchdowns as the offense produced the second most points in the league. However, the defense allowed the most points and Jim Mora was fired after the season.|$|E
500|$|Tom Dowd {{produced}} At Fillmore East; he {{had previously}} worked on their second studio album, Idlewild South. He had recently returned from Africa from working on the film Soul to Soul, and stayed in New York several days to oversee the live recording. [...] "It was a good truck, with a 16-track machine and a great, tough-as-nails staff {{who took care of}} business," [...] recalled Dowd. He gave the staff suggestions and noted the band had two lead guitarists and two drummers, [...] "which was unusual, and it took some foresight to properly capture the dynamics." [...] Things went smoothly until the band unexpectedly brought out saxophonist Rudolph [...] "Juicy" [...] Carter, an unknown horn player, and longstanding [...] "unofficial" [...] band member Thom Doucette on harmonica. [...] "I was <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> we could isolate them, so we could wipe them and use the songs, but they started playing and the horns were leaking all over everything, rendering the songs unusable," [...] said Dowd. He rushed to Duane during the break to tell him to cut the horn players; while Duane loved the players, he put up no fight with Dowd. The final show was delayed because of a bomb scare, and did not end until 6 am.|$|E

500|$|In March 2011, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph told MTV News {{that the}} tour {{would have a}} [...] "post-apocalyptic vibe", and commented that [...] "Till The World Ends" [...] "keeps {{becoming}} a theme for us." [...] He also confirmed Jamie King as the tour director and Brian Friedman as the choreographer. The following month, Friedman {{announced that he had}} pulled out of the tour due to scheduling conflicts with his own reality series. In a video interview posted on Spears's official website, she said, [...] "The Femme Fatale Tour will hopefully just be outrageously spectacular. I'm <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> that the choreographers will come up with just the most outrageous things, and I'm really excited. This {{is one of the most}} excited I've been about a project in a really long time, so I can't wait." [...] The script of the show was created by Jamie King, and was inspired by the concept of the femme fatale and femme fatales throughout the ages. Rudolph stated that the idea for the show was to have Spears as an [...] "international woman of mystery". The setlist was composed mostly of songs from Femme Fatale, but also included hits from her previous albums, as Spears explained, [...] "The fans really like a lot of the old songs, because that's what they are used to. So it's just about finding the balance, and how many songs I wanna incorporate from the past and from the present." ...|$|E
500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E
500|$|The album saw {{the band}} take on {{much more of}} a commercially {{influenced}} sound, and also the appearance of Moog synthesizers, while being lyrically focused on a comedic approach, as with [...] "Seven Days in the Sun", but also dark emotions, such as those shown on [...] "Turn", [...] "Oxygen", and [...] "Satellite News". It was during the campaign for Echo Park that the band played another slot on the main stage at the Reading and Leeds festival, including T in the Park. As of August 2003, the album has shipped 300,000 units in the UK going platinum, with counter sales standing at 293,000 as of February 2005. Grant said in a Melody Maker interview that if the album did not sell well enough the band would probably split up; he said at the time that [...] "It's the same with any band. That's just the way the music business is. There is only {{a certain amount of money}} a label will put into a band. I'm just being realistic. We've been around for seven or eight years and I am not planning on giving up, but we're putting everything into this record and I'm <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> that people like it". The album campaign helped the band in August 2001 win the [...] "Best British Live Act" [...] accolade at the Kerrang! awards, before ending the year supporting the Stereophonics, and then releasing the [...] "Just a Day" [...] single in December. In February 2015, [...] "Buck Rogers" [...] gained a silver certification for 200,000 physical sales, digital downloads and streaming points combined.

2500|$|Barth {{argued that}} {{previous}} perspectives on sin and salvation, influenced by strict Calvinist thinking, sometimes misled Christians {{into thinking that}} predestination set up humanity such {{that the vast majority}} of human beings were foreseen to disobey and reject God, with damnation coming to them as a matter of fate. Barth's view of salvation is centrally Christological, with his writings stating that in Jesus Christ the reconciliation of all of mankind to God has essentially already taken place and that through Christ man is already elect and justified. Though not an advocate of Christian universalism, strictly speaking, Barth asserted that eternal salvation for everyone, even those that reject God, is a possibility that isn't just an open question but should be hoped for by Christians as a matter of grace; specifically, he wrote, [...] "Even though theological consistency might seem to lead our thoughts and utterances most clearly in this direction, we must not arrogate to ourselves that which can be given and received only as a free gift", <b>just</b> <b>hoping</b> for total reconciliation.|$|E
