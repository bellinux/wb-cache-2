50|$|Kroemer {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the National Academy of Engineering in 1997 and the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. He always {{preferred}} to work on problems that are ahead of mainstream technology. In the 1950s, he invented the <b>drift</b> <b>transistor</b> and was the first to point out that advantages could be gained in various semiconductor devices by incorporating heterojunctions. Most notably, in 1963 he proposed the concept of the double-heterostructure laser, which is now a central concept in the field of semiconductor lasers. Kroemer became an early pioneer in molecular beam epitaxy, concentrating on applying the technology to untried new materials.|$|E

5000|$|Most of {{the logic}} {{circuitry}} of the 1401 was {{a type of}} diode-transistor logic (DTL), that IBM referred to as CTDL (Complemented Transistor Diode Logic). Other IBM circuit types used were referred to as: Alloy (some logic, but mostly various non-logic functions, named for the germanium-alloy transistors used), CTRL (Complemented Transistor Resistor Logic, a type of resistor-transistor logic (RTL)). Later upgrades (e.g., the TAU-9 tape interface) used a faster type of DTL using [...] "drift" [...] transistors (a type of transistor invented by Herbert Kroemer in 1953) for their speed, that IBM referred to as SDTDL (Saturated <b>Drift</b> <b>Transistor</b> Diode Logic). Typical logic levels of these circuits were (S & U Level) high: 0 V to -0.5V, low: -6 V to -12 V; (T Level) high: 6 V to 1 V, low: -5.5 V to -6 V.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{optimization}} of {{the programming}} voltage and {{the dimensions of}} antifuse bitcells is a design challenge due to antagonistic parameters. An optimization approach is presented using a time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) model. Fowler-Nordheim wear-out current and TBD power-law models are identified using electrical characterizations performed on antifuse bitcells fabricated in standard 40 -nm CMOS. The TDDB model allows the calculation of the programming voltage according to a targeted TBD and the antifuse bitcell dimensions. As a result, it was shown that the lowest programming voltage is obtained for a small capacitor, whereas {{the size of the}} <b>drift</b> <b>transistor</b> has a second-order impact...|$|E

50|$|The 7030 CPU uses {{emitter-coupled logic}} (originally called current-steering logic) on 18 types of Standard Modular System (SMS) cards. It uses 4,025 double cards (as shown) and 18,747 single cards, holding 169,100 transistors, {{requiring}} {{a total of}} 21 kW power. It uses high-speed NPN and PNP germanium <b>drift</b> <b>transistors,</b> with cut-off frequency over 100 MHz, and using ~50mW each. Some third level circuits use a 3rd voltage level. Each logic level has a delay of about 20 nS. To gain speed in critical areas emitter-follower logic is used to reduce the delay to about 10 nS.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the aluminum p-well implant annealing process on the electrical properties of lateral 4 H-SiC MOSFET transistors. The interface trap concentration was measured by quasi-static capacitive voltage (QSCV) and negative bias stress measurements on MOSFETs. We found that higher annealing temperatures significantly reduce the trap density in the lower bandgap, and as a consequence the threshold voltage <b>drift</b> of the <b>transistor</b> after negative stress is reduced...|$|R

The various ma-terial response functions that enter the theory are outlined and, {{to the extent}} possible, specified and calibrated.

40|$|Plasma {{processing}} {{has become}} an integral part of the IC fabrication, since it offers advantages in terms of directionality, low temperature and process convenience. However plasma processing induces an oxide charging damage, which is function of process conditions and gate interconnect layout. At the end of the process the plasma damage is "hidden" by hydrogen passivation and becomes latent. At a first electrical inspection all the devices on wafer present nearly the same electrical parameters, whereas a small stress is enough to reveal the plasma damage, producing again a <b>drift</b> of all <b>transistor</b> parameters. In fact the applied stress both depassivate the latent plasma damage and introduce newly defects, which are electrically undistinguishable from plasma damage and depend on applied stress conditions. In our contribution we propose an experimental stress methodology to investigate both the latent damage depassivation effect and the net contribution of plasma damage...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} interface to neural medical devices is researched from three perspectives, namely, the electronics within the device, the electrodes on the device, and the electromagnetic fields around the device. A Brain-Machine Interface may allow paralyzed patients to control robotic limbs with neural signals sensed by fine wires {{inserted into the}} brain. The neural signals have an amplitude under one millivolt and must be amplified. A totally integrated amplifier is designed, manufactured, and characterized. The amplifier is fabricated in a standard half-micron CMOS process without capacitors or resistors. Two application issues not previously addressed are solved. First, the topology of the amplifier is shown to be less sensitive to long-term <b>drift</b> of <b>transistor</b> parameters than the standard topology. Second, a neural signal corrupted by 10 millivolts of powerline interference can be recovered. The amplifier has a gain of 58 dB, a bandwidth of 750 to 14 k Hz, power consumption of 180 uW, and noise of 1. 5 uV RMS. The design techniques proven in this amplifier are suitable for clinical Brain Machine Interfaces. An implanted electroencephalogram (EEG) recorder may aid the diagnosis of infrequent seizure-like events that are currently diagnosed, without proof, as epilepsy. A proof-of-concept study quantifies the electrical characteristics of the electrodes planned for the recorder. The electrodes are implanted in an ovine model for eight weeks. Electrode impedance is less than 800 Ohm throughout the study. A frequency-domain determination of sedation performs similarly for surface versus implanted electrodes throughout the study. The time-domain correlation between an implanted electrode and a surface electrode is almost as high as between two surface electrodes (0. 86 versus 0. 92). EEG-certified clinicians judge that the implanted electrode quality is at least adequate and that the implanted electrodes provide the same clinical information as surface electrodes except for a noticeable amplitude difference. No significant issues are found that invalidate {{the concept of an}} implanted EEG recorder. Transcranial stimulation may treat a multitude of neural and psychological illnesses. The stimulation may have higher repeatability and lower patient effort if an implanted device provides the stimulation. The shape of the device, 300 mm long by 1 mm in diameter, is unlike any present implanted device. Five techniques that deliver energy to the device are analyzed using computer simulations. The electrode for the techniques that employ an electric field to deliver the energy is a new design that exploits the anatomy of the scalp and skull. The electric field techniques deliver energy that is likely suitable for some stimulation protocols but not for all. The techniques that employ a magnetic field deliver more than the energy required, especially if the shape of the coil that creates the magnetic field is automatically optimized. However, the magnetic-field techniques heat the brain; the electric-field techniques do not heat the brain. This research validates the new delivery concepts and justifies future research.

40|$|Electrochemical sensors {{share many}} {{properties}} {{of an ideal}} (bio) chemical sensor. They can be easily miniaturized with high parallel sensing capabilities,with rugged structure and at low cost. The response obtained from thetarget analyte is directly in electrical form allowing convenient data post-processing and simple interfacing to standard electrical components. With ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor (FET) based sensors, the transducing principle relies on direct detection of interfacial charge allowing detection of various ions and charged macromolecules. This thesis investigates FET based sensors for biological and chemical sensing. First, an ion-sensitive ﬂoating gate FET (ISFGFET) structure is studied and modeled. The proposed model reveals novel abilities of the structure not found in conventional ion-sensitive FETs (ISFETs). With IS-FGFET, we can simultaneously optimize the transistor operating point and modulate the charging of the surface and the ionic screening layer via the ﬁeld eﬀect. This control is predicted to allow reduced electric double layer screening {{as well as the}} possibility to enhance charged molecule attachment to the sensing surface. The model can predict sensor characteristic curves in pH sensing in absolute terms and allows any potential to be computed in the sensor including the electrical part and the electrolyte solution. Furthermore, a compact ISFGFET variant is merged into electric circuit simulator, which allows it to be simulated as a standard electrical component with electrical simulations tools of high computational eﬃciency, and allows simple modiﬁcations such as addition of parasitic elements, temperature eﬀects, or even temporal <b>drifts.</b> Next, another <b>transistor</b> based conﬁguration, the extended-gate ISFET is studied. The simplicity of the proposed conﬁguration allows a universal potentiometric approach where a wide variety of chemical and biological sensors can be constructed. The design philosophy for this sensing structure is to use the shelf electric components and standard electric manufacturing processes. Such an extended-gate structure is beneﬁcial since the dry electronics can be completely separated from the wet sensing environment. The extended-gate allows simple functionalization towards chemical and biological sensing. A proof-of-concept of this structure was veriﬁed through organo modiﬁed gold platforms with ion-selective membranes. A comparison with standard open-circuit potentiometry reveals that the sensing elements in a disposable sensing platform arrays provide comparable performance to traditional electrodes. Finally, a universal battery operated hand-held electrical readout device is designed for multiplexed detection of the disposable sensors with wireless smartphone data plotting, control, and storage. Organic polymers {{play an important role in}} the interfacial properties of sensors studied in this thesis. The polymer coating is attractive in chemical sensing because of its redox sensitivity, bio-immobilization capability, ion-to-electron transducing capability, and applicability, for example via a simple low-cost drop-casting. This structure simpliﬁes the design of the sensor substantially and the coating increases the amount of possible target applications...|$|R
