40|$|The {{intimate}} {{relationship between the}} urinary and <b>genital</b> <b>systems</b> permits stimuli in one system to influence the other. At least 15 per cent of women with symptoms of cystitis have no organic basis for their complaints. In psychiatric studies it has been noted that sexual conflict is the primary etiological factor in these patients. In some cases, continuance of the disorder leads to irreversible organic change.

40|$|Crohn's disease (CD) and {{ulcerative}} colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that may often involve organs {{other than those}} of the gastrointestinal tract. We investigated retrospectively the frequency, diagnosis and treatment of urinary and male genital complications of CD and UC. From February 1998 to July 2007, 93 patients with CD and 75 patients with UC consulted our department for urinary and male genital complications. Thirty, 19 and 16 of the 93 patients with CD were diagnosed as having fistulas to the urinary and male <b>genital</b> <b>systems,</b> urolithiasis and hydronephrosis, respectively. Fifteen, 14 and 13 of the 75 patients with UC were diagnosed as having urolithiasis, urinary tract infection (UTI) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), respectively. Fistula to the urinary and male <b>genital</b> <b>systems</b> in CD occurred more often in men. In 22 CD patients who had undergone surgical operation and were definitively diagnosed as fistula, the positive rate of cystogram (CG) was 38. 1 % (8 / 21). They presented with pyuria (10 cases), pneumaturia (7), hematuria (7), fecaluria (2) and urorrhea (2). Cystoscopy was performed in 20 patients. Fistula opening in the urinary bladder was found in only 2 patients. Other findings in the bladder were edema (14 cases), redness of mucosa (6) and debris (3). Hydronephrosis in CD occurred in 16 patients. Placing a percutaneus nephrostomy (PNS) or ureteral stent was performed in 11 patients and surgical therapy was performed in 12 patients. Only two of the 34 patients with urolithiasis (CD 19, UC 15 cases) underwent ESWL and/or TUL. Almost all patients with UTI in UC were treated with antibiotics and improved, but one patient died from Fournier’s Gangrene due to erirectal abscess...|$|R
40|$|Penetration of {{antiretroviral}} drugs {{into the}} genital tract {{is crucial for}} virological efficacy in this compartment and impacts the transmission of the virus.

40|$|IL- 6 is a {{pleiotropic}} pro-inflammatory cytokine {{thought to}} play a role in age physiology, even if its possible modulation by aging mechanisms has not been fully defined. In this paper, the morpho-functional modifications and IL- 6 immunoreactivity during, aging in a simple invertebrate model, Ophryotrocha labronica, are reported. The comparison between newly-hatched, juveniles, young adult and 3 -month-old females showed significant differences in the nervous and <b>genital</b> <b>systems.</b> There is evidence of nerve cell loss and a decline in oocyte growth and maturation at the gonad level. Immunohistochemistry reveals a different distribution of IL- 6 -like molecules, and a decreased number of reactive nerve cells in the central nervous system of aged O. labronica associated to the induced morphological modifications.

40|$|The {{interest}} in the immunosuppressive activity of mammalian seminal plasma depends largely on its putative role in the immunoregulation of both {{the male and female}} <b>genital</b> <b>systems.</b> We report here that the immunosuppressive action of bovine seminal plasma is based on the presence in this fluid of copious amounts of an immunosuppressive RNase, bovine seminal RNase. Studies of structure-function relationships have revealed that the immunosuppressive activity of seminal RNase depends on the integrity of the dimeric structure of the enzyme, {{as well as on the}} integrity of its catalytic function. While bovine seminal RNase has no effect on the secretion of interleukin- 2 by T-cell cultures, the enzyme has been found to decrease drastically the expression of the alpha-chain of the interleukin- 2 receptor on the T-cell membrane...|$|R
50|$|The {{physiological}} role of this enzyme is not {{yet found}} and thus {{it is still a}} mystery why the seminal fluid in bovine has such a higher concentration of this enzyme. In the evolutionary process, it has acquired new behaviors such as being a dimer with composite active sites binding firmly to anionic glycolipids, including bovine spermatozoa seminolipid, a fusogenic sulfated galactolipid possessing immunosuppressive and cytostatic activities whereas the ancestral RNase does not possess these behaviors. The homolog of RNase A, bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase), has a specific antitumor activity. In the immunoregulation of both male and female <b>genital</b> <b>systems,</b> the seminal plasma plays a prominent role in immunosuppression. The direct or indirect interference of the seminal plasma with the function of many types of immunocompetent cells including T cells, B cells, NK cells and macrophages has been shown. These effects of immunosuppression are not species-specific and are found to be in physiological concentrations that are normally seen in the urogenital tract of females. RNase secretion has not been detected in the seminal fluid of any other mammal.|$|R
