50|$|Many {{different}} methodologies {{aimed at}} freshwater inflow management {{to maintain an}} estuary have been implemented throughout the world. Studies are aimed at determining the freshwater inflow amount necessary to maintain an <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> One common methodology implemented in studies in several U.S. states including Texas, Florida, and California is to indirectly link estuarine resources (i.e. integrity- species composition, biomass, diversity; function- primary production, secondary production, nutrient recycling; sustainability- habitats, valued resources, ecosystem services) to freshwater inflow (i.e. quantity- timing, frequency, duration, extent; quality; tidal connections) through estuarine conditions (i.e. salinity; sediment; dissolved material; particulate material).

40|$|Although respiration-based {{oxidation}} {{of reduced}} carbon releases CO 2 into the environment, {{it provides an}} ecosystem with the metabolic energy for essential biogeochemical processes, including the newly proposed microbial carbon pump (MCP). The efficiency of MCP in heterotrophic microorganisms {{is related to the}} mechanisms of energy transduction employed and hence is related to the form of respiration utilized. Anaerobic organisms typically have lower efficiencies of energy transduction and hence lower efficiencies of energy-dependent carbon transformation. This leads to a lower MCP efficiency on a per-cell basis. Substantial input of terrigenous nutrients and organic matter into <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystems</b> typically results in elevated heterotrophic respiration that rapidly consumes dissolved oxygen, potentially producing hypoxic and anoxic zones in the water column. The lowered availability of dissolved oxygen and the excessive supply of nutrients such as nitrate from river discharge lead to enhanced anaerobic respiration processes such as denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. Thus, some nutrients may be consumed through anaerobic heterotrophs, instead of being utilized by phytoplankton for autotrophic carbon fixation. In this manner, eutrophied <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystems</b> become largely fueled by anaerobic respiratory pathways and their efficiency is less due to lowered ecosystem productivity when compared to healthy and balanced <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> This situation may {{have a negative impact on}} the ecological function and efficiency of the MCP which depends on the supply of both organic carbon and metabolic energy.
