5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, <b>dust,</b> <b>and</b> very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E

5|$|Pull Up Some <b>Dust</b> <b>and</b> Sit Down is the 2011 fourteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ry Cooder. Following his 2008 album I, Flathead, Cooder {{pursued a}} more {{political}} direction with his songwriting, {{inspired by the}} late-2000s economic crisis and protest songs of the past. Pull Up Some <b>Dust</b> <b>and</b> Sit Down was written and produced by Cooder, who recorded its songs at Drive-By Studios, Ocean Studios, and Wireland Studios in California. He played various instruments and worked with musicians such as Flaco Jiménez, Juliette Commagere, Robert Francis, and Jim Keltner.|$|E

5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants.

5|$|After antiquity, {{mention of}} lead {{poisoning}} was absent from medical literature {{until the end}} of the Middle Ages. In 1656 the German physician Samuel Stockhausen recognized <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> fumes containing lead compounds as the cause of disease, called since ancient Roman times morbi metallici, that were known to afflict miners, smelter workers, potters, and others whose work exposed them to the metal.|$|E
5|$|An {{active galaxy}} is a {{formation}} that emits {{a significant amount}} of its energy from a source other than its stars, <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas.

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|However, that meaning {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the process of accretion forming the planets.

5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
5|$|All {{vanadium}} compounds {{should be}} considered toxic. Tetravalent VOSO4 {{has been reported to}} be at least 5 times more toxic than trivalent V2O3. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> 0.1 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health, that is, likely to cause permanent health problems or death.|$|E
5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
