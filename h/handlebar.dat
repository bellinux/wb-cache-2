5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include <b>handlebar</b> weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} stage, the Tour {{returned}} to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs {{officers and the}} delay took so long that the stage had to be restarted. During the stage in the Alps, Émile Georget was better than his competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification. Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead. In the seventh stage, Marcel Cadolle, {{at that time in}} second place, fell and his <b>handlebar</b> penetrated his knee, after which he had to give up.|$|E
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the <b>handlebar,</b> it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
50|$|<b>Handlebars</b> {{usually have}} tape or grips to provide grip and comfort. In general, <b>handlebars</b> which have one riding {{position}} have grips, and <b>handlebars</b> which provide several use tape.|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{original}} ape hanger <b>handlebars,</b> several models sported ram horn style <b>handlebars</b> that contained loops. Huffy even introduced a model, called The Wheel, with a steering wheel {{in place of}} <b>handlebars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Recumbent bicycles, due {{to their}} wide variety, are often {{equipped}} with <b>handlebars</b> seen nowhere else. These include <b>handlebars</b> with a very far reach, similar to ape hangers (see above) but mounted less vertically, and <b>handlebars</b> designed for under-seat steering, called Whatton bars.|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the <b>handlebar.</b> If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
25|$|The 1948 Chief had a 74 {{cubic inch}} engine, hand shift and foot clutch. While one <b>handlebar</b> grip {{controlled}} the throttle {{the other was}} a manual spark advance.|$|E
25|$|In the 1989 Race Across America, {{one team}} (Team Strawberry) used an {{experimental}} device comprising a rear wheel hub, a sensor, and a <b>handlebar</b> mounted processor, to measure each cyclist's power output.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycles sold in America {{had high}} <b>handlebars</b> with a cross brace. Those sold {{elsewhere}} came with low, Euro <b>handlebars.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2010 SRAM {{expanded}} the Double Tap technology {{from the original}} drop <b>handlebars</b> to flat <b>handlebars</b> on flat bar road bikes.|$|R
50|$|A European {{city bike}} has angled-back <b>handlebars</b> {{and an upright}} riding position. The <b>handlebars,</b> similar to the North Road style <b>handlebars,</b> have a {{moderate}} rise and are swept back toward the body, enabling a fully upright posture similar to a person walking. The rider is easily visible to other traffic and can easily see traffic and hazards.|$|R
25|$|Moto Guzzis {{have used}} an {{hydraulic}} integrated brake system, where the right front disc works off the <b>handlebar</b> lever, while the left {{front and the}} rear disc work off the foot brake.|$|E

5000|$|Renthal {{has always}} had ties with the {{manufacturers}} of motocross motorcycles and ATV's such as Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha, Suzuki, and KTM. In 2004, Honda became the first manufacturer to fit Renthal 7/8" [...] aluminium <b>handlebars</b> to their motocross bikes. This {{was also the first}} time that aluminium 7/8" [...] <b>handlebars</b> had been fitted to a motocross bike which typically came with very cheap to produce steel <b>handlebars.</b>|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Aerodynamic <b>Handlebars</b> were developed to increase the competitive cyclists aerodynamic advantage. They place the cyclist in a laid out position with the hands stretched out in front similar to a down hill skier "tuck" position. Research has shown that there are no metabolic changes {{associated with the use of}} aerodynamic <b>handlebars.</b> These findings are contradicted by anecdotal evidence of specific fatigue and pain in regions such as the upper thigh, buttocks and low back. This anecdotal evidence may point out differences not revealed by metabolic testing. In this study the electromyography of the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and low back were recorded during cycling with both aerodynamic <b>handlebars</b> and drop <b>handlebars,</b> Although there was no significant interaction between the two <b>handlebars</b> there was an interaction between the warm-up and exercise phases of the exercise bouts in the rectus femoris and gluteus maximus. These results indicate that there is possibly a differential response to aerodynamic <b>handlebars</b> as compared to drop <b>handlebars</b> but it is not in the area we expected...|$|R

25|$|Larry is {{credited}} with helping to re-popularize the stripped down, tall <b>handlebar,</b> foot clutched, jockey shifted, no front brake or fender, small gas tank, open piped, kick start only, stock rake choppers that prevailed in the 1960s, before long front ends became popular (Larry explained during his first Biker Build-Off, that he preferred nimbleness in a bike so he could ride at high speeds along the mountain switchbacks).|$|E
25|$|Expo 58, {{the first}} major {{international}} fair after World War II, was {{to be held in}} Brussels in 1958. Franklin was invited to make a five-foot high model of TMV, which she started in 1957. Her materials included table tennis balls and plastic bicycle <b>handlebar</b> grips. The Brussels world's fair, with an exhibit of her virus model at the International Science Pavilion, opened on 17 April, one day after she died.|$|E

25|$|The pattern {{returned}} in 2003, Armstrong taking {{first place and}} Ullrich second. Only {{a minute and a}} second separated the two {{at the end of the}} final day in Paris. U.S. Postal won the team time trial on stage four, while Armstrong took stage 15, despite having been knocked off on the ascent to Luz Ardiden, the final climb, when a spectator's bag caught his right <b>handlebar.</b> Ullrich waited for him, which brought Ullrich fair-play honors.|$|E
25|$|The primary modern {{mechanical}} {{actuation mechanism}} uses brake levers coupled to Bowden cables to move brake arms, thus forcing pads against a braking surface. Cable mechanisms are usually less expensive, but may require some maintenance related to exposed {{areas of the}} cable. Other mechanical actuation mechanisms exist: see Coaster brakes for back-pedal actuation mechanisms, and Rod-actuated brakes for a mechanism incorporating metal rods. The first Spoon brakes were actuated by a cable that was pulled by twisting {{the end of a}} <b>handlebar.</b>|$|E
50|$|The dandy horse, or draisienne, {{invented by}} Karl von Drais {{and the first}} vehicle with two wheels {{arranged}} in tandem, was controlled by a bar connected to the front steering mechanism and held by the riders' two hands. The first <b>handlebars</b> were solid bars of steel or wood, depending on the manufacturer. Curved, moustache-shaped, drop <b>handlebars</b> became popular in the 1880s and were invented by Percy Stenton of Ardwick, Manchester. Whatton bars were developed in attempt to improve the safety of penny-farthings. <b>Handlebars</b> made of wood, instead of steel, were used on safety bicycles to reduce weight in the 1890s. Although aluminum {{had been used to}} make bicycles as early as 1935, it was considered unsafe for <b>handlebars</b> until Cinelli produced them in 1963.|$|R
