5|$|While at a Scabbard and Blade honors society {{conference in}} New Orleans, Louisiana, Shoup heard {{a speech by}} Major General John A. Lejeune, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, {{offering}} commissions in the U.S. Marine Corps to interested officer candidates. Shortly after being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve in May 1926, Shoup applied, and was offered a commission in the Marine Corps. In August 1926 he resigned his commission in the Army and traveled from Camp Knox, Kentucky, to Chicago, Illinois, for physical exams. On 25 August 1926, {{he arrived at the}} Marine Corps barracks at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and commenced Marine Officers Basic School. Shoup maintained that he had never previously considered a military career and had only chosen to become a military officer for the pay. Throughout his service, he excelled in athletics and marksmanship, and during his early career he would coach recreational athletic teams in addition to his regular assignments. He quickly established himself as an assertive and demanding leader, impressing both his commanders and his subordinates. Despite his no-nonsense demeanor, those he commanded later recalled his ability to keep morale with <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> He often sported a clenched cigar, which became something of a trademark during his front-line service.|$|E

Calhoun in 1828, and Wilson and Marshall became the first president and vice president team to be re-elected since Monroe and Tompkins in 1820.|$|E

500|$|Sommerfeld {{recommended}} Bethe for a Rockefeller Foundation Travelling Scholarship in 1929. This provided $150 a month (about $,000 in [...] dollars) {{to study}} abroad. In 1930, Bethe {{chose to do}} postdoctoral work at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England, where he worked {{under the supervision of}} Ralph Fowler. At the request of Patrick Blackett, who was working with cloud chambers, Bethe created a relativistic version of the Bethe formula. Bethe was also known for <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> and with Guido Beck and Wolfgang Riezler, two other postdoctoral research fellows, created a hoax paper On the Quantum Theory of the Temperature of Absolute Zero where he calculated the fine structure constant from the absolute zero temperature in Celsius units. [...] The paper poked fun at a certain class of papers in theoretical physics of the day, which were purely speculative and based on spurious numerical arguments such as Arthur Eddington's attempts to explain the value of the fine structure constant from fundamental quantities in an earlier paper. They were forced to issue an apology.|$|E

500|$|Critic Robert Christgau, {{writing in}} Esquire of Pleasures of the Harbor in May 1968, did not {{consider}} this new direction a good turn. While describing Ochs as [...] "unquestionably a nice guy", {{he went on to}} say, [...] "too bad his voice shows an effective range of about half an octave [...] his guitar playing would not suffer much if his right hand were webbed." [...] "Pleasures of the Harbor", Christgau continued, [...] "epitomizes the decadence that has infected pop since Sgt. Pepper. [...] gaudy musical settings ... inspire nostalgia for the three-chord strum." [...] With an ironic sense of humor, Ochs included Christgau's [...] "webbed hand" [...] comment in his 1968 songbook The War is Over on a page titled [...] "The Critics Raved", opposite a full-page picture of Ochs standing in a large metal garbage can. Despite <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> Ochs was unhappy that his work was not receiving the critical acclaim and popular success he had hoped for. Still, Ochs would joke on the back cover of Greatest Hits that there were 50 Phil Ochs fans ("50 fans can't be wrong!"), a sarcastic reference to an Elvis Presley album that bragged of 50 million Elvis fans.|$|E
500|$|When {{starting}} serialization the manga was unpopular and {{was close}} to being cancelled. Although Sorachi {{was pleased with the}} first tankÅbon selling all of its copies, he later learned Shueisha was afraid of poor sales which resulted in the minimum printed. In order to increase its popularity, the author introduce new characters, the Shinsengumi, who felt memorable to his assistants. [...] Sorachi had little hope on the manga's popularity, as he noted that people used to tell him the manga would not surpass the number of two tankÅbon volumes. However, once the third volume was released, Sorachi found {{that he did not have}} [...] "any fresh material to use." [...] During the first year of the series, Sorachi believed that the source of the popularity of Gin Tama was partially connected to the Shinsengumi drama. While the drama ran during the first year of the series, when the manga was mostly shorter stories that established the characters and the world, he felt uncomfortable of making things related to the drama. By the second year and beyond, he became more daring in his stories and concepts, creating longer storylines that included more drama while keeping <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and satirization of modern Japan by way of his fictionalized past. Although Sorachi has already planned the series' ending, he is not sure when the manga is going to reach that point due to the characters requiring development to behave the way he wants.|$|E
