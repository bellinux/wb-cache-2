Giammarinaro was the drafter of the first proposal for a <b>Framework</b> <b>Decision</b> on Trafficking, subsequently transformed into a Directive, and is widely regarded as one of the main actors in the negotiation leading to the adoption of Directive 2011/36 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting its victims. Importantly, for the first time, an EU Directive in penal matters included strengthened victim provisions regarding victims’ rights in criminal proceedings, assistance and support before, during and after criminal proceedings, and special protective provisions for child victims.|$|E
500|$|Recently the Commission {{has moved}} into {{creating}} European criminal law. In 2006, a toxic waste spill {{off the coast of}} Côte d'Ivoire, from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. Some EU states at that time did not even have a crime against shipping toxic waste leading to the Commissioners Franco Frattini and Stavros Dimas to put forward the idea of [...] "ecological crimes". Their right to propose criminal law was challenged in the European Court of Justice but upheld. As of 2007, the only other criminal law proposals which have been brought forward are on the intellectual property rights directive, and on an amendment to the 2002 counter-terrorism <b>framework</b> <b>decision,</b> outlawing terrorism‑related incitement, recruitment (especially via the internet) and training.|$|E

Scope: Requires Member States to implement the provisions of the <b>Framework</b> <b>Decision</b> in their national legal frameworks. <b>Framework</b> <b>decision</b> is relevant to RM/RA because it contains the conditions under which legal liability can be imposed on legal entities for conduct of certain natural persons of authority within the legal entity.

40|$|Two recent {{decisions}} of the European Court of Justice {{in the field of}} criminal sanctions have raised a considerable amount of academic interest. Its decision in Case C- 176 / 03 Commission v Council (Environmental Legislation Litigation) confirmed the Community has the implied power to harmonise criminal laws in relation to other Treaty competences. Its earlier decision in Case C- 105 / 03 Pupino established a requirement of sympathetic interpretation in relation to Union third pillar <b>framework</b> <b>decisions,</b> furthering the legal impact of instruments which {{on the basis of the}} Treaty on European Union were previously thought to be incapable of supranational legal effects. However revolutionary both of these decisions may seem, this paper will consider the limitations inherent in both Community and Union legal orders as well as these and subsequent cases that mitigate the practical effects of these judgments. It will discuss the legal circumstances under which the Communautizing effects of Case C- 176 / 03 are applicable and proceed to examine the remaining limitations of Union <b>framework</b> <b>decisions</b> in the field of criminal law. Whilst the ECJ has developed the notion of Community criminal competence, this paper will demonstrate that its effects are primarily upon the vertical division of competences in the Union rather than on the criminal law liability of individuals. This is in part because the ECJ has maintained in Berlusconi and other recent cases its position that Community directives and Union <b>framework</b> <b>decisions</b> are incapable of detrimentally affecting defendants’ legal rights, and in part because a number of developments raise questions as to the feasibility of directly applicable criminal law Regulations...|$|R
40|$|The <b>framework</b> <b>decisions,</b> as {{the central}} legal act under the “third pillar” {{are some of the}} most {{significant}} non-typical documents from a dogmatic point of view within the EU law. The differences and specialities of this legislative act, correlated with the EC Treaty are available not only in the lawmaking process, but in juridical supervision as well. The main goal of this paper is to show the dogmatic and practical aspects of these two perspectives. First of all it is necessary to predict, why the <b>framework</b> <b>decisions</b> are not products of classic public international law (according to the position of the German Federal Constitutional Court), rather than special documents, and do they consequently belong to a supranational system. The missing infringement procedure within the police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters makes the judicial control of the Member State’s effective enlargement extremely difficult. Secondly it is important to demonstrate the alternative methods of the ECJ, which is based on case law from the Court of Luxembourg, in the field of the directives. In this context the study will analyze the consequences of the important “Pupino” Judgment...|$|R
