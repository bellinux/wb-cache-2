40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{establishment}} of KIR SA was to build and standardise the interbank clearing system. It was intended to include exchange and recording of payment transfers and identificate mutual liabilities, as well as presentation of clearing results between banks active in Poland to the National Bank of Poland. On the 22 nd of November 1991 representatives of 16 founding banks, including National Bank of Poland and the Polish Bank Association signed the notarial deed of the National Clearing House C. o. which stipulated the company’s statue and governing bodies. The KIR SA organisation’s structure comprises the 1 -Iead Office in Warsaw and 17 Bank Regional Clearing Houses (BRIR) in the Poland’s province capitals and in Koszalin. In National Clearing House C. o. there are 2 basic clearing systems: The SYBIR system - paper-based or traditional and the ELIXIR system - the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Clearing</b> System. While the SYBIR system in Polish banks was an immense leap as compared with practices, {{it could not be}} treated to be the only and final solution, primarily due to its non-electronic” nature. Therefore, KIR SA undertook in the very begining the preparations for a fully <b>electronic</b> <b>clearing</b> system. The ELIXIR system was presented in its complete form to the KIR SA Management Board by Unisys as early as September 1993. The ELIXIR system became operational on 18 April, 1994 linking 37 branches of eight banks. As a result of implementation of the process of widespread migration to electronic interbank transactions, as of July 1997 all of the National Clearing House C. o. members use the modern <b>electronic</b> <b>clearing</b> system.
