40|$|The {{production}} of glass/plant fiber hybrid laminates {{is a possibility}} for obtaining semistructural materials with sufficient impact properties, and a better life cycle analysis (LCA) profile than fiberglass. The simplest and possibly the most effective configuration for the pro-duction of these hybrids would involve {{the use of a}} plant fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>laminate</b> as the core between two <b>glass</b> fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>laminates.</b> A main limitation to the use of composites including plant fibers is that their properties may be significantly affected by the presence of damage, so that even the application of a low stress level can result in laminate failure.

Laser fusion joining is eval-uated as a potential process to replace mechanical reinforcements used in conventional laminate composite fabrication.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, an {{automated}} method for prediction {{of the long-term}} (creep rupture) behavior of multilayer pipes under hydrostatic pressure is presented. For long-term extrapolation, a combined quadratic and linear regression analysis is used. This procedure is automated in the pipe software called automated design and analysis of pipes (ADAP) for design and analysis of pipelines. Two examples showing this procedure using the software ADAP are presented {{and the results are}} compared with the existing international standards. Through this study, a new automated procedure for the extrapolation of the long-term hydrostatic strength of thermoplastic and fiber reinforced pipes is presented. Hence the arbitrary action of defining a sharp knee becomes redundant. Moreover, instead of a computational but physically non-plausible sharp knee, a transition zone between the ductile and the brittle behavior at a higher temperature is obtained. This automated method and the inherent novel features may be of use in the revisions of the existing international standards.
