The cross-referencing technique suggested herein was used to predict EURO currency based on the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>relations</b> modeled by using Artificial Neural Networks.

40|$|The {{majority}} of general equilibrium models of international portfolio holdings differ substantially in their modeling procedures but typically feature {{a term that}} captures the relationship between real exchange rate changes and relative, i. e. home vs. foreign, equity market returns.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} characteristics of the world economy today is the enormous, ever worsening US balance of payments current account deficit, which reached a record level of 5. 7 p. c. of GDP in 2004. This has given rise to concerns in academic and political circles regarding the sustainability of the current situation and the potential dangers for the global economy of a sudden, disorderly adjustment. The size of the US current account deficit is not only unprecedented in American post-war history, but it also seems to be exceptional from an international perspective. Moreover, the US deficit contrasts with a surplus in virtually every other region and the problem has consequently taken on a global dimension. The increase in the US current account deficit recorded in the nineties reflects an internal American shortfall in savings. Whereas the private savings-investment equilibrium was restored in 2002 and 2003, the same period saw a huge deficit in the public sector budget. The start of the new millennium brought notable changes in the way the US current account deficit was financed since investments by Asian public authorities in American government debt instruments largely took over the position previously occupied by European private foreign direct investments and investments in equities. It is sometimes put forward that the US, unlike other countries facing similar circumstances, is safeguarded from an attack on its currency because of its prominent role in the international financial system. According to an influential school of thought in economic literature, the current international system can even be seen as a “revived” Bretton Woods system. Indeed, a number of East-Asian countries, including China, use a fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate against the dollar, which brings to mind an informal dollar standard. Although this set of circumstances has undoubtedly offered various regions in the world a number of mutual benefits during recent years, these <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>relations</b> may nevertheless have caused some distortions in US spending, whereas Asian countries have to deal with a growing exchange rate risk on their official reserves. Different scenarios are conceivable to deal with the global imbalances. The results of model simulations show the huge effort required to significantly reduce the US current account deficit which highlights the scale of the problem, emphasising the need for simultaneous economic policy measures in the different economies involved. The concern over global imbalances and the development of exchange rates also feature prominently on the agenda of international forums such as the G 7 or G 20 meetings. In the statements issued at those meetings, the need for a common approach to tackle the global imbalances is given priority and the belief that excessive exchange rate volatility is not desirable is underlined. current account imbalances, United States current account, financial flows into the United States, international monetary system...|$|E

We applied {{asymmetric}} cointegration approachtoinvestigate {{the impacts}} of stock prices on <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> in South Africa using monthly data from January 1980 to May 2014. The empirical finding shows that the two macroeconomic variables are cointegrated using traditional Engle-Granger approach. While TAR model shows no element of cointegration, MTAR model revealsthat there is long-run relationshipbetween the variables and they are asymmetrically cointegrated as signifies by both F-equality and F-joint respectively. Using Enders & Siklos (2001) table we reject null hypothesis of no cointegration at 5 % significance level. This means that stock prices influences <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> in South Africa and the speed of adjustment is non-linear, when share price changes <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> equally changes {{but not in the}} same proportion with that of share prices.

40|$|When does trade {{become a}} one-way relationship? We study {{bilateral}} trade balances for {{a sample of}} 18 European countries over the period from 1948 through 2008. We find that, {{with the introduction of}} the euro, trade imbalances among euro area members widened considerably, even after allowing for permanent asymmetries in trade competitiveness within pairs of countries or in the overall trade competitiveness of individual countries. This is consistent with indications that pair-wise trade tends to be more balanced when nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> are flexible. Intra-euro area imbalances also seem to have become more persistent with the introduction of the euro, some of which is linked to labor market inflexibility. Reviewing the direction of imbalances, we find that bilateral trade surpluses are decreasing in the real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> decreasing in growth differentials, and increasing in the relative volatility of national business cycles. Finally, countries with relatively higher fiscal deficits and less flexible labor and product markets exhibit systematically lower trade surpluses than others.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A physio-ecological {{study of}} Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. {{was done to}} {{determine}} if geographic variation occurred within the species. Lobaria pulmonaria was collected from Table Mountain, Oak Creek, and Lost Prairie, located in the Coast Range, Willamette Valley, and Cascade Range respectively in Western Oregon. During 1971 and 1972 experiments were conducted to determine physical and chemical characteristics, thallus water content-water potential relations, and metabolic oxygen <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> in <b>relation</b> to light intensity, temperature, relative water content (RWC), and water potential. No differences were observed in the morphology, thallus area-density, presence of stictic and norstictic acids, chlorophyll concentrations, or metabolic response to temperature among the three populations of L. pulmonaria. However, results of other experiments indicated the possibility that L. pulmonaria has evolved intraspecific differences between the Oak Creek population and the montane groups. The Oak Creek population, situated in the most xeric habitat, showed a slow decrease in water potential as the plant lost water (- 0. 9 bars /...|$|R
40|$|The Australian dollar’s <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> (mainly in <b>relation</b> to the American dollar) has {{received}} a considerable attention in research and several models have been proposed to explain its trend and fluctuations. Thus, as a conclusion of this research {{we can say that}} this commodity currency very much depends on the terms of trade which in turn depend on commodity prices. The present paper is based on this conclusion and hence proposes the possibility that the Australian dollar’s behavior is overwhelmingly explained by a handful of cycles of mainly harmonic frequencies. Using the principles of Fourier analysis, a simple regression provides considerable evidence about the existence of these cycles. In addition, and as important, a search into the commodity realm demonstrates that these cycles are for example related to various cycles of mining and producing minerals. If the proposition of the present paper is true, we have a very simple yet substantial explanation of the long term trend and fluctuations of the Australian dollar <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and probably of <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of many other commodity currencies.
