5|$|Since {{the kidneys}} are {{the site of}} {{potassium}} excretion, individuals with impaired kidney function {{are at risk for}} <b>hyperkalemia</b> if dietary potassium and supplements are not restricted. The more severe the impairment, the more severe is the restriction necessary to avoid <b>hyperkalemia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs can cause {{abnormally}} high {{blood levels of}} potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause <b>hyperkalemia</b> by themselves {{in the setting of}} normal renal function and euvolemic state.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium cyclosilicate {{is under}} {{investigation}} for oral therapy {{in the treatment of}} <b>hyperkalemia.</b> It is a highly selective oral sorbent designed specifically to trap potassium ions in preference to other ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{reactive}} nature of potassium metal, it must be handled with great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. Ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to <b>hyperkalemia</b> strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. Potassium chloride {{is used in the}} United States for lethal injection executions.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium {{is not recommended}} for muscular paralysis as it may {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from <b>hyperkalemia</b> associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is treated and survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, <b>hyperkalemia,</b> seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{causes of}} <b>hyperkalemia</b> are {{discussed}} as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause <b>hyperkalemia</b> through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause <b>hyperkalemia</b> in infants due to leakage of potassium {{out of the}} red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine tn patients with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause <b>hyperkalemia</b> due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing <b>hyperkalemia.</b> Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, diazoxide, and minoxidil can cause <b>hyperkalemia.</b> Box jellyfish venom can also cause <b>hyperkalemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|ECG {{findings}} {{are not a}} reliable finding in <b>hyperkalemia.</b> In a retrospective review, blinded cardiologists documented peaked T-waves in only 3 of 90 ECGs with <b>hyperkalemia.</b> Sensitivity of peaked-Ts for <b>hyperkalemia</b> ranged from 0.18 to 0.52 depending on the criteria for peak-T waves.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{can cause}} <b>hyperkalemia,</b> which can, rarely, be fatal. Of those {{prescribed}} typical doses, 10% to 15% developed <b>hyperkalemia,</b> and in 6%, it was severe. An {{increase in the}} rates of hospitalization (from 0.2% to 11%) and death (from 0.3 per 1,000 to 2.0 per 1,000) due to <b>hyperkalemia</b> from 1994 to 2001 {{has been attributed to}} a parallel {{rise in the number of}} prescriptions written for spironolactone following the publication of the RALES study. The risk of <b>hyperkalemia</b> with spironolactone treatment is greatest in the elderly, in people with renal impairment, and in people simultaneously taking potassium supplements or ACE inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Potassium accumulates in {{the blood}} (<b>hyperkalemia</b> {{with a range of}} {{symptoms}} including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias). <b>Hyperkalemia</b> usually does not develop until the glomerular filtration rate falls to less than 20–25 ml/min/1.73 m2, at which point the kidneys have decreased ability to excrete potassium. <b>Hyperkalemia</b> in CKD can be exacerbated by acidemia (which leads to extracellular shift of potassium) and from lack of insulin.|$|E
25|$|Although {{spironolactone}} poses {{an important}} risk of <b>hyperkalemia</b> in the elderly, those with renal or cardiovascular disease, or those taking drugs or supplements which increase circulating potassium levels, {{the rate of}} <b>hyperkalemia</b> in young women without such characteristics treated with spironolactone for dermatological conditions has been found not to differ from that of controls. This suggests that <b>hyperkalemia</b> is not a significant risk in such patients and that routine monitoring of circulating potassium levels is unnecessary in this population.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{intake of}} {{potassium}} {{is not a}} primary cause of <b>hyperkalemia</b> because the human body usually can adapt to {{the rise in the}} potassium levels by increasing the excretion of potassium into urine through aldosterone hormone secretion and increasing the number of potassium secreting channels in kidney tubules. Acute <b>hyperkalemia</b> in infants is also rare even though their body volume is small, with accidental ingestion of potassium salts or potassium medications. <b>Hyperkalemia</b> usually develops when there are other co-morbidities such as hypoaldosteronism and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
25|$|For example, peaked T waves is not {{sufficient}} to diagnose <b>hyperkalemia</b> and should be verified by measuring the blood potassium level; inversely, discover of <b>hyperkalemia</b> should be followed by an ECG for manifestations such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, and loss of P waves.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications of {{spironolactone}} include {{renal disease}} and <b>hyperkalemia</b> (high levels of potassium), among others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperkalemia</b> (high {{concentration}} of potassium in the blood) is another possible complication of treatment with an ACE inhibitor {{due to its}} effect on aldosterone. Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone levels. Since aldosterone is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium. Some people, however, can continue to lose potassium while on an ACE inhibitor. <b>Hyperkalemia</b> may decrease the velocity of impulse conduction in the nerves and muscles, including cardiac tissues. This leads to cardiac dysfunction and neuromuscular consequences, such as muscle weakness, paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, and others. Close monitoring of potassium levels is required in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors {{who are at risk}} of <b>hyperkalemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Metabolic acidosis, <b>hyperkalemia,</b> and {{pulmonary}} edema may require medical treatment with sodium bicarbonate, antihyperkalemic measures, and diuretics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperkalemia,</b> also spelled hyperkalaemia, is an {{elevated}} level of potassium (K+) {{in the blood}} serum. Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L (3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L) with levels above 5.5mmol/L defined as <b>hyperkalemia.</b> Typically this results in no symptoms. Occasionally when severe it results in palpitations, muscle pain, muscle weakness, or numbness. An abnormal heart rate can occur which can result in cardiac arrest and death.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{sorbitol}} added to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, used {{in the treatment of}} <b>hyperkalemia)</b> can cause complications in the GI tract, including bleeding, perforated colonic ulcers, ischemic colitis and colonic necrosis, particularly in patients with uremia. Risk factors for sorbitol-induced damage include immunosuppression, hypovolemia, postoperative setting, hypotension after hemodialysis, and peripheral vascular disease. SPS-sorbitol should therefore be used carefully in the management of <b>hyperkalemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Salbutamol {{has been}} used to treat acute <b>hyperkalemia,</b> as it stimulates {{potassium}} flow into cells, thus lowering the level in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{improvement}} with fluid resuscitation, therapy-resistant <b>hyperkalemia,</b> metabolic acidosis, or fluid overload may necessitate artificial {{support in the}} form of dialysis or hemofiltration.|$|E
25|$|With mild to {{moderate}} <b>hyperkalemia,</b> there is prolongation of the PR interval and development of peaked T waves. Severe <b>hyperkalemia</b> results in a widening of the QRS complex, and the ECG complex can evolve to a sinusoidal shape. There {{appears to be a}} direct effect of elevated potassium on some of the potassium channels that increases their activity and speeds membrane repolarization. Also, (as noted above), <b>hyperkalemia</b> causes an overall membrane depolarization that inactivates many sodium channels. The faster repolarization of the cardiac action potential causes the tenting of the T waves, and the inactivation of sodium channels causes a sluggish conduction of the electrical wave around the heart, which leads to smaller P waves and widening of the QRS complex. Some of potassium currents are sensitive to extracellular potassium levels, for reasons that are not well understood. As the extracellular potassium levels increase, potassium conductance is increased so that more potassium leaves the myocyte in any given time period.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{captopril}} include cough due {{to increase in}} the plasma levels of bradykinin, angioedema, agranulocytosis, proteinuria, <b>hyperkalemia,</b> taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia.|$|E
25|$|Type 4 RTA is not {{actually}} a tubular disorder at all {{nor does it}} have a clinical syndrome similar to the other types of RTA described above. It was included in the classification of renal tubular acidoses as it is associated with a mild (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis due to a physiological reduction in proximal tubular ammonium excretion (impaired ammoniagenesis), which is secondary to hypoaldosteronism, and results in a decrease in urine buffering capacity. Its cardinal feature is <b>hyperkalemia,</b> and measured urinary acidification is normal, hence it is often called hyperkalemic RTA or tubular <b>hyperkalemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} potential {{side effect of}} spironolactone is <b>hyperkalemia</b> (high potassium levels), which, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. <b>Hyperkalemia</b> in these patients can present as a non anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Spironolactone may put patients at a heightened risk for gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and gastritis. In addition, {{there has been some}} evidence suggesting an association between use of the drug and bleeding from the stomach and duodenum, though a causal relationship between the two has not been established. Also, spironolactone {{has been shown to be}} immunosuppressive in the treatment of sarcoidosis.|$|E
25|$|Elevations of serum {{creatinine}} {{and more}} serious renal damage such as acute renal failure, chronic nephritis and nephrotic syndrome, are also possible. These conditions also often begin with edema and <b>hyperkalemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{with some}} other diuretics, {{potassium}} supplementation should not be administered while taking spironolactone, as this may cause dangerous elevations in serum potassium levels resulting in <b>hyperkalemia</b> and potentially deadly abnormal heart rhythms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperkalemia</b> {{develops}} {{when there}} is excessive production (oral intake, tissue breakdown) or ineffective elimination of potassium. Ineffective elimination can be hormonal (in aldosterone deficiency) or due to causes in the kidney parenchyma that impair excretion.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol reduces bone formation, favoring {{long-term}} {{development of}} osteoporosis (progressive bone disease). It transports potassium {{out of cells}} in exchange for {{an equal number of}} sodium ions (see above). This can trigger the <b>hyperkalemia</b> of metabolic shock from surgery. Cortisol also reduces calcium absorption in the intestine.|$|E
25|$|As ill {{as these}} infants can be, they respond rapidly to {{treatment}} with hydrocortisone and intravenous saline and dextrose quickly restores blood volume, blood pressure, and body sodium content, and reverses the <b>hyperkalemia.</b> With appropriate treatment, most infants {{are out of}} danger within 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{can also}} have {{numerous}} other interactions, most commonly with other cardiac and blood pressure medications. Spironolactone together with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole {{increases the likelihood of}} <b>hyperkalemia,</b> especially in the elderly. The trimethoprim portion acts to prevent potassium excretion in the distal tubule of the nephron.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{lowering}} of potassium levels is needed when new arrhythmias occur {{at any level}} of potassium in the blood, or when potassium levels exceed 6.5mmol/l. Several agents are used to transiently lower K+ levels. The choice depends on the degree and cause of the <b>hyperkalemia,</b> {{and other aspects of}} the person's condition.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{acidosis}} (due to {{accumulation of}} sulfates, phosphates, uric acid etc.) may cause altered enzyme activity by excess acid acting on enzymes; and also increased excitability of cardiac and neuronal membranes by {{the promotion of}} <b>hyperkalemia</b> due to excess acid (acidemia). Acidosis is also due to decreased capacity to generate enough ammonia from {{the cells of the}} proximal tubule.|$|E
25|$|Calcium (calcium {{chloride}} or calcium gluconate) increases {{threshold potential}} through a mechanism {{that is still}} unclear, thus restoring normal gradient between threshold potential and resting membrane potential, which is elevated abnormally in <b>hyperkalemia.</b> A standard ampule of 10% calcium chloride is 10 mL and contains 6.8mmol of calcium. A standard ampule of 10% calcium gluconate is also 10 mL but has only 2.26mmol of calcium. Clinical practice guidelines recommend giving 6.8mmol for typical EKG findings of <b>hyperkalemia.</b> This is 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride or 30 mL of 10% calcium gluconate. Though calcium chloride is more concentrated, it is caustic to the veins and should only be given through a central line. Onset of action is less than one to three minutes and lasts about 30–60 minutes. The goal of treatment is to normalize the EKG and doses can be repeated if the EKG does not improve within a few minutes.|$|E
25|$|Losartan is a uricosuric. As a {{specific}} inhibitor of the urate transporter 1 (SLC22A12, URAT1), losartan blocks the uptake of uric acid into cells, thus leaving more {{available in the}} bloodstream to be filtered and excreted by the kidneys. Because losartan can cause <b>hyperkalemia,</b> individuals should not use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without appropriate monitoring by a physician.|$|E
25|$|Preventing {{recurrence}} of <b>hyperkalemia</b> typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or {{the addition of}} a diuretic (such as furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide). Sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol (combined as Kayexalate) are occasionally used on an ongoing basis to maintain lower serum levels of potassium though the safety of long-term use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for this purpose is not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Salt-wasting {{in early}} infancy {{does not occur}} in most cases of 11β-OH CAH but can occur because of {{impaired}} production of aldosterone aggravated by inefficiency of salt conservation in early infancy. When it occurs it resembles the salt-wasting of severe 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH: poor weight gain and vomiting in the first weeks of life progress and culminate in life-threatening dehydration, hyponatremia, <b>hyperkalemia,</b> and metabolic acidosis in the first month.|$|E
