40|$|This is {{a theory}} {{about the origin of}} human beings that {{combines}} the creation of man and woman by God with the theory of evolution. An explanation is given to reconcile the creation story in Scripture with scientific observation. Evolution is considered as a useful theory of the development of life on earth. A solution is given for the conflict between the continuity of Homo sapiens coming forward to today’s human beings, and our creation by God. Recent scientific literature concerning archaeology and origins, etc., which is usually interpreted as showing continuity of Homo sapiens, was searched for indications that God’s created man and woman replaced Homo sapiens. The major ecological effects of the Ice Age and early Holocene are considered as likely major factors in the transition from Homo sapiens to created man and woman around the world.

40|$|We {{show that}} the masses of red giant stars can be well {{predicted}} from their photospheric carbon and nitrogen abundances, in conjunction with their spectroscopic stellar labels log g, Teff, and [Fe/H]. This is qualitatively expected from mass-dependent post main sequence evolution. We here establish an empirical relation between these quantities by drawing on 1, 475 red giants with asteroseismic mass estimates from Kepler that also have spectroscopic labels from APOGEE DR 12. We assess the accuracy of our model, and find that it predicts stellar masses with fractional r. m. s. errors of about 14 % (typically 0. 2 Msun). From these masses, we derive ages with r. m. s errors of 40 %. This empirical model allows us {{for the first time}} to make age determinations (in the range 1 - 13 Gyr) for vast numbers of giant stars across the Galaxy. We apply our model to 52, 000 stars in APOGEE DR 12, for which no direct mass and age information was previously available. We find that these estimates highlight the vertical age structure of the Milky Way disk, and that the relation of age with [alpha/M] and metallicity is broadly consistent with established expectations based on detailed studies of the solar neighbourhood.

40|$|The {{power and}} {{communication}} networks are highly interdependent {{and form a}} part of the critical infrastructure of a country. Similarly, dependencies exist within the networks itself. It is essential to have a model which captures these dependencies precisely. Previous research has proposed certain models but these models have certain limitations. The limitations of the aforementioned models have been overcome by the Implicative Interdependency Model, which uses Boolean Logic to denote the dependencies. This paper formulates the Entity Hardening problem and the Targeted Entity Hardening problem using the Implicative Interdependency Model. The Entity Hardening problem describes a situation where an operator, with a limited budget, must decide which entities to harden, which in turn would minimize the damage, provided a set of entities fail initially. The Targeted Entity Hardening problem is a restricted version of the Entity Hardening problem. This problem presents a scenario where, the protection of certain entities is of higher priority. If these entities were to be nonfunctional, the economic and societal damage would be higher when compared to other entities being nonfunctional. It has been shown that both problems are NP-Complete. An Integer Linear Program (ILP) has been devised to find the optimal solution. A heuristic has been described whose accuracy is found by comparing its performance with the optimal solution using real-world and simulated data.

40|$|We apply a friends-of-friends {{algorithm}} to {{an enhanced}} SDSS DR 12 spectroscopic catalog including redshift from literature {{to construct a}} catalog of 1588 N> 3 compact groups of galaxies containing 5179 member galaxies and covering the redshift range 0. 01 < z < 0. 19. This catalog contains 18 times as many systems and reaches 3 times the depth of similar catalog of Barton et al. (1996). We construct catalogs from both magnitude-limited and volume-limited galaxy samples. Like Barton et al. (1996) we omit the frequently applied isolation criterion in the compact group selection algorithm. Thus the groups selected by fixed projected spatial and rest frame line-of-sight velocity separation produce a catalog of groups with a redshift independent median size. In contrast with previous catalogs, the enhanced SDSS DR 12 catalog (including galaxies with r < 14. 5) includes many systems with z≤ 0. 05. The volume-limited samples are unique to this study. The compact group candidates in these samples have a median stellar mass independent of redshift. Groups with velocity dispersion ≤ 100 km s^- 1 show abundant evidence for ongoing dynamical interactions among the members. The number density of the volume-limited catalogs agrees with previous catalogs at the lowest redshifts but decreases as the redshift increases. The SDSS fiber placement constraints limit the catalog completeness. In spite of this issue the volume-limited catalogs provide a promising basis for detailed spatially resolved probes {{of the impact of}} galaxy-galaxy interactions within similar dense systems over a broad redshift range.

We present LBT MODS observations of 109 Hii regions in NGC 5457, of which 74 have robust measurements of key auroral lines, a factor of 3 larger than all previous published detections of auroral lines in the HII regions of NGC 5457. Comparing the temperatures derived from the different ionic species we find: (1) strong correlations of T[NII] with T[SIII] and T[OIII], consistent {{with little or no}} intrinsic scatter; (2) a correlation of T[SIII] with T[OIII], but with significant intrinsic dispersion; (3) overall agreement between T[NII], T[SII], and T[OII], as expected, but with significant outliers; (4) the correlations of T[NII] with T[SIII] and T[OIII] match the predictions of photoionization modeling while the correlation of T[SIII] with T[OIII] is offset from the prediction of photoionization modeling. Based on these observations, which include significantly more observations of lower excitation HII regions, missing in many analyses, we inspect the commonly used ionization correction factors (ICFs) for unobserved ionic species and propose new empirical ICFs for S and Ar. We have discovered an unexpected population of HII regions with a significant offset to low values in Ne/O, which defies explanation. We derive radial gradients in O/H and N/O which agree with previous studies. Our large observational database allows us to examine the dispersion in abundances, and we find intrinsic dispersions of 0. 074 in O/H and 0. 095 in N/O (at a given radius). We stress that this measurement of the intrinsic dispersion comes exclusively from direct measurements of HII regions in NGC 5457.

40|$|In this paper, {{we aim at}} {{solving the}} Biot model under {{stabilized}} finite element discretizations. To solve the resulting generalized saddle point linear systems, some iterative methods are proposed and compared. In the first method, we apply the GMRES algorithm as the outer iteration. In the second method, the Uzawa method with variable relaxation parameters is employed as the outer iteration method. In the third approach, Uzawa method is treated as a fixed-point iteration, the outer solver is the so-called Anderson acceleration. In all these methods, the inner solvers are preconditioners for the generalized saddle point problem. In the preconditioners, the Schur complement approximation is derived by using Fourier analysis approach. These preconditioners are implemented exactly or inexactly. Extensive experiments are given to justify {{the performance of the}} proposed preconditioners and to compare all the algorithms. Comment: to <b>be</b> <b>accepte...</b>|$|R

In this case, the writer discusses about the students‘ knowledge of regular and irregular verbs and their ability in writing active and passivesentence. The objectives of the research are to find out the students‘ knowledge of regular and irregular verbs, to find out the students‘ ability in writing activeand passivesentence, and to find out the correlation between the students‘ knowledge of regular and irregular verbs and their ability in writing active and passivesentence. To find out all the data in this research, the writer has used quantitative approach. It means that the data which is obtained from the field of the research then analyzed statistically by means of numbers by using Pearson‘s Product Moment Formulation. The population of the research is all the second year students atSMPN 8 Cirebon. The amount of them comes to 242 students. As a sample of the research is 60 students. The result of the test shows that the average score of the students‘ knowledge of regular and irregular verbs as X variable is 7. 9. The score 7. 9 can be rounded into 8. This score is assumed as ―good‖. It means that the students‘ knowledge of regular and irregular verbs can be considered as ―good‖. And the average score of the students‘ ability in writing activeand passive sentence as Y variable is 7. 1. The score 7. 1 can be rounded into 7. It can be assumed that the students‘ ability in writing activeand passive sentence can be considered as ―sufficient‖. The result of coefficient correlation is 0. 46.

40|$|The {{internal}} {{states or}} local structures of bulk metallic glass (BMGs) can be well reflected from the changes of density, structural relaxation {{as well as}} the elastic constants. With the increasing free volume (FV) content, more local atomic clusters are capable of simultaneous plastic shear at different sites in the metallic glasses, inducing large plasticity. In this work, we report a close correlation between the internal states and strength in a BMG and discover that the yield strength can be changed by varying of the casting current, revealing that the yielding strength of BMGs is not only intrinsically associated with the glass transition, but also with the internal states, such as free volume and elastic properties. Such results may have some implications for understanding the correlations between the internal states and mechanical properties of BMGs.

The role of the λφ 4 interaction as a source of the “background phase”, which was essential there, is also discussed. The chiral symmetry and the notion of its dynamical breaking have been playing a central role in understanding the spectroscopy of hadrons with light-quarks. Presently the non-linear representation (Non-Linear σ Model(NLσM)) of chiral SU(2) L×SU(2) R group is widely accepted to be realized in nature {{on the basis of the}} success of low energy theorems concerning π mesons as Nambu-Goldstone bosons. In the simplest linear representation 1) (Linear σ Model(LσM)) of the chiral symmetry, an iso-singlet scalar particle, as a chiral partner of π, the σ meson, is required to exist in the effective Lagrangian. Both LσM and NLσM satisfy the current algebra and PCAC, which lead to the same low-energy ππ scattering amplitude A(s,t,u) in the O(p 2) level of the former in the tree-approximation (of the latter). The possible existence of a rather light σ meson has been inferred from various points of view. 2) ∼ 11) However, experimentally its existence has not <b>been</b> <b>accepte...</b>|$|R
