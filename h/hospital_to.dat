Poppe of Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS), the company which operated one the city tramways.

40|$|Background: During {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} growing a trend to develop and disseminatereport cards {{to the public in}} the {{healthcare}} industries of the UnitedStates. The purposes of this article were to understand the willingness of hospitalsin Taiwan to use report cards and to explore the factors that influencethe willingness of <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> use them. Methods: A postal survey study was conducted on 495 <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> explore factorsinfluencing the willingness of <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> use report cards. A multiple logisticregression was performed to identify statistically significant factors relatedto the willingness of the <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> use report cards. Results: In total, 52. 0 % of the sampled hospitals were "very willing" or "willing" touse report cards. The top three factors which respondents felt most influencedthe willingness of <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> use report cards were the provision forincorrect data, the upgrading of the image of the hospital, and the increase inadministrative costs. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that thewillingness of <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> use report cards was positively significantly associatedwith the score of the factor "to upgrade the image of the hospital" (OR= 8. 0; 95 % CI 1. 8 - 36. 0), and it was negatively associated with the score ofthe factor "to increase the possibility of malpractice suits" (OR = 0. 5; 95 %CI 0. 2 - 0. 9). Conclusions: It was also found {{that more than half of}} <b>hospitals</b> were willing <b>to</b> use reportcards. Thus, it is recommended that mandatory hospital report cards be initiatedin order to allow consumers to make fair and accurate comparisonsamong hospitals...|$|R
