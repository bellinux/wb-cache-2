The key objectives of effective convergence of FTTH and WSN are less computational complexity for data packet processing, low installation cost, and good quality of services. In this paper, we introduce an integrated network structure of multi-optical line terminal (multi-OLT) passive optical network (PON) which can accommodate multiple service providers in a single PON. A modified version of interleaved polling algorithm is proposed for scheduling of control messages from multiple OLTs in a single network. We also provide detailed numerical analysis of cycle time variation, successive grant scheduling time, and average packet delay for both uniform and non-uniform traffic loads generated by each ONU, using fixed service bandwidth allocation scheme and limited service bandwidth allocation scheme. We also compare the throughput of the proposed scheme with existing single-OLT PON for non-uniform traffic load using limited service bandwidth allocation scheme.

By the end of 2012, 88.068 FTTH homes passed, and 12.333 were connected to optic in several major cities in Macedonia such as Skopje, Kumanovo, Stip, Strumica, Ohrid, Gostivar. In November 2011, Makedonski Telekom started a project for modernization of the network through a new fully internet-based multimedia platform of the new generation. The IMS Platform is used for the provision of VoIP as part of the 2Play and 3Play services and as a base for the PSTN network migration towards the all-IP network. In less than nine months, as of November 2011 until June 2012, 100,000 Telekom users already used the new platform, i.e. were migrated on it. This platform replaces the existing digital telephone exchanges and is a preparation for the services of the new generation and the unlimited communication possibilities offered by the internet. In February 2014 Deutsche Telekom revealed that its subsidiary Makedonski Telekom had become the first European incumbent to convert its PSTN infrastructure to an all IP network. It took just over two years for all 290,000 fixed lines to be migrated onto the new platform.
