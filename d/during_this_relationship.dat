5000|$|This {{story begins}} with the narrator {{discussing}} his job at a home for disabled people called [...] "Beverly Home." [...] He lists {{some of the more}} unusual clients of the home, then details how he starts watching a woman shower after work every day. The narrator shares his thoughts of raping her, but would be ashamed to be seen by her. Eventually, the woman's husband comes home and the narrator decides to leave. He also details his romantic relationship with a woman whose arms and legs are disproportionately small. Despite the fact that the narrator claims to not want to get to know this woman very well, they often eat out at Mexican restaurants, where the narrator learns that this woman works at an airline ticket counter. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>relationship,</b> he continues watching the woman shower, eventually becoming obsessed with the idea of watching her and her husband have sex.

Her paralysis is significantly worse in the morning, which the narrator calls [...] "unwholesome, and very erotic." [...] The narrator then discusses the woman's ex-boyfriends, many of whom have died and the narrator pities.

This study uses those visibility measurements, along with radar observations and other ASOS data, to determine a relationship between radar reflectivity and visibility <b>during</b> snow conditions. <b>This</b> <b>relationship</b> is used together with an extrapolation forecast of radar reflectivity to determine forecast visibility during snow conditions out to one hour.

This gene is expressed in the thymus and in several epithelial structures early in embryogenesis. EVA is highly homologous to the myelin protein zer...|$|R

40|$|To make educated guesses {{about what}} happens to {{consciousness}} upon bodily death, one has to have some understanding of the relationship between body and consciousness <b>during</b> life. <b>This</b> <b>relationship,</b> of course, reflects an ontology. In this brief essay, the tenability of both the physicalist and dualist ontologies will be assessed in view of recent experimental results in physics. The alternative ontology of idealism will then be discussed, which not only can be reconciled with the available empirical evidence, but also overcomes the lack of parsimony and limited explanatory power of physicalism and dualism. Idealism elegantly explains the basic facts of reality, such as (a) the fact that brain activity correlates with experience, (b) the fact that we all seem to share the same world, and (c) the fact that we can’t change the laws of nature at will. If idealism is correct, the implication is that, instead of disappearing, conscious inner life expands upon bodily death, a prediction that finds circumstantial but significant confirmation in reports of near-death experiences and psychedelic trances, both of which can be construed as glimpses into {{the early stages of the}} death process...|$|R
40|$|It {{seems that}} {{aggressive}} behavior is {{negatively related to}} cortisol (C), but <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> has been established considering the evening C levels.

This study analyzed <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> in 83 women (38 in the luteal and 45 in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle) and 20 men. CAR was assessed by measuring salivary free cortisol levels in samples taken immediately following awakening and 30, 45, and 60 minutes later. Additionally, participants completed a self-report of aggression. Men presented lower CAR than women in the luteal phase. Moreover, they also had higher levels of physical aggression than women, independently of their menstrual phase. Regarding the relationships between variables, in men general aggression and verbal aggression predicted the CAR. In women, verbal aggression predicted the CAR during the follicular phase, whereas anger and physical aggression were predictors during the luteal phase. Our data support the view that there is a negative relationship between C and aggressive behavior, even <b>during</b> the morning, <b>this</b> <b>relationship</b> being moderated by gender and menstrual cycle phase in the women.

40|$|Background—Ventricular assist devices (VADs) provide {{effective}} treatment for end-stage heart failure, however most patients experience ≥ 1 major adverse event (AE) while on VAD support.

Therefore, we sought to determine the impact of AEs occurring during the first 60 days of VAD support on one-year mortality. Methods—A retrospective analysis was performed using prospectively collected data from a single-site database for patients aged ≥ 18 years receiving left- or biventricular support during 1996 - 2008, who survived> 60 days on VAD support. Fourteen major classes of AEs occurring <b>during</b> <b>this</b> 60 -day period were examined. One-year survival rates of patients with and without each major AE were compared.

40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} reasons why a pilot {{clinical}} informationist program ended and how the library capitalized upon what worked to build even stronger relationships with clinicians, educators, and administrators. Setting/Participants: A clinical informationist provided information consultation on rounds with Internal Medicine attending physicians and residents in a community hospital setting for about one year before {{this aspect of the}} project was cancelled in 2008. Brief Description: The demise of this librarian-in place pilot project was caused by economics, politics, planning and communications breakdowns, and new challenges in the library environment. Issues and lessons learned will be discussed frankly, as will the unexpected benefits of the failed project. Outcome: As a result of contacts initiated <b>during</b> <b>this</b> project, <b>relationships</b> with faculty, staff and leadership in multiple departments and institutions have flourished, educational elements of the pilot continue, and the library is reaching more students, residents, and clinicians than would have been possible using the single clinical informationist model.
