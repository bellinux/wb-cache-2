40|$|International audienceThe {{domestic}} dog {{offers a}} unique opportunity to explore the genetic basis of disease, morphology and behaviour. Humans share many diseases with our canine companions, making dogs an ideal model organism for comparative disease genetics. Using newly developed resources, genome-wide association studies in dog breeds are proving to be exceptionally powerful. Towards this aim, veterinarians and geneticists from 12 European countries are collaborating to collect and analyse the DNA from large cohorts of dogs suffering from a range of carefully defined diseases of relevance to human health. This project, named LUPA, has already delivered considerable results. The consortium has collaborated to develop a new high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Mutations for four monogenic diseases have been identified and the information has been utilised to find mutations in human patients. Several complex diseases have been mapped and fine mapping is underway. These findings should ultimately lead {{to a better understanding of}} the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases in both <b>humans</b> and their <b>best</b> <b>friend...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} whether age, <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> delinquency, {{and adolescent}} self-concept clarity {{were related to}} adolescents’ delinquency, and whether age and self-concept clarity moderated the relation between adolescent and <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> delinquency.

Adolescent delinquency linearly declined, and whereas adolescents’ and best friends' delinquency levels were related, developmental change in delinquency was not. Self-concept clarity significantly affected delinquency development between ages 16 - 18. Age and self-concept clarity did not significantly moderate the relation between adolescent and <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> delinquency, and thus did not affect adolescent susceptibility to <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> influence...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that people compare themselves with routine standards—such as their best friend—during self–evaluations (Mussweiler & Rüter, 2003). In these past studies, the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was more accessible than a former friend subsequent to self–evaluations. We therefore con-cluded that the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> {{was used as a}} routine standard. However, spreading activation from the self to the more closely associated <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> would provide an alternative explanation. In the present research, we want to rule out this possibility and demonstrate that comparison processes are responsible for the <b>best</b> <b>friend’s</b> increased accessibility. In Study 1, we con-trasted comparative self–evaluations with absolute ones. In Study 2, partic-ipants engaged either in comparative self–evaluations or in self–descriptions. Afterwards the accessibility (Study 1) or the facilitation of judgments (Study 2) of the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was assessed. Both studies support the assumption that the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was used as a routine standard during comparative self–evaluations...|$|R
