40|$|Background Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} (BPD) is {{a serious}} complication of preterm birth. Plasma N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has been suggested as a marker that may predict BPD {{within a few days}} after birth. Objectives To investigate the association between NT-proBNP <b>day</b> <b>three</b> and bronchopulmonary dys-plasia (BPD) or death and further {{to assess the impact of}} patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on this association in neonates born before 32 gestational weeks. Methods A cohort study of 183 neonates born before 32 gestational weeks consecutively admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Aarhus University Hospital, <b>Denmark.</b> On <b>day</b> <b>three</b> plasma samples were collected and echocardiography carried out. NT-proBNP was mea-sured by routine immunoassays. The combined outcome BPD or death was assessed at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was per-formed to determine the discrimination ability of NT-proBNP by the natural log continuous measure to recognize BPD or death. The association of BPD or death was assessed in rela-tion to natural log NT-proBNP levels <b>day</b> <b>three...</b>|$|R

The association of BPD or death was assessed in relation to natural log NT-proBNP levels <b>day</b> <b>three.</b> The risk of BPD or death increased 1. 7 -fold with one unit increase of natural log NT-proBNP <b>day</b> <b>three</b> when adjusted for gestational age at birth (OR = 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 3; 2. 3). The association was found both in neonates with and without a PDA. Adjusting for GA, PDA diameter, LA:Ao-ratio, or early onset sepsis did not change the estimate. We found NT-proBNP to be associated with BPD or death in very preterm neonates. This association was not only explained by the PDA. We speculate that NT-proBNP may help the identification of neonates at risk of BPD as early as postnatal <b>day</b> <b>three...</b>|$|R
