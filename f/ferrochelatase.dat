The structures of two related class II enzymes, CbiXS from Archaeoglobus fulgidus and CbiK from Salmonella enterica, that are responsible for the insertion of cobalt along the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway are presented in complex with their metallated product. A further structure of a CbiK from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough reveals how cobalt is bound at the active site. The crystal structures show that the binding of sirohydrochlorin is distinctly different to porphyrin binding in the protoporphyrin <b>ferrochelatases</b> and provide a molecular overview of the mechanism of chelation. The structures also give insights into the evolution of chelatase form and function. Finally, the structure of a periplasmic form of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough CbiK reveals a novel tetrameric arrangement of its subunits that are stabilized by the presence of a heme b cofactor.

In this paper, we report the characterization of a protein, IhtB (iron heme transport; formerly designated Pga 30), that is an outer membrane hemin-binding protein potentially involved in iron assimilation by P. gingivalis. IhtB was localized to the cell surface of P. gingivalis by Western blot analysis of a Sarkosyl-insoluble outer membrane preparation and by immunocytochemical staining of whole cells using IhtB peptide-specific antisera. The protein, released from the cell surface, was shown to bind to hemin using hemin-agarose. The growth of heme-limited, but not heme-replete, P. gingivalis cells was inhibited by preincubation with IhtB peptide-specific antisera. The ihtB gene was located between an open reading frame encoding a putative TonB-linked outer membrane receptor and three open reading frames that have sequence similarity to ATP binding cassette transport system operons in other bacteria. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of IhtB showed significant similarity to the Salmonella typhimurium protein CbiK, a cobalt chelatase that is structurally related to the ATP-independent family of <b>ferrochelatases.</b> Molecular modeling indicated that the IhtB amino acid sequence could be threaded onto the CbiK fold with the IhtB structural model containing the active-site residues critical for chelatase activity.

Crystal structures of the enzyme-tetrapyrrole complex were obtained that reveal radically different modes of binding compared to the well characterized <b>ferrochelatases.</b> Furthermore protein structures reveal the evolutionary re lationships between cobaltochelatases from different organisms.

Mutations in the C-terminal region of the human erythroid specific ALAS (ALAS 2) lead to X-linked dominant protoporphyria a condition that is characterized by the accumulation of protoporphyrin in red blood cells leading to photosensitivity and liver disease.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of human protoporphyrin metalation remains under investigation. Many researchers have hypothesized {{distortion of the}} porphyrin macrocycle as key to catalysis. Researchers studying Bacillus subtilis <b>ferrochelatase</b> propose a mechanism for iron insertion into protoporphyrin in which the enzyme tightly grips rings B, C, and D while bending ring A 36o. Normally planar, this distortion exposes the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the nitrogen in ring A to the Fe+2 ion. Subsequent investigation revealed a 100o distortion in protoporphyrin bound to human <b>ferrochelatase.</b> A highly conserved histidine residue (His183 in B. subtilis, His263 in humans) is essential for determining the type of distortion, as well as acting as the initial proton acceptor from protoporphyrin. Anionic residues form a pathway facilitating proton movement away from the catalytic histidine. Frataxin chaperones iron to the matrix side of <b>ferrochelatase,</b> where aspartate and histidine residues on both proteins coordinate iron transfer into <b>ferrochelatase.</b> Two arginine and tyrosine residues in the active site (Arg164, Tyr165) may perform the final metalation.|$|E
