40|$|One of the {{constant}} elements of warfare is its degrading effects on the environment. Many writers blame this destruction of the environment on inadequate standards in the international law of <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare.</b> To remedy this shortfall, the international law of <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare</b> should be categorized as either passive or active <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare.</b> Active <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare</b> requires the intentional use of the environment as a weapon of waging armed conflict. Passive <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare</b> includes acts not specifically designed to use the environment for a particular military purpose but that have a degrading effect on the environment. Passive <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare</b> violates international law only when it produces effects that are widespread, long-term, and severe. Active <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare</b> against the sustainable environment that is not de minimus violates international law per se and should not require environmental damage to reach the standard of widespread, long-tasting, and severe {{to be considered a}} violation of international law. A well-recognized differentiation between active and passive <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare</b> will help solidify the standards of state responsibility and provide increased protection for the environment...|$|E
40|$|If {{humanitarian}} tragedies {{caused by}} war {{have for a}} long time been the object of legal regulation, it was not until recently that the protection of the natural environment in armed conflict has attracted similar attention. The consequence is that there is yet no homogenous body of law that protects the ecosystem from hostilities. Apart from a few rules specifically addressing <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare,</b> indirect protection derives from provisions that were conceived for other purposes and from the underlying principles of customary international law that traditionally regulate the conduct of military hostilities. This raises the problem of the adequacy of the existing rules to protect the natural environment from warfare. In order to answer this question, the present chapter will first examine the rules available in the laws of war and will distinguish those specifically addressing the natural environment from other rules that might however apply and provide some protection. Individual criminal responsibility for the violation of such rules will then be discussed. In the second part, the chapter will investigate whether the law of peace, in particular international environmental law, can play any role in the protection of the environment in time of armed conflict and will verify its applicability pendente bello...|$|E

First {{published}} in the Electronic Workshops in Computing series at [URL] prime objective of deploying large- scale wireless sensor networks is to collect information from to control systems associated with these networks. Wireless sensor networks are widely used in application domains such as security and inspection, <b>environmental</b> monitoring, <b>warfare,</b> and other situations especially where immediate responses are required such as disasters and medical emergency. Whenever there is a growth there are challenges and to cope with these challenges strategies and solutions must be developed. This paper discusses the recently addressed issues of data aggregation through presenting a comparative study of different research work done on minimizing delay in different structures of wireless sensor networks. Finally we introduce our proposed method to minimize both delay and power consumption using a tree based clustering scheme with partial data aggregation...|$|R

It enacted resolutions on such topics as the conduct of <b>warfare,</b> <b>environmental</b> protection, international sovereignty, and human rights. Peacekeeping forces consisting of troops provided by various countries, with various United Nations and other aid agencies, helped to relieve famine, disease, and poverty, and to suppress some local armed conflicts.

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} {{the law of}} the environment during armed conflicts in five parts. Part One, “General Background of Armed Conflict,” focuses on the nature of armed conflict, including international and national disputes, civil war, and the problem of applying international legal duties to internal belligerents, the impact of armed conflict on civilians, and the environmental impact of preparing for, engaging in, and recovering from armed conflict. Part Two, “Environmental Protection in International Humanitarian Law,” examines the definition of international humanitarian law (IHL), focusing particularly on the environmental protection provisions in the IHL and its current inadequacy as a tool to protect the natural environment. Part Three, “The Environmental Law Rules,” will examine relevant provisions of environmental law, and investigate environmental law rules relevant to armed conflicts in the national, comparative, and international levels. Part Four deals with “Enviro-Humanitarian Rules,” and explores the Articles of Armament Conventions, a main source of enviro-humanitarian rules. This section examines the deficiencies of those rules in the environmental protection framework. Part Five, “The Responsibility of <b>Warfare</b> <b>Environmental</b> Damage,” will examine the system of responsibility for environmental damage resulted from military activities in peacetime and in times of armed conflicts. This part explores two levels of responsibility in the international and internal systems. Part Six, “The Recommendations” in which some recommendations and proposals will be presented to better advance the environmental protection and to reduce <b>warfare</b> <b>environmental</b> damage. The recommendations are grouped according to the concerned party. Some recommendations are directed to the international community, others are directed to national societies and the last group of recommendation is directed to non-governmental organizations...|$|R
40|$|In 1991, {{after the}} first Gulf War, the Marsh Arabs of {{southern}} Iraq rose up against the Hussein government, with U. S. encouragement. The rebellion failed; in retaliation the government embarked on a massive water diversion project to drain the wetlands. In 1970 the wetlands covered nearly 11, 000 square kilometers; today they cover fewer than a thousand. The Marsh Arabs whose ancestors {{had lived in the}} wetlands for five thousand years were forced to flee; many died. The drainage of the wetlands was a deliberate and calculated act of genocide and ecocide. At the time, Iraq was a party to several international agreements that made its acts illegal. The various environmental treaties to which Iraq was a party and customary international law regarding transboundary environmental harm provide little recourse for the Marsh Arabs, although they may provide the basis for claims to be pursued by neighboring states. 	Of the other treaties to which Iraq is a party, the Genocide Convention most clearly prohibits acts such as those committed by the Iraqi government against the Marsh Arabs. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions addresses individual murders and extrajudicial killings of Marsh Arabs, but probably does not address the problem of the destruction of the wetlands as a whole. The Covenants on Economic and Cultural Rights and Civil and Political Rights provide similar protections, and provide that a people may not be deprived of its means of subsistence, as the Marsh Arabs have been. Treaties to which Iraq is not a party address the specific problem of environmental modification used in war or as an instrument of persecution of an ethnic group. ENMOD and the Rome Statute prohibit <b>environmental</b> <b>warfare</b> of the type engaged in by Iraq, but {{it is unlikely that the}} provisions of either have been accepted as custom in the practice of states. Protocols I and II to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, however, are probably expressions of customary international law, and may even express jus cogens or non-derogable norms. Of these, Protocol I addresses environmental harm far more directly. Under Protocol I, the Iraqi government’s action against the southern Mesopotamian wetlands was illegal because its effects were widespread, long-lasting, and severe, and because it was a prohibited reprisal against the natural environment...|$|E

5000|$|The {{cause of}} San Lorenzo's demise and later {{replacement}} with La Venta is unknown, although it most certainly {{occurred in the}} 10th century BC.

50|$|The Science Fiction Radio Show had clear {{educational}} value. For newcomers, {{it provided}} {{an introduction to}} a vital literature of their time. For hardcore fans, it supplied insights and background {{to what they were}} reading in books and magazines or seeing on the screen. The show’s interviewees also spanned the history of modern science fiction, from authors who began publishing pulp stories in the 1920s to fans in the 1980s attempting to publish their first stories. In their interviews authors often spoke of the value of speculative fiction. By imagining possible futures science fiction authors prepare their readers for “future shock”—the fear and confusion many people experience when confronted with the bewilderments of modern technology. Science fiction also expands readers’ minds by exploring scenarios of future <b>warfare,</b> <b>environmental</b> decay, and cosmic catastrophes.|$|R
25|$|James {{cautions}} that available scientific evidence stands against the above assumptions and conclusions. He {{reports that there}} is an excess of males at birth in almost all human populations, and the natural sex ratio at birth is usually between 102 and 108. However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons such as early marriage and fertility, teenage mothers, average maternal age at birth, paternal age, age gap between father and mother, late births, ethnicity, social and economic stress, <b>warfare,</b> <b>environmental</b> and harmonal effects. This school of scholars support their alternate hypothesis with historical data when modern sex-selection technologies were unavailable, as well as birth sex ratio in sub-regions, and various ethnic groups of developed economies. They suggest that direct abortion data should be collected and studied, instead of drawing conclusions indirectly from human sex ratio at birth.|$|R

40|$|The 'dual etalon {{frequency}} comb spectrometer' {{is a novel}} low cost spectometer with limited moving parts. A broad band light source (pulsed laser, LED, lamp [...] .) is split into two beam paths. One travels through an etalon and a sample gas, while the second arm is just an etalon cavity, and the two beams are recombined onto a single detector. If the free spectral ranges (FSR) of the two cavities are not identical, the intensity pattern at the detector with consist {{of a series of}} heterodyne frequencies. Each mode out of the sample arm etalon with have a unique frequency in RF (radio-frequency) range, where modern electronics can easily record the signals. By monitoring these RF beat frequencies we can then determine when an optical frequencies is absorbed. The resolution is set by the FSR of the cavity, typically 10 MHz, with a bandwidth up to 100 s of cm{sup - 1 }. In this report, the new spectrometer is described in detail and demonstration experiments on Iodine absorption are carried out.

40|$|Fo r t u n a te ly, {{scientists}} studying these c h a n ges {{have now}} acc u m u l a ted {{enough information to}} provide strong predictions {{of what can be}} expected if we do not inter-vene. Recent analyses suggest that in the next five years, for example, Mesoamerica (Mexico to Panama) is likely to lose 10 % of its remaining natural vegetation, with the resulting extinction of at least 22 species of vertebrates and 93 species of plants (Brooks et al. 2002). Even the major tropical wilder-ness areas (MTWAs) (Myers et al. 2000; Mittermeier et al., in press) —which, unlike the hotspots, still retain 70 % or more of their native vegetation cover—are rapidly changing with the advancement of agricul-ture frontiers. Anticipated loss of habitat in these areas will result in a far greater num-ber of species at risk of extinction (Pimm and Raven 2000). Awa reness of this impending crisis gives us early warning that if we do not act, it will soon be too late; the question is what actions are necessary. The challenges faced by conservationists in the past offer some important lessons. Pa rks and re s e r ve s, despite widespread pressure, have shown themselves to be the only areas where the full complement of biodiversity persists in contexts of serious threats. On the other hand, ecological and economic dynamics have also {{made it clear that the}} status quo approach to conservation, highly site-spe-cific and largely reactive, is barely holding the line in a sort of <b>environmental</b> “trench <b>warfare,</b> ” and is not adequate to protect bio-diversity in the long run. Despite increased conservation efforts, many critical areas are still lost each year. If we are to avert a massive crisis, there is an urgent need to both dra s t i c a l ly increase the scale of conservation work, and, equally important, to adjust our strate-gies to address large-scale ecological, social, and economic re a l i t i e s.

40|$|Paul Gilroy {{seeks to}} awaken a new {{understanding}} of W. E. B. Du Bois’ intellectual and political legacy. At a time of economic crisis, <b>environmental</b> degradation, ongoing <b>warfare,</b> and heated debate over human rights, how should we reassess the changing place of black culture? Gilroy considers the ways that consumerism has diverted African Americans’ political and social aspirations. Luxury goods and branded items, especially the automobile—rich in symbolic value and the promise of individual freedom—have restratified society, weakened citizenship, and diminished the collective spirit. Jazz, blues, soul, reggae, and hip hop are now seen as generically American, yet artists like Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, and Bob Marley, who questioned the allure of mobility and speed, are not understood by people who have drained their music of its moral power. Gilroy explores the way in which objects and technologies can become dynamic social forces, ensuring black culture’s global reach while undermining the drive for equality and justice. Drawing on the work of a number of thinkers, including Michel Foucault, Hannah Arendt, Primo Levi, and Frantz Fanon, he examines the ethical dimensions of living in a society that celebrates the object. What are the implications for our notions of freedom? With his brilliant, provocative analysis and astonishing range of reference, Gilroy revitalizes the study of African American culture. He traces the shifting character of black intellectual and social movements, and shows how we can construct an account of moral progress that reflects today’s complex realities...|$|R
40|$|The reliable, {{quick and}} {{cost-effective}} {{method for detection}} and quantification of different analytes such as pathogens is crucial in many analytical applications. Biosensors have revolutionized diagnostics and been emerged as a highly promising tool for rapid identification of food and <b>environmental</b> contaminants, biological <b>warfare</b> agents, illicit drugs and human/animal disease markers and other required fields. It is foresighted {{that the future of}} detection analytical methods for biological agents shall be guided by biosensor, which has already contributed enormously in sensing and identification technology. However, the increasing numbers of analytes requiring monitoring and others that require control and the need for high sensitivity, speed and accuracy of analytical measurements have stimulated considerable efforts in developing different sensors as diagnostics tools. A range of molecules with biorecognition powers are available naturally such as antibodies, enzymes, cell receptors and nucleic acids which are used as the sensing receptors in biosensors. Currently, Lectins as new bioreceptors has being started to play a pivotal role in many biosensing devices due to their exquisite specificity for their cognate carbohydrates. In this review, biosensor technology and different bio-receptor systems and methods of transduction are described briefly and then lectins characterizations with lectin based biosensors and their application in different fields are discussed. It is expected that the views presented in this article will provide both new ideas and a toolbox in a single reference work for both the beginner and experienced scientists who work on lectins and biosensors...|$|R
