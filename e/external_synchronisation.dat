25|$|The C++ {{standard}} {{consists of}} two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes vectors, lists, maps, algorithms (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples, input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing to the console and files), smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression support, multi-threading library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any <b>external</b> <b>synchronisation),</b> time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that doesn't use C++ exceptions into C++ exceptions, a random number generator and a slightly {{modified version of the}} C standard library (to make it comply with the C++ type system).|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm that adaptively synchronises an agent with its environment enabling maximal deliberation time and improved action success rates. The method balances its reliance upon noisy evidence with internal representations, making it robust to interaction faults caused by both communication and timing. The notion of action correctness is developed {{and used to}} analyse the new method {{as well as two}} special cases: Internal and <b>External</b> <b>synchronisation.</b> Action correctness is determined online by a novel action accounting procedure that determines the outcome of commanded actions. In conjunction, these elements provide online analysis of agent activity, action con rmation for model prediction, and a coarse measure of the agent's coherence with the environment that is used to adapt its performance...|$|E

Sampled value (SV) process buses allow {{for the removal of}} potentially lethal voltages and damaging currents inside substation control rooms and marshalling kiosks, reduce the amount of cabling required in substations, and facilitate the adoption of non-conventional instrument transformers. IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 provides an inter-operable solution to support multi-vendor process bus solutions. A time synchronisation system is required for a SV process bus, however the details are not defined in IEC 61850 - 9 - 2. IEEE Std 1588 - 2008, Precision Time Protocol version 2 (PTPv 2), provides the greatest accuracy of network based time transfer systems, with timing errors of less than 100 ns achievable. PTPv 2 is proposed by the IEC Smart Grid Strategy Group to synchronise IEC 61850 based substation automation systems. IEC 61850 - 9 - 2, PTPv 2 and Ethernet are three complementary protocols that together define the future of sampled value digital process connections in substations. The suitability of PTPv 2 for use with SV is evaluated, with preliminary results indicating that steady state performance is acceptable (jitter < 300 ns), and that extremely stable grandmaster oscillators are required to ensure SV timing requirements are met when recovering from loss of <b>external</b> <b>synchronisation</b> (such as GPS) ...|$|E
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{have many}} {{application}} scenarios where <b>external</b> clock <b>synchronisation</b> {{may be required}} because a WSN may consist of components which are not connected to each other. In this paper, we first propose a novel weighted average-based internal clock synchronisation (WICS) protocol, which synchronises all the clocks of a WSN with the clock of a reference node periodically. Based on this protocol, we then propose our weighted average-based <b>external</b> clock <b>synchronisation</b> (WECS) protocol. We have analysed the proposed protocols for maximum synchronisation error and shown that it is always upper bounded. Extensive simulation studies of the proposed protocols {{have been carried out}} using Castalia simulator. Simulation results validate our above theoretical claim and also show that the proposed protocols perform better in comparison to other protocols in terms of synchronisation accuracy. A prototype implementation of the WICS protocol using a few TelosB motes also validates the above conclusions...|$|R

It combines all {{the advantages of}} modern single-chip DLP technology - attractive price, great brightness, high contrast, superior resolution and color quality - with those of active stereoscopy: invariance to {{the orientation of the}} user and an image separation of nearly 100 %. With a refresh rate of 60 Hz per eye (120 Hz in total) our system is flicker-free even for sensitive users. The system permits <b>external</b> projector <b>synchronisation</b> which allows to build up affordable stereoscopic multi-projector systems, e. g., for immersive visualisation...|$|R
40|$|The {{weighted}} average based clock synchronisation protocols for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs), viz., energy efficient and fault-tolerant clock synchronisation (EFCS) protocol, {{weighted average}} based internal clock synchronisation (WICS) protocol, and weighted average based <b>external</b> clock <b>synchronisation</b> (WECS) protocol, have several fault-tolerant properties including automatic interchangeability among these protocols, but a major problem with these protocols is that their synchronisation accuracy is not very high. In this paper, we propose a generic technique to improve the synchronisation accuracy in these three protocols. We also give a proof that the synchronisation error in the EFCS protocol is bounded. The improved protocols also make use of estimated drift rate to provide an accurate reading of time at any instant, and the logical time provided by these protocols is monotonic. The simulation and experimental studies clearly show that the average synchronisation error in the improved protocols is much less than that in the original protocols...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{an image sensor}} with 128 x 128 pixels and analog neural {{preprocessing}} is presented. It contains a two-dimensional neural network with next-neighbour con-nectivity and optical input capable of low-pass filtering of images combined with contrast enhancement, binarisation or segmentation in the spatial domain. The single neuron cell is implemented as a fully differential current-mode circuit. The parameters of the neurons (gain and linearity of the transfer function, self-feedback, coupling strength of photodetector input and next-neighbour output) are adjustable by external bias currents. Varying these param-eters, the behaviour of the network changes from a linear spatial low-pass filter with variable diffusion length to binarisation or segmentation. The neural network circuits can be operated in weak inversion for low power dissipa-tion and/or moderate or strong inversion for a larger sig-nal to pattern-noise ratio. The neuron outputs are read out via differential switched-capacitor column preamplifiers and analog output buffers driving an external AD-con-verter. All clocks for the analog readout circuitry and <b>external</b> video <b>synchronisation</b> are generated on-chip. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of stimulus evoked neuromuscular potentials or m-waves {{is a useful}} technique for improved feedback control in functional electrical stimulation systems. Usually, however, these signals are contaminated by stimulus artifact. A novel software technique, which uses a two-stage peak detection algorithm, has been developed to remove the unwanted artifact from the recorded signal. The advantage of the technique {{is that it can}} be used on all stimulation artifact-contaminated electroneurophys-iologic data provided that the artifact and the biopotential are non-overlapping. The technique does not require any estimation of the stimulus artifact shape or duration. With the developed technique, {{it is not necessary to}} record a pure artifact signal for template estimation, a process that can increase the complexity of experimentation. The technique also does not require the recording of any <b>external</b> hardware <b>synchronisation</b> pulses. The method avoids the use of analogue or digital filtering techniques, which endeavour to remove certain high frequency components of the artifact signal, but invariably have difficulty, resulting in the removal of frequencies in the same spectrum as the m-wave. With the new technique the signal is sampled at a high frequency to ensure optimum fidelity. Instrumentation saturation effects due to the artifact can be avoided with careful electrode placement. The technique was fully tested with a wide variety of electrical stimulation parameters (frequency and pulse width) applied to the common peroneal nerve to elicit contraction in the tibialis anterior. The program was also developed to allow batch processing of multiple files, using closed loop feedback correction. The two-stage peak detection artifact removal algorithm is demonstrate...|$|R
40|$|Aim. <b>External</b> {{fertilisation}} requires <b>synchronisation</b> of gamete release {{between the}} two sexes. Adequate synchronisation is essential in aquatic media because sperm is very short-lived in water. In the cichlid Lamprologus callipterus, fertilisation of the eggs takes place inside an empty snail shell, where females stay inside the shell and males have to ejaculate into the shell opening. This spawning pattern makes the coordination of gamete release difficult. Methods. This study examined the synchronisation {{of males and females}} during egg laying. Results. The results showed that the male initiates each spawning sequence and that sperm release and egg laying are very well synchronised. 68 % of all sperm releases occurred at exactly the same time when the female laid an egg, and 99 % of ejaculations occurred within ± 5 seconds from egg deposition. On average 95 eggs are laid one by one with intervals of several minutes between subsequent eggs, leading to a total spawning duration in excess of six hours. Conclusions. We discuss this exceptional spawning pattern and how it might reflect a conflict between the sexes, with males attempting to induce egg laying and females extending the egg laying period to raise the chance for parasitic males to participate in spawning...|$|R
