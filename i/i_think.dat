5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that the}} band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had}} a goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we showed too much. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that the lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
5|$|You know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the Triton kind of, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> was a spur {{for that}} routine as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> back.

5|$|Their daughter, Scottie, wrote {{after their}} deaths: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> (short of {{documentary}} {{evidence to the}} contrary) that if people are not crazy, they get themselves out of crazy situations, so I {{have never been able}} to buy the notion that it was my father's drinking which led her to the sanitarium. Nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she led him to the drinking.|$|E

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's {{something}} that is so unique about Rihanna whatever she's doing, whatever character she's playing, whatever side of herself she's showing, she's in it 1,000 percent... And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the song and {{the theme of this}} song, she wanted to obviously show a softer side, a lighter side, one that's caught in maybe a tumultuous relationship... There's so much variety with her and it's been such a journey with her.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think,</b> {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a lot of females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's {{a big deal to}} be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> therefore taking all those circumstances in view... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is a lovely thought and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
