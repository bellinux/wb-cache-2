40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} optimal long run monetary policy. It shows that optimal <b>inflation</b> <b>policy</b> involves trading off two quite different considerations. First, increases {{in the rate of}} inflation tax the holding of many balances, leading to a deadweight loss as excessive resources are devoted to economizing on cash balances. Second, increases in the rate of inflation raise capital intensity. As long as the economy has a capital stock short of the golden rule level, increases in capita intensity raise the level of consumption. Ignoring the second consideration leads to the common recommendation that the money growth rate be set so that the nominal interest rate is zero. Taking it into account can lead to significant modifications in the "full liquidity rule.

It is argued that the design of lower limits on target bands, if not done with care, can lead to a lack of transparency, potentially confusing markets about how the authorities will react to a fall in inflation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{explanation for the}} negative correlation between ex post real interest rates and inflation found in earlier empirical studies. We begin by showing {{that there is a}} strong negative correlation between the permanent movements in ex post real interest rates and inflation. We argue that such a correlation can arise when people incorporate anticipated shifts in <b>inflation</b> <b>policy</b> into their expectations. Under these circumstances, a shift to lower (higher) inflation will lead to systematically higher (lower) ex post real rates. Using new time series techniques we are able to reject the hypothesis that nominal interest rates were unaffected by anticipated switches in <b>inflation</b> <b>policy</b> in the post-war era. To evaluate the impact of these switches, we then calculate the effects of inflationary expectations upon real rates using a Markov switching model of inflation. Inflation forecasts based upon the estimates of this rational model behave similarly to inflation forecasts from the Livingston survey. When ex ante real interest rates are identified with the Markov models of inflation, we find that ex ante real interest rate does not contain permanent shocks, nor is it related to permanent shocks in inflation. ...|$|E

40|$|Three {{alternative}} policy {{rules are}} contrasted {{in a model}} framework in this paper.

The specific features of an economic transition period are reflected in an extended set of measures when comparing the policy rules. The paper {{presents the results of}} these simulations, including tests of sensitivity to calibration, and summarizes the conclusions. First, any policy rules that combine several targets are inferior to inflation and exchange-rate rules since they are less efficient in ensuring nominal convergence, and more costly in terms of output, interest-rate and external-balance volatility. Second, exchange-rate rules are less efficient and less costly in terms of output volatility. <b>Inflation</b> <b>policy</b> rules are more efficient and less costly in terms of interest-rate volatility. This result illustrates that {{it is very difficult to}} hit upon a single superior strategy. The final choice depends on preferences. Third, exchange-rate and <b>inflation</b> <b>policy</b> rules produce gradual real appreciation. Under exchange-rate rules, real appreciation is due to the inflation differential.
