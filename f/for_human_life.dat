5|$|In 1845, James Howlett, a boy {{living in}} Canada, {{witnesses}} his father {{being killed by}} groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The anxiety activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James's birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas's other son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of empathy <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> causes Logan to leave.|$|E

500|$|In a major address, Grant stated: [...] "The {{building}} of rail-roads and the access thereby given {{to all the}} agricultural and mineral {{regions of the country}} is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians. No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is they do not get on together, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom, and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> and the rights of others, dangerous to society.

500|$|Raymond Benson notes {{increased}} political intrigue in {{the novel}} compared to earlier Bond novels. In Colonel Sun, Bond acts {{in concert with the}} Russians against the Chinese, which demonstrates one of the main themes of the book: a peacekeeping between nations. Military historian Jeremy Black describes the novel reflecting a shift in the balance of world power away from two-party Cold War politics. To accentuate this idea of Oriental threat, the novel demonstrates a disregard by the Chinese <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> a position similar to the treatment of the East in Fleming's Dr. No. Black also notes an emotional and social sadness throughout Colonel Sun. The social sadness is a reaction to the culture of modernity and mourning what was being lost in its place. This treatment by Amis is similar to Fleming's nostalgia in describing Paris in [...] "From a View to a Kill".|$|E
500|$|Scattered {{throughout}} the chapters {{are more general}} critical discussions, such as that on tragedy in the essay [...] "Othello", comedy in [...] "Twelfth Night", and the value <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> of poetry in general, in [...] "Lear", among many others. Along the way, Hazlitt intersperses lengthy quotations from the plays, sharing with the reader poetic passages he thought particularly excellent. This practice resembled the by then common practice of collecting long extracts from the plays as the [...] "beauties" [...] of Shakespeare. Hazlitt, however, also adds critical commentary (though often far less extensive than would become the practice in later years), with the quotations illustrating particular points about the plays as well as sharing with his readers what he thought worthy of attention. All this, done as no one had before, made Characters of Shakespear's Plays the first handbook for the study and appreciation of all of Shakespeare's plays.|$|E
500|$|The United States Catechism for Adults devotes {{a section}} to in vitro fertilization, stem-cell {{research}} and cloning in its {{explanation of the}} fifth commandment, because these often involve the destruction of human embryos, {{considered to be a}} gravely sinful form of murder.

[...] Citing the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's Instruction on Respect <b>for</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Life</b> in its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation, the US Bishops quote: [...] "No objective, even though noble in itself, such as a foreseeable advantage to science, to other human beings, or to society, can in any way justify experimentation on living human embryos or fetuses, whether viable or not, either inside or outside the mother's body." [...] The Bishops note that adult stem cell research, using cells obtained with informed consent, is a promising field of research that is morally acceptable.|$|E

500|$|This commandment demands respect <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> {{and is more}} {{accurately}} translated as [...] "thou shalt not murder." [...] Indeed, killing may, under limited circumstances, be justified within Catholicism. Jesus expanded it to prohibit unjust anger, hatred and vengeance, and to require Christians to love their enemies. The basis of all Catholic teaching about the fifth commandment is the sanctity of life ethic, which Kreeft argues is philosophically opposed {{to the quality of}} life ethic, a philosophy which he characterizes as introduced by a book entitled Die Freigabe der Vernichtung des Lebensunwerten Lebens (The Permission to Destroy Life Unworthy of Life) (see Life unworthy of life) and which he asserts was the [...] "first to win public acceptance... by German doctors before World War II—the basis and beginning of Nazi medical practices." [...] This interpretation is supported by modern medical journals that discuss the dilemma posed by these opposing philosophies to physicians who must make life or death decisions. Some bioethicists characterize the use of the [...] "Nazi analogy" [...] as inappropriate when applied to quality of life decisions; Arthur Caplan called this rhetoric [...] "odiously wrong". The Church is actively involved in the public debates over abortion, capital punishment and euthanasia, and encourages believers to support legislation and politicians it describes as pro-life.|$|E
500|$|Nathan F. Cobb {{was named}} after a ship builder, born in 1797 from Eastham, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Cobb and his family moved from Eastham to Northampton County, Virginia before {{purchasing}} Sand Shoal Island, which later became Cobb Island. It was on Cobb Island, in 1839, that Nathan founded Cobb's Salvaging Company with his sons. They specialized in wrecking and salvaging stranded vessels along the shallow Mid-Atlantic coastline. The Cobbs had a remarkable record; not one person drowned {{in any of the}} rescue efforts for the 37 or more ships stranded off their island. The success of the salvaging company earned them the sobriquet [...] "Rothschilds among the toilers of the sea". Despite the company's notable prosperity, the Cobbs were often praised for their humanity and general regard <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> [...] "Often a crew of ten or twenty would be landed on the island from stranded vessels without a penny, and they were tenderly cared for as though they were millionaires." [...] This practice was a rare creed among wreckers in the 19th century. The Cobbs and others like them transformed the act of salvaging which led way to the forming of the United States Life-Saving Service; this later merged into what is now the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
