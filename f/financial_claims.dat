40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{a model of}} the optimal <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> for a bank in a world where a {{borrowing}} firm’s uninformed stakeholders depend upon the bank for truthful information about the firm’s evolving financial condition. In particular, stakeholders rely upon the bank to reveal whether the borrowing firm is truly financially distressed and whether concession by stakeholders are necessary. The bank’s <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> is designed to ensure that it cannot form a coalition with the firm’s owners either to seek unnecessary concession when the firm is actually healthy, or to claim that the firm is healthy when it is actually in distress. We show that the optimal chain has the following characteristics. To ensure that a healthy firm/bank coalition will not form to seek unnecessary concessions from stakeholders, the bank must keep its equity stake in a distressed firm below a ceiling level. To ensure that a distressed firm/bank coalition will not falsely claim that the firm is healthy, a sufficiently large portion of the bank’s <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> on the healthy firm must be subordinated to stakeholders’ claims. Since banks may have difficulty in credibly subordinating their debt claims, a bank equity stake in the healthy firm may be necessary. Thus, our analysis offers limited support for the argument that bank equity stakes in borrowing firms may enhance banks’ ability to reduce the costs of financial distress for borrowing firms. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{financing}} possibilities for capital constrained entrepreneurs when venture financiers perform two tasks, monitoring and advice. We model advice as effort that results {{in an increase in}} the probability of success. In turn, we consider monitoring as an activity exerted to control entrepreneurial project choice, which results in an increase in the returns in the less successful state. Thus entrepreneurs favor advice and dislike monitoring. Through the <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> offered, an entrepreneur can affect the financier 9 ̆ 2 s effort exertion on the two tasks. The primary result is that highly capital constrained entrepreneurs can get financing only with intense monitoring and limited advice. The optimal <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> resembles to a convertible debt contract. Entrepreneurs endowed with more self-financing can restrain the level of monitoring, thus induce more advice, and can offer an equity contract. The results may shed light on contracting practices observed in the venture capital industry, namely the unusual negative correlation between control and cash-flow rights and the use of a variety of securities...|$|R

[...] Among other ventures, in 1900 Williamson leased Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne, and began a series of extensive renovations and expansions to the theatre that became the flagship venue for J.

[...] With a running time of nearly four hours, the production contained huge choral numbers, marches and a spectacular chariot race, with horses galloping on a treadmill in front of a moving backdrop.

[...] On 4 November 1918 [...] "the Soviet courier's packing-case had 'come to pieces'" [...] in a Berlin railway station; [...] {{it was filled with}} insurrectionary documents. Joffe and his staff were ejected from Germany in a sealed train on 5 November 1918. [...] In the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended World War I, one clause abrogated the Brest-Litovsk treaty. Next [...] the Bolshevik legislature (VTsIK) annulled the treaty on 13 November 1918, and the text of the VTsIK Decision was printed in Pravda newspaper the next day. In the year after the armistice following [...] a timetable set by the victors the German Army withdrew its occupying forces from the lands gained in Brest-Litovsk. [...] The fate of the region, and the location of the eventual western border of the Soviet Union, was settled in violent and chaotic struggles {{over the course of the}} next three and a half years. The Polish–Soviet War was particularly bitter; it ended with the Treaty of Riga in 1921. Although most of Ukraine fell under Bolshevik control and eventually became one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, Poland and the Baltic states emerged as independent countries. In the Treaty of Rapallo, concluded in April 1922, Germany accepted the Treaty's nullification, and the two powers agreed to abandon all war-related territorial and <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> against each other. This state of affairs lasted until 1939. As a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union advanced its borders westward by invading Poland in September 1939 and taking a small part of Finland in November 1939 and annexing the Baltic States, Eastern Poland and Bessarabia in 1940. It thus overturned almost all the territorial losses incurred at Brest-Litovsk, except for the main part of Finland, western Congress Poland, and western Armenia.|$|E
