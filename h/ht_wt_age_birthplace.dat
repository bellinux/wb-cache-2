40|$|Purpose. This study {{investigated}} the anthropometric indices associated with variations in cardiovascular parameters among primary school pupils in Ile-Ife. Method. One thousand and twenty-six pupils (age range 6 – 14 years, mean age 10. 12 years) from ten schools were recruited with parents' informed consent. Anthropometric (Height (<b>Ht),</b> Weight (<b>Wt),</b> Abdominal Circumference (AC)) and cardiovascular (Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Heart Rate (HR)) parameters were measured using standard instruments and procedures. Blood pressure (BP) was measured after ten minutes of quiet sitting. Body Mass Index (BMI), Rate Pressure Product (RPP) and Pulse Pressure (PP) were estimated. Results. <b>Age,</b> <b>Ht,</b> <b>Wt,</b> BMI, and AC correlated significantly (<. 01) with BP and PP. AC and BMI were predictors of BP, HR, RPP, and PP. Conclusion. Significant correlations exist between <b>age,</b> <b>Ht,</b> <b>Wt,</b> BMI, AC, and BP with weight being a more viable predictor of SBP and age a more viable predictor of DBP...|$|R

40|$|Thirty {{young male}} volunteers, 9 - 14. yrs, were studied to {{determine}} if a relationship existed between peak VO 2 and the 9 -min run distance. Physical characteristics for a 1 l Ss included <b>ht,</b> <b>wt,</b> and % fat. Ss were tested for volitional peak VO 2 on the treadmill using the Skinner et al. (1971) protocol. Variables measured were VE max, RER, HR max, and peak VO 2 (l-min - 1 ml/kg/min-l). A 9 -min run for distance was also performed by the Ss. A multiple regression technique was used to predict peak 90 from the 9 -min run distance. The resulting r value when predicting peak VO 2 in ml/kg/min from the 9 -min distance was 0. 693. The r value for prediction of peak VO 2 in l'min from the 9 -min run distance was 0. 583. Other variables measured were entered into the regression technique to improve the R such as <b>age,</b> <b>ht,</b> <b>wt,</b> HR, F 3 R, % fat, and body density. It was concluded that 2 equations which utilized. <b>wt</b> (kg) and <b>ht</b> (an) with the 9 -min run distance (yds) predicted peak V 02 values with the mst accuracy and practicality in ml/kg/min- (R=O. 7 89) and 1 'min- (R- 0. 966) : Peak k (ml/kg/min-l) = - 12. 13 t 0. 29608 (X 3) - 2 Peak yo 2 (1 -min-l) = - 3. 391 + 0. 017377 (X 3) + 0. 00072169 (XI) + 0. 033712 (X 2) Key: X 1 = 9 -min run distance (yds) X 2 = wt (kg) X 3 = Ht (cm) The multiple R value (0. 812) which combined % fat with the 9 -min was also concluded to be a goad predictor of peak V 02 (ml/kg/min- 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{the absence}} of stochasticity, {{allometric}} growth throughout ontogeny is axiomatically described by the logarithm-transformed power-law model, ht~log a bzk w t, where ht:h(t) and w t:w(t) are the logarithmic sizes of two traits {{at any given time}} t. Realistically, however, stochasticity is an inherent property of ontogenetic allometry. Due to the inherent stochasticity in both ht and w t, the ontogenetic allometry coefficients, log a b and k, can vary with t and have intricate temporal distributions that are governed by the central and mixed moments of the random ontogenetic growth functions, ht and w t. Unfortunately, there is no probabilistic model for analyzing these informative ontogenetic statistical moments. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study treats <b>ht</b> and <b>wt</b> as correlated stochastic processes to formulate the exact probabilistic version of each of the ontogenetic allometry coefficients. In particular, the statistical dynamics of relative growth is addressed by analyzing the allometric growth factors that affect the temporal distribution of the probabilistic version of the relative growth rate, k:DtðuSVtTÞ=DtðvSVtTÞ, where SVtT is the expected value of the ratio of stochastic <b>ht</b> to stochastic <b>wt,</b> and uSVtT and vSVtT are the numerator and the denominator of SVtT, respectively. These allometric growth factors, which provide important insight into ontogenetic allometry but appear only when stochasticity is introduced, describe the central and mixed moments of <b>ht</b> and <b>wt</b> as differentiable real-valued functions of t...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} postnatal {{growth of}} extremely {{low birth weight}} infants (ELBW, < 1, 000 g) until 36 months of corrected age (CA), and to relate growth outcome to anthropometric parameters at birth, sex, fetal growth status (small or appropriate for gestational age [...] SGA/AGA), period of admission and major perinatal events. STUDY DESIGN/METHOD: Weight (<b>Wt),</b> height (<b>Ht)</b> and head circumference (HC) were assessed in 159 ELBW infants. Data were standardized with Z-scores following Usher and McLean and Sempe growth curves. Uni- and multivariate statistical analysis were performed. RESULTS: The mean birth weight was 851. 2 +/- 116. 5 g. Z-scores decreased from birth to term, at a deeper rate for AGA than for SGA infants (p< 0. 005 for <b>Ht,</b> <b>Wt,</b> and HC). Between term and 36 months, growth was better in SGA compared with AGA infants (p= 0. 003 for Ht). Multivariate analysis showed that anthropometric parameters at birth were positive determinants for <b>Wt,</b> <b>Ht</b> and HC at term, and also for <b>Wt</b> and <b>Ht</b> at 36 months CA (Z-scores). Oxygen therapy after 36 weeks of post-conceptional age was a negative determinant influencing growth at 36 months CA (Z-scores). CONCLUSIONS: Significant catch-up growth took place between birth and 36 months, which was greater for SGA than for AGA infants. Anthropometric parameters at birth and oxygen therapy at 36 weeks post-conceptional age are the main predictive factors for growth at 36 months CA...|$|R

40|$|Oxidative {{stress and}} {{oxidative}} damage of cerebral vasculature and neuronal cells {{have been found}} {{to play an important role}} in ageing-related neurodegenerative behaviour disorders. Although several enzymatic sources are involved in brain ROS generation, recently NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox 2) has been suggested as a major source of ROS generation in ageing-related vascular dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we used age-matched littermates of wild-type (WT) and Nox 2 knockout (Nox 2 (-/-)) mice on a C 57 BL/ 6 background at young (3 - 4 month old) and old age (18 - 21 month old) to investigate the relationship between Nox 2 -derived ROS production, cerebral vascular damage and the loss of locomotor activity in ageing. There was no significant difference in locomotor activity between WT and Nox 2 (-/-) young mice as measured digitally using laser-beam motility chambers over a 42 h period. Compared to young mice, <b>WT</b> <b>ageing</b> mice (but not Nox 2 (-/-) ageing mice) had a significant decrease in horizontal activity (p < 0. 05) and total activity in the dark period. We then examined the levels of ROS production in brain homogenates by lucigenin (5 µM) -chemiluminescence and in brain sections by DHE fluorescence. Compared to WT young mouse brains, there were significant increases in the levels of ROS production in <b>WT</b> <b>ageing</b> brains and this was accompanied with an average 2 -fold reduction in the numbers of CD 31 -positive vessels (all p < 0. 05) as revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy and vessel number counting. Compared to <b>WT</b> <b>ageing</b> mice, knockout of Nox 2 completely inhibited the age-related increase in brain ROS production and preserved the cerebral microvasculature density and the locomotor activity. In conclusion, Nox 2 -derived ROS plays an important role in oxidative damage of cerebral vasculature and the loss of locomotor activity at old age...|$|R

Impaired postnatal growth has been reported to be associated with delayed cognitive and motor development. Aims: To describe postnatal growth patterns of appropriate and small for gestational age (AGA and SGA) ELBW children in relation to their cognitive and motor outcome at age 5. 5. Study design: Retrospective cohort study. Subjects: One hundred one children with a BW Outcome measures: Height (<b>Ht),</b> weight (<b>Wt),</b> occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) at birth, 15 months and 2 years corrected age and 3. 5 and 5. 5 years. Cognitive and motor outcome at 5. 5 years of age, classified as normal (Z-score >=- 1). mildly delayed (- 2 =- 2 SDS) infants were compared with SGA (<b>Ht.</b> <b>Wt</b> or OFC at birth Results: Between birth and 5. 5 years catch-up growth in lit, weight for height (Wt/Ht), Wt and OFC was seen in 72. 2 %, 55. 2 %, 28. 6 % and 68. 9 % respectively of the SGA infants. For AGA infants we found substantial catch-down growth in lit (15. 4 %) and Wt (33. 8 %). Cognitive and motor outcome was normal in 76. 2 % and 41. 6 % of the 101 children. A significantly higher percentage of normal cognitive outcome was found in AGA infants with Wt growth remaining at >=- 2 SDS compared to AGA infants with catch-down growth (83 % vs 63 %). Next, SGA infants who caught-up in OFC had a higher prevalence of normal cognitive outcome compared to SGA infants who did not catch-up in OFC. Furthermore, a higher percentage of severely delayed motor outcome was found in SGA infants without catch-up growth in Wt compared to SGA infants who caught-up in Wt (61. 5 % vs 32. 2 %). Conclusions: Catch-up growth in Ht. Wt/Ht and OFC occurred in the majority of the SGA infants with a BW =- 2 SDS have a better cognitive and motor developmental outcome at 5. 5 years of age. Catch-up growth in OFC was associated with a better cognitive outcome at 5. 5 years of age. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} study was to assess the tolerance and compliance of an intended population of infants to a new formulation of a hypoallergenic eHF. Methods: A non-random, single-group, multicenter study was conducted. Infants with suspected food protein allergy, persistent feeding intolerance, or presenting conditions where an eHF was deemed appropriate were enrolled in a 15 -day feeding trial. Intake, stool patterns, weight (wt), length, and questionnaires were collected. The primary outcome was maintenance of <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-score during the study. Results: 25 infants (85 + 8. 9 d of age) were enrolled; 7 were> 4 months; 4 were preterm. At entry, 12 had symptoms of allergic colitis or food protein allergy/intolerance, 12 had persistent formula intolerance, 11 had hematochezia/heme positive stools, and 1 was recovering from necrotizing enterocolitis. Mean <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-score was- 0. 62 + 0. 19 at entry and- 0. 41 + 0. 16 at exit. Mean change in <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-score was 0. 21 + 0. 10. Mean formula intake was 764 + 48 mL/day. The mean number of stools/day was 1. 8 + 0. 4 and the predominant stool consistencies were loose/mushy (48 %) or soft (43 %). Conclusion: The results suggest that this eHF was well accepted and tolerated by an intended use population of infants during the first 6 months of life which enabled adequate volume consumption, maintenance of <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-scores and a high level of parental satisfaction...|$|R
