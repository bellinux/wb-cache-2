5|$|Ms. Mililani Minerva Mudd, Millie's mother, is a lawyer, who is as an older, wiser, more {{temperate}} {{version of}} Millie. She was like Millie in her childhood, {{and as a}} result knows how to deal with any trouble caused by her, much to Millie's annoyance. While Ms. Mudd knows how to deal with Millie, she is also the first to lend her support <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> amiss. She married Llewellyn {{at the end of the}} strip's run in a storyarc from November–December 2008. Her full name was revealed on October 1, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Sir Rowland wonders <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> {{written on}} the autographed papers in {{invisible}} ink and they test them, revealing the names of six distributors of drugs, including Costello. Going to tell the police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone and, after a moment, Jeremy re-enters {{and is about to}} smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was away from the other two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made about seeing his golf club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E

500|$|Natasha starts dating Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) and she {{believes}} that they are perfect for each other. Novakovic said that they [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and added [...] "I don't think she could find a guy that would tolerate her like Andrew does. She thinks he's the only guy she could possibly be with." [...] Natasha thinks that school and studying is not cool and is happy that Andrew feels the same, until Summer Hoyland joins their class and Andrew becomes interested in his studies. Natasha fears that she could lose her control over Andrew. Summer later asks Natasha <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> else, other than the physical aspect, to her relationship with Andrew. Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her {{stop and think about}} what she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship to have to be about communicating and understanding each other. Andrew does not take the new direction of the relationship well. Novakovic said that Natasha believes the relationship between her neighbours, Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), is something to be inspired by. She added [...] "That's what she wants to look forward to, but she's getting way ahead of herself. Andrew likes her but he isn't as serious as she is." [...] Novakovic opined that Andrew and Natasha [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and that Natasha's relationship with Andrew had been one of her favourite storylines.|$|E

[...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you.

2500|$|Ward {{was killed}} in the Battle of Cixi and his {{successor}} H. A. Burgevine, an American was disliked by the Imperial Chinese authorities. Burgevine was an unsavory character known for his greed and for being an alcoholic. Moreover, Burgevine made little effort to hide his racism, and his relations with the Chinese were very difficult at the best of times. Li Hongzhang, the governor of the Jiangsu province, requested Staveley to appoint a British officer to command the contingent. Staveley selected Gordon, who had been made a brevet major in December 1862 and the nomination was approved by the British government. Given Burgevine's alcoholism, open corruption, and a tendency to engage in acts of mindless violence when drunk, the Chinese wanted [...] "a man of good temper, of clean hands and a steady economist" [...] as his replacement. These requirements led Staveley to choose Gordon. Li was impressed with Gordon, writing:It is a direct blessing from Heaven, the coming of this British Gordon. ... He is superior in manner and bearing to any of the foreigners whom I have come into contact with, and does not show outwardly that conceit which makes most of them repugnant in my sight...What an elixir for a heavy heart-to see this splendid Englishman fight! ... <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> that I admire nearly as much as the superb scholarship of Zeng Guofan, it is the military qualities of this fine officer. He is a glorious fellow!...With his many faults, his pride, his temper, and his never-ending demand for money – but he is a noble man, and in spite of all I have said to him or about him, I will ever think most highly of him. ... He is an honest man, but difficult to get on with. Gordon was honest and incorruptible, and unlike many Chinese officers, did not steal the money that was meant to pay his men, but rather insisted on paying the Ever Victorious Army on time and in full. Gordon's insistence on paying his men meant that he always pressing the Imperial government for money, something which often irritated the mandarins who did not understand why Gordon did not just let his men loot and plunder as a compensation for wages. Gordon designed the uniform for the Ever Victorious Army, which consisted of black boots together with turbans, jackets and trousers that were all green while his personal bodyguard of 300 men wore blue uniforms.|$|E
