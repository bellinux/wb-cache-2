5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> be expected to hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say}} that domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} idea {{of building}} a railway between Norway's two largest cities was launched by Hans Gløersen on 24 August 1871 in Bergensposten. The forest supervisor in Voss suggested building the railway via Voss and Hallingdal {{to connect with the}} Krøderen Line. Back in 1866 the same person had launched the idea of the Jæren Line. Within days of the launch of the Bergen Line the city council had assimilated support for the suggestion. In 1872 the railway director Carl Abraham Pihl and two engineers went on a survey tour to look at the suggested line. At the time it was common that proposals for railways came from local initiative, and that local municipalities and private <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> then pay about 20% of the investments, the state covering the rest, mostly through foreign debt.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of transfers, Overbeck tried to sell the {{territory}} to Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy but all rejected his offer. Overbeck then co-operated with the British Dent brothers (Alfred Dent and Edward Dent) for financial backing to develop the land, with the Dent company persuading him that any <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> need guarantees of British military and diplomatic support. Overbeck agreed to this co-operation, {{especially with regard to}} the counterclaims of the Sultan of Sulu, part of whose territory in the Sulu Archipelago had been occupied by Spain. Overbeck, however, withdrew in 1879 and his treaty rights were transferred to Alfred Dent, who in 1881 formed the North Borneo Provisional Association Ltd to administer the territory. In the following year, Kudat was made its capital but due to frequent pirate attacks, the capital was moved to Sandakan in 1884. To prevent further disputes over intervention, the governments of the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany signed the Madrid Protocol of 1885, recognising the sovereignty of the King of Spain over the Sulu Archipelago in return for the relinquishment of all Spanish claims over northern Borneo. The arrival of the company brought prosperity to the residents of northern Borneo, with the company allowing indigenous communities to continue their traditional lifestyles, but imposing laws against headhunting, ethnic feuds, slave trade, and piracy. North Borneo then became a protectorate of the United Kingdom in 1888 despite facing local resistance from 1894 to 1900 by Mat Salleh and Antanum in 1915.|$|E

25|$|In {{portfolio}} theory, {{the locus}} of mean-variance efficient portfolios (called the efficient frontier) is {{the upper half of}} the east-opening branch of a hyperbola drawn with the portfolio return's standard deviation plotted horizontally and its expected value plotted vertically; according to this theory, all rational <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> choose a portfolio characterized by some point on this locus.|$|E

50|$|Currency risk is {{the risk}} that the value of the {{currency}} a bond pays out will decline compared to the holder's reference currency. For example, a German <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> consider United States bonds to have more currency risk than German bonds (since the dollar may go down relative to the euro); similarly, a United States <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> consider German bonds to have more currency risk than United States bonds (since the euro may go down relative to the dollar). A bond paying in a currency that does not have a history of keeping its value may not be a good deal even if a high interest rate is offered.|$|R
50|$|In {{aforementioned}} example, the <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> need {{to substantiate}} {{his or her}} investment intent to the IRS by showing an arm's length lease to the son and other students. The investor should declare income and related depreciation deductions.|$|R
25|$|Goodwin began {{commenting on}} NESARA in {{connection}} with Omega Trust, a fraudulent investment scheme whose creator, Clyde Hood, was on trial at the time. According to Goodwin, Omega Trust <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> receive their returns after NESARA was announced. Goodwin repeatedly predicted that the NESARA announcement would occur {{in the very near}} future, although in later years she became more reserved in these predictions.|$|E
25|$|Hazard had {{previously}} invested in {{an idea of}} Blodget's called the Boston Tontine, a sort of early annuity fund that also acted as a lottery for the last surviving investor. It failed, but Blodget and Hazard decided to try again in Philadelphia, then the largest city in North America. They called their new attempt the Universal Tontine Association and this time gave it a 21-year lifespan, after which the association would disband and the surviving <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> split {{what remained of the}} fund.|$|E
25|$|The Universal Tontine Association {{also failed}} to {{generate}} the hoped-for interest. In November 1792, its investors met at the Pennsylvania State House (today Independence Hall) {{to decide what to}} do with their fund. On November 12, they adopted a proposal to form a general insurance company, to be called the Insurance Company of North America. On November 19, the investors adopted articles of association, giving the company the ability to write fire, life, or marine insurance, though initially the <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> focus solely on marine.|$|E
50|$|In the Common law of England, the {{practice}} of financing lawsuits was connected with champerty and maintenance, which was a practice whereby the <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> {{become involved in the}} lawsuit.

50|$|One {{offshoot}} of this {{discounted cash flow}} analysis is the Fed Model. Under the Fed model, the earnings yield is compared to the 10-year treasury bonds. If the earnings yield is {{lower than that of}} the bonds, the <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> shift their money into the less risky T-bonds.|$|R
5000|$|Resource {{extraction}} in the Democratic Republic of Congo (e.g. mining) {{has been}} undercapitalized {{for many years}} due to endemic violence and looting, uncertain property rights and concerns about corruption.

25|$|The Japanese yen soared against {{most major}} {{currencies}} following the earthquake and reached a post-World War II high of 76.25 yen to the US dollar on speculation that Japanese <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> repatriate assets {{to pay for}} rebuilding. Since Japan relies heavily on exports, the strong yen could dampen its economy further. The financial markets' instability prompted the G7 to meet on 17March, resulting in an agreement on joint forex intervention to sell yen against the dollar; {{it was the first}} such move since 2000.|$|E

25|$|Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, {{offered to}} sell the patent {{outright}} to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone {{was nothing but a}} toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted {{to sell the}} patent. Bell's <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.|$|E
2500|$|Mandatory {{convertibles}} are {{a common}} variation of the vanilla subtype, especially on the US market. Mandatory convertible would force the holder to convert into shares at maturity—hence the term [...] "Mandatory". Those securities would very often bear two conversion prices, making their profiles similar to a [...] "risk reversal" [...] option strategy. The first conversion price would limit the price where the <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> receive the equivalent of its par value back in shares, the second would delimit where the investor will earn more than par. Note that if the stock price is below the first conversion price the <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> suffer a capital loss compared to its original investment (excluding the potential coupon payments). Mandatory convertibles {{can be compared to}} forward selling of equity at a premium.|$|R
50|$|An {{investor}} {{who wishes to}} be entitled to the dividend does not have to wait until after the record date to sell the stock; however, the investor must hold the stock until the ex-dividend date. If the investor were to sell the stock on the ex-dividend date or afterwards, the <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> still be entitled to the dividend payment. In this example, assuming that the investor purchased the stock one day before the ex-dividend date, the <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> be a stockholder on the record date. If the investor sells the stock on the ex-dividend date, the buyer of the stock would be a stockholder one day after the record date given the three stock business trading day settlement. The person that bought the stock would not be entitled to receive the dividend.|$|R

25|$|Hord {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Conservative MEPs and as the annual meeting of the group approached in January 1982, he was mentioned as a possible candidate for group leader; however, he decided not to stand. As a city-based member he opposed increased farm prices, but did manage to persuade the Commission to reconsider a plan to subsidise conversion of the 'wine lake' into industrial alcohol. Although he could be highly critical of European institutions, Hord was willing to put the case for EEC membership: he felt <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> need access to a tariff-free market. He was a Whip for the European Democratic Group from 1982 to 1983.|$|E
25|$|Simply {{examining}} {{the performance of}} the best known value <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> not be instructive, because investors do not become well known unless they are successful. This introduces a selection bias. A better way to investigate the performance of a group of value investors was suggested by Warren Buffett, in his May 17, 1984 speech that was published as The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville. In this speech, Buffett examined the performance of those investors who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation and were thus most influenced by Benjamin Graham. Buffett's conclusion is identical to that of the academic research on simple value investing strategies—value investing is, on average, successful in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Orion's Belt was {{the first}} film to be financed as a KS, with some investors {{investing}} capital and others only guaranteeing. The state grants were structured {{in such a way}} that had the film been withdrawn from the cinemas after a revenue of NOK5 million, all <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> have received more money at the expense of the state. This was in part because increased grants reduced the tax advantage of the KS model. Subsequently the rules were changed to increase the incentive to make a high-grossing production. The tax rules also caused problems for Alveberg and Borgli in financing their next film, Etter Rubicon.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to hedge}} is the beta neutral. Beta is the {{historical}} correlation between a stock and an index.

50|$|An {{investor}} {{who did not}} reinvest would have received total distributions (cash payments) of $5.78 per share. The return over the five-year period for such an <b>investor</b> <b>would</b> be ($19.90 + $5.78) / $14.21 - 1 = 80.72%, and the arithmetic average rate of return would be 80.72%/5 = 16.14% per year.|$|R
25|$|Paulson {{agreed with}} Bernanke {{that the only}} way to unlock the frozen capital markets was to provide direct {{injections}} into financial institutions so <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> have confidence in these institutions. The government would take a non-voting share position, with 5% dividends for the first year on the money lent to the banks and 9% thereafter until the banks stabilized and could repay the government loans. According to the book Too Big To Fail, Paulson, Bernanke, New York Federal Reserve Chairman Timothy Geithner, and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair attended the meeting on October 13, 2008, at which this plan was presented to the CEOs of nine major banks.|$|E

25|$|The canal {{was a very}} {{efficient}} way of moving large amounts of heavy goods cheaply and with minimal labor. But White and Hazard had single-handedly spurred canal construction {{up and down the}} East Coast by taming the Lehigh River with navigations in less than two years, and four years ahead of promises to investors. Unfortunately, the northern canals would freeze in the winter, and their towpaths were muddy in spring and late fall. This made it impractical for a burgeoning mill town that needed year-round freight transportation, but if LC Co. was putting monies into railroads, other businessmen {{were going to have to}} take a hard careful look. With steamboat tugs proven on the Merrimack and Middlesex Canal themselves, and news of railroads building in Europe and now, the United States, <b>investors</b> <b>would</b> need to adopt new techniques sooner or miss opportunities.|$|E
