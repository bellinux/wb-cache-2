2500|$|In {{the paper}} by Higgs the boson is massive, {{and in a}} closing {{sentence}} Higgs writes that [...] "an essential feature" [...] of the theory [...] "is the prediction of incomplete multiplets of scalar and vector bosons". (Frank Close comments that 1960s gauge theorists were focused {{on the problem of}} massless vector bosons, and the implied existence of a massive scalar boson was not seen as important; only Higgs directly addressed <b>it.)</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> by GHK the boson is massless and decoupled from the massive states. In reviews dated 2009 and 2011, Guralnik states that in the GHK model the boson is massless only in a lowest-order approximation, but it is not subject to any constraint and acquires mass at higher orders, and adds that the GHK paper was the only one to show that there are no massless Goldstone bosons in the model and to give a complete analysis of the general Higgs mechanism. All three reached similar conclusions, despite their very different approaches: Higgs' paper essentially used classical techniques, Englert and Brout's involved calculating vacuum polarisation in perturbation theory around an assumed symmetry-breaking vacuum state, and GHK used operator formalism and conservation laws to explore in depth the ways in which Goldstone's theorem may be worked around.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, we have {{proposed}} some modifica-tions of the reduced update Kalman filter (RUKF) {{as applied to}} filtering of images corrupted by additive noise. First, we have reduced the computational complexity by reducing the state di-mensionality. By doing so, <b>it</b> is shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> that <b>the</b> computational requirement is reduced by an order of magni-tude while the loss of performance is only marginal. Next, the RUKF is modified using the score function based approach to accommodate the non-Gaussian noise. The image is modeled as a nonstationary mean and stationary variance autoregressive Gaussian process. <b>It</b> is shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> that <b>the</b> stationary variance assumption is reasonable if the nonstationary mean is computed by an edge and detail preserving efficient estimator of local nonstationary mean. Such an estimator called HMSMD filter is also described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper.</b> Finally, detailed experi-mental results are provided which indicate {{the success of the}} new filtering scheme.
