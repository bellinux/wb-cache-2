50|$|<b>Emedastine</b> (trade name Emadine) is {{a second}} {{generation}} antihistamine used in eye drops to alleviate the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. It acts as a H1 receptor antagonist. It works by blocking the action of histamine that causes allergic symptoms. It is used in form of the difumarate. The <b>emedastine</b> difumarate is a white, crystalline, water-soluble fine powder. <b>Emedastine</b> eye drops is usually applied twice a day to the affected eye. When the patients with allergic conjunctivitis were treated with 0.05% <b>emedastine</b> difumarate ophthalmic solution for six weeks, the signs and symptoms such as redness, itching and swelling of the eyes were relieved. <b>Emedastine</b> appears to be devoid of effects on adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin receptors. This drug was developed by Alcon, which is global medical company specializing in eye care products.|$|E
50|$|The human oral {{bioavailability}} {{is approximately}} 50% and maximum plasma concentration was achieved within 1-2 hours after dosing. <b>Emedastine</b> is mainly metabolized by the liver. There are two primary metabolites: 5-hydroxyemedastine and 6-hydroxyemedastine. They are excreted {{in the urine}} as both free and conjugated forms. The 5'-oxoanalogs of 5-hydroxyemedastine, 6-hydroxyemedastine and the N-oxide are also formed as minor metabolites. The elimination half-life of oral <b>emedastine</b> in plasma is 3-4 hours, whereas that of topical <b>emedastine</b> is 10 hours. Approximately 44% of the oral dose is recovered in the urine over 24 hours with only 3.6% of the dose excreted as parent drug.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} cost {{effectiveness}} of <b>emedastine,</b> a new antihistamine, versus levocabastine {{in the treatment}} of acute allergic conjunctivitis (AAC) in Belgium, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. Design and setting: Randomised double-blind multicountry clinical trial followed by economic modelling from the treatment provider perspective. Patients: A total of 221 patients (109 <b>emedastine,</b> 112 levocabastine) with AAC were included. Methods: The clinical trial compared the efficacy and safety of <b>emedastine</b> 0. 05 % and levocabastine 0. 05 %, both twice daily, for 42 days, using ocular redness, itching, days without symptoms and clinical failure as outcome measures. The cost of first-line treatment failure, including visits, drugs and laboratory examinations, was established in each country from a panel of ophthalmologists and general practitioners.

40|$|AbstractSpectrophotometric {{procedures}} were presented for {{the determination of}} antihistaminic drug, <b>emedastine</b> difumarate. The methods {{are based on the}} charge transfer complexation reaction of the drug with π-acceptors; 2, 3 -dichloro- 5, 6 -dicyano- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (DDQ), chloranilic acid (CA) and 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). Different charge-transfer complexes and colored radical anions were obtained. The formations of the colored complexes were utilized in the development of simple, rapid and accurate spectrophotometric methods for the analysis of <b>emedastine</b> in drug substance and products. Under the optimum reaction conditions, linear relationships with good correlation coefficients (0. 9996 – 0. 9999) were found between the absorbance at the relevant maxima and the concentrations of <b>emedastine</b> in the range of 0. 8 – 200 μgmL− 1. The limits of detection ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 76 μgmL− 1. The molar absorptivities and association constants for the colored complexes were evaluated using the Benesi–Hildebrand equation. The free energy change (ΔG°) and the enthalpy of formation (ΔH°) as well as the entropy (ΔS°) were also determined. The methods were successfully applied to analyze the drug formulation with mean recovery percentages±RSD% of 100. 04 ± 0. 59 – 100. 22 ± 0. 72.

40|$|Background: Mast cell-derived {{histamine}} {{is known}} to act on dermal fi broblasts and contribute to formation of an intractable chronic allergic dermatitis. Although this fi brotic event may also occur in other organs such as the nasal mucosa, no direct evidence has been reported as to whether responsiveness to histamine by fi broblasts derived from different organs is of the same intensity. Furthermore, while type 1 histamine receptor (H 1 R) blockers {{have been shown to}} be effective for alleviation of the symptoms of allergic diseases, their ability to affect histamine-induced tissue remodeling has not yet been clarifi ed. Objective: Our aim was to study the effect of H 1 R-blockers on histamine-induced tissue remodeling. Methods: A macroarray assay was used for a comprehensive analysis of histamine–induced gene expression by normal human fi broblasts. Fibroblasts derived from skin or nasal mucosa were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of histamine, and the synthesis of type 1 collagen was measured by means of semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To determine the effect of H 1 R blockers, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and <b>emedastine</b> difumarate were investigated in this assay. Results: Histamine induced expression of various kinds of fi brogenic molecules in fi broblasts. Increased type 1 collagen expression was observed in fi broblasts treated with high-dose (0. 1 mM to 1 µM) and low-dose (1 pM) histamine. This histamine-induced type 1 collagen synthesis was effectively diminished by <b>emedastine</b> difumarate. While organ specifi city seems to be involved, <b>emedastine</b> difumarate i...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} the two antihistaminic drugs Azelastine-HCl and <b>Emedastine</b> difumarate is studied in micellar solutions. Anodic oxidation is obtained at the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and a carbon paste electrode (CPE) using cyclic voltammetry(CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in Britton-Robinson buffers (pH 8 and pH 6) containing 0. 8 × 10 - 4 M sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS). The peak potential shifts to more positive value in anionic surfactant (sodium dodecylsulphate solution) than in presence of cationic surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) or the non-ionic surfactant (Triton X- 100). The oxidation was characterized by the single one-electron wave. The method has been validated according to the ICH Guidelines, when the limit of quantitation ranges between 0. 4 × 10 - 7 and 0. 8 × 10 - 7 mol L- 1...|$|E
40|$|Background: Since all antihistamines {{are capable}} of {{crossing}} the blood-brain barrier, they may also cause sedation which may impair daily activities such as driving a car. The purpose of this review {{was to examine the}} effects of antihistamines on driving ability. Method: A literature search revealed 18 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials that applied the on-road highway driving test. In this test, subjects are instructed to drive 100 -km on a public highway with a steady lateral position and a constant speed (95 km/h). Primary outcome measure is the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP, cm), i. e. the weaving of the car. Results: The literature search yielded 18 clinical trials. At therapeutic doses, a single dose of diphenhydramine, <b>emedastine</b> and hydroxizine impaired driving comparable or greater than the effects of BAC 0. 08 %. Clemastine, triprolidine, mizolastine, acrivastine, dexchlorpheniramine CR and mequitazine impaired driving performance to the same extent as BAC 0. 05 %. For mizolastine significant impairment was only seen after higher than therapeutic doses. Results for cetirizine were mixed, illustrating the drug has the potential to impair driving performance, especially in sensitive subjects. Terfenadine, loratadine levocetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, bilastine fexofenadine and rupatadine showed no driving impairment in the standard driving test after acute administration of their recommended dose. Several studies examined subchronic effects of antihistamines on driving performance. After 4 days of daily treatment significant driving impairment was found for <b>emedastine</b> (2 and 4 mg bid), diphenhydramine (50 mg), clemastine (2 mg bid), triprolidine (5 mg bid), after 5 days of ebastine (30 mg), and after 8 days of hydroxyzine (50 mg). Mixed results were found for cetirizine (10 mg), terfenadine (120 mg) and loratadine (20 mg). No significant differences from placebo were observed after 4 days of subchronic treatment with triprolidine (10 mg), levocetirizine (5 mg), fexofenadine (up to 120 mg), and after 8 days of daily treatment with dexchlorpheniramine (6 mg), bilastine (20 and 40 mg), and mequitazine (10 mg). Conclusion: First- and second-generation antihistamines may significantly impair driving performance. The newer antihistamines such as levocetirizine and fexofenadine that cross to blood brain barrier to a much lesser degree do not show clinically relevant sedation or driving impairment...|$|E
40|$|Background Chronic {{spontaneous}} urticaria (CSU) is characterised by {{the development}} of crops of red, itchy, raised weals or hives with no identifiable external cause. Objectives To assess the effects of H 1 -antihistamines for CSU. Search methods We searched the following databases up to June 2014 : Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and PsycINFO (from 1806). We searched five trials registers and checked articles for references to relevant randomised controlled trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of H 1 -antihistamines for CSU. Interventions included single therapy or a combination of H 1 -antihistamines compared with no treatment (placebo) or another active pharmacological compound at any dose. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome measures were proportion of participants with complete suppression of urticaria: 'good or excellent' response, 50 % or greater improvement in quality of life measures, and adverse events. We present risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Main results We identified 73 studies (9759 participants); 34 studies provided data for 23 comparisons. The duration of the intervention was up to two weeks (short-term) or longer than two weeks and up to three months (intermediate-term). Cetirizine 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term led to complete suppression of urticaria by more participants than was seen with placebo (RR 2. 72, 95 % CI 1. 51 to 4. 91). For this same outcome, comparison of desloratadine versus placebo in the intermediate term (5 mg) (RR 37. 00, 95 % CI 2. 31 to 593. 70) and in the short term (20 mg) (RR 15. 97, 95 % CI 1. 04 to 245. 04) favoured desloratadine, but no differences were seen between 5 mg and 10 mg for short-term treatment. Levocetirizine 20 mg per day (short-term) was more effective for complete suppression of urticaria compared with placebo (RR 20. 87, 95 % CI 1. 37 to 317. 60), and at 5 mg was effective in the intermediate term (RR 52. 88, 95 % CI 3. 31 to 843. 81) but not in the short term, nor was 10 mg effective in the short term. Rupatadine at 10 mg and 20 mg in the intermediate term achieved a 'good or excellent response' compared with placebo (RR 1. 35, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 77). Loratadine (10 mg) versus placebo (RR 1. 86, 95 % CI 0. 91 to 3. 79) and loratadine (10 mg) versus cetirizine (10 mg) (RR 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 76 to 1. 43) over short-term and intermediate-term treatment showed no significant difference for 'good or excellent response' or for complete suppression of urticaria, respectively. Loratadine (10 mg) versus desloratadine (5 mg) (intermediate-term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 06) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1. 04, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 71). For loratadine (10 mg) versus mizolastine (10 mg) (intermediate-term), no statistically significant difference was seen for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 16) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 0. 88, 95 % CI 0. 55 to 1. 42). Loratadine (10 mg) versus <b>emedastine</b> (2 mg) (intermediate-term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression (RR 1. 04, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 39) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1. 09, 95 % CI 0. 96 to 1. 24); the quality of the evidence was moderate for this comparison. No difference in short-term treatment was noted between loratadine (10 mg) and hydroxyzine (25 mg) in terms of complete suppression (RR 1. 00, 95 % CI 0. 32 to 3. 10). When desloratadine (5 to 20 mg) was compared with levocetirizine (5 to 20 mg), levocetirizine appeared to be the more effective (P value < 0. 02). In a comparison of fexofenadine versus cetirizine, more participants in the cetirizine group showed complete suppression of urticaria (P value < 0. 001). Adverse events leading to withdrawals were not significantly different in the following comparisons: cetirizine versus placebo at 10 mg and 20 mg (RR 3. 00, 95 % CI 0. 68 to 13. 22); desloratadine 5 mg versus placebo (RR 1. 46, 95 % CI 0. 42 to 5. 10); loratadine 10 mg versus mizolastine 10 mg (RR 0. 38, 95 % CI 0. 04 to 3. 60); loratadine 10 mg versus <b>emedastine</b> 2 mg (RR 1. 09, 95 % CI 0. 07 to 17. 14); cetirizine 10 mg versus hydroxyzine 25 mg (RR 0. 78, 95 % CI 0. 25 to 2. 45); and hydroxyzine 25 mg versus placebo (RR 3. 64, 95 % CI 0. 77 to 17. 23), all intermediate term. No difference was seen between loratadine 10 mg versus mizolastine 10 mg in the proportion of participants with at least 50 % improvement in quality of life (RR 3. 21, 95 % CI 0. 32 to 32. 33). Authors' conclusions Although the results of our review indicate that at standard doses of treatment, several antihistamines are effective when compared with placebo, all results were gathered from a few studies or, in some cases, from single-study estimates. The quality of the evidence was affected by the small number of studies in each comparison and the small sample size for many of the outcomes, prompting us to downgrade the quality of evidence for imprecision (unless stated for each comparison, the quality of the evidence was low). No single H 1 -antihistamine stands out as most effective. Cetirizine at 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term was found to be effective in completely suppressing urticaria. Evidence is limited for desloratadine given at 5 mg once daily in the intermediate term and at 20 mg in the short term. Levocetirizine at 5 mg in the intermediate but not short term was effective for complete suppression. Levocetirizine 20 mg was effective in the short term, but 10 mg was not. No difference in rates of withdrawal due to adverse events was noted between active and placebo groups. Evidence for improvement in quality of life was insufficient...|$|E
