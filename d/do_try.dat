A punt in this situation is placed as close to the out of field line as possible, which gives the opposition little chances to regather.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit {{languages}} are a fairly closely linked set of languages {{which can be}} broken up using a number of different criteria. Traditionally, Inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncrasies in language: The dialect of Igloolik versus the dialect of Iqaluit, for example. However, political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the Inuit languages because of their links to different writing systems, literary traditions, schools, media sources and borrowed vocabulary. This makes any partition of the Inuit language somewhat problematic. This article will use labels that try to synthesise linguistic, sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the Inuit dialect spectrum. This scheme {{is not the only one}} used or necessarily one used by Inuit themselves, but its labels <b>do</b> <b>try</b> to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature.|$|E

[...] The band's music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts; Francis explained in 1991, [...] "Those are the two basic components of rock music... the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We <b>do</b> <b>try</b> to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't {{know how to do}} anything else.

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can <b>do,</b> <b>try</b> again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{religious}} and cultural values in Pakistan, women who <b>do</b> <b>try</b> to enter the workforce are often pushed into the lower of the three employment structures. This structure level, unorganized services sector, has low pay, low job security and low productivity. In order to improve this situation, governmental organizations and political parties need to push for the entrance of women into the organized services sector. Conservative interpretations of Islam have not promoted women's rights in the workforce, since they value women as keepers of the family honor, support gender segregation, and institutionalization of gender disparities. Furthermore, women who do work are often paid less than minimum wage, because they are seen as lesser beings in comparison to men, and [...] “their working conditions vis-à-vis females are often hazardous; having long working hours, no medical benefits, no job security, subjected to job discrimination, verbal abuse and sexual harassment and no support from male oriented labor unions”(An In-Depth Analysis of Women's Labor Force Participation in Pakistan).|$|E
2500|$|Cicero's {{last words}} {{are said to}} have been, [...] "There is nothing proper about what you are doing, soldier, but <b>do</b> <b>try</b> to kill me properly." [...] He bowed to his captors, leaning his head out of the litter in a gladiatorial gesture to ease the task. By baring his neck and throat to the soldiers, he was {{indicating}} that he wouldn't resist. According to Plutarch, Herennius first slew him, then cut off his head. On Antony's instructions his hands, which had penned the Philippics against Antony, were cut off as well; these were nailed along with his head on the Rostra in the Forum Romanum according to the tradition of Marius and Sulla, both of whom had displayed the heads of their enemies in the Forum. Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions who was displayed in that manner. According to Cassius Dio (in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch), Antony's wife Fulvia took Cicero's head, pulled out his tongue, and jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero's power of speech.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We <b>do</b> <b>try</b> to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show premiered in Toronto, at the O'Keefe Centre on October 1, 1960. It overran {{drastically}} – it {{was supposed}} to last two hours forty minutes, and instead clocked in at four and a half hours. [...] The curtain came down at twenty to one in the morning; Lerner later noted that [...] "Only Tristan and Isolde equaled it as a bladder endurance contest." [...] Noël Coward was supposed to have remarked that the show was [...] "longer than the 'Götterdämmerung'...and not nearly as funny!" [...] In spite of this, the morning papers gave generally positive reviews, but hinted that the show needed much work, i.e. drastic editing, in order to succeed. Soon afterwards, Lerner was hospitalised for three weeks with a bleeding ulcer. [...] Soon after he was discharged, Hart suffered his second heart attack, and Lerner stepped in as temporary director {{for the rest of the}} out-of-town run. Camelot then moved to Boston, edited, but still running well over the intended length. The production team tried to find another director, even phoning Jose Ferrer, who could not undertake the job. Lerner and Loewe disagreed on how to proceed with the show, as Loewe did not want to make any major changes without Hart's guidance. Lerner wrote: [...] "God knows what would have happened had it not been for Richard Burton." [...] Accepting cuts and changes, he radiated a [...] "faith and geniality" [...] and calmed the fears of the cast. Guenevere's song [...] "Before I Gaze at You Again" [...] was given to Andrews at the last minute before the first New York preview, which provoked her famous quote, [...] "Of course, darling, but <b>do</b> <b>try</b> to get it to me the night before." [...] After the show opened on Broadway, Hart was released from the hospital, and he and Lerner began cutting the play even further. Two songs, [...] "Then You May Take Me To the Fair" [...] and [...] "Fie on Goodness," [...] were cut a few months into the run (though they remain on the cast album, and the former featured in the 1967 film).|$|E
