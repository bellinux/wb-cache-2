2500|$|A {{database}} program HyperCard {{was released in}} 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, Windows Help, which was introduced with Microsoft Windows 3.0, had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single help file together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the <b>help</b> <b>page.</b> The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the Gopher protocol from 1991. [...] It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the Mosaic browser (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). [...] HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.|$|E
2500|$|Google {{publishes the}} source code for Android through its [...] "Android Open Source Project", {{allowing}} enthusiasts and developers to program and distribute their own modified {{versions of the}} operating system. However, not all these modified versions are compatible with apps developed for Google's official Android versions. The [...] "Android Compatibility Program" [...] serves to [...] "define a baseline implementation of Android that is compatible with third-party apps written by developers". Only Android devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements may install and access Google's Play Store application. As stated in a <b>help</b> <b>page</b> for the Android Open Source Project, [...] "Devices that are [...] "Android compatible" [...] may participate in the Android ecosystem, including Android Market; devices that don't meet the compatibility requirements exist outside that ecosystem. In other words, the Android Compatibility Program is how we separate [...] "Android compatible devices" [...] from devices that merely run derivatives of the source code. We welcome all uses of the Android source code, but only Android compatible devices—as defined and tested by the Android Compatibility Program—may participate in the Android ecosystem." ...|$|E
