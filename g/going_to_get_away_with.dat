5000|$|Over the years, both Thomas and Michael Skakel {{significantly}} {{changed their}} alibis {{for the night}} of Moxley's murder. Michael Skakel claimed {{that he had been}} window-peeping and masturbating in a tree beside the Moxley property from 11:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Two former students from Élan School, a treatment center for troubled youths, testified they heard Michael Skakel confess to killing Moxley with a golf club. Gregory Coleman testified that Skakel was given special privileges, saying Skakel bragged, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> murder. I'm a Kennedy." ...|$|E
5000|$|De Palma has, however, {{been quick}} to downplay {{the notion that the}} movie {{suffered}} because of studio interference: [...] "The initial producers, once we had cast Tom Hanks, moved on and went over to Columbia Pictures, so I was sort of left to my own devices and pursued ways in which I thought I could make this movie more commercial and keep some edge of the book...I thought we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it, but we didn't. I knew that the people who read the book were going to be extremely unhappy, and I said, 'Well, this is a movie; it isn't the book.' And I {{think if you look at}} the movie now, and you don't know anything about the book, and you get it out of the time that it was released, I think you can see it in a whole different way." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, Lina's {{own death}} will be Johnnie's first [...] "real" [...] murder. He goes {{to great lengths}} to {{conceive}} an undetectable murder. When Isobel Sedbusk, the author of detective stories, happens to spend the summer in their village, he associates with her and, on the pretext of discussing material for her new book, elicits a new method of murder from her: swallowing an alkali commonly used, but never suspected of being poisonous, and which leaves no trace in the human body for a post-mortem to find. At {{the very end of the}} novel, Lina, who really seems to have gone mad, catches the flu. She has been waiting for her husband to try to murder her for months now. When he brings her a drink, she swallows it deliberately, knowing that it is a poisonous cocktail. Johnny is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it ("People did die of influenza."), which is what Lina, so much in love with her husband, hopes will happen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from it mighty quick,--if we can," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Camdal, pointedly. The {{close quarters}} did not suit him {{any better than}} it suited Mr. Dawson and the boys.|$|R

5000|$|The lead scientist, Anthony Dresden, {{reveals that}} all of the {{scientists}} on the station had been selected for their sociopathic qualities, so that they could emotionlessly perform their research without empathy for the victims on Eros. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the Protomolecule, not only for its innate scientific value, but to protect against the clear threat presented by the aliens who created it. Realizing that Dresden's rationale is likely to be accepted by the powers that be on Earth and Mars, and his horrific research allowed to continue, Miller shoots Dresden without warning, angering Holden. [...] "He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it," [...] Miller explains later, [...] "He was talking us into it. All that about getting the stars and protecting ourselves from whatever shot that thing at Earth? I was starting to think maybe he should get away with it. Maybe things were just too big for right and wrong." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song's lyrics {{became a}} subject of {{controversy}} among music critics who felt that the song did not promote a positive body image as Trainor intended. Trainor was accused of anti-feminism and shaming thin women in the song. Kris Ex of Complex said that the track [...] "jacked both the stereotyped body priorities of black beauty and the codes of black slang". Naomi Schaefer Riley of the New York Post dubbed the song as [...] "faux empowerment" [...] and wrote, [...] "feminists {{want her to know}} she's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Kelsey McKinney of Vox felt that some verses in [...] "All About That Bass" [...] uplifted ideas of body positivity and self-worth while destroying those ideals in others by putting down other women. The Independent writer Yomi Adegoke said that the song's replacement of one ideal with another was a poor representation of body positivity, and felt that its enforcement that [...] "real men love curves" [...] was insulting.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the time}} {{leading up to}} his arrest, Le Roux is {{described}} as a megalomaniac whose appetite exceeded his caution on one hand, while on the other hand taking care of crucial details, such as fathering a child in Brazil in order to avoid extradition. DEA agents have stated that on the wiretaps, Le Roux gave the impression that “he felt like he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> forever.” ...|$|R
2500|$|... “We {{had a tough}} beginning. It was {{a shotgun}} marriage. We didn’t get along very well, and {{we were kind of}} thrown together. Although, I think the thing that changed {{everything}} was how quickly the ratings were off the charts. By spring, nine months into the show, we were No. 1 — and No. 1 in a big way — and we realized that no matter what we did, we weren’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from each other.” ...|$|R

[...] "It is true the snow has stopped coming down {{and the sun is}} {{breaking}} through the clouds; but I am quite sure the drifts on the road between here and Crumville are much higher than we can manage, even with the powerful horses we have.

6000|$|... "Oh, Chebron!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "you {{have arrived}} just in time. I {{thought we were}} never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from that dreadful man; and I don't know what I should have done if it hadn't been for Ruth. And, oh! they have been telling me such terrible things--but they can't be true--that our dear father had been killed; {{and that it was}} you, Chebron, who killed dear Paucis; but of course I did not believe them--I knew it was all their wickedness." ...|$|R
60|$|The Texas {{had done}} {{wonderful}} {{work on the}} Maria Teresa and the Oquendo, and now {{did her best to}} keep {{to the front of the}} chase. But the speed was too great for her, and gradually she dropped behind, although still continuing to throw shot and shell after the Vizcaya that had dropped some distance behind the Colon. It was now apparent to all that if any vessel was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> it was <b>to</b> be the Colon, for her speed was greater than the Vizcaya and as yet she had hardly been touched.|$|R

5000|$|Johnny Marr {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} {{that one of}} the main impetuses for his leaving The Smiths was Morrisey's insistence on covering the titular theme song to this movie. There is a famous quote published in a 1992 issue of [...] "Record Collector" [...] where Marr disdainfully said [...] "'Work Is A Four Letter Word' I hated. That was the last straw, really. I didn't form a group to perform Cilla Black songs. That was it, really. I made a decision that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> on holiday.

5000|$|Having truthfully {{revealed}} valuable things, Dolon {{expected to}} {{be taken as a}} prisoner to the ships, or to be tied up, while the other two found out whether he had told them the truth or not. But Diomedes told him: [...] "You have given us excellent news, but do not imagine you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> now that you have fallen into our hands. If we set you free tonight, there is nothing to prevent your coming down once more to the Achaean ships, either to play the spy or to meet us in open fight. But if I lay my hands on you and take your life, you will never be a nuisance to the Argives again." [...] Having said this, Diomedes cut off the prisoner's head with his sword, without giving him time to plead for his life.|$|R

"If {{you think}} you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from here until you've paid me for all you've eat, an' {{all the time}} I've spent on you, you're mistaken, that's all.

Now you just let me hear two words more {{out of your head}} about going away--only two more--an' I'll show you what a {{whipping}} is. I've only been playing with you before when you thought you were getting a whipping; but you'll find out what it means if I so much as see a thought in your eyes about goin' away.

5000|$|On 4 October 2014, it was {{reported}} that Matthews was in talks about returning to the show. It was then announced on 20 October 2014 that Jenny would be making a return to the show in February 2015. Matthews said: [...] "It was only in 2010—when the 50th celebrations started and I was asked to do this and that—that I thought, ‘I’m never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from it, people still recognise me from it, I’m dead proud I was in it, I should embrace it." [...] Speaking about Jenny and Rita being reunited, Matthews said: [...] "Jenny doesn't see Rita initially. She meets Kevin first and so I didn't share scenes with Barbara (Knox) for a while. However, the scenes I have done with her have just been like picking up from where we left off. There is a lot of unfinished business with them—Rita isn't very happy." ...|$|R

5000|$|It was one {{of those}} magic moments in your life when you expect a horror story, and the doors of heaven open up. I knew there and then he wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away.</b> George Russell upon hearing Bill Evans for the first time. Evans had met George Russell during his tenure with Lucy Reed. Russell's first {{impression}} of Evans was negative ("this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be like pulling teeth all day"), but when he secretly heard Evans play, he completely changed his mind. Russell was then developing his magnum opus, the treatise Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization, in which he exposed that the Lydian mode was more compatible with tonality than the major scale used in most music. This new concept was ground-breaking in jazz, and would soon influence musicians like Miles Davis. Evans, who had already been acquainted with these ideas before, began to work with him in 1956.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{announcement}} that the Kapoor family would become regular cast members, several racist posts were left on the Neighbours website {{and had to be}} removed by staff. Bower said most of the inappropriate comments, from viewers expressing their anger at a non-Anglo-Saxon family being introduced to the show, came from a [...] "small minority". She later commented that for every negative comment about the family there were ten to fifteen positive ones. Joab spoke out about the issue, saying [...] "There is various pockets that will say it is un-Australian to have an Indian or an Indian family on Ramsay St. Those Aussies who are saying it is un-Australian will be the same ones who pretty much supported the White Australia policy back in the day, you are never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from that kind of stuff."

5000|$|Morrissey's {{insistence on}} {{releasing}} this single incurred {{the wrath of}} Johnny Marr, due to his dislike of the B-side, and he left the band not long afterwards.
