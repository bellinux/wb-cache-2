40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Artefacta</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in {{an older}} woman with obsessive {{compulsive}} disorder. G. LUCCIOLA, E. PAPUZZO, E. TOLINO, F. NICOLUCCI, I. PROIETTI, B. GROSSI, D. INNOCENZI <b>Artefacta</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is a disease characterized by self-inflicted skin lesions and the full awareness and intention of the patient. Mechanical and chemical devices are {{the most commonly used}} to produce such injuries. Several psychological disorders like depression, obsessive compulsive disorders, hysteria, are associated with <b>artefacta</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and females are more often involved. The majority of the patients are young, with an age between 15 and 30, but it is possible to find such symptoms also in paediatric or older patients. Because of its rarity and because of the polymorphism of lesions, <b>artefacta</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is often a challenge for the clinicians and a differential diagnosis with other skin diseases must be done. Difficulties are also {{due to the lack of}} cooperation in these patients, who usually refuse the dialogue with doctors and deny their primary role in the production of the lesions. We present the case of {{an older woman}} who showed a peculiar pattern of extended deep excoriations in different parts of body and an evident state of depression. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedure, that is often long lasting and difficult in such case, was made in about 4 months by the cooperation of dermatologists with psychiatrists and psychologists, getting to a steady control of impulses and the full remission of cutaneous symptoms...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta</b> is {{a disease}} that {{occurs as a result}} of a self-inflicted injury of the skin. The skin lesions are most often located on the areas within easy reach of the patient’s {{dominant}} hand sparing the middle part of the back. <b>Dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta</b> may coexist with psychiatric disorders and imitate many dermatologic diseases. As most of the patients with self-inflicted dermatoses usually initially deny any psychiatric problems, what delays psychiatric intervention, they are typically first seen by dermatologists. We are reporting a case of a 35 -year-old man with a 3 -year-long history of schizophrenia who has been treated at a dermatologist’s office sequentially with acne, bacterial lesions, suspected tuberculosis. However, the treatment was ineffective. He was diagnosed with <b>dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta</b> after 7 years of disease duration. During this time he was treated with many medicines e. g. isotretinoin, which is contraindicated in psychosis as it worsens the course of disease. After establishing the correct diagnosis and antipsychotic treatment, a significant improvement was obtained in both skin condition and mental state. These are the reasons why we would like to recommend close cooperation between dermatologists and psychiatrists.

40|$|Primary {{psychiatric}} conditions {{encountered in}} dermatology include <b>dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta,</b> trichotillomania (TTM) and neurotic excoriations.

Herein, we review common primary psychiatric conditions in dermatology - <b>dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta,</b> neurotic excoriations and TTM - and examine their epidemiology, clinical presentation, differential {{diagnosis and treatment}} strategies. For all primary psychiatric disorders, the most effective underlying strategy is to first establish a strong therapeutic rapport with the patient.

After building a trusted physician-patient relationship and empathically confronting the mother,the mother herself was able to provide her daughter a narrow escape, which resulted in complete remission of her condition. <b>Dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta</b> is a spot diagnosis, however the treatment is challenging for both the physician and the patient. A trusting physician-patient relation is crucial and providing verbal and non-verbal support is essential. One way of doing this is asking the patient to keep a diary.

40|$|Abstract <b>Dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta</b> is a rarely {{diagnosed}} {{disorder that}} is often a source of perplexity and anxiety for dermatologists because they know less about {{the cause of this}} self-inflicted condition than the patients themselves. It differs from other skin disorders in that diagnosis is made by exclusion rather than on the basis of histologic and biochemical findings and therefore involves a considerable investment of time and resources. Based on the findings of a study of 201 patients diagnosed with <b>dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta</b> between 1976 and 2006, we review the different clinical presentations of this skin disorder and discuss its diagnosis and treatment. The series analyzed comprised 152 women and 49 men (female to male ratio of 3. 1 : 1) {{with a mean age of}} 31. 2 years.

40|$|The self-inflicted dermatoses, namely <b>dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta,</b> {{neurotic}} excoriations, and trichotillomania, {{have been}} reported to be associated with various degrees of psychopathology in the dermatologic literature, but have received surprisingly little emphasis in the psychiatric literature. This probably reflects, firstly {{the fact that most of}} these patients initially deny any psychologic problems and hence may not receive psychiatric interventions, and secondly a lack of adequate collaboration between the psychiatrist and dermatologist. These disorders may be associated with serious sequelae, such as suicide and repeated major surgical procedures. Their treatment is also primarily psychiatric.

40|$|<b>Dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta</b> (DA) is an {{intentional}} self-inflicted dermatitis produced by patients for unconscious psychological gain. Characteristically, patients deny {{the responsibility for}} their creation. It is a poorly understood condition and, in most cases, goes {{on for a long}} period of time before a diagnosis is made. This condition creates a lot of anxiety for physicians due to a lack of awareness of the disorder and involves a considerable amount of time and resources to deal with. Suspicion usually arises when there is an unconvincing history of the evolution and recurrence of these lesions, their locations on the body, and their bizarre shapes. Here we report a typical case of DA in a 33 -year-old male who repeatedly presented with oddly shaped recurrent skin lesions in the left lower leg for nine years. He had numerous doctors’ visits and tests, and was admitted to a number of different hospitals without reaching a diagnosis or a cure...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Primary {{psychiatric}} disorders where skin changes appear most frequently include: delusions of parasitosis, body dysmorphic disorder, neurotic excoriations, <b>dermatitis</b> <b>artefacta,</b> and trichotillomania. In all these diseases the primary pathologic condition is of psychiatric nature, {{and the skin}} changes are secondary and self-induced. In this review we wanted to present the epidemiology, clinical pictures, and treatment options for these disorders. These patients are more frequently seen in dermatology clinics, {{as they may be}} unwilling to acknowledge a psychiatric basis for their psychical symptoms. If we want the treatment to be effective and timely, {{it is important for the}} dermatologist to understand the underlying psychopathology of these conditions. Treatment should be gradual. An initially supportive, nonconfrontational, empathic approach to the patient is indicated. Immediate confrontation regarding the suspicion that the patient’s lesions are self-induced can be counterproductive in that the patient will often refuse treatment. Frequent visits and symptomatic topical treatments are useful in the beginning. The goal is to establish a trusting and supportive enough relationship with the patient so that he or she will accept a psychiatric referral to explore the complex personality and behavioral issues that often underlie these conditions.   KEY WORDS: delusions of parasitosis; body dysmorphic disorder; neurotic excoriations; dermatitis artefacta; trichotillomania</p...|$|E
