50|$|Lindholm Strait (Russian: Proliv Lindgol'ma) is a strait in {{the northwestern}} Sea of Okhotsk. It {{separates}} Malyy Shantar and Belichiy Islands to the north from the Tugur Peninsula to the south. At its narrowest it is only 3.2 km (2 mi) wide. Tides are semidiurnal. Springs rise 4.9 m (16 ft), while neaps rise 3.6 m (11.8 ft). The <b>flood</b> <b>current</b> sets west, while the stronger ebb current flows in the opposite direction.

40|$|<b>Flood</b> <b>currents</b> {{in shallow}} {{estuaries}} {{are driven by}} an along-channel barotropic and baroclinic pressure gradient that increases monotonically toward the bottom, while friction retards near-bottom currents. Therefore, in many estuaries there is a middepth maximum in <b>flood</b> <b>currents.</b> We explore this phenomenon using a simple three-layer model in which each layer has vertically uniform currents and constant density. In this model the middle layer is of intermediate density and grows by shear-induced entrainment from the other two layers. This very simple model produces a middepth maximum in <b>flood</b> <b>currents</b> and simulates observed currents in the Columbia River entrance channel within about 10 %. There is good qualitative agreement between model salinity transport and observed transport.

40|$|<b>Flood</b> <b>currents</b> (tidal pumping) {{have led}} to the {{increase}} of transportation of sediments to the river’s upper estuary. In the tidal section of the Elbe River, more sediment is transported to the upper estuary with <b>flood</b> <b>currents</b> (tidal pumping) related to tidal asymmetry. This process contributes, amongst others, to dredging in order to obtain the water depth required for navigation safety. Cognizant of the above problems, construction of shallow water area is planned in order to reduce tidal asymmetry while improving ecological integrity at the tidal Elbe areas. The study on which this paper is based was conducted to assess ecological integrity and ecosystem services before and after the shallow water creation. Habitat identification and quality ranking were conducted for current habitat, while model habitats representing future state (after shallow water creation) were designed using HEC-RAS model simulation. The assessment matrix was used to assess ecological integrity and ecosystem services provisioning of the study area’s habitats before and after the shallow water creation, using potential indicators.

50|$|When it got {{dark and}} the <b>flood</b> <b>current</b> came out again, Kae {{suggested}} Longopoa that they should {{find a way to}} escape from the island, every man for himself. He plunged in the sea and swam away. At midnight he landed on a sandy island; (other sources say many days later). He saw eight dead whales on the shore and hundreds of neiufi fish, or (according to other sources) fewer whales and 2 huge man eating sharks, luckily also dead. It was the lair of the kanivatu, a giant bird (like the roc), which was known to be a man eater too. Kae wisely hid for the night between two of the whales. The bird returned to its nest in the morning. While it was preening its feathers, Kae emerged and clung to one of its legs (or the feathers of its breast according to some, or of its wing according to some). At midday the bird flew away over the ocean, with his passenger, and when Kae saw they were over land, he let go. The place where he landed was on the coral sand beach of Akana (Aana in Sāmoan), the western part of Upolu. He was friendlily received by the high chief of the area, Sinilau, who gave him status, more than he ever had gotten in Tonga, but not enough to enter the kava circle. So Kae stayed in Sāmoa for some time. But then he was seized by a longing for Tonga to tell about all the wonderful things he had seen, and he announced to Sinilau that he wanted to go. Sinilau agreed and presented him with a farewell gift. He would be allowed to ride on the back of Sinilau's twin whales.|$|E

40|$|The net {{transport}} of sediment between the back-barrier basin {{and the sea}} is an important process for determining the stability of tidal inlet systems. Earlier studies showed that in a short basin, tidal flats favor peak ebb-currents stronger than peak <b>flood</b> <b>currents,</b> implying export of coarse sediment, while shallow basins favor stronger <b>flood</b> <b>currents.</b> The new elements considered {{in this study are}} (1) arbitrary basin lengths, (2) a narrow inlet that connects the basin to the sea, (3) an asymmetric tidal forcing, and (4) radiation damping. The objective is to gain fundamental insight in how the geometry of a tidal inlet system affects the net sand transport in a tidal inlet. For this purpose, a width-averaged and depth-averaged analytical model was constructed. It is found that the length of a back-barrier basin controls the effect that nonlinear hydrodynamic processes have on the tidal asymmetry, and consequently controls whether the currents in the inlet are flood-dominant or ebb-dominant. Furthermore, the cross-sectional area of the inlet controls the ratio between the net sediment transports that results from tidal asymmetry and that caused by the interaction of the principal tide with the residual current. Finally, it is shown that the effect of an asymmetric tidal forcing on the net sand transport depends on the length of the back-barrier basin with respect to the tidal wavelength in that basin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The development, {{characteristics}} and {{causes of the}} tidal bore in the North Branch of the Changjiang Estuary are expounded, based on in-situ survey, measured and relative historical data. When the velocity of <b>flood</b> <b>current</b> exceeds the tidal wave celerity (the supercritial flow occurs), the water level abruptly jumps and a tidal bore is formed. The Froude number {{can be used to}} determine whether a tidal bore will form or not. A analysis indicates that narrowing channel increases <b>flood</b> <b>current</b> velocity and sloping riverbed slows down wave celerity. The North Branch channel has been narrowed and its bed has been silted because of natural processes and artificial reclamation in recent years, which are the main causes of frequent and strong bore occurrence. Furthermore the observed data in April 2001 when the tidal bore occurred at the Qinglong Harbor indicated that a tidal bore was produced when the Froude number rF> 1. The converging funnel shape and submerged sand bars are necessary conditions for the formation of a bore. The Froude number begins greater than 1 at Lingdianxi (50 km upstream from the mouth) for either maximum or minimum bores, which indicates Lingdianxi is the initial site of North Branch bores...|$|E

40|$|The hydrodynamics, {{morphology}} and sedimentology of the Taperacu estuary were investigated. This is one {{of several}} estuaries located within the largest mangrove fringe in the world, bordering the Amazon region, subject to a macrotidal regime and regionally atypical negligible fresh water supply. The results reveal widespread sand banks that occupy the central portion of the estuarine cross-section. Well-sorted very fine sandy sediments of marine origin prevail. Shorter flood phases, with substantially higher current velocities, were observed in the upper sector of Taperacu, as expected for a shallow, friction-dominated estuary. However, ebb domination can be expected for estuaries with large associated mangrove areas and substantial estuarine infilling, both of which situations occur on the Taperacu. The tidal asymmetry favoring <b>flood</b> <b>currents</b> could be the result of the absence of an effective fluvial discharge. Furthermore, it was observed that the Taperacu is connected by tidal creeks to the neighboring Caete estuary, allowing a stronger flux during the flood and intensifying the higher <b>flood</b> <b>currents.</b> As a whole, the results have shown a complex interaction of morphological aspects (friction, fluvial drainage, connections with neighbor estuaries, infilling and large storage area) in determining hydrodynamic patterns, thus improving the understanding of Amazon estuaries.

The temporal and lateral current variations correspond to the usual intertidal pattern, except the strongest first <b>flood</b> <b>current</b> when water is pushed with high pressure under the ice still resting on the ground. Velocity profiles show currents decreasing downward near the bed, but also upward near the water-ice interface, which reduces the total flow and pushes the velocity maximum toward the bed.

40|$|The {{shoaling}} rate in Blind Pass {{entrance channel}} approximately equals the net southward longshore sediment transport rate.

In contrast, the <b>flood</b> <b>current</b> is mainly uniform across the inlet and is stronger than the ebb flow over the northern portion. This flow-velocity distribution induced by a nearly 90 -deg bend of the channel contributes to the shoaling pattern. Two years after the 2000 dredging, the shoal along the north side became shallow enough to induce wave breaking. Distinctive shoaling patterns influenced by seasonal wave climate were observed. Sediment deposition in the channel is closely related to the passages of cold fronts, which significantly increases the sediment supply by longshore transport...|$|E

A measurable interaction over 24 hours is the density difference between these water sources, where less-dense riverine water is warmer and has lower salinity. Ebb currents enhance the advection of riverine output, placing {{it on top of}} the oceanic water and creating stratification. Primary production increased during stratification periods, but reduced when transitioning between a flood and ebb current. Visual analysis of phytoplankton community composition also highlighted increases in the population during high ebb and <b>flood</b> <b>current</b> rates. The large increase in Skeletonema population during this study suggested that the movement or growth of certain phytoplankton genera are affected by these water source interactions.

40|$|Sorted bedforms are {{ubiquitous}} on {{the inner}} continental shelves worldwide. They are described as spatially-grain-size-sorted features consisting of small rippled medium-to-coarse sand and can remain stable for decades. However, the knowledge about their genesis and development is still fragmentary. For this study, a representative investigation area (water depth < 15 m) located on the shelf west of the island of Sylt (SE North Sea, Germany) was periodically surveyed with hydroacoustic means (i. e. sidescan sonar, multibeam echo sounder, and sub-bottom profiler) during 2010 - 2014. Since this area is influenced by tidal and wind-driven currents, {{the aim was to}} detect and examine interannual variabilities in the characteristics of the prevailing sorted bedforms. Our measurements reveal sinuous stripes of rippled medium sand which are embedded in shallow symmetrical depressions. These domains are surrounded by relatively smooth fine-sand areas. These sorted bedforms were identified as flow-transverse features that are maintained by ebb and <b>flood</b> <b>currents</b> of almost equal strengths that flow in opposite directions. This bidirectional flow field generates sharp boundaries between the medium- and fine-sand domains in both current directions. Further to the north, where <b>flood</b> <b>currents</b> are dominant, asymmetric sorted bedforms were detected which show sharp boundaries only in flood-current direction. Comparisons between the measurements of the different years show no significant variations in morphology and distribution of the sorted bedforms. However, variations of the boundaries between the medium and the fine-sand domains were observed. Additionally, new minor sorted bedforms and rippled excavation marks as well as new fine-sand areas developed and disappeared occasionally. It can be supposed that such sediment winnowing and focusing processes take place during periodically recurring storm surges, which change the shapes of the features. Moreover, variations in alignments and sizes of the small ripple formations were detected. They seem to indicate the directions and intensities of previous storm events...|$|R
