In addition, psychological flexibility was explored as a possible facet of this relation. As predicted, results revealed that there was a significant positive correlation between mental health stigma and psychological distress. Furthermore, the results suggested that psychological flexibility may be a shared feature of mental health stigma and psychological distress.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Is {{recollection}} of highly improbable traumatic ex-periences accompanied by psychophysiological responses indic-ative of intense emotion? To investigate this issue, we measured heart rate, skin conductance, and left lateral frontalis electro-myographic responses in <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> been abducted by space aliens. Recordings of these participants were made during script-driven imagery of their reported alien en-counters and of other stressful, positive, and neutral experi-ences they reported. We also measured the psychophysiological responses of control participants while {{they heard the}} scripts of the abductees. We predicted that if ‘‘memories’ ’ of alien ab-duction function like highly stressful memories, then psycho-physiological reactivity to the abduction and stressful scripts would be greater than reactivity to the positive and neutral scripts, and this effect would be more pronounced among ab-ductees than among control participants. Contrast analyses confirmed this prediction for all three physiological measures (ps <. 05). Therefore, belief that one has been traumatized may generate emotional responses similar to those provoked by rec-ollection of trauma (e. g., combat). Few controversies in psychology have been as contentious as the one concerning recovered memories of trauma (McNally, 2003 b). Espe-cially contentious has been the claim that some people may recover ‘‘false memories’ ’ of traumatic events that never occurred (e. g., Ceci &...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Internet is a {{major source}} of {{information}} for professionals and the general public, especially in the field of health. However, despite ever-increasing connection rates, a digital divide persists in the industrialised countries. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the determinants involved in: 1) having or not having Internet access; and 2) using or not using the Internet to obtain health information. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of a representative random sample was conducted in the Paris metropolitan area, France, in the fall of 2005 (n = 3023). Results: Close to 70 % of the adult population had Internet access, and 49 % of Internet users had previously searched for medical information. Economic and social disparities observed in online health information seeking are reinforced by the economic and social disparities in Internet access, hence a double divide. While <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> a recent health problem were less likely to have Internet access (odds ratio (OR) : 0. 72, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 53 – 0. 98), it is they who, when they have Internet access, are the most likely to search for health information (OR = 1. 44, 95 % CI = 1. 11 – 1. 87) ...|$|E
40|$|We use cross-national {{harmonized}} micro {{data from}} a broad sample of developed and developing countries and investigate the heterogeneity {{of the effect of}} entry, contract enforcement regulation, and financial development on both the decision to become an entrepreneur and the level of employment of newly created businesses. We focus on the interaction between the level of regulation and financial development and some individual characteristics that are important determinants of entrepreneurship, such as gender, business skills, and social networks. We find that entry regulation moderates the effect of business skills, while accentuating the effect of gender, even after accounting for the level of financial development. Specifically, {{women are more likely to}} enter into entrepreneurship in countries with higher levels of entry regulation, but mainly because they cannot find better work. This effect is also more pronounced in countries that are less financially developed. Furthermore, <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>report</b> <b>having</b> business skills are less likely to enter entrepreneurship in countries with higher entry regulation. Finally, we also find that <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> know other entrepreneurs are less likely to start large businesses in countries with higher levels of entry and contract enforcement regulation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the potential relationship between life history theory and the sexual double standard. Life history theory posits that one’s upbringing (e. g., whether one’s parents are divorced or not; quality of relationship with one’s father) may have physiological and psychological implications on one’s future mating strategies, especially for women. The sexual double standard is the notion that men and women are judged differently depending on their sexual activities. For the present study, we hypothesized that participants who came from single parent households or who have had worse relationship with their parents would differentially exhibit the sexual double standard compared to participants from two parent households or who have had better relationship with their parents. Participants completed questionnaires regarding their relationships with their parents and then evaluated a target <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> either 1 or 12 sexual partners. Results showed that female participants who come from divorced households evaluated highly sexually active men as less successful than less sexually active men.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of exposure to}} traumatic events {{for the development of}} dental anxiety has not been investigated.

Patients of a specialized dental fear clinic (n = 90) were divided into those who reported a traumatic event that initiated their dental trait anxiety and those who did not. The two groups did not differ in their severity of dental anxiety and number of PTSD symptoms, but the memories of those who had been exposed to traumatic events were significantly more vivid than the memories of those in the reference group. Length of time since the event took place did not play a role. Hence, traumatic events are remembered more vividly, but do not seem to initiate more severe forms of dental anxiety than other events...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two studies designed to further validate the construct of modern homonegativity {{as measured by the}} Modern Homonegativity Scale (MHS). Similar to the concepts of modern racism and modern sexism, modern homonegativity rests upon three core assumptions: (1) gay men and lesbian women are making illegitimate (or unnecessary) demands for changes in the status quo; (2) discrimination against homosexual men and women is a thing of the past; and (3) gay men and lesbian women exaggerate the importance of their sexual preference and, in so doing, prevent themselves from assimilating into mainstream culture. The MHS was created to measure contemporary negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women (i. e., attitudes that are not based on traditional or moral objections to homosexuality). The scale contains two parallel forms: one for gay men (MHS-G) and one for lesbian women (MHS-L). Using Canadian participants (N = 374), results of Study 1 indicate that the parallel versions of the MHS are reliable, unidimensional, factorially, and conceptually distinct from a measure of old-fashioned homonegativity as measured by the Attitudes Toward Lesbian and Gay Men Scale and a relatively new measure of homonegativity entitled Modern Homophobia. As well, modern homonegativity correlated in the hypothesized direction with the motivation to control prejudiced reactions. Finally, results of one-way ANOVAs indicated that <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> gay men and lesbian women as acquaintances and close friends evidenced significantly lower levels of modern homonegativity than did individuals who reported no contact experience. Study 2 was designed to examine the psychometric properties of the MHS from a cross-cultural vantage. Specifically, the psychometric properties of the MHS were investigated using a sample of American participants (N = 608). Results of this study confirmed the unidimensionality of the MHS-G, and its conceptual distinctiveness from other measures of homonegativity (the ATLG and "Modern" Homophobia scales). Also, modern homonegativity correlated in the hypothesized direction with political conservatism, religious self-schema, neosexism, and concern about acting prejudiced. Similar to Study 1, results of one-way ANOVAs confirmed that <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> both gay men and lesbian women as acquaintances and close friends evidenced lower levels of modern homonegativity when compared with individuals who reported not having gay or lesbian acquaintances or close friends. Finally, the metric invariance of the MHS-G and MHS-L factor loadings were tested. With the exception of four items on the MHS-G, the metric invariance of the parallel versions of the MHS was confirmed. In summary, the studies outlined in this thesis strengthen the argument that a new form of homonegativity exists. Further, the MHS possesses superior psychometric properties and will prove useful when used to measure negative attitudes toward homosexual men and women in college and university settings. As an adjunct to the implications of the research, future directions are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} the association between negative life events {{in the past year}} and cognitive performance in a population of older adults. Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted on 428 participants from the Charlotte County Healthy Aging Study. Participants completed tests of episodic memory, attention, and psychomotor speed and endorsed the presence and severity of 24 life events. Life events were examined in the aggregate as well as individually. Results: Hierarchical multiple regression results suggest no sig-nificant relationship between the aggregate frequency and severity measures of negative life events and cognitive performance. At the individual-event level, individuals who experienced the injury or illness of a friend during the past year and rated it as having more of an effect on their lives performed better on all three cognitive tasks. However, <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> less money to live on over the past year and rated the event as having more of an effect on their lives performed more poorly on the psychomotor speed tasks. Discussion: The findings support previous research indicating that using estimates of individual stressors rather than aggregate stress measures increases the predictive validity of stress measurement. Furthermore, the individual negative life events can have both a positive and a negative effect, which nullify one another when using the sum score of events...|$|E
40|$|Individuals' direct {{exposure}} to {{and experience of}} climate change are arguably integral aspects of their risk perceptions, understandings, and engagement with the issue. Recent research investigating these experiences has thrown into sharp relief some fundamental considerations with respect to public risk perceptions and responses, in particular {{the extent to which}} such perceived encounters might reflect a priori beliefs and motivated reasoning. Findings to date are intriguing and compelling, both in regard to the escalating percentages of <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>report</b> <b>having</b> such personal encounters, and conclusions being drawn with respect to the nature, significance, and influence of such direct experience. These findings have also led to some intuitively reasonable but possibly problematic recommendations regarding policy and issue and behavioural engagement implications. A focus on underlying processes of experience and belief, oversimplified in terms of 'seeing' or 'believing', has however deflected attention from other issues such as the nature and contexts of individual climate change encounters, the clarity of the constructs and validity of the measures being used for 'belief' and 'experience', and the transactional and phenomenological nature of climate change encounters. There is nonetheless current and convergent evidence that perceived direct experience of environmental changes or events deemed to be manifestations of climate change influences psychological responses such as risk perception, acceptance, belief certainty, distress, and psychological and behavioural adaptation. These findings suggest that such experiences, for many, foster a contextualized and more personally meaningful realisation of what climate change portends, implies, and ultimately means, locally and globally.

40|$|Individuals with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) seem to judge harm caused actively and passively as morally equivalent. In contrast, others choose harm by omission over harm by commission, a propensity known as omission bias. Two studies, {{one with a}} student population and one comparing <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>report</b> <b>having</b> OCD and those without OCD, examined the hypothesis that OCD is associated with less omission bias. In both, OCD was associated with less omission bias about scenarios targeting common OCD fears, {{and the relationship between}} OCD and omission bias for those scenarios was mediated by thought-action fusion (TAF) and inflated responsibility. In neither study was general omission bias related to OCD. These results support the idea that individuals with elevated OCD symptoms distinguish less than others between acts of omission and commission for harm relevant to typical OCD concerns. ^ Two additional studies evaluated the relationship between moral TAF and OCD as a function of religion. In the first, Christians scored higher than Jews on moral TAF, a large effect not explainable by differences in religiosity. Jewish groups (Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform) did not differ from each other. Furthermore, religiosity was associated with TAF only within the Christian group, suggesting that Christian religious adherence is related to beliefs about the moral import of thoughts. In the second study, (a) Christians endorsed higher levels of moral TAF than did Jews independent of OCD symptoms; (b) religiosity was correlated with moral TAF in Christians but not in Jews; and (c) moral TAF was related to OCD symptoms only in Jews. That is, for Christians, moral TAF was related to religiosity but not OCD symptoms, and for Jews, moral TAF was related to OCD symptoms but not religiosity. These results imply that moral TAF is only a marker of pathology when such beliefs are not culturally normative. More generally, these results qualify the presumed associations between religiosity, obsessive cognitions, and OCD symptoms, which depend on religious affiliation. Furthermore, group differences in a supposed maladaptive construct without corresponding differences in prevalence rates call into question the assumption that the construct always marks pathology. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} a great deal of {{research}} linking social support with favourable psychological well-being outcomes a number of contradictory findings have been published showing support to be associated with increased psychological distress. These contrary findings arise when social support is measured as the receipt of supportive behavior rather than perceptions of support availability and quality. This paper examines three hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why the receipt of support is associated with distress. The first of these hypotheses (the support mobilisation hypothesis) argues that the relationship is a spurious one, and that it is a product of distressing circumstances which increase both support receipt and psychological distress. The other two hypotheses (the inequity hypothesis and the esteem threat hypothesis) both argue that receiving support actually causes distress. We tested these hypotheses in two samples. One sample was a group of <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> some form of disability (N = 106). the other sample was a 'healthy' comparison group (N = 134). Our analyses showed that in both groups the receipt of support was significantly and positively related to reports of anxiety, but not to reports of depression. Among the 'healthy' sample, controlling for subjects' sex largely explained the positive association between support receipt and anxiety. This was not the case among the 'disabled sample, where the inequity hypothesis received the strongest support. The implications of these findings for interventions based around the provision of social support are examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{biomedical}} and behavioral risk factors in relation to self-assessed physical, mental and general health status in an open adult Croatian population sample. Subjective experience of health status was assessed with the Short Form 36 Health Survey questionnaire (SF- 36). Out of 9070 respondents, we defined two groups with respect to cardiovascular (CV) risk factors: (1) a healthy group of individuals who did not state the presence of any covered chronic disease or disorder (N = 1, 817), and (2) a group with CV risk which included <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol or high blood sugar diagnosed (N = 360). When adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, these two groups differed in self-assessed health status. The group with CV risk factors showed an average lower level of subjective health status than the healthy group. At the level of specific health dimensions, the group with CV risks reported significantly lower general and mental health, but they reported healthier behaviors at the present time. We analyzed the measured health behaviors in predicting individual differences in the physical, mental and general health of the healthy group. Physical activity was revealed as a significant predictor of all three aspects of subjective health. Socio-economic variables of age, gender and self-assessed economic status contributed significantly to the explanation of all three aspects of subjective health. Our findings emphasize that psychological, physical, and social factors are inextricably linked in maintaining cardiovascular health, thus showing the importance of targeting health-related behaviors, especially physical activity, in preventive strategies and programs...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between {{coronary artery bypass}} graft (CABG) surgery and cognitive decline remains uncertain, in particular with regard to whether there is delayed cognitive decline associated with this procedure. Methods: This was a population-based cohort study involving participants in the Cache County Study of Memory Health and Aging. At baseline the study enrolled 5, 092 persons age 65 and older and followed them up three years later and again four years after that. <b>Individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> undergone CABG surgery at study baseline or had this surgery in between follow-up waves were compared to individuals who never reported having the surgery. The main outcome measure was the Modified Mini Mental State (3 MS). Multilevel models were used to examine the {{relationship between}} CABG surgery and cognitive decline over time. Results: Study participants who had CABG surgery evidenced 0. 95 points of greater decline relative to baseline on the 3 MS at the first follow-up interview after CABG, and an average of 1. 9 points of greater decline at the second follow-up interview, than those without CABG (t = - 2. 51, df = 2, 316, p = 0. 0121), after adjusting for several covariates, including number of vascular conditions. This decline was restricted to individuals who were more than five years past the procedure and was not evident in the early years after the surgery. Conclusions: CABG surgery is associated with accelerated cognitive decline more than five years after the procedure in a long-lived population. This decline is small and its clinical significance is uncertain. We could not find an association between CABG and decline in the first five post-operative years...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: 	In this article, {{we suggest}} that the term “dental phobia,” as {{commonly}} applied {{to the experience of}} dental fear and anxiety, is typically a misnomer. The problem with using the term “phobia” in a dental-care context is as follows: by definition, phobias involve a fear that is “excessive or unreasonable,” which the individual recognizes as such, and in which the anxiety, panic attacks and phobic avoidance are not better accounted for by another disorder, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In our experience, most individuals who experience dental anxiety or fear do not view their symptoms as “excessive or unreasonable” and in that sense, resemble individuals with PTSD. Further, our review of the dental-care literature suggests that true (innate) dental phobias (akin to unreasonable fear at the sight of blood or a syringe) probably account for a smaller percentage of cases, and that a larger subset of dental-care anxiety (DA) cases stem from dental experiences that are, at a minimum, aversive and/or painful, and at times highly traumatizing. Research has documented that <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> experienced painful dental treatments and perceived a lack of control in the dental situation were approximately 14 times more likely to also report higher dental fear, and approximately 16 times more likely to report being less willing to return to the dental treatment. Based on the current available research, we propose that this psychological condition should be conceptualized as Posttraumatic Dental-care Anxiety (PTDA), and should be classified as part of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) spectrum in the forthcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{labour market}} {{is widely regarded}} as having become more "flexible". It is proposed that such flexibility is a characteristic of employment histories which will have effects on psychosocial status, health-related behaviour, and physical health. Recent increases in flexibility are unlikely to have accumulated over sufficient portions of individual employment histories for any effect on health to be apparent, but a "preview" of these effects may be gained from study of older cohorts. This cross-sectional study is based on data collected in the early 1970 s from 5399 men and 945 women in paid work, recruited from 27 workplaces in the west of Scotland. A flexible employment history was defined as one encompassing a large number of changes between jobs. Perceived psychological stress, health behaviour (cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical exercise), physiology (diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, forced expiratory volume, plasma cholesterol concentration) and current health (angina, myocardial ischaemia) were assessed. Those <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> experienced frequent job change were more likely to smoke, consume greater amounts of alcohol, and perhaps to exercise less. Similar findings were observed in both males and females, and for different age and socio-economic groups. We found no suggestion that this association was due to higher levels of psychosocial stress, and the expected consequences for health were not observed. Interpretation of these findings is not straightforward due to an uncertain direction of causation, and a possible selection bias. However, the observed relationship between frequent job changing and a higher incidence of health risk behaviours, {{in the absence of a}} relationship with poorer health, invites further research.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify the contributors to optimal sexual experiences. At present, {{there is a lack of}} clinical knowledge, research knowledge and in-depth public discourse concerning the nature of healthy sexuality. The theoretical and research literature in this area has focused almost exclusively on defining and conceptualizing sexual dysfunctions with little attention paid to either normal or satisfactory experiences. Very little theory exists on the nature and components of optimal sexuality. To date, no empirical investigations have been done to determine the contributors to optimal sexual experiences. In order to identify the contributors to optimal sexual experiences, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> experienced “great sex”. A phenomenologically-oriented content analysis was performed on interview transcripts to determine the contributors to optimal sexual experiences. Analysis led to the identification of seven major contributors, two pathways towards optimal sexual experiences and two minor contributors. The major contributors included developmental contributors, individual qualities overall, individual qualities in-the moment, skills, relationship qualities overall, relationship qualities in-the-moment and environmental, situational and preparatory contributors. Each of these larger themes was also characterized by a variety of more specific themes. The two pathways that led to optimal sexual experiences included individual qualities that facilitated relationship qualities and relationship qualities that facilitated individual qualities. Finally, the minor contributors consisted of personal proclivities and miscellaneous contributors. Noteworthy findings of this investigation are discussed and then compared and contrasted with existing research and theory. The implications of this work for the general public, sex therapy, sex education, theory and research are considered as well as the strengths and limitations of this study...|$|E

Introduction. The systemic inflammatory response (SIR) {{plays a key role}} in determining nutritional status and survival of patients with cancer. A number of objective scoring systems have been shown to have prognostic value; however, their application in routine clinical practice is not clear. The aim of the present survey was to examine the range of opinions internationally on the routine use of these scoring systems. Methods. An online survey was distributed to a target group consisting of <b>individuals</b> worldwide <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> an interest in systemic inflammation in patients with cancer.

40|$|Black gay, bisexual, {{and other}} {{men who have}} sex with men (BMSM) {{experience}} a disparate rate of HIV infections among MSM. Previous analyses have determined that STI coinfection and undiagnosed HIV infection partly explain the disparity. However, few studies have analyzed the impact of partner-level variables on HIV incidence among BMSM. Data were analyzed for BMSM who attended the Los Angeles LGBT Center from August 2011 to July 2015 (n =  1974) to identify risk factors for HIV infection. A multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze predictors for HIV prevalence among all individuals at first test (n =  1974; entire sample). A multivariable survival analysis was used to analyze predictors for HIV incidence (n =  936; repeat tester subset). Condomless receptive anal intercourse at last sex, number of sexual partners in the last 30  days, and intimate partner violence (IPV) were significant partner-level predictors of HIV prevalence and incidence. <b>Individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> IPV <b>had</b> 2. 39 times higher odds (CI 1. 35 - 4. 23) and 3. 33 times higher hazard (CI 1. 47 - 7. 55) of seroconverting in the prevalence and incidence models, respectively. Reporting Black partners only was associated with increased HIV prevalence, but a statistically significant association was not found with incidence. IPV is an important correlate of both HIV prevalence and incidence in BMSM. Further studies should explore how IPV affects HIV risk trajectories among BMSM. Given that individuals with IPV history may struggle to negotiate safer sex, IPV also warrants consideration as a qualifying criterion among BMSM for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) ...|$|R
40|$|According to {{national}} statistics, African American {{men have a}} 60 % higher incidence rate, are diagnosed at later stages, and have twice the mortality rate of Caucasian men. The prostate cancer disparity is especially salient in North Carolina where African American men have a mortality rate that is almost 3 times that of Caucasian men. Although the American Cancer Society does not endorse routine prostate cancer screening, it remains a priority to focus on prostate cancer screening education in African American men {{in the effort to}} evaluate psychological harms in providing prostate cancer educational information and to increase appropriate screening for early detection of prostate cancer in this high risk group. An underlying theme of research on barriers to screening is stress, however stress related to receiving information about prostate cancer screening information and has never been studied from a psycho-physiological standpoint.   	The current study assessed relationships between cortisol response, masculinity beliefs, prostate cancer screening knowledge and intent, health care utilization, subjective distress and demographic characteristics among African American men in the pre-screening age range (aged 25 - 40 years). The primary research questions were 1) Do African American men exposed to information about prostate cancer screening evidence a measurable cortisol response following this exposure?, and 2) Are masculinity beliefs and/or prostate cancer screening knowledge related to cortisol response following exposure to prostate cancer screening information?   The participant's mean cortisol levels after exposure to prostate cancer screening information (M =. 157. SD = 08) were significantly less than baseline cortisol levels (M =. 207, SD =. 16), t(53) = - 3. 65, p =. 001. Primary analyses revealed no significant associations between cortisol response and masculinity beliefs.    Results of secondary analyses revealed that participant's self-reported level of prostate cancer screening knowledge after exposure to educational information (M = 64. 83, SD = 25. 5) was significantly greater than (M = 22. 08, SD = 24. 00), t(35) = 9. 36, p = <. 001. Interestingly, participants <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> not <b>having</b> a primary care physician had significantly greater prostate cancer screening knowledge change scores (M = 52. 65, SD = 25. 25) than those <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>having</b> a primary care physician (M = 30. 41, SD = 24. 54), t(34) = 2. 61, p =. 013. However, self- report of prostate cancer screening knowledge was not significantly different between the two groups after exposure to prostate cancer educational information. In addition, a higher level of power dominance was positively associated with self-reported distress related to the DRE r(n = 36) =. 38, p =. 03, 95 % CI [. 06,. 63].    In conclusion, providing prostate cancer screening information to African American men of prescreening age {{does not appear to be}} a stressor as measured by salivary cortisol. However, identifying psycho-physiological barriers to behavior may lead to more innovative ways to improve positive behavioral outcomes in relationship to prostate cancer screening. Specifically, increasing exposure to prostate cancer screening information in these men may increase confidence to have discussions with their doctors, which is especially important in the light of the current stance of the USPSTF and conflicting recommendations from other organizations.   M.
