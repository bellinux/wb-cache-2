500|$|The lens {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] It has a bulb-like aspherical lens, similar to notable wide-angle and fisheye lenses {{such as the}} Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 14-24mm f/2.8G ED, Nikon AF DX Fisheye-Nikkor 10.5mm f/2.8G ED, or Tokina AT-X 107 DX AF 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 fisheye lens. Because of the shape of <b>front</b> <b>element,</b> it is not compatible with many filters, including UV filters, but the frontal exposure is rectified by a petal-shaped lens hood element. Because the lens has a permanent lens hood affixed, {{it comes with a}} friction-fit aluminum element, variously described as a sleeve, ring or shroud, that surrounds the hood to enable the placement of a front cap on the lens. PC Magazine Jim Fisher says the lens is relatively large and heavy; A reviewer at photozone.de says that for a wide-angle lens the dimensions are unusually narrow but long.|$|E

40|$|We give an {{efficient}} algorithm to enumerate {{all elements of}} a Pareto front in a multi-objective optimization problem in which the space of values is finite for all objectives. Our algorithm uses a feasibility check for a search space element as an oracle and minimizes the number of oracle calls {{that are necessary to}} identify the Pareto front of the problem. Given a k-dimensional search space in which each dimension has n elements, it needs p · (k ·_ 2 n + 1) + ψ(p) oracle calls, where p is the size of the Pareto front and ψ(p) is the number of greatest elements of the part of the search space that is not dominated by the Pareto <b>front</b> <b>elements.</b> We show that this number of oracle calls is essentially optimal as approximately p · k ·_ 2 n oracle calls are needed to identify the Pareto <b>front</b> <b>elements</b> in sparse Pareto sets and ψ(p) calls are needed to show that no element is missing in the set of Pareto <b>front</b> <b>elements</b> found...|$|R
50|$|Retrofocus lenses are {{extremely}} asymmetric with their large <b>front</b> <b>elements</b> and therefore {{very difficult to}} correct for distortion by traditional means. On the upside, the large negative element also limits the oblique cos4θ light falloff of regular wide-angle lenses.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the 14-42mm, the 14-45mm has a {{metal mount}} and {{hardware}} OIS switch. The <b>front</b> <b>elements</b> extend upon zooming, {{but do not}} rotate, allowing consistent use of polarized filters. The 52mm filter diameter lets a user share common filters with the Panasonic 14-42mm and 45-200mm, but not the 14-140 or 100-300mm.|$|R

50|$|Correctly made {{rectangular}} or square lens hoods {{are generally}} more efficient than cylindrical or conical ones because those shapes closely resemble {{the shape of the}} photograph. However, rectangular or square lens hoods should not be used with zoom lenses whose <b>front</b> <b>elements</b> rotate as the focal length is changed, as the hood will rotate as well, blocking parts of the angle of view. The same also applies to petal lens hoods. For these types of lenses, only cylindrical or conical lens hoods will work effectively.|$|R
40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{method for}} constructing optical surfaces for illumination purpose developed by Oliker and co-workers [Trends in Nonlinear Analysis (Springer, 2003) ] is generalized {{in order to}} obtain freeform designs in arbitrary optical systems. The freeform is created by a set of primitive surface elements, which are generalized Cartesian ovals adapted to the given optical system. Those primitives are determined by Hamiltonian theory of ray optics. The potential of this approach is demonstrated by some examples, e. g., freeform lenses with collimating <b>front</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

After being assured by local barangay leaders that no MNLF forces had landed, the 31st Infantry Battalion began to withdraw its troops from the island on 12 February 1981, leaving its Headquarters Service Company along with battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Jacinto Sardual.|$|R

Tritium illuminated night sights are also available. Due to product evolution in the Walther pistol line the PPS maintains compatibility with Walther P99 sights.The sight radius is 137 mm.|$|R
5000|$|By 25 April, the Italian Partisans' Committee of Liberation {{declared}} a general uprising, {{and on the}} same day, having crossed the Po on the right flank, forces of Eighth Army advanced north northeast towards Venice and Trieste. On the U.S. Fifth Army <b>front,</b> <b>elements</b> drove north toward Austria and north west to Milan. On the Fifth Army's left flank, the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division (the [...] "Buffalo Soldiers Division") went along the coast to Genoa; and a rapid advance towards Turin, by the Brazilian division on their right, took the German-Italian Army of Liguria by surprise, causing its collapse.|$|R
50|$|The lens {{features}} a weather resistant plastic exterior over plastic internals. It showcases recessed <b>front</b> lens <b>element,</b> focusing ring, and a matte black finish. On {{the side of}} the lens is a programmable focus-hold button.|$|R
50|$|The hood of {{the lens}} is fixed and the <b>front</b> <b>element</b> {{protrudes}} extensively, forcing the lens cap to take an unconventional shape, covering the entire hood. This also does not allow the placing of a filter in the front.|$|E
50|$|Autofocus is {{achieved}} using a moderately fast hypersonic motor for quiet operation. Additionally, all focus elements are internal so in operation the <b>front</b> <b>element</b> does not rotate or extend during focusing, which is useful when a polarizing filter is employed.|$|E
50|$|Some lenses, {{including}} Tessars, can {{be focused}} by moving lens elements relative to each other; this usually worsens optical performance to some extent, but is cheaper to implement. As the <b>front</b> <b>element</b> of the Tessar has {{three times the}} power of the whole lens, it must be moved one-third of the distance that the whole lens would need to move to focus at the same point. The large airspace {{between the first and second}} elements allows focusing by moving the <b>front</b> <b>element</b> only; as the displacement is small compared with the airspace, the adverse effect on image performance is not severe. The front-element-focusing Tessar, cheaper than a unit-focusing lens, was widely used in many midrange Zeiss Ikon cameras.|$|E
5000|$|Regular {{wide angle}} lenses (meaning lenses with focal length much {{shorter than the}} format {{diagonal}} and producing a wide field of view) need to be mounted close to the film. However, SLR cameras require that lenses be mounted far enough {{in front of the}} film to provide space for the movement of the mirror (the [...] "mirror box"); about 40 mm for a 35mm SLR compared to less than 10 mm in non-SLR 35mm cameras. This prompted the development of wide field of view lenses with more complex retrofocus optical designs. These use very large negative <b>front</b> <b>elements</b> to force back-focus distances long enough to ensure clearance.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} a Zeiss Pro-Tessar M 1:1 {{supplementary}} lens, that kept the focal length of 50mm but allowed 1:1 reproduction. The effective speed of the M 1:1 lens is f/5.6.The 50mm standard <b>front</b> <b>elements,</b> {{as well as the}} Pro-Tessar M 1:1 elements, were different between the early models III, IV, Rapid and Super with the old model of Tessar, and the later models Super (new), Super B, Super BC and S with the recomputed Tessar. It appears that the mount was very slightly modified, and it seems physically impossible to mismatch the elements as the journal diameterabove the bayonet mount had been reduced by approximately [...]006" ...|$|R
