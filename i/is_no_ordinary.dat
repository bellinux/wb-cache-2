Forced {{to work together to}} survive, they come to realize it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> island.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{opens with}} the third and {{youngest}} son of a miller receiving his inheritance—a cat. At first, the youngest son laments, as the eldest brother gains the mill, and the middle brother gets the mules. The feline <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> cat, however, but one who requests and receives a pair of boots. Determined to make his master's fortune, the cat bags a rabbit in the forest and presents it to the king as a gift from his master, the fictional Marquis of Carabas. The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months, {{for which he is}} rewarded.|$|E
25|$|The 330 Squadron {{is part of}} the National Air Ambulance Service. It {{carries out}} about 800 {{missions}} per year, or about ten percent of the total helicopter ambulance missions in Norway. The unit's helicopters are used when the ordinary helicopter ambulances (Eurocopter EC135, EC145 and AgustaWestland AW139) are unable to operate due to weather; missions in which a large cabin is needed such as due to the number of patients or an incubator; and in areas where the Sea Kings are closer and areas where there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> air ambulance service. Ambulance use must be permitted by the JRCCs.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} 38 referendums for {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Ireland. There have <b>been</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> referendums.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a pause}} again. Bert {{felt that}} she <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> girl, and she was quite as {{strongly}} drawn to him.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, {{and entered}} {{strongly}} into {{the view that}} an illness of his <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> occasion for medical science.|$|R
500|$|The Myst {{series of}} {{adventure}} computer games {{deal with the}} events following the player's discovery of a mysterious book describing an island known as Myst. The book <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> volume; it is a linking book, {{which serves as a}} portal to the world it describes. The player is transported to Myst Island, and must unravel the world's puzzles in order to return home. Myst was a commercial and critical success upon release, and spawned four sequels—Riven, , [...] and — as well as several spinoffs and adaptations.|$|E
500|$|One review {{about the}} soundtrack said that, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> album {{and will be}} {{preferred}} by musical elites. Infused with classical music and Rajasthani folk music, {{it is a good}} quality album coming out of Salim-Sulaiman. But the shortcoming comes in the form {{that this is not the}} kind of music that'll please every ear." [...] Another review, in a similar tone, said that the album [...] "works only for those who are either followers of classical music or enjoy hearing songs with a Rajasthani folk music base. There is no doubt that composers good quality throughout, but overall the album caters only to a niche audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Chi first appears atop a trash pile in {{an alley}} where she is found by Hideki Motosuwa, a high school {{graduate}} who knows very little about computers or the androids known as [...] "persocoms" [...] (personal computers) that have become the fashionable item {{to have in the}} city. Unlike other persocoms, her activation switch is located in an unusual place: her crotch. She has difficulty communicating with Hideki at first; the only word that she says is [...] "chi", which becomes her given name, but slowly she learns how to speak. Having no memory of her past life, she is taught by Hideki to perform simple tasks. Hideki's neighbor Shinbo and computer prodigy Minoru determine that Chi <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> persocom, and may be a legendary [...] "Chobit", possessing synthetic intelligence.|$|E

500|$|The plot {{begins with}} Souichiro Nagi {{and his friend}} Bob Makihara going to their first day of high school at Toudou Academy. They had {{intended}} to rule the school by beating up anybody that got in their way, as they had done at their previous schools. They soon learn that Toudou <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> high school, but rather a school that was founded to teach and integrate different fighting styles. Its students are skilled in the various arts of combat with some students possessing [...] supernatural abilities, such as pyrokinesis, precognition, and superhuman strength based on the abilities to use their [...] "spirit" [...] or [...] "ki" [...] in Japanese. After an altercation with the Executive Council, Souichiro and Bob join the only surviving club that opposes them, the Juken club. As the storyline develops, both groups find they are becoming increasingly involved in a long enduring conflict that was left unresolved from the Japanese Feudal era {{by some of the}} characters' ancestors.|$|E
500|$|Doggystyle was {{generally}} praised by critics. Rolling Stone writer Touré mentioned [...] "Doggystyle {{is filled with}} verbal and vocal feats that meet its high expectations. It speeds through 55minutes of constant talk {{as if on a}} suicide hot line". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly noted [...] "It is the most limber, low-rider gangsta album to date" [...] and went on to say [...] "Doggystyle is a grim, bleak-faced record. It's set in a dead-end, no-tomorrow world of cheap thrills". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated [...] "Doggystyle and The Chronic stand proudly together as the twin pinnacles of West Coast G-funk hip-hop of the early '90s" [...] Stylus magazine presented [...] "The Chronic vs. Doggystyle" [...] article, and stated a strong point of Doggystyle compared to Dre's album was its follow-up singles and that [...] "some of the album tracks are more famous than the singles". Vibe magazine expressed that [...] "Snoop <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> gangsta; that's impossible for an artist this playful. On his debut, with Dre riding shotgun anthems abound as often as gin-soaked debauchery". The Source magazine gave the album a 4/5 mic rating. It said Snoop Doggy Dogg emerged as a rapper who lived up to all the advance hype which came from his work on The Chronic, and discussed songs on the record, stating [...] "If 'Murder Was The Case' is a stroke of near genius, then 'Lodi Dodi' is an example of total genius." [...] NME magazine called the lead single [...] "a pinnacle he conquered effortlessly" [...] and went on to name the record a [...] "benchmark album".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time before}} 1976 the Guenettes {{reported}} that, {{in answer to}} their questions, [...] "He concluded that if the creature is {{a man in a}} suit, then it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> gorilla suit. It is not something they bought or rented in a store; {{it would have to be}} something tailor made. He also felt like it might have been made out of real animal fur." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{separation}} {{also proved}} painful, it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> separation and each twin would have rather died than live on without the other. To them, there <b>was</b> just <b>no</b> point in living any more."The {{separation of the}} twins <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> separation. Imagine surviving an earthquake. When you come to, you find the world unrecognisable. The horizon is in a different place. The sun has changed colour. Nothing remains of the terrain you know. As for you, you are alive. But it's {{not the same as}} living. It's no wonder the survivors of such disasters so often wish they had perished with others. [...] " [...] — p. 206 ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{criticism}} of Kejriwal's {{style of leadership}} continued with National Executive member Yogendra Yadav's letter to his party members, in which he claimed the members were [...] "falling prey to personality cult". He said [...] "Let me reiterate that Arvind bhai <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> leader {{and there are no}} two opinions about his continuing as the national convener; nor have I ever doubted his status as first among equals within the party's leadership. The real question is whether there are limits to personal discretion of the leader." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Triumph of Love, {{sold for}} Three Shillings and Sixpence. It was {{reviewed}} by The Examiner who stated, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> depth and tenderness of feeling in these poems. They have a curious resemblance in sentiment to the mystical {{poetry of the}} seventeenth century." [...] The Sunday Times reviewer noted, [...] "Few volumes of modern poetry deserve a warmer welcome than 'The Triumph of Love', of Ella Dietz. Tender, thoughtful and womanly throughout, it rises in points into absolute inspiration, and it has every variety of charm that cultivation, fervent aspiration, and poetic perception can bestow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 25 {{addresses}} Reformed ecclesiology or {{the teachings}} about the Christian Church. The confession teaches {{that the church}} is catholic or universal. The church is both invisible and visible. The invisible church is made up of all the elect who will ever live. Christ {{is the head of the}} church, and the church is the body of Christ and the bride of Christ. The visible church includes all people alive throughout the world who [...] "profess the true religion" [...] and their children. It is described as the kingdom of Christ and the house and family of God. The confession teaches that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> possibility of salvation outside of the visible church. It is said that Christ gave to the visible church [...] "the ministry, oracles, and ordinances of God" [...] for the perfecting of the saints.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Cat," [...] {{replied the}} Prince, [...] "I {{thank you for}} {{receiving}} me so kindly, but surely you <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> pussy-cat? Indeed, the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked down}} at her, and again she had an uncomfortable sense that {{notwithstanding}} his rude clothes and country dialect, this man <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> villager. He said nothing, however, until she produced her purse, and held out a little tentatively two half-crowns.|$|R
6000|$|Laverick {{looked at}} him steadily. Morrison was an {{ordinary}} young man of his type, something of a swaggerer, probably at heart a coward. But this <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> fear--not even the ordinary fear of a coward. Laverick's face became graver. There was something else, then! ...|$|R
2500|$|In 196, the warlord Cao Cao {{received}} and fetched Emperor Xian to Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) and established the new capital there. He wrote to Xun You, [...] "The Empire is in chaos. It {{is time for}} intelligent people to do something. Don't {{you think you have}} spent too much time observing changes in the Shu region?" [...] Xun You was then appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day Gushi County, Henan) and later summoned to the capital to serve as a Master of Writing (尚書). Cao Cao had long heard of Xun You and was overjoyed when they finally met. He told Xun Yu and Zhong Yao, [...] "Gongda <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> person. Now that I have him to advise me, why should I worry {{about not being able to}} pacify the Empire?" [...] He also appointed Xun You as a Military Adviser (軍師).|$|E
2500|$|David Gordon <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> choreographer, [...] He {{understands how}} to {{manipulate}} text and dance {{so that the}} result evokes an invigorating place, where thoughtful theater takes on the appearance of being casual. It never is just that. ... plays with many pieces of seemingly disparate phrases before they are transformed into an eloquent whole. [...] In many ways, he is a gleaner of his own work, which he files away {{with the possibility of}} revisiting it in the future. ... But as much as he revives material after recontextualizing it, most fundamental to the vitality of [...] repertory is not what the movement looks like or even what the words say, but the beguiling way in which they fit together. [...] He is a director who knows dance. [...] And even though there is a bit of everything in his work [...] humor, musicality, lush movement [...] he is unpredictable. (Gia Kourlas, 2002) ...|$|E
2500|$|Śrīrāghave Bhārgavapraveśaḥ (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवे भार्गवप्रवेशः). Rāma {{counters}} {{the rage}} of Paraśurāma by his gentle words. Rāma accepts that he has indeed broken the bow, but only on orders of Viśvāmitra. He calls Paraśurāma as his Guru and himself as Paraśurāma's disciple. Rāma aplogizes to Paraśurāma for the insulting speech of Lakṣmaṇa. While Rāma speaks thus, Lakṣmaṇa giggles again at Paraśurāma. This further infuriates Paraśurāma who now challenges Rāma to a duel, saying he <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>ordinary</b> Brāhmaṇa. Rāma respectfully tells Paraśurāma that duel is only between equals, {{and he is not}} worthy of having a duel with Paraśurāma. He tells Paraśurāma that he (Rāma) is omnipotent but still a slave of the Brāhmaṇas. Then Rāma reveals his Mahāviṣṇu form to Paraśurāma, showing the mark of Bhṛgu's foot on his chest. On seeing the footprint of his ancestor, Paraśurāma gives up the pretence of anger. He asks Rāma to string the bow of Viṣṇu named Śārṅga. As he hands over the Śārṅga to Rāma, his axe disappears, and all his weapons go and dissolve into Rāma. His aura also enters Rāma. Rāma strings the Vaiṣṇava bow and places an arrow on it. Paraśurāma's pretence of doubt is also over. Paraśurāma then praises Rāma in twelve verses (19.63–19.76). Rāma tells Paraśurāma that his arrow is infallible. He asks Paraśurāma if he should use the arrow to destroy Paraśurāma's ability to move freely on earth, or if he should destroy the fruits earned by Paraśurāma with his penance. Rāma again gently reveals his Mahāviṣṇu form to Paraśurāma, and then falls at the feet of Paraśurāma to ask for his orders. Amidst acclaims from everybody in the assembly, Paraśurāma embraces Rāma and asks hims to get up from his feet. He then asks Rāma to destroy the fruits of his penance and not his mobility. [...] Rāma does the same. Paraśurāma starts to praise Rāma.|$|E
