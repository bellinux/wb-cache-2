5|$|Galen Clark {{retired as}} the state grant's {{guardian}} in 1896, leaving Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees under ineffective stewardship. Pre-existing problems in the state grant worsened and new problems arose, but the cavalry could only monitor the situation. Muir and the Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unified Yosemite National Park.

5|$|In 1785, a {{proposal}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> General Assembly {{went before the}} Synod, yet the convening of one was delayed due to the necessity of having to write a constitution, a constitution which officers could not initially agree upon. In 1788, the Synod adopted a constitution modeled on the Church of Scotland in which power was centralized in the General Assembly. The constitution also included provisions of the Church of Scotland's Barrier Act of 1697, which required the General Assembly to receive the approval {{of a majority of}} presbyteries before making major changes to the church's constitution and doctrine.|$|E

Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean Sea which would serve as coaling and naval stations, and serve as strategical points of defense upon the construction of an Isthmusian canal.|$|E

5|$|In the Peace of Westphalia, Frederick William was {{compensated}} for Western Pomerania with the secularized bishoprics of Halberstadt and Minden {{and the right}} of succession to the likewise secularized Archbishopric of Magdeburg. With Halberstadt, Brandenburg-Prussia also gained several smaller territories: the Lordship of Derenburg, the County of Regenstein, the Lordship of Klettenberg and the Lordship of Lohra. This was primarily due to French efforts to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg emperor by strengthening the Hohenzollern, and while Frederick William valued these territories lower than Western Pomerania, they became step-stones <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> closed, dominant realm in Germany in the long run.|$|E

On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt {{to take control of}} Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove away from California and return it to the federal government. In 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that.|$|E
