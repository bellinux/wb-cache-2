25|$|For an open system, {{there can}} be {{transfers}} of particles as well as energy into {{or out of the}} system during a process. For this case, the <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> still holds, in the form that the internal energy is a function of state and the change of internal energy in a process is a function only of its initial and final states, as noted in the section below headed <b>First</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> for open systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{energy of a}} system can be changed by transfers of matter or heat or by doing work. When matter transfer is prevented by impermeable containing walls, the system {{is said to be}} closed. Then the <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> states that the increase in {{internal energy}} is equal to the total heat added plus the work done on the system by its surroundings. If the containing walls pass neither matter nor energy, the system is said to be isolated and its internal energy cannot change. The <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> may be regarded as establishing the existence of the internal energy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> is an {{expression}} of the principle of conservation of energy. It states that energy can be transformed (changed from one form to another), but cannot be created or destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} <b>of</b> chemical <b>thermodynamics</b> {{is based}} on the <b>first</b> two <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics.</b> Starting from the <b>first</b> and second <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics,</b> four equations called the [...] "fundamental equations of Gibbs" [...] can be derived. From these four, a multitude of equations, relating the thermodynamic properties of the thermodynamic system can be derived using relatively simple mathematics.

25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics,</b> deduced {{from the}} heat-friction {{experiments}} of James Joule in 1843, expresses {{the concept of}} energy, and its conservation in all processes; the first law, however, is unable to quantify the effects of friction and dissipation.|$|E
25|$|A {{calculation}} of quantity of heat transferred {{can rely on}} a hypothetical quantity of energy transferred as adiabatic work and on the <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics.</b> Such calculation is the primary approach of many theoretical studies of quantity of heat transferred.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} state equation, given by the <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> (i.e. {{conservation}} of energy), is written in the following form (assuming no mass transfer or radiation). This form is more general and particularly useful to recognize which property (e.g. cp or ') influences which term.|$|E

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} of heat death {{stems from the}} ideas of William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who in the 1850s took the theory of heat as mechanical energy loss in nature (as embodied in the <b>first</b> two <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics)</b> and extrapolated it to larger processes on a universal scale.|$|R

25|$|In 1840, Germain Hess stated a {{conservation}} {{law for the}} so-called 'heat of reaction' for chemical reactions. His law was later recognized {{as a consequence of}} the <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics,</b> but Hess's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> was {{developed}} empirically over {{about half a}} century. The first full statements of the law came in 1850 from Rudolf Clausius and from William Rankine; Rankine's statement is considered less distinct relative to Clausius'. A main aspect of the struggle was {{to deal with the}} previously proposed caloric theory of heat.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the latter}} is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their {{difference}} would be a state function that would vanish {{upon completion of the}} cycle. The state function was called the internal energy and it became the <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{modified}} <b>first</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> at {{the black}} hole horizon and the cosmological horizon of the Schwarzschild de Sitter black hole and the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology are derived by the surface tensions, respectively. The corresponding Smarr relations are obeyed. For the black hole, the cosmological constant is first treated as a fixed constant, {{and then as a}} variable associated to the pressure. The law at the apparent horizon takes the same form as that at the cosmological horizon, but is different from that {{at the black}} hole horizon. The positive temperatures guarantee the appearance of the worked terms in the modified laws at the cosmological and apparent horizons. While they can disappear at the black hole horizon.

25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> for {{a closed}} system was {{expressed}} {{in two ways}} by Clausius.

25|$|The {{basis for}} Spencer's appeal {{to many of}} his {{generation}} was that he appeared to offer a ready-made system of belief which could substitute for conventional religious faith {{at a time when}} orthodox creeds were crumbling under the advances of modern science.

25|$|A {{problem the}} energy {{analysis}} method cannot resolve is that different energy forms (heat, electricity, chemical energy etc.) have different quality and value even in natural sciences, {{as a consequence}} of the two main laws of thermodynamics. A thermodynamic measure of the quality of energy is exergy. According to the <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics,</b> all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight, whereas by the second law diverse energy forms should be accounted by different values.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBabichev, Dokuchaev and Eroshenko have {{recently}} found that accretion of phantom energy onto {{a black hole}} induces a gradual decrease of the black hole mass, and that masses of all possible black holes tend to zero {{as a result of}} this process as the universe approaches the big rip singularity. The implications of these results on the <b>thermodynamics</b> <b>of</b> black holes and phantom energy are explored in this Letter, showing that such results become consistent with the two <b>first</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> only if phantom energy is characterized by a negative temperature depending on the scale factor and by a positive definite entropy which tends to become constant if phantom energy largely dominates the universe. It is also argued that the loss of quantum coherence of semiclassical black hole physics is no longer present if the universe is filled with phantom energy...|$|R

25|$|Energy {{is neither}} created nor {{destroyed}} during a process. Energy changes from one form to another (see <b>First</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thermodynamics).</b> In contrast, exergy is always destroyed when a process is irreversible, for example loss of heat {{to the environment}} (see Second Law of Thermodynamics). This destruction {{is proportional to the}} entropy increase of the system together with its surroundings. The destroyed exergy has been called anergy. For an isothermal process, exergy and energy are interchangeable terms, and there is no anergy.|$|E
25|$|For the <b>first</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics,</b> {{there is}} no trivial passage of {{physical}} conception from the closed system view to an open system view. For closed systems, the concepts of an adiabatic enclosure and of an adiabatic wall are fundamental. Matter and internal energy cannot permeate or penetrate such a wall. For an open system, there is a wall that allows penetration by matter. In general, matter in diffusive motion carries with it some internal energy, and some microscopic potential energy changes accompany the motion. An open system is not adiabatically enclosed.|$|E
