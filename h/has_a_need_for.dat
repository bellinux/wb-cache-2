2500|$|In colonial times, Massachusetts {{also used}} the term [...] "plantation" [...] for a {{community}} in a pre-town stage of development (Maine originally got the term from Massachusetts, as Maine was part of Massachusetts until 1820, when it became a state via the Missouri Compromise). The term plantation had not been much used in Massachusetts since the 18th century. Massachusetts also once had [...] "districts," [...] which served much the same purpose. They {{were considered to be}} incorporated, but lacked the full privileges of a town. Maine and Rhode Island are also known to have made limited use of the district concept. Districts have not been at all common since {{the first half of the}} 19th century, and there have not been any districts anywhere in New England in over a century. Maine is the only New England state that currently has a significant amount of territory that is not sufficiently populated to support town governments, thus the only New England state that still <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the plantation type of municipality.|$|E

5000|$|Most people <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> stable self-respect and self-esteem.

The [...] "higher" [...] version manifests itself as the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> self-respect.

This [...] "higher" [...] version takes precedence over the [...] "lower" [...] version because it relies on an inner competence established through experience.

50|$|Such glasses do {{not take}} into account the {{possible}} need for any astigmatism correction, which will influence both the near and the distance prescription. The need for a cylindrical component in the otherwise spherical lens surfaces, correctly aligned in angle, is used to correct for astigmatism, and any lack of such correction is a major cause of tiredness and headaches in people doing prolonged close work or reading. If the wearer has little to no need for the correction of astigmatism, off-the-shelf glasses may work quite well for seeing better during near vision tasks. But if the person <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> distance correction, it is less likely that they will be perfectly effective.|$|E
