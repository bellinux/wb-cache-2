Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), a heavy rail/metro system, operates in four counties and connects San Francisco and Oakland via an underwater tube. Other commuter rail systems link San Francisco with the Peninsula and San Jose (Caltrain), San Jose with the Tri-Valley Area and San Joaquin county (ACE), and Sonoma with Marin county (SMART). In addition, Amtrak provides frequent commuter service between and San Jose and the East Bay with Sacramento, and long distance service {{to other parts of}} the United States. Muni Metro operates a hybrid streetcar/subway system within the city of San Francisco, and VTA operates a light rail system in Santa Clara county. These rail systems are supplemented by numerous bus agencies and transbay ferries such as Golden Gate Ferry and the San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority. Most of these agencies accept the Clipper Card, a reloadable contactless smart card, as a universal <b>electronic</b> <b>payment</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Many <b>electronic</b> <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} to facilitate the purchase of goods and services over the Internet. For the class of goods and services that can be categorized as low-value transactions, they require <b>electronic</b> <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> that are efficient but reasonably secure. This class of goods and services includes news clippings, songs' video clips, etc. For efficiency the <b>payment</b> <b>systems,</b> commonly called "micropayment" systems, are designed with lightweight security measures, and hence could be attractive targets of malicious attacks. This paper proposes three architecture designs for server-side credit-based <b>electronic</b> <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> to resist external attacks. A simulation model has been built for the proposed architectures to analyze their performance and their levels of security Such analyses should be useful for designers of <b>electronic</b> <b>payment</b> <b>systems,</b> especially those of micropayment systems...|$|R
