50|$|The {{essential}} {{design of}} Phi Mu Alpha's official membership pin was adopted at the 1st National Convention in 1901. The design consisted of an upward-pointing equilateral triangle {{with a gold}} old-English S on a field of black <b>enamel,</b> <b>surrounded</b> by twelve pearls and six rubies. The pattern of the jeweling was three pearls at each tip, with two rubies separated by one pearl on each side. The design was modified slightly in 1910 by reducing {{the size of the}} old-English S to allow room for the Greek letters Φ, Μ, and Α, with Φ in the top corner, Μ in the lower left corner, and Α in the lower right corner. This design remains in use today, though garnets are used instead of rubies. The official membership pin is only worn by initiated members of the fraternity (collegiate, alumni, or honorary).|$|R

Since 1991, it has been required that the insignia be returned upon the recipient's death.|$|R

On the lingual side (towards the tongue), there is a deep furrow (filled in part with cementum) that extends from the top to near {{the base of the}} tooth. There is also a much smaller indentation on the buccal side (towards the cheeks). The occlusal surface is mostly covered with <b>enamel</b> <b>surrounding</b> a dentine lake, but there is a V-shaped islet in the middle, with the tip of the V towards the lingual side, that forms the remnant of an —a deep cavity in the tooth. Perikymata—wave-like bands and grooves—are visible in the enamel.|$|R

5000|$|Postcanine megadontia is {{commonly}} associated with the repeated consumption of tough plant-like material, which {{can be referred to}} as [...] "low-quality food stuffs". The substances were integral to the diet of extinct hominids, and their molars were subject to the constant occlusal attrition from the stress of vigorous mastication. The development and evolution of this trait was characterized by a thick coating of <b>enamel</b> <b>surrounding</b> the molars and premolars, mitigating the detrimental effects of the tough diet. As such, this postcanine dentition is capable of “crushing and grinding” the tough shoots and leaves common to the diet of an early hominid. Australopithecus Paranthropus, for example, was perhaps the most noteworthy hominid to display this trait, an adaptation perhaps due to its varied and encompassing diet [...] Note, postcanine megadontia is hypothesized to have no correlation to durophagy, but is rather a crucial development in hominids that allowed for preservation of occlusal quality.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Star and Garter" [...] {{originates}} from an abbreviation of {{the name}} of the insignia belonging to Order of the Garter. The Star is eight pointed and of chipped silver.
