[...] "It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, the political and economic turmoil in the People's Republic of Poland had seriously eroded the authority of the Polish United Workers' Party. Suslov's position on this matter carried particular weight as he chaired a Politburo Commission, established on 25 August 1980, {{on how to deal with}} the Polish crisis. Members of the commission included such high-ranking Soviets as Andropov, Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov, Andrei Gromyko, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Brezhnev's long-time associate Konstantin Chernenko. On 28 August, the Commission considered Soviet military intervention to stabilize the region. Wojciech Jaruzelski, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, was able to persuade the Commission that a Soviet military intervention would only aggravate the situation. Suslov agreed with Jaruzelski's argument, stating that [...] "if troops are introduced, that will mean a catastrophe. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all share the unanimous opinion here that there can be no discussion of any introduction of troops". Suslov was able to persuade Jaruzelski and the Polish leadership to establish martial law in Poland.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} anti-US sentiments {{would affect the}} film's box office, Feige said, [...] "Marvel is {{perceived}} pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office {{would be a good}} thing.... We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E

I don’t have any information about that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should not jump to conclusions and we should wait {{to find out what}} the evidence says...

2500|$|Artist Neville Page, in {{response}} to claims that {{the design of the}} creature was {{similar to that of the}} 2006 South Korean film The Host, said, [...] "They are [...] in that they ravage and seem to originate from the water, but the end results are quite different. However, when I finally saw some of the concept art, there were some very obvious similarities. But then again, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were both channeling similar biological possibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{incident}} in July 2012 {{dealt with the}} vandalism of the synagogue of Noisy-le-Grand of the Seine-Saint-Denis district in Paris. The synagogue was vandalized {{three times in a}} ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L’Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, [...] "Despite the measures taken, things persist, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{are at a}} {{crossing}} in {{the roads}} of history, history in the grand sense. One road already appears clearly laid out, at least in its general orientation.

2500|$|While {{emphasizing}} unity {{within the}} Muslim community, Warith Deen Mohammed called upon the American Muslim community {{to establish a}} new school of fiqh, a code of conduct for the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. He told ISLAMICA magazine in 2008 that he felt that the madhhab—the schools of thought within fiqh—were geographically influenced and should be regionally developed, suggesting that [...] "I think we are gradually getting a sense of madhabs in America, especially those like me. We are getting a sense of madhabs. And with the coming generation <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will be getting a much stronger sense of it. It is coming more and more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stone took on {{the role}} of a {{clinically}} depressed woman in the independent drama When a Man Falls in the Forest (2007), premiered in competition at the 2007 Berlin Film Festival where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. She found her part [...] "challenging" [...] to play, remarking: [...] "It was a watershed experience. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> live in a [...] Prozac society where we're always told we're supposed to have this kind of equilibrium of emotion. We have all these assignments about how we're supposed to feel about something." [...] Her next film roles have been in independent productions, including the late 2000s films If I Had Known I Was a Genius (2007), The Year of Getting to Know Us (2008), Five Dollars a Day (2009) and Streets of Blood (2009), all of which went directly-to-DVD in North America.|$|E

2500|$|During her June 12, 2010, {{appearance}} on Freedom Watch, Palin elaborated on her stance {{that even though}} marijuana should not be legalized, enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws should be made a lower priority: [...] "Well, if we’re talking about pot, I’m not for the legalization of pot because I think that that would just encourage, especially, our young people {{to think that it}} was okay to go ahead and use it. And I’m not an advocate for that. However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need to prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem {{that we have in the}} country." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a {{short period}} of {{development}} regarding the ideas of the album, on March 6, 2007 the band arrived at a cabin in the rural mountains of Mount Charleston, Nevada and began the writing process for the new album. After recording the new tracks and performing them live over the summer, the band returned to its native Las Vegas as well as the group's old rehearsal studio, where the band members wrote their debut record. The band grew uninterested in the songs previously written and by August scrapped the entire new album (which Ross later revealed was [...] "three-quarters" [...] done) and started over. [...] "We wanted to approach these songs in the most basic form," [...] Ross said. [...] "We wrote them all on one acoustic guitar and with someone singing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> kind of skipped that part of songwriting on the first record, and this time we're sort of paying attention to that. [...] We've written a bunch of songs since we've been home [...] I think it's the most fun and the happiest we've been since we started." [...] With simplicity the new focus and the old album shelved, the group settled in and began recording what would become Pretty. Odd. In October, the band entered the Studio at the Palms at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas to begin recording the album.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the close}} of the band's tour in support of Light Grenades (2006), the band entered an {{extended}} hiatus. Vocalist Brandon Boyd noted, [...] "It's not that we were burned out being in a band or being in this band; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we,</b> collectively, were feeling like if we didn't step away from this monster that we created then it would begin to consume us. [...] We had to plant some roots, lest we start to write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals. [...] It was like, 'Ok, well what do we do now?' Obviously there are lots of things to do but I think we wanted to take some time, each of us personally, to explore a little bit and find out what the rest of the world was like." [...] Bassist Ben Kenney stated, [...] "Being with music is a creative thing and requires a certain amount of creativity - to just keep going back to that well over and over again, it doesn’t have a chance to replenish." ...|$|E
