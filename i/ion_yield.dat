50|$|Many {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out on the MPI of rare gas atoms using strong laser pulses, through measuring both the total <b>ion</b> <b>yield</b> and the kinetic energy of the electrons. Here, one only considers the experiments designed to measure the total <b>ion</b> <b>yield.</b> Among these experiments are those by Chin et al., Augst et al. and Auguste et al. Chin et al. used a 10.6 μm CO2 laser in their experiment. Due to the very small frequency of the laser, the tunneling is strictly quasi-static, a characteristic which is not easily attainable using pulses in the near infrared or visible region of frequencies. These findings weakened the suspicion on the applicability of models basically founded on the assumption of a structureless atom. Larochelle et al. have compared the theoretically predicted ion versus intensity curves of rare gas atoms interacting with a Ti:sapphire laser with experimental measurement. They have shown that the total ionization rate predicted by the PPT model fits very well the experimental ion yields for all rare gases in the intermediate regime of Keldysh parameter.|$|E

5000|$|Tandem {{time-of-flight}} (TOF/TOF) is a tandem {{mass spectrometry}} method where two time-of-flight mass spectrometers are used consecutively. To record {{full spectrum of}} precursor (parent) ions TOF/TOF operates in MS mode. In this mode, {{the energy of the}} pulse laser is chosen slightly above the onset of MALDI for specific matrix in use to ensure the compromise between an <b>ion</b> <b>yield</b> for all the parent ions and reduced fragmentation of the same ions. When operating in a tandem (MS/MS) mode, the laser energy is increased considerably above MALDI threshold. The first TOF mass spectrometer (basically, a flight tube which ends up with the timed ion selector) isolates precursor ions of choice using a velocity filter, typically, of a Bradbury-Nielsen type, and the second TOF-MS (that includes the post accelerator, flight tube, ion mirror, and the ion detector) analyzes the fragment ions. Fragment ions in MALDI TOF/TOF result from decay of precursor ions vibrationally excited above their dissociation level in MALDI source (post source decay [...] ). Additional ion fragmentation implemented in a high-energy collision cell may be added to the system to increase dissociation rate of vibrationally excited precursor ions. Some designs include precursor signal quenchers as a part of second TOF-MS to reduce the instant current load on the ion detector.|$|E

Secondary ion yields are increased using Bi 2 +and Bi 32 + primary ions for the molecular layers and polymers that can undergo allyl cation rearrangements. For Irganox 1010, the deprotonated molecular ion yields (m/z 1175; [M − H]−) are {{one to two}} times larger for Bi 2 + and Bi 32 + primary ions than for Bi+ and Bi 3 + at the same primary ion velocities. In the positive ion mode, the largest fragment <b>ion</b> <b>yield</b> (m/z 899) is ∼ 1. 5 times larger for Bi 2 + ions than for Bi+. For Bi 32 + the largest fragment <b>ion</b> <b>yield</b> is only ∼ 70 % of the <b>ion</b> <b>yield</b> using Bi 3 +, but the secondary ion yields of the fragment ions at m/z 57 and 219 are enhanced.

The one-of-a-kind instrument {{used to generate}} these hypervelocity nanoparticles (~ 2 nm diameter, ~ 30 km/s) and monitor emissions from their impacts (SIMS) is described in detail for the first time. The projectile range of 520 keV Au 400 + 4 is measured to be ~ 20 nm in amorphous carbon and projectile disintegration is observed at the exit of carbon foils as thin as 5 nm. These experiments were performed by monitoring carbon cluster ions emitted {{from both sides of}} a foil impacted by the projectile. Surprisingly, clusters emitted in the forward direction are larger than those emitted backward. The composition of the mass spectra is shown to depend on both the thickness of the foil {{and the size of the}} projectile. Secondary <b>ion</b> <b>yields</b> for a variety of materials including peptides, lipids, drugs, polymers, inorganic salts, and various small molecules have been measured and molecular <b>ion</b> <b>yields</b> for many of these species exceed unity. Multiplicity measurements show that up to seven molecular ions of leucine-enkephalin (YGGFL) can be detected from the impact of a single projectile. SI yields measured with ~ 500 keV Au 400 + 4 are generally one to two orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with 130 keV Au 3 + and 50 keV C 60 + projectiles. The high molecular <b>ion</b> <b>yields</b> observed suggest the internal energies of ions emitted from massive cluster impacts are relatively low. In order to address this hypothesis, a novel method for measuring secondary ion internal energies was developed using a series of benzylpyridinium salts. Using this method, the internal energies were measured to be ~ 0. 19 eV/atom, which is a factor of five less than that seen in atomic-SIMS. Sample metallization is shown to be ineffective for further increasing secondary <b>ion</b> <b>yields</b> with Au 400, despite observations from previous molecular dynamic simulations.

40|$|The current {{limitation}} for SIMS analyses is insufficient secondary <b>ion</b> <b>yields,</b> {{due in part}} to the inefficiency of traditional primary ions. Massive gold clusters are shown to be a route to significant gains in secondary <b>ion</b> <b>yields</b> relative to other commonly used projectiles. At an impact energy of 520 [*]keV, Au 400 + 4 is capable of generating an average of greater than ten secondary ions per projectile, with some impact events generating > 100 secondary ions. The capability of this projectile for signal enhancement is further displayed through the observation of up to seven deprotonated molecular ions from a single impact on a neat target of the model pentapeptide leu-enkephalin. Positive and negative spectra of leu-enkephalin reveal two distinct emission regimes responsible for the emission of either intact molecular ions with low internal energies or small fragment species. The internal energy distribution for this projectile is measured using a series of benzylpyridinium salts and compared with the small polyatomic projectile Au 3 + at 110 [*]keV as well as distributions previously reported for electrospray ionization and fast atom bombardment. These results show that Au 400 + 4 offers high secondary <b>ion</b> <b>yields</b> not only for small fragment ions, e. g.

Using Aun+ ion structures obtained from Density Functional Theory, we demonstrate that the secondary yield enhancement is not simply due to an increase in energy per area deposited into the surface (energy deposition density). Instead, based on simple mechanical arguments and molecular dynamics results from Medvedeva et al, we suggest a mechanism for nonlinear secondary <b>ion</b> <b>yield</b> enhancement wherein the action of multiple concerted Au impacts leads to efficient energy transfer to substrate atoms in the near surface region and {{an increase in the number}} of secondary ions ejected from the surface. Such concerted impacts involve one, two, or three Au atoms, which explains well the large nonlinear yield enhancements observed going from Au+ to Au 2 + to Au 3 + primary ions. This model is also able to explain the observed substrate effect. For an Au+ ion passing through the more open Si surface, it contacts fewer substrate atoms than in the more dense Al surface. Less energy is deposited in the Si surface region by the Au+ primary ion and the secondary <b>ion</b> <b>yield</b> will be lower for adsorbates on Si than on Al.

50|$|Experimental {{applications}} include high-resolution {{measurements on}} {{the intensity and}} angular distributions of emitted electrons {{as well as on}} the total and partial <b>ion</b> <b>yields.</b> Ejected electrons can escape only from a depth of approximately 3 nanometers or less, making electron spectroscopy most useful to study surfaces of solid materials. Depth profiling is accomplished by combining an electron spectroscopy with a sputtering source that removes surface layers.|$|R
40|$|Photoionization cross {{sections}} and partial <b>ion</b> <b>yields</b> of Xe and XeF_ 2 from Xe 3 d_ 5 / 2, Xe 3 d_ 3 / 2, and F 1 s subshells in the 660 [...] 740 eV range are compared to explore {{effects of the}} F ligands. The Xe 3 d - ϵf continuum shape resonances dominate the photoionization {{cross sections}} of both the atom and molecule, but prominent resonances appear in the XeF_ 2 cross section due to nominal excitation of Xe 3 d and F 1 s electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), a delocalized anti-bonding MO. The subshell ionization thresholds, the LUMO resonance energies and their oscillator strengths are calculated by relativistic coupled-cluster methods. Several charge states and fragment ions are produced from the atom and molecule due to alternative decay pathways from the inner-shell holes. Total and partial <b>ion</b> <b>yields</b> vary {{in response to the}} shape resonances and LUMO resonances. Previous calculations and measurements of atomic Xe 3 d core-hole decay channels and our calculated results for XeF_ 2 guide interpretations of the molecular ion products. The partial <b>ion</b> <b>yields</b> of XeF_ 2 are dominated by Xe 3 d core-hole decays, but distinct ion products are measured at the F 1 s - LUMO resonance. Xe 3 d core-hole decays from XeF_ 2 produce lower charge states in comparison with atomic Xe, and energetic F ions are produced by Coulomb explosions of the molecular ions. The measurements support a model of molecular core-hole decay that begins with a localized hole, stepwise Auger electron emission spreads charge across neighboring atoms, and the system fragments energetically...|$|R
