"My lord the dwarf," [...] said Alcahazar, {{advancing}} toward him, [...] "I am {{the king}} of a far country; and passing your castle, and hearing of your feast, I have made bold to come and offer {{you some of the}} sweet-tasting birds of my kingdom." [...] So saying, he lifted up his richly embroidered cloak, and took from under it a great silver dish containing about two hundred dozen <b>hot,</b> <b>smoking,</b> delicately cooked, fat little birds. Under the dish were fastened lamps of perfumed oil, all lighted, and keeping the savory food nice and hot. Making a low bow, the magician placed the dish before the dwarf, who tasted one of the birds, and immediately clapped his hands with joy. [...] "Great King!" [...] he cried, [...] "welcome to my feast! Slaves, quick! make room for the great king!" [...] As there was no vacant place, the slaves took hold of one of the guests, and gave him what the boys would call a [...] "hist," [...] right through the window, and Alcahazar took his place. Then stepped forward Ormanduz, and said, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I am also {{the king of}} a far country, and I have made bold to offer you some of the wine of my kingdom." [...] So saying, he lifted his gold-lined cloak, and took from beneath it a crystal decanter, covered with gold and ruby ornaments, with one hundred and one beautifully carved silver goblets hanging from its neck, and which contained about eleven gallons of the most delicious wine. He placed it before the dwarf, who, having tasted the wine, gave a great cheer, and shouted to his slaves to make room for this mighty king. So the slaves took another guest by the neck and heels, and sent him, slam-bang, through the window, and Ormanduz took his place. Then stepped forward Mahallah, and said, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I am also the king of a far country, and I bring you a sample of the venison of my kingdom." [...] So saying, he raised his velvet cloak, trimmed with diamonds, and took from under it a whole deer, already cooked, and stuffed with oysters, anchovies, buttered toast, olives, tamarind seeds, sweet-marjoram, sage, and many other herbs and spices, and all piping hot, and smelling deliciously. This he put down before the dwarf, who, when he had tasted it, waved his goblet over his head, and cried out to the slaves to make room for this mighty king. So the slaves seized another guest, and out of the window, like a shot, he went, and Mahallah took his place. Then Akbeck stepped up, and said, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I am also the king of a far country, and I bring you some of the confections of my dominions." [...] So saying, he took from under his cloak of gold cloth, a great basket of silver filagree work, in which were cream-chocolates, and burnt almonds, and sponge-cake, and lady's fingers, and mixtures, and gingernuts, and hoar-hound candy, and gum-drops, and fruit-cake, and cream candy, and mintstick, and pound-cake, and rock candy, and butter taffy, and many other confections, amounting in all to about two hundred and twenty pounds. He placed the basket before the dwarf, who tasted some of these good things, and found them so delicious, that he lay on his back and kicked up his heels in delight, shouting to his slaves to make room for this great king. As the next guest was a big, fat man, too heavy to throw far, he was seized by four slaves, who walked him Spanish right out of the door, and Akbeck took his place. Then Zamcar stepped forward and said, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I also am king of a far country, and I bring you some of the fruit of my dominions." [...] And so saying, he took from beneath his gold and purple cloak, a great basket filled with currants as big as grapes, and grapes as big as plums, and plums as big as peaches, and peaches as big as cantaloupes, and cantaloupes as big as water-melons, and water-melons as big as barrels. There were about nineteen bushels of them altogether, and he put them before the dwarf, who, having tasted some of them, clapped his hands, and shouted to his slaves to make room for this mighty king; but as the next guest had very sensibly got up and gone out, Zamcar took his seat without any delay. Then Ting-a-ling, who was very much excited by all these wonderful performances, slipped down out of Zamcar's turban, and, running up towards the dwarf, cried out, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I am also the king of a far country, and I bring you"--and he lifted up his little cloak; but as there was nothing there, he said no more, but clambered up into Zamcar's turban again. As nobody noticed or heard him, so great was the bustle and noise of the festivity, his speech made no difference one way or the other. After everybody had eaten and drunk until they could eat and drink no more, the dwarf jumped up and called to the chief butler, to know how many beds were prepared for the guests; to which the butler answered that there were thirty beds prepared. [...] "Then," [...] said the dwarf, [...] "give these five noble kings each one of the best rooms, with a down bed, and a silken comfortable; and give the other beds to the twenty-five biggest guests. As to the rest, turn them out!" [...] So the dwarf went to bed, and each of the magicians had a splendid room, and twenty-five of the biggest guests had beds, and the rest were all turned out. As it was pouring down rain, and freezing, and cold, and wet, and slippery (for the weather was very unsettled on this mountain), and all these guests, who now found themselves outside of the castle gates, lived many miles away, and as none of them had any hats, or knew the way home, they were very miserable indeed.|$|E

50|$|Smoking helps {{seal the}} outer {{layer of the}} food being cured, making it more {{difficult}} for bacteria to enter. It can be done in combination with other curing methods such as salting. Common smoking styles include <b>hot</b> <b>smoking,</b> smoke roasting (pit barbecuing) and cold smoking. Smoke roasting and <b>hot</b> <b>smoking</b> cook the meat while cold smoking does not. If the meat is cold smoked, it should be dried quickly to limit bacterial growth during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry. This can be achieved, as with jerky, by slicing the meat thinly.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>smoking</b> {{exposes the}} foods to smoke and {{heat in a}} {{controlled}} environment. Like cold smoking, the item is hung first to develop a pellicle, then smoked. Although foods that have been hot smoked are often reheated or cooked, they are typically safe to eat without further cooking. Hams and ham hocks are fully cooked once they are properly smoked. <b>Hot</b> <b>smoking</b> occurs {{within the range of}} 52 to 80 C. Within this temperature range, foods are fully cooked, moist, and flavorful. If the smoker is allowed to get hotter than , the foods will shrink excessively, buckle, or even split.

5000|$|The first {{ingredient}} in the barbecue tradition is the meat. The most widely used meat in most barbecue is pork, particularly the pork ribs, and also the pork shoulder for pulled pork. The techniques used to cook the meat are <b>hot</b> <b>smoking</b> and smoke cooking. These cooking processes are distinct from the cold smoking preservation process. <b>Hot</b> <b>smoking</b> is where the meat is cooked with a wood fire, over indirect heat, at temperatures between 120 and 180 °F (50 and 80 °C), and smoke cooking is cooking over indirect fire at higher temperatures. The long, slow cooking process take hours, as many as 18, and leaves the meat tender and juicy. [...] Characteristically, this process leaves a distinctive line of red just under the surface, where the myoglobin in the meat reacts with carbon monoxide from the smoke, and imparts the smoky taste essential to barbecue.|$|E
