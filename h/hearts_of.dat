Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of Krishna Lila {{is an act of}} remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of para bhakti (supreme devotion).

5|$|Restrictive N-terminal truncation: The {{approximately}} 30 {{amino acids}} N-terminal extension of cTnI is an adult heart-specific structure. The N-terminal extension contains the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23/Ser24 and {{plays a role}} in modulating the overall molecular conformation and function of cTnI. A restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> all vertebrate species examined including human and significantly increases in adaptation to hemodynamic stress and Gsα deficiency-caused failing mouse hearts. Distinct from the harmful C-terminal truncation, the restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI selectively removing the adult heart specific extension forms a regulatory mechanism in cardiac adaptation to physiological and pathological stress conditions.|$|E

During the invasion, Sora obtains a weapon called the Keyblade {{that allows him to}} fight the Heartless. He soon arrives in another world, Traverse Town, where he meets Donald Duck and Goofy, two emissaries from Disney Castle sent to find the Keyblade wielder under orders from their missing king, Mickey Mouse. The three band together and travel to different Disney-themed worlds, sealing the <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> the worlds to prevent more Heartless from devouring the <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> those worlds as they search for their companions. Along the way, they encounter a group of Disney villains led by Maleficent, who are controlling the Heartless to capture seven maidens called the Princesses of Heart, and use their power to open the door to Kingdom Hearts, the heart of all worlds. Though they eventually defeat Maleficent, the three discover a sentient Heartless named Ansem to be the true orchestrator of the worlds' destruction. The three defeat Ansem and seal the door to Kingdom Hearts, but remain separated from Riku and King Mickey while Kairi remains home to await her friends' return.|$|E
