40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} type D <b>enterotoxemias</b> {{have significant}} economic impact by causing rapid death of several domestic animal species. Consequently, domestic animals are commonly vaccinated, at varying efficacy, with inactivated type D vegetative supernatants. Improved type D vaccines might become possible if the lethal toxins produced by type D isolates were characterized and {{the contributions of}} those toxins to supernatant-induced lethality were established. Therefore, the current study evaluated the presence of lethal toxins in supernatants prepared from late-log-phase vegetative cultures of a large collection of genotype D isolates. Under this growth condition, most genotype D isolates produced variable levels {{of at least three}} different lethal toxins, including epsilon-toxin (ETX). To model the rapid lethality of type D <b>enterotoxemias,</b> studies were conducted involving intravenous (i. v.) injection of genotype D vegetative supernatants into mice, which were then observed for neurotoxic distress. Those experiments demonstrated a correlation between ETX (but not alpha-toxin or perfringolysin O) levels in late-log-phase genotype D supernatants and lethality. Consistent with the known proteolytic activation requirement for ETX toxicity, trypsin pretreatment was required for, or substantially increased, the lethality of nearly all of the tested genotype D vegetative supernatants. Finally, the lethality of these trypsin-pretreated genotype D supernatants could be completely neutralized by an ETX-specific monoclonal antibody but not by an alpha-toxin-specific monoclonal antibody. Collectively, these results indicate that, under the experimental conditions used in the present study, ETX is necessary for the lethal properties of most genotype D vegetative supernatants in the mouse i. v. injection model...|$|R

It is well established that the epsilon-toxin structural gene, etx, occurs on large plasmids. We show here {{that at least two}} of these plasmids are conjugative. The etx gene on these plasmids was insertionally inactivated using a chloramphenicol resistance cassette to phenotypically tag the plasmid. High-frequency conjugative transfer of the tagged plasmids into the C. perfringens type A strain JIR 325 was demonstrated, and the resultant transconjugants were shown to act as donors in subsequent mating experiments. We also demonstrated the transfer of “unmarked” native ɛ-toxin plasmids into strain JIR 325 by exploiting the high transfer frequency. The transconjugants isolated in these experiments expressed functional ɛ-toxin since their supernatants had cytopathic effects on MDCK cells and were toxic in mice. Using the widely accepted multiplex PCR approach for toxin genotyping, these type A-derived transconjugants were genotypically type D. These findings have significant implications for the C. perfringens typing system since {{it is based on the}} toxin profile of each strain.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} type B and D strains cause <b>enterotoxemias</b> and enteritis in livestock after proliferating in {{the intestines}} and producing epsilon-toxin (ETX), alpha-toxin (CPA), and, usually, perfringolysin O (PFO). Although ETX {{is one of}} the most potent bacterial toxins, the regulation of ETX production by type B or D strains remains poorly understood. The present work determined that the type D strain CN 3718 upregulates production of ETX upon close contact with enterocyte-like Caco- 2 cells. This host cell-induced upregulation of ETX expression was mediated at the transcriptional level. Using an isogenic agrB null mutant and complemented strain, the agr operon was shown to be required when CN 3718 produces ETX in broth culture or, via a secreted signal consistent with a quorum-sensing (QS) effect, upregulates ETX production upon contact with host cells. These findings provide the first insights into the regulation of ETX production, as well as additional evidence that the Agr-like QS system functions as a global regulator of C.  perfringens toxin production. Since it was proposed previously that the Agr-like QS system regulates C.  perfringens gene expression via the VirS/VirR two-component regulatory system, an isogenic virR null mutant of CN 3718 was constructed to evaluate the importance of VirS/VirR for CN 3718 toxin production. This mutation affected production of CPA and PFO, but not ETX, by CN 3718. These results provide the first indication that C.  perfringens toxin expression regulation by the Agr-like quorum-sensing system may not always act via the VirS/VirR two-component system...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} type C isolates cause <b>enterotoxemias</b> and enteritis {{in humans}} and livestock. While the major disease signs and lesions of type C disease are usually attributed to beta toxin (CPB), these bacteria typically produce several different lethal toxins. Since understanding of disease pathogenesis {{and development of}} improved vaccines is hindered {{by the lack of}} small animal models mimicking the lethality caused by type C isolates, in this study we developed two mouse models of C. perfringens type C-induced lethality. When inoculated into BALB/c mice by intragastric gavage, 7 of 14 type C isolates were lethal, whereas when inoculated intraduodenally, these strains were all lethal in these mice. Clinical signs in intragastrically and intraduodenally challenged mice were similar and included respiratory distress, abdominal distension, and neurological alterations. At necropsy, the small, and occasionally the large, intestine was dilated and gas filled in most mice developing a clinical response. Histological changes in the gut were relatively mild, consisting of attenuation of the mucosa with villus blunting. Inactivation of the CPB-encoding gene rendered the highly virulent type C strain CN 3685 avirulent in the intragastric model and nearly nonlethal in the intraduodenal model. In contrast, inactivation of the genes encoding alpha toxin and perfringolysin O only slightly decreased the lethality of CN 3685. Mice could be protected against lethality by intravenous passive immunization with a CPB antibody prior to intragastric challenge. This study proves that CPB is a major contributor to the systemic effects of type C infections and provides new mouse models for investigating the pathogenesis of type C-induced lethality...|$|R

Predominantly veal calves of beef cattle breeds are affected and losses due to <b>enterotoxemia</b> may account for up to 20 % of total mortality. Clostridium perfringens type A is considered to be the causative agent. Recently, alpha toxin and perfringolysin O have been proposed to play an essential {{role in the development of}} disease. However, other potential virulence factors also may play a role in the pathogenesis of bovine <b>enterotoxemia.</b> The aim of this study was to evaluate whether strains originating from bovine <b>enterotoxemia</b> cases were superior in in vitro production of virulence factors (alpha toxin, perfringolysin O, mucinase, collagenase) that are potentially involved in <b>enterotoxemia.</b> To approach this, a collection of strains originating from <b>enterotoxemia</b> cases was compared to bovine strains isolated from healthy animals and to strains isolated from other animal species. Results: Strains originating from bovine <b>enterotoxemia</b> cases produced variable levels of alpha toxin and perfringolysin O that were not significantly different from levels produced by strains isolated from healthy calves and other animal species. All tested strains exhibited similar mucinolytic activity independent of the isolation source. A high variability in collagenase activity between strains could be observed, and no higher collagenase levels were produced in vitro by strains isolated from <b>enterotoxemia</b> cases.

40|$|The gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium {{perfringens}} {{produces a}} large arsenal of toxins {{that are responsible}} for histotoxic and enteric infections, including <b>enterotoxemias,</b> in humans and domestic animals. C. perfringens type C isolates, which cause rapidly fatal diseases in domestic animals and enteritis necroticans in humans, contain the genes for alpha toxin (plc), perfringolysin O (pfoA), beta toxin (cpb), and sometimes beta 2 toxin (cpb 2) and/or enterotoxin (cpe). Due to the economic impact of type C-induced diseases, domestic animals are commonly vaccinated with crude type C toxoid (prepared from inactivated culture supernatants) or bacterin/toxoid vaccines, and it is not clear which toxin(s) present in these vaccines actually elicits the protective immune response. To improve type C vaccines, {{it would be helpful to}} assess the contribution of each toxin present in type C supernatants to lethality. To address this issue, we surveyed a large collection of type C isolates to determine their toxin-producing abilities. When late-log-phase vegetative culture supernatants were analyzed by quantitative Western blotting or activity assays, most type C isolates produced at least three lethal toxins, alpha toxin, beta toxin, and perfringolysin O, and several isolates also produced beta 2 toxin. In the mouse intravenous injection model, beta toxin was identified as the main lethal factor present in type C late-log-phase culture supernatants. This conclusion was based on monoclonal antibody neutralization studies and regression analyses in which the levels of alpha toxin, beta toxin, perfringolysin O, and beta 2 toxin production were compared with lethality.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} type B or D isolates, {{which cause}} <b>enterotoxemias</b> or enteritis in livestock, produce epsilon toxin (ETX). ETX is exceptionally potent, earning it a listing as a CDC class B select toxin. Most C. perfringens strains also express {{up to three}} different sialidases, although the possible contributions of those enzymes to type B or D pathogenesis remain unclear. Type D isolate CN 3718 was found to carry two genes (nanI and nanJ) encoding secreted sialidases and one gene (nanH) encoding a cytoplasmic sialidase. Construction in CN 3718 of single nanI, nanJ and nanH null mutants, {{as well as a}} nanI/nanJ double null mutant and a triple sialidase null mutant, identified NanI as the major secreted sialidase of this strain. Pretreating MDCK cells with NanI sialidase, or with culture supernatants of BMC 206 (an isogenic CN 3718 etx null mutant that still produces sialidases) enhanced the subsequent binding and cytotoxic effects of purified ETX. Complementation of BMC 207 (an etx/nanH/nanI/nanJ null mutant) showed this effect is mainly attributable to NanI production. Contact between BMC 206 and certain mammalian cells (e. g., enterocyte-like Caco- 2 cells) resulted in more rapid sialidase production and this effect involved increased transcription of BMC 206 nanI gene. BMC 206 was shown to adhere to some (e. g. Caco- 2 cells), but not all mammalian cells, and this effect was dependent upon sialidase, particularly NanI, expression. Finally, the sialidase activity of NanI (but not NanJ or NanH) could be enhanced by trypsin.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} type D isolates {{are important}} in biodefense and also cause natural <b>enterotoxemias</b> in sheep, goats, and occasionally cattle. In these isolates, the gene (etx) encoding ɛ-toxin is thought to reside on poorly characterized large plasmids. Type D isolates sometimes also produce other potentially plasmid-encoded toxins, including C. perfringens enterotoxin and beta 2 toxin, encoded by the cpe and cbp 2 genes, respectively. In the current study we demonstrated that the etx, cpe, and cpb 2 genes are carried on plasmids in type D isolates and characterized the toxin-encoding plasmids to obtain insight into their genetic organization, potential transferability, and diversity. Southern blotting of pulsed-field gels showed that the etx gene of type D isolates can be present on at least five different plasmids, whose sizes range from 48 to 110 kb. The etx plasmids also typically carried IS 1151 and tcp open reading frames (ORFs) known to mediate conjugative transfer of C. perfringens plasmid pCW 3. PCR studies revealed that other than their tcp ORFs, etx plasmids of type D isolates do not carry substantial portions of the conserved or variable regions in the cpe plasmids of type A isolates. Southern blotting also demonstrated that in type D isolates the cpe and cpb 2 genes are sometimes present on the etx plasmid. Collectively, these findings confirmed that the virulence of type D isolates is heavily plasmid dependent and indicated that (i) a single type D isolate can carry multiple virulence plasmids, (ii) a single type D virulence plasmid can carry up to three different toxin genes, and (iii) many etx plasmids should be capable of conjugative transfer...|$|R

In this study, we have compared a commercial multivalent vaccine with native α toxin, formalin-inactivated α toxin, and recombinant C-terminal domain of α toxin as vaccine candidates. The native and recombinant α toxin were capable of stimulating higher levels of immune responses compared with the formalin inactivated α toxin and the multivalent vaccine.

However, this lesion has not been reported in goats. The current paper reports a case of FSE in a goat {{from the state of}} Paraı́ba in the Brazilian semiarid region. As reported by the farmer, 30, 4 – 48 -month-old animals from a flock of 150 goats died after showing nervous signs, including blindness and recumbence, for periods varying between 1 and 14 days. The flock was grazing native pasture supplemented with wheat and corn bran. Additionally, lactating goats were supplemented with soybeans.

40|$|ABSTRACT Clostridium {{perfringens}} vegetative cells cause both histotoxic infections (e. g., gas gangrene) {{and diseases}} {{originating in the}} intestines (e. g., hemorrhagic necrotizing enteritis or lethal <b>enterotoxemia).</b> Despite their medical and veterinary impor-tance, the molecular pathogenicity of C. perfringens vegetative cells causing diseases of intestinal origin remains poorly under-stood. However, C. perfringens beta toxin (CPB) was recently shown to be important when vegetative cells of C. perfringens type C strain CN 3685 induce hemorrhagic necrotizing enteritis and lethal <b>enterotoxemia.</b> Additionally, the VirS/VirR two-component regulatory system was found to control CPB production by CN 3685 vegetative cells during aerobic infection of cul-tured enterocyte-like Caco- 2 cells. Using an isogenic virR null mutant, the current study now reports that the VirS/VirR system also regulates CN 3685 cytotoxicity during infection of Caco- 2 cells under anaerobic conditions, as found in the intestines. More importantly, the virRmutant {{lost the ability to}} cause hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis in rabbit small intestinal loops. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the VirS/VirR systemmediates necrotizing enteritis, at least in part, by controlling in vivo CPB production. In addition, vegetative cells of the isogenic virR null mutant were, relative to wild-type vegetative cells, strongly at-tenuated in their lethality in a mouse <b>enterotoxemia</b> model.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} vegetative cells cause both histotoxic infections (e. g., gas gangrene) {{and diseases}} {{originating in the}} intestines (e. g., hemorrhagic necrotizing enteritis or lethal <b>enterotoxemia).</b> Despite their medical and veterinary importance, the molecular pathogenicity of C.  perfringens vegetative cells causing diseases of intestinal origin remains poorly understood. However, C.  perfringens beta toxin (CPB) was recently shown to be important when vegetative cells of C.  perfringens type C strain CN 3685 induce hemorrhagic necrotizing enteritis and lethal <b>enterotoxemia.</b> Additionally, the VirS/VirR two-component regulatory system was found to control CPB production by CN 3685 vegetative cells during aerobic infection of cultured enterocyte-like Caco- 2 cells. Using an isogenic virR null mutant, the current study now reports that the VirS/VirR system also regulates CN 3685 cytotoxicity during infection of Caco- 2 cells under anaerobic conditions, as found in the intestines. More importantly, the virR mutant {{lost the ability to}} cause hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis in rabbit small intestinal loops. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the VirS/VirR system mediates necrotizing enteritis, at least in part, by controlling in vivo CPB production. In addition, vegetative cells of the isogenic virR null mutant were, relative to wild-type vegetative cells, strongly attenuated in their lethality in a mouse <b>enterotoxemia</b> model. Collectively, these results identify the first regulator of in vivo pathogenicity for C.  perfringens vegetative cells causing disease originating in the complex intestinal environment. Since VirS/VirR also mediates histotoxic infections, this two-component regulatory system now assumes a global role in regulating a spectrum of infections caused by C.  perfringens vegetative cells...|$|E
