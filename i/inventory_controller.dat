40|$|Abstract The {{focus of}} this paper is {{understanding}} the effects of demand forecast error on a tactical decision policy for a single node of a manufacturing supply chain. The demand forecast is treated as an external measured disturbance in a multi-degree-of-freedom feedback-feedforward Internal Model Control (IMC) based inventory control system. Because forecast error will be multifrequency in nature, the effect of error in different frequency regimes is examined. A mathematical framework for evaluating the effect of forecast revisions in an IMC controller is developed. A Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) optimization algorithm is implemented to develop an optimal tuning strategy under these conditions. For the IMC-based <b>inventory</b> <b>controller</b> presented it is concluded that the most desirable performance may be obtained by acting cautiously (e. g. implementing small changes to factory starts) to initial forecasts and gradually becoming more aggressive on starts until the actual demand change is realized.

40|$|The Factory Outlet is one {{of medium}} scale textile shops {{situated}} in Colombo. As {{it does not have}} a computerized Inventory Management System, it finds it difficult to run its business activity effectively and efficiently. In order to provide a solution to the long felt problem of this The Factory Outlet, a project to develop a computerized system has been undertaken. This project includes whole information of the textile Inventory, such as purchase information, stock information, and Distribution information. The main user of this system is <b>Inventory</b> <b>Controller</b> of The Factory Outlet. By implementing a computerized system connected to a database, the staff would be highly supported in their day to day activities. Keeping track of records of all day to day activities done by them. Manipulating and storing data would be maintained through the database. It would facilitate searching the past records and generating the required reports. These facts are carrying out an efficient service with reduction of work load. All the interfaces are user friendly, component based and attractive. Software design technique used for the project is object oriented design as it is a more effective way of producing flexible software. The system will be implemented using the technologies such as C# and Microsoft Access. The ultimate goal of our project is to provide a good, accurate and efficient Inventory Management System with new technologies...|$|E
40|$|An {{approximation}} for the fill rate, i. e. {{the percentage}} of demand being delivered from inventory on hand immediately, is derived for items in a periodic review inventory control system with lost sales. We assume demand is stochastic and discrete, lead-times are positive and replenishments are made in multiples of a given fixed case pack size. Most literature on inventory control systems assumes that unmet demand is backordered. The major {{reason for this is}} that the analysis of a general lost sales inventory system is known to be hard. To find an approximation for the fill rate, given a safety stock, we start with existing analytical approximations. By applying linear regression, we slightly modify these existing approximations. The new approximation is tested for a wide set of parameters and performs very well: the average approximation error for the fill rate is only 0. 0028 and the standard deviation of the approximation error is 0. 0045. Since the approximations are very fast,this result enables <b>inventory</b> <b>controllers</b> dealing with a lost sales inventory system to set safety stocks in accordance with the target service level set by their management in an effectiveway. The results of our study also show that the assumption that the lost sales system can simply be approximated by a backordering system if the target fill rate is at least 95 %, may lead to serious approximation errors. These errors are particularly large when the lead-time is large or demand uncertainty is low and when on average there is at least one replenishment order outstanding...|$|R
40|$|We {{review a}} range of methodological {{approaches}} to solving the bullwhip problem. The bullwhip problem is a dynamic consequence of supply chain structures and replenishment policies. The roles {{of the structure of}} the demand process, the treatment of time (continuous v discrete), forecasting techniques and lead-times will be reviewed. In practice, and in the theory, a variety of techniques have been used to smooth the dynamics of supply chains. These include, the use of sophisticated forecasting, pooling of demand and <b>inventories,</b> proportional feedback <b>controllers</b> and full-state feedback systems. Multi-echelon supply chains also present a number of interesting innovations. From the traditional, arms-length trading relationships, information sharing, vendor managed inventory and echelon stock policies can be developed. More sophisticated collaboration and co-ordination mechanisms may also lead to altruistic behaviour and result in superior performance. The impact of these procedures will be examined. Finally thoughts on new directions in bullwhip research is presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} papers have {{recently}} appeared that investigate the "bullwhip effect" (the variance amplification of ordering {{decisions in the}} supply chain) produced by the order-up-to replenishment policy. An adapted policy, with a proportional <b>inventory</b> position feedback <b>controller,</b> has shown improved "bullwhip" behaviour. The dynamic behaviour of this so-called "proportional order-up-to" policy has been investigated for arbitrary lead-times and several demand models such as i. i. d. demand and autoregressive moving average AR(1) and ARMA(1, 1) models. It has been shown that, for a correct choice of the feedback parameter, the bullwhip effect can always be avoided. However, less attractive properties of this policy have also become clear. Herein, we investigate the behaviour of the proportional order up to policy for ARMA(2, 2) demand with arbitrary lead-times. In order to compensate for possible weaknesses of the proportional OUT policy we propose another replenishment rule that accounts for {{the characteristics of the}} demand in a superior manner. The characteristics of both policies are compared for several parameter settings of the ARMA(2, 2) model. Finally, the consequences of our full-state-feedback order-up-to policy are discussed.

40|$|Reactive {{distillation}} {{has enormous}} {{potential for the}} economical synthesis of tertiary ethers. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) has been commercially produced with this technology since the early 1980 s {{and it appears that}} the process also has application for Ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) and other ethers. However, the combination of reaction and distillation in a single unit operation produces a process complexity that inhibits expeditious design and tight control, and presents a technology risk for potential developers. This particularly applies to hybrid reactive distillation where both reactive and non-reactive column sections are employed. The steady state simulation of a series of reactive distillation columns and processes for the production of ETBE and MTBE illuminated a number of important issues related to the optimal design techniques. Many of these issues are peculiar to reactive distillation and would not reasonably be anticipated without a priori knowledge of the phenomena involved. For example, the addition of theoretical equilibrium stages and an increase in the reflux ratio do not always have a directionally equivalent effect. The trade-off between energy consumption and capital cost which is the basis for most distillation designs cannot always be applied to reactive distillation. Importantly, the use of standard modelling techniques for equilibrium processes was also validated for reactive distillation design. The use of residue curve diagrams and reactive residue curve diagrams for the design of reactive distillation processes was investigated and shown to provide useful information regarding the feasibility of reaction-separations. Combined with simulation tools (e. g. Pro/II and SpeedUp), these techniques form the basis of a proposed design strategy for hybrid reactive distillation. It is important to apply these design tools appropriately and to ++select the correct process for a given application. The optimal design must also consider economics and the relative values of products, reactants and energy. These issues were studied with respect to ETBE production for gasoline oxygenation. The complexity of hybrid reactive distillation not only presents design challenges but potentially makes the process more difficult to control. Dynamic simulations of ETBE and MTBE reactive distillation processes were used to explore some unusual dynamic phenomena and to elucidate the process non-linearity and bidirectionality of reactive distillation. The presence of multiple steady states for some reactive distillation columns has been documented previously but the analysis of this behaviour has been incomplete and somewhat flawed. It was shown that the distinction between molar inputs and physically realisable mass or volumetric inputs is crucial and that multiplicity could be present in one case and not in the other. Multiplicity that is only observed with molar inputs (relatively common) was termed pseudo-multiplicity. Pseudo-multiplicity has few implications for the operation and control of practical reactive distillation processes although most literature examples of multiple steady states fall into this category. Four distinct causes of output multiplicity were identified including one new cause, reaction hysteresis, which is only applicable to hybrid reactive distillation. It was shown, using dynamic simulations, that transitions between parallel steady states are possible for a range of physically realisable and practical disturbances. This contrasts with other work in the area, which examines only unrealisable events and control schemes. An extensive analysis of reactive distillation control was also undertaken with respect to ETBE and MTBE hybrid columns. Manual (open-loop) control was shown to be impractical due to ++the need to sustain the operating conditions at close to the optimal values in order to produce acceptable process performance. One-point composition control was found to be relatively easy to implement and effective with either an energy-balance or a material-balance control scheme provided only one steady state was present. Where multiple steady states exist, there are restrictions on the feasible control structures due to unavoidable instability in the <b>inventory</b> <b>controllers.</b> For example, if multiple steady states exist for the one value of the reboiler duty, only the bottoms product draw rate can be used to control the reboiler sump level. Thus, a material-balance control structure that uses the reboiler duty to control the sump level cannot be implemented in practice. Two-point control was also investigated and found to effectively prevent transitions between parallel steady states. Although more complex and difficult to implement than one-point control, a two-point scheme could be used successfully to control both the product composition and the reactant conversion and this could be desirable in some cases. A reactive distillation pilot plant was designed and operated for ETBE synthesis from ethanol and a locally available refinery hydrocarbon stream. The design of the pilot plant was based on simulation studies and the objective of operating in the industrially significant ranges of product purity and isobutene conversion. A fully automatic control system was designed and installed on the pilot plant to permit precise control of the manipulated variables and the framework to implement a range of control structures and schemes.
