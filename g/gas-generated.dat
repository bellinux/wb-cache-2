Learning rates are presented for nuclear power in seven countries, comprising 58 % of all power reactors ever built globally. Learning rates and deployment rates changed in the late- 1960 s and 1970 s from rapidly falling costs and accelerating deployment to rapidly rising costs and stalled deployment. Historical nuclear global capacity, electricity generation and overnight construction costs are compared with the counterfactual that pre-disruption learning and deployment rates had continued to 2015. Had the early rates continued, nuclear power could now be around 10 % of its current cost.

In previous work a whole range of possibly suitable single compounds, such as sodium azide, double base propellant, azodicarbonamide, guanidine derivatives and azole derivatives were studied. These compounds - whether or not stoichiometrically mixed with an oxidizer (e. g. KNO 3, KClO 4 or NH 4 NO 3) - were theoretically and experimentally examined in order to evaluate their combustion properties. The objective of this work is to experimentally investigate the influence of the particle size of an oxidizer on the combustion behavior of a <b>gas-generating</b> pyrotechnic mixture. As an example a series of nitroguanidine (NQ) /potassium nitrate (KNO 3) -mixtures with well-defined KNO 3 -particle size fractions are selected. Raman spectroscopy is used to examine the constituent distribution within the bulk and thus the mixing efficiency. Closed vessel tests are used to experimentally compare ignition delay, burning rate, dynamic vivacity, and yield of gas. ne composition of the combustion gases is examined through gas analysis. The experiments show that a decrease of the particle size of the KNO 3 -particles has a positive influence on the mixing efficiency and on the investigated combustion properties of a NQ/KNO 3 -composition. The combustion process of this mixture becomes better controllable when a small KNO 3 -particle size fraction is selected, but its combustion behavior is comparable to that of a NQ/KNO 3 -mixture containing a broad KNO 3 -particle size distribution. status: publishe...|$|R
