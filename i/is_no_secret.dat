But history cannot be rewritten, however much we might sometimes wish otherwise. It has its moments of sadness, as well as gladness. We must learn from the sadness and build on the gladness.|$|E

500|$|Former prime ministerial adviser Sanjaya Baru {{published}} a book titled [...] in which he criticised Singh for not being [...] "fully in charge of his government in having {{to compete with the}} dynastic INC leader, Sonia Gandhi, for influence within his own cabinet." [...] Singh's office retorted in saying it is [...] "smacks of fiction and coloured views of a former adviser." [...] After Baru said [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Sonia Gandhi was the super prime minister," [...] Priyanka Vadra replied [...] "I think Manmohan Singh ji is the super PM." [...] The opposition targeted Sonia Gandhi {{on the basis of this}} book.|$|E

500|$|In its October 8, 1945, issue, The New Republic {{took the}} position, {{emphasized}} with italics, that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> to be kept": {{the knowledge of}} how to build an atomic bomb had been [...] "the common property of scientists throughout the world for the last five years". President Harry S. Truman took a similar line in his first speech to Congress on nuclear matters that month, proclaiming that [...] "the essential theoretical knowledge upon which the discovery is based is already widely known." [...] In November 1945, Groves instructed Tolman to draw up a policy for the declassification of the Manhattan Project's documents. Tolman assembled a committee, which took a list of the Manhattan Project's activities and assigned each a classification. Four reviewers assessed the documents and declassified about 500 of them {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{hoped that}} a {{cancellation}} of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference. Describing the event as the [...] "most crucial gathering since Versailles", Time magazine featured Chamberlain on its cover, referring to him as [...] "that mighty mover behind British Cabinet scenes, lean, taciturn, iron-willed... It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Scot MacDonald remains Prime Minister by Prime Mover Chamberlain's leave." [...] The Conference came to nothing, when US President Franklin Roosevelt sent word {{that he would not}} consider any war debt cancellation. After the US Congress passed the Johnson Act, forbidding loans to nations in default on their debts, Chamberlain felt that Britain could not pay the entire debt, and, as the Act made no distinction between a partial and complete default, the Chancellor entirely suspended Britain's war debt payments to the US.|$|E
500|$|Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature {{magazine}} {{noted the}} intimacy {{featured in the}} track despite its anthemic quality. She considered it [...] "a major leap forward in terms of Jared Leto's song writing", saying that the lyrics [...] "lay the often enigmatic frontman bare" [...] as he pays homage to Los Angeles. She also felt that [...] "Leto's love of U2 <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> and displayed to full effect in this uplifting song with the piano, electronics, vocals and drums all weaving together effortlessly." [...] In a mixed review, John Watt from Drowned in Sound called it a [...] "soulless slab of soft-rock". Brent Faulkner from PopMatters wrote that the song [...] "isn't too shabby, filled with minimalistic ideas and pummeling drums." [...] Chris Maguire of AltSounds criticized the influences of U2 featured in the track, while Andy Baber from musicOMH called it a [...] "corny ballad" [...] which makes Thirty Seconds to Mars a [...] "love-them-or-hate-them band". Writers of 91X named [...] "City of Angels" [...] the 33rd best song of 2013.|$|E

500|$|On 16 May 2011, Brodie {{signed for}} Conference Premier club Fleetwood Town on loan for 2011–12 for a five-figure loan fee. Homesickness was {{cited as the}} reason for the transfer, with manager Evans saying [...] "Richard is a very talented lad but it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> he has failed to settle away from his family home". Brodie debuted as a 54th-minute {{substitute}} for Magno Vieira in Fleetwood's 2–0 away win over Grimsby on 13 August 2011. His first goal for Fleetwood was the team's fifth goal in a 5–2 home victory over Kidderminster on 20 September 2011. Brodie's sixth goal for Fleetwood came on 26 December 2011 against Southport, when he scored a late equaliser in the 88th minute to make the score 2–2 in front of 3,029 supporters, a record home league attendance for Fleetwood. He scored twice during the away league match against the same club on 1 January 2012, the first coming after just four minutes and the second coming in the 29th minute, which made the score 3–0 to Fleetwood. Two minutes after scoring his second goal Brodie was sent off after receiving a second yellow card, although his team {{went on to win the}} match 6–0. He made 39 appearances and scored 10 goals in 2011–12 and won his second Conference Premier winner's medal in as many seasons, as Fleetwood won the title and therefore promotion into League Two.|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, [...] "It is {{flawlessly}} crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well." [...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received [...] "two thumbs up" [...] and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as [...] "a glorious Hollywood epic" [...] and [...] "well worth the wait," [...] and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio [...] "captivating". James Berardinelli stated, [...] "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic {{is the kind of}} epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it." [...] It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that [...] "the sinking of the great ship <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret,</b> yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy" [...] and that [...] "when you consider that [...] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, [...] "To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner {{is one of the most}} magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1951, Foley {{was pleased}} when the popular Andrews Sisters (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) flew from Hollywood to Nashville {{to join him}} for a two-day {{recording}} session, both acts hoping to repeat the previous successes that the sisters enjoyed when they teamed with Burl Ives in 1947 and Ernest Tubb in 1949, producing both folk and country hits. While the results proved to be less popular, the ten tunes recorded were vocally well-executed and received {{a good deal of}} play on the country radio stations. The songs included the rhythmic [...] "Satins and Lace," [...] the rockabilly-flavored novelty [...] "Where Is Your Wandering Mother Tonight?," [...] a very slow rendering of the forlorn hillbilly classic [...] "Bury Me Beneath the Willow," [...] two duets by Foley and Patty Andrews, and two country gospel favorites: [...] "It <b>Is</b> <b>No</b> <b>Secret</b> (What God Can Do)" [...] and [...] "He Bought My Soul at Calvary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then Guardian {{features}} editor Ian Katz asserted in 2004 that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> {{we are a}} centre-left newspaper". In 2008, Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley {{said that}} editorial contributors were a mix of [...] "right-of-centre libertarians, greens, Blairites, Brownites, Labourite but less enthusiastic Brownites, etc," [...] and that the newspaper was [...] "clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive". She also said that [...] "you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election, The Guardian stance will not be dictated by the editor, still less any foreign proprietor (it helps that there isn't one) but will {{be the result of}} vigorous debate within the paper". The paper's comment and opinion pages, though often written by centre-left contributors such as Polly Toynbee, have allowed some space for right-of-centre voices such as Sir Max Hastings and Michael Gove. Since an editorial in 2000, The Guardian has favoured abolition of the British monarchy. [...] "I write for the Guardian," [...] said Max Hastings in 2005, [...] "because it is read by the new establishment," [...] reflecting the paper's then-growing influence.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Condoleezza Rice criticized Spain for {{not doing}} more to support dissidents in {{communist}} Cuba. American officials were irked {{by the fact that}} Miguel Ángel Moratinos, Minister of Foreign Affairs, chose not to meet with Cuban dissidents during a visit to the United States in April 2007. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that we have had differences with Spain on a number of issues, but we have also had very good cooperation with Spain on a number of issues", Rice remarked. Moratinos defended his decision, believing it better to engage with the Cuban regime than by isolating it. [...] "The U.S. established its embargo", he remarked. [...] "We don't agree with it but we respect it. What we hope is that they respect our policy", Moratinos remarked. [...] "What Spain is not prepared to do is be absent from Cuba. And what the U.S. has to understand is that, given they have no relations with Cuba, they should trust in a faithful, solid ally like Spain." [...] On the relationship between Cuba and Spain, Daniel Fried, U.S. Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, has commented in 2007 that: ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2013, {{rumors of}} a reunion began as the band posted a photo on their {{official}} Facebook page with the caption [...] "What's going on here...?" [...] Woomble, Jones and Newton were tagged in the photo of a recording/rehearsal studio. On 5 November, Roddy Woomble confirmed that the band {{were in the process}} of writing a new album, stating: [...] "I have been getting asked about this a lot recently, and it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Idlewild are making a new album (There are some photographs of a recent writing session in a Hebridean cabin up on the Idlewild facebook page) it is being written and recorded slowly and intermittently, and I have no idea when it’ll be done. Not for a while. I’m just enjoying the process. It is always great to work with Rod and Colin, we have been making up songs together since 1995 – not far off 20 years! Gareth and Allan have not been involved much so far due to both their other touring commitments, but they will be in time, as will others." [...] In January 2014 the band started recording their next studio effort and had two 'live' dates, one at Musicport. Through his blog Roddy Woomble revealed that Gareth Russell had left the band back in 2013 and Lucci Rossi had joined the band as new bassist.|$|E
2500|$|German {{chancellor}} Angela Merkel {{has repeatedly}} opposed full membership of Turkey to the EU on German-Turkish summits, advocating instead a privileged partnership. Some Christian Democrats back fuller support for Turkey, risking the chancellor becoming more isolated in advocating for a [...] "privileged partnership". In September 2011, {{on the occasion}} of the visit of the Turkish president Gül, Merkel said: [...] "We don't want the full membership of Turkey. But we don't want to lose Turkey as an important country", referring to her idea of a strategic partnership. In 2006, Chancellor Merkel said [...] "Turkey could be in deep, deep trouble when it comes to its aspirations to join the European Union" [...] regarding its refusal to open up its ports to European Union member Cyprus. Again in 2014, when Erdogan urged Merkel to strongly support his country's bid, there was no sign the chancellor had relinquished her skepticism. She revealed after the two had talked: [...] "I personally said that we are in a negotiation process that has certain outcome and no fixed time frame. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> and nothing has changed in my view that I am sceptical about full membership for Turkey." [...] In a TV debate in September 2017, German chancellor Angela Merkel and her challenger Martin Schulz both said that they would seek an end to Turkey’s membership talks with the European Union.|$|E
