We were all {{struggling}} to find our chemistry together, and as a result, the experience of making and promoting this was tense and unenjoyable. Ironically, our shows were selling out every night. But after a while, {{we decided that we}} needed to go home to lick our wounds." ...|$|E
500|$|Knowles's debut {{extended}} play True is a {{new wave}} album with Knowles stating, [...] "This is a dance record, but the lyrics can <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> dark at times." [...] Knowles described the EP as [...] "eclectic with 1980s references and African percussion influences." [...] Sonically the extended play {{is influenced by the}} keyboard sounds and beats of early 1980s pop and R music. The extended play was recorded in five cities including Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Houston, New York, and on the German autobahn.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Vibe on July 7, 2010, Knowles said she suffered [...] "a {{little bit of a}} breakdown" [...] while recording her new album: [...] "I literally gave up my sanity for a while to do this record. [...] We literally were waking {{up in the morning and}} just making music all day and all night. [...] It just started to wear on me in so many different ways. I started having these crazy panic attacks." [...] Knowles explained how she made sacrifices [...] "mentally, emotionally and financially", and continued, [...] "It's more than an album to me. It's a transitional time in my life." [...] Regarding the musical direction of the album, she said the inspiration came from new wave and stated, [...] "This is a dance record, but the lyrics can <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> dark at times." ...|$|E

500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Wired writer Nate Ralph {{found that}} [...] "Bloody Fun Day might not feature a deep or even logical narrative, but it's got style in spades, bolstered by simple, fun game mechanics." [...] He {{added that the}} {{increased}} amount of turns needed to hatch eggs [...] "can lead to some delightfully irritating close shaves." [...] IndieGames.com writer Michael Rose agreed, stating [...] "The game mechanics work really well and it's a very nice concept." [...] Anthony Carboni, a former co-host of Attack of the Show! and current presenter of online video game review show Bytejacker, was also positive. In his review he said [...] "It's {{a lot of fun}} and easy to pick up, but as levels progress things do <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> intense." [...] Zenko stated the game embodied three virtues; [...] "simple, hot and deep". These virtues were required in games published by Electronic Arts, which had been outlined to Zenko in a letter from Electronic Arts' founder Trip Hawkins after Zenko had written to Hawkins as a teenager. During play Zenko's reaper almost died {{due to a lack of}} red souls, but he managed to reverse the situation and fill the life bar; [...] "even after all these years of gaming, that rush still does its neurochemical work".|$|E
500|$|Brian Michael Bendis, {{writer for}} the series, said in an {{interview}} he was [...] "honored" [...] to add to the Halo lore. He noted that the graphic novel brought [...] "humanity and perspective" [...] to the franchise, something not easily imparted through the games. Bendis described himself as a longtime player of Halo and had [...] "done [...] Halo homework", reading and playing everything Halo. Bendis stated that Bungie was open to the Marvel team exploring lesser-known elements of the Halo universe or even bringing up new ideas, as opposed to sticking to a script or set of preplanned ideas from Bungie or Microsoft. The Philadelphia Daily News suggested that a Halo comic book would attract readers who had never picked up a comic book before. Bendis said that drawing casual gamers to the comics was a major goal for the series. While using established characters meant that Bendis had to cooperate with Bungie and Microsoft, {{he said he did not}} feel it was a restriction. [...] "You can <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> bloated and sloppy with total autonomy all the time." [...] The Bungie team allowed Bendis to explore lesser known areas of the Halo story, which he enjoyed. Writing the dialogue for the Master Chief, who is faceless and normally silent during gameplay, was a challenge; Bendis scrapped much of the drafted dialogue to allow Maleev's work to define the character.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, {{the band}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour. On March 13, 1992, at the Munich, Germany show at Nachtwerk, Pearl Jam played Ten in its entirety in order midway through its set. The band would only do this again in 2016 at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center, as the arena management homaged the band's tenth straight sellout concert in the city. Following the European leg, Pearl Jam did another tour of North America. Goldstone noted that the band's audience expanded, saying that unlike before, [...] "everyone came." [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening {{and there was no}} stopping it. To play in the Midwest and be selling out these 500 seat clubs. Eddie could say he wanted to talk to Brett, the sound guy, and they'd carry him out there on their hands. You hadn't really seen that reaction from a crowd before..." [...] When Pearl Jam came back for a second go-around in Europe the band appeared at the Pinkpop Festival and the Roskilde Festival in June 1992. The band cancelled its remaining European dates in the summer of 1992 after the Roskilde Festival due to a confrontation with security at that event as well as exhaustion from touring. Ament said, [...] "We'd been on the road over 10 months. I think there just came a point about half way through that tour it was just starting to <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> intense. I mean just being away from home, being on the road all the time and being lonely or being depressed or whatever." [...] The band would go on to play the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, Ministry and Ice Cube, among others.|$|E
500|$|When {{the band}} {{completed}} writing and recording demos for the songs, the three headed to Los Angeles to record drum tracks at Chick Corea's Mad Hatter Studios in January 1999. Barker recorded {{the majority of}} his drum tracks in eight hours. The recording process for the album was completed over a period of four months, and production was handled at several production facilities in southern California, including Signature Sound and Studio West in San Diego, Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, and Conway Recording Studios and The Bomb Factory in Los Angeles. For Barker, the album was [...] "fueled by black coffee and Marlboro Lights"; he was hopeful for the album as the band were well-rehearsed and no time would be wasted. To record Enema of the State, Blink-182 turned to punk rock producer Jerry Finn, who previously worked on Green Day's breakthrough album, Dookie (1994). Hoppus and DeLonge were impressed with his work when they recorded [...] "Mutt" [...] for its placement on the American Pie soundtrack. Finn was harder on the trio to record better takes, and Hoppus credited Finn with knowing a great deal about punk rock music, but also helping the band establish a more pop-inspired sound. Finn came with an array of amps, effects and equipments; previously the band were forced to rent such equipment. Barker kept attempting to irritate Finn by sneaking in vibraslaps, which Finn hated. In addition, the band had so much fun with Finn that there were days when very little work was accomplished: [...] "Recording can <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> monotonous, but at least we could laugh with Jerry," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "A pretty typical day would involve multiple takes for one part of one song, and then everyone would get naked and jump on Jerry." [...] The band chose [...] "never to work with anyone else again," [...] and Finn would produce their next three releases.|$|E

[...] "We have not picked any banker and we have not picked any partner," [...] Pickens said. [...] "It is kind of nice ... I have decided I can <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> far down the track before having to make those choices." [...] Pickens predicted that similar wind farm projects could be built in the Texas Panhandle and the Canada–US border in the future.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller {{scored the}} game 7.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "a basic action {{game with a}} heavy dose of button mashing {{and a little bit of}} task management." [...] Finding the combat repetitive, he argued, [...] "even with the rage moves the combat can <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> dull after a while." [...] He was also {{critical}} of the graphics, writing [...] "detail is sometimes sacrificed to achieve that nice frame rate. The character models are blocky, and they don't animate particularly well. Additionally, all the textures are fuzzy and bland." [...] He concluded, [...] "Spartan: Total Warrior is a pretty fun, though derivative, action game that should keep you entertained for at least the six or seven hours it takes you to get through the story. With just a bit more effort, Spartan could have been great." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he and}} {{his crew}} do some {{research}} with regard to depicting societies, such as the Grounders, within the series, but most of what is shown is based on his personal tastes. He enjoys the world-building aspect the most. [...] "Getting to create this universe from the language to the wardrobe to the tattoos ... we obviously <b>get</b> <b>pretty</b> deep into what the grounder spirituality is and means," [...] he stated. [...] "All of that is pretty awesome. So yes, we do some research as to how societies have evolved in the past {{but for the most part}} it's fiction." [...] Rothenberg said there are more than just men writing the show; there are several women [...] "writing hardcore sci-fi." [...] In 2015, two commander jackets were described as being [...] "made out of leather, metal, and fur". Debnam-Carey felt that the Grounder culture—the language, wardrobe, makeup and [...] "all the symbolic meaning behind that"—was [...] "one of the highlights" [...] for her. [...] "We explored it as much as we could as actors to break down its meaning, but the best thing about this was finally finding out all this backstory and fully creating this world," [...] she stated, adding they [...] "had three sets built just for the Grounders".|$|E
