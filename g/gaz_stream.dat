40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to develop polysaccharide nanoparticles for antigen delivery (proteins, peptides, DNA). In this case the particles ensure the transport {{and the protection of}} protein or nucleic acid. The chitosan is a biocompatible, biodegradable and nontoxic polymer, its immunostimulation and mucoadhesive properties were also recognized and makes it very interesting for biomedical applications. Polysaccharide colloids were obtained without cross-linker via a novel process using only pharmacologically accepted compounds. Chitosan physical hydrogels were formed within aqueous droplets dispersed in an oil. The emulsification was carried out by ultrasounds and the dispersed chitosan aqueous phase was gelated by an ammonia <b>gaz</b> <b>stream.</b> After several centrifugation/washings cycles, nanoparticles were collected and characterized, then the immobilization of proteins at their surface was carried out.
