500|$|... the indie {{rock band}} Guillemots have {{recorded}} more than 80 songs for their four studio albums and other official releases. The band {{was formed in}} November 2004, with their first official material being I Saw Such Things <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Sleep,</b> an extended play (EP) released in September 2005. The EP contained four songs, including [...] "Made-Up Lovesong #43", a track that would also feature on their first studio album, Through the Windowpane. The release of I Saw Such Things <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Sleep</b> was followed three months later by Guillemots' debut single, [...] "Trains to Brazil". Like [...] "Made-Up Lovesong #43", it was also included on Through the Windowpane, which was released in July 2006. The album's songs were well received by critics: review aggregator Metacritic gave the record a score of 81 out of 100, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Craig McLean of The Observer described them as [...] "gorgeous tunes that are lithe enough {{to cope with the}} little bursts of sonic madness". Two additional tracks were released as singles from the album: [...] "We're Here" [...] and [...] "Annie, Let's Not Wait".|$|E

2500|$|Rosenzweig's final {{attempt to}} {{communicate}} his thought, via the laborious typewriter-alphabet method, consisted in the partial sentence: [...] "And now it comes, {{the point of}} all points, which the Lord has truly revealed to me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>sleep,</b> the point of all points for which there—". The writing was interrupted by his doctor, {{with whom he had}} a short discussion using the same method. When the doctor left, Rosenzweig did not wish to continue with the writing, and he died on the night of December 10, 1929, in Frankfurt, the sentence left unfinished.|$|E
2500|$|Templer {{remained}} with the battalion until mid-October 1917 when, now aged 19, {{he was sent}} to the 7th/8th (Service) Battalion on the Western Front. The battalion was a Kitchener's Army unit serving as part of the 49th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division. However, he was posted to 'C' Company of the 1st Battalion in mid-November a Regular Army unit, then serving in the 107th Brigade of the 36th (Ulster) Division. Soon after Templer's arrival, the battalion took part in the Battle of Cambrai in late November, although Templer himself took no part in the battle and the battalion, and his 'C' Company in particular, sustained heavy losses. In early February 1918 Templer's battalion, the 1st Irish Fusiliers, was transferred to the 108th Brigade, due to a severe manpower shortage in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, which necessitated the reduction of all British brigades from four to three battalions. He was promoted to lieutenant on 16 February 1918. On 20 March Templer, seriously ill, passed out while in the trenches, suffering from acute diphtheria, and he was later evacuated to England. The German Army launched their Spring Offensive the day after and, while he was away his battalion sustained over 770 casualties out of a strength of some 800 men. He returned to the battalion in , now composed of mainly teenagers, and fought with it in the Hundred Days Offensive, which saw the war turn in favour of the Allies and eventually resulted in the Armistice with Germany being signed and the war ending on 11 November 1918. Templer was considerably lucky during the war, having not been wounded, although, as with many others of his generation, it left its mark on him in other ways. He wrote, many years later, [...] "I still sometimes <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>sleep</b> at night hear the screams of the wounded horses, galloping on the ground, tripping over barbed wire, and treading on their own guts. It was a terrible thing to have to witness, worse in some ways than the human casualties". A week before his death Templer had this dream again, over sixty years after the war.|$|E

60|$|Apart {{from the}} {{tendency}} to trance, however, my general health appeared to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one prevalent malady--unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ordinary <b>sleep</b> may be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity;--the mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a condition of absolute abeyance.|$|R

6000|$|But oh, the English {{comfort of}} those beds! How did Lankin manage in his, with his great long legs? How did I toss and tumble in mine; which, small as it was, I was not destined to enjoy alone, but {{to pass the}} night in company with anthropophagous wretched reptiles, who took their horrid meal off an English Christian! I thought the morning would never come; and when the tardy dawn at length arrived, and as I was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> first <b>sleep,</b> dreaming of Miss Fanny, behold I was wakened up by the Serjeant, already dressed and shaven, and who said, [...] "Rise, Titmarsh, the steamer will be here in three-quarters of an hour."

60|$|Well do I {{remember}} {{the first time in my}} waking life that I saw an oak tree.

60|$|It {{would be}} better, I dare say, {{for you to}} make your approach, as I made mine, through my childhood. As a boy I was very like other boys--in my waking hours. It was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>sleep</b> that I was different. From my {{earliest}} recollection my sleep was a period of terror. Rarely were my dreams tinctured with happiness. As a rule, they were stuffed with fear--and with a fear so strange and alien that it had no ponderable quality. No fear that I experienced in my waking life resembled the fear that possessed me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>sleep.</b> It was of a quality and kind that transcended all my experiences.|$|E

6000|$|That night I hardly closed <b>my</b> eyes <b>in</b> <b>sleep.</b> <b>My</b> leg, {{which for}} several days had {{scarcely}} pained me, became troublesome once more {{with a sort of}} violent twitching neuralgic rheumatism. Never before had I felt anything so curiously spasmodic. I had tossed about during the evening indeed a great deal more than usual, and Kalaua, who noted my discomfort with his keen and observant Hawaiian glance, asked me more than once how I felt, with apparent kindliness.
