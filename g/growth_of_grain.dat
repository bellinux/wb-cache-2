40|$|Microstructural {{and texture}} {{evolution}} during grain growth in polycrystalline thin films was investigated. Grain growth in thin films is a coarsening process {{driven by the}} reduction <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundary energy, surface energies, and strain energy density. Because crystal properties can be anisotropic, grain growth in thin films is an orientation selective process. Surface and interfacial energy minimization or reduction favors the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> with low combined surface and interfacial free energy. For the films and substrates investigated in this thesis, surface and interfacial energy promotes the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> (111) -textured <b>grains.</b> Thin films on thick substrates are usually subjected to a non-zero state of strain, arising from differential thermal expansion between the film and the substrate, from densification and from intrinsic strains. For elastically deformed fcc metal films, strain energy density promotes the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> (001) -textured <b>grains.</b> In plastically deformed films, strain energy density can favor the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> (011) -textured grains; this results from the orientation dependence of the yield stress <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> in thin films. (111) grains are predicted to maximize the yield stress, and (011) grains are predicted to have low yield stress. An analytic model for texture evolution during grain growth in thin films can be developed by equating the magnitudes of the orientation-dependent driving forces, for pairs of orientations. Th...|$|R

The results are applied to the condensation in the primordial solar nebula. It is shown how the picture based on the chemical equilibrium calculations should be modified.

50|$|The {{bond coat}} adheres the {{thermal barrier coating}} to the {{superalloy}} substrate. Additionally, the bond coat provides oxidation protection and functions as a diffusion barrier against the motion of substrate atoms towards the environment.There are five major types of bond coats, the aluminides, the platinum-aluminides, MCrAlY, cobalt-cermets, and nickel-chromium.For the aluminide bond coatings, the final composition {{and structure of the}} coating depends on the composition of the substrate. Aluminides also lack ductility below 750 °C, and exhibit a limited by thermomechanical fatigue strength. The Pt-aluminides are very similar to the aluminide bond coats except for a layer of Pt (5—10 μm) deposited on the blade. The Pt is believed to aid in oxide adhesion and contributes to hot corrosion. The cost of Pt plating is justified by the increased blade life span. The MCrAlY is the latest generation of bond coat and does not strongly interact with the substrate. Normally applied by plasma spraying, MCrAlY coatings are secondary aluminum oxide formers. This means that the coatings form an outer layer of chromium oxide (chromia), and a secondary aluminum oxide (alumina) layer underneath. These oxide formations occur at high temperatures in the range of those that superalloys usually encounter. The chromia provides oxidation and hot-corrosion resistance. The alumina controls oxidation mechanisms by limiting oxide growth by self-passivating. The yttrium enhances the oxide adherence to the substrate, and limits the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries (which can lead to flaking of the coating). Investigation indicates that addition of rhenium and tantalum increases oxidation resistance. Cobalt-cermet based coatings consisting of materials such as tungsten carbide/cobalt can be used due to excellent resistance to abrasion, corrosion, erosion, and heat. These cermet coatings perform well in situations where temperature and oxidation damage are significant concerns, such as boilers. One of the unique advantages of cobalt cermet coatings is a minimal loss of coating mass over time, due to the strength of carbides within the mixture. Overall, cermet coatings are useful in situations where mechanical demands are equal to chemical demands for superalloys. Nickel-chromium coatings are used most frequently in boilers fed by fossil fuels, electric furnaces, and waste incineration furnaces, where the danger of oxidizing agents and corrosive compounds in the vapor must be dealt with. The specific method of spray-coating depends on the composition of the coatings. Nickel-chromium coatings that also contain iron or aluminum perform much better (in terms of corrosion resistance) when they are sprayed and laser glazed, while pure nickel-chromium coatings perform better when thermally sprayed exclusively.|$|E
