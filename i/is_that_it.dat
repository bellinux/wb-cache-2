5|$|A {{characteristic}} that distinguishes Cetiosauriscus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has axially concave summits on the cranial and middle caudal neural spines.

5|$|A {{popular and}} more recent {{explanation}} for the Loch Ness monster among believers <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> belongs to a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs, but the kelpie myth still survives in children's books such as Mollie Hunter's The Kelpie's Pearls (1966) and Dick King-Smith's The Water Horse (1990).|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E

5|$|When Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814, {{he learned}} of several {{traditional}} tales relating to the area and the clan. He <b>was</b> told <b>that</b> the Fairy Flag had three magical properties. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> multiplied {{the number of men}} upon a battlefield. The second <b>was</b> <b>that</b> when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> spread upon a nuptial bed, it ensured fertility. The third <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> brought herring into the loch.|$|R
5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> occasionally catches small monkeys {{and other large}} animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E
5|$|Brownhills is {{situated}} on the ancient Watling Street and {{there is evidence of}} early settlement in the area, including an ancient burial mound and a guard post believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle. The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular suggestion for the origin of the name <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> refers to the early mining spoil heaps which dotted the area.|$|E
5|$|Cats do eat grass occasionally. A {{proposed}} {{explanation is}} that cats use grass {{as a source of}} folic acid.

5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{theories}} {{explaining the}} origin of this lake have been formulated. One version <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the remnants of a post-glacial lake, which has undergone drastic changes in size over the years and the other theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is of fluvial origin from an old flood spill channel or ox-bows of the Jhelum River. The dendritic drainage pattern of the catchment signifies that its rock strata have low levels of porosity. Lithologically, a variety of rock types have been discerned namely, igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. The Dachigam Telbal Nallah system is conjectured to follow two major lineaments. Discontinuous surfaces seen in the terrain are attributed to the angular and parallel drainage pattern. The water table cuts the hill slopes, which is evidenced by the occurrence of numerous springs in the valley. Seismic activity in the valley is recorded under Zone V of the Seismic Zoning Map of India, the most severe zone where frequent damaging earthquakes of intensity IX could be expected. In the year 2005, Kashmir valley experienced one of the severe earthquakes measured at 7.6 on the Richter's scale, which resulted in deaths and the destruction of many properties, leaving many homeless.|$|E

5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E

5|$|The {{alternative}} {{train of}} thought <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was simply not advantageous to be large until {{the appearance of the}} Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms. But for large size never to be favourable, the environment would have to be very different indeed.|$|E
5|$|The breed's {{history is}} {{uncertain}} before {{the middle of}} the 19th century. One theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> originated in France, stating that the Duc de Noailles {{at the time of the}} French Revolution gave his kennel of prized spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. The theory goes, that the now extinct Alpine Spaniel was bred with Basset Hounds, and the Pyrenean Mountain Dog also known as the Great Pyrenees. A second theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is descended from the old type of Bleinheim Spaniel, which was later to be incorporated into the King Charles breed of Spaniel. Originally these dogs were large gundogs, colored lemon and white whereas the modern breed of them is a much smaller lap/toy breed of dog.|$|E
5|$|The frailty of the {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> implies that God, a being which does not suffer from transworld depravity by the assumption of omnibenevolence, is unable to recreate a transworld-depravity-free being, which is seemingly contradictory to the assumption of omnipotence.|$|E

40|$|This report briefly {{presents}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of two timed sources of neutrons <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> used with the source-driven noise analysis method: (1) {sup 252 }Cf in an ionization chamber and (2) an associated-particle sealed tube neutron generator (APSTNG). These sources can be used with frequency and time analysis methods for nuclear weapons identification, quality assurance in production, special nuclear materials assay, criticality safety, and provision of measured data for verification of neutron and gamma ray transport calculational methods. The advantages of {sup 252 }Cf for a nuclear materials identification system <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simple, reliable, and small and that all source events are detected. The disadvantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot <b>be</b> turned off, leads to small radiation doses in handling, and produces more than one neutron per fission event. The advantages of APSTNG <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> directional, can be turned off, and has one particle per deuterium-tritium reaction. The disadvantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> large and complicated compared to {sup 252 }Cf...|$|R
