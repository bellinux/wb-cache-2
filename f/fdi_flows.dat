40|$|This study empirically {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Nigeria during 1970 - 2006. This study suggests that the endowment of natural resources, trade intensity, macroeconomic risk factors like inflation and exchange rates are significant determinants of <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> to Nigeria. The findings also suggest that in long run market size is not the significant factor for attracting FDI to Nigeria, it contradicts the existing literature. Our results indicate that <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> to Nigeria is resource-seeking FDI.

40|$|In this paper, {{the impact}} of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on {{agricultural}} productivity and poverty reduction are examined. Factors that hinder <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> to agriculture in Tanzania are assessed. Specifically, the role of FDI in improving an agricultural firm’s efficiency in Tanzania and reforms required for more effective investment promotion in agriculture are examined. The study uses literature review to draw its conclusions and policy recommendations. It is observed that FDI has {{a positive impact on}} productivity especially to smallholder farmers who are linked in integrated producer schemes. The study recommends rethinking of the smallholder institutional setup for increasing productivity and <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> to the agricultural sector. An important implication of the results is that FDI to Tanzania and specifically to agriculture, has a much more far- reaching economic and social impact than in other sectors. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} carried out to {{establish}} the possible factors that determine the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment into the Sudan. Using OLS and annual time series data for the period 1980 to 2011, the study established that variables that determine inflow of FDI both in the long-run and short-run for the Sudan are the market size {{and the level of}} development. While infrastructure development and financial sector development have been the determining factors for the <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> to the country in the long-run, they do not posses any effect on the <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> into the country in the short-run. Additionally, inflation as a proxy for macroeconomic instability and openness of the economy to the out side world have been effective in determining the inflow of the FDI to the Sudan in the short-run but do not have any impact on the <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> to the country in the long run. The ECM term in the short-run dynamics shows that FDI was above its equilibrium value and has been moving downwards towards its equilibrium value, however, with low speed of adjustment towards its equilibrium value. As much as the study succeeded in attaining its objectives, the study suffers from lack of data for some variables and this has reduced the findings of the study. Additionally, with the break away of southern part of the country (now South Sudan), coupled with the civil war in the country, Sudan is likely to lose out foreign investors...|$|R
40|$|Inward {{foreign direct}} {{investment}} (FDI) represents {{an integral part of}} the U. S. economy. The flow of international capital has been a key factor expanding economy. The inward U. S. FDI constitutes important factor contributing to output growth in the U. S. economy. This paper investigates factors affecting the inward <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> among fifty states of the United States. The analysis uses annual data for the period from 1997 to 2007. The study identifies several state-specific determinants of FDI and investigates the changes in their importance during the study period. Our results show that among the major determinants, the real per capita income, real per capita expenditure on education, FDI related employment, research and development expenditure, and capital expenditure are found to have a significant positive impact on FDI inflows. There is also evidence that the share of scientists and engineers in the workforce exerts a small positive impact on inward <b>FDI</b> <b>flow.</b> In addition, per capita state taxes, unit labor cost, manufacturing density, unionizetion, and unemployment rate exert a negative impact on FDI inflows...|$|R
40|$|China’s {{national}} {{construction industry}} is now preparing {{to face the}} challenges, and to seize the opportunities, resulting from China’s entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). With the foreign direct investment (FDI) hitting a record high of around US$ 52. 7 billion in 2002, China {{is believed to have}} now surpassed the USA as the world’s favorite destination for foreign investment. This fact, coupled with the huge potential for infrastructure development, indicates that the relatively large proportion of <b>FDI</b> <b>flowing</b> into the national construction industry will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Positive aspects of <b>FDI</b> <b>flowing</b> will definitely help forging new industrial capabilities for China’s construction industry, thus helping it to achieve the ambitious strategic targets set by the Government for exporting construction goods and services. To shed some light on the position of the national industry in the global economy, this paper briefly presents the current international standing of China’s construction industry and qualitatively appraises potential positive influences of, and challenges associated with, FDI on the national industry...|$|R
50|$|Starting from a {{baseline}} {{of less than}} $1 billion in 1990, a 2012 UNCTAD survey projected India as {{the second most important}} FDI destination (after China) for transnational corporations during 2010-2012. As per the data, the sectors that attracted higher inflows were services, telecommunication, construction activities and computer software and hardware. Mauritius, Singapore, US and UK were among the leading sources of FDI. Based on UNCTAD data <b>FDI</b> <b>flows</b> were $10.4 billion, a drop of 43% from {{the first half of the}} last year.|$|E
50|$|By {{providing}} {{additional security}} and certainty {{under international law}} to investors operating in foreign countries, IIAs can encourage companies to invest overseas. While there is a scientific debate {{on the extent to}} which IIAs increase the amount of <b>FDI</b> <b>flows</b> to signatory host countries, policymakers do tend to anticipate that IIAs encourage cross-border investment and thereby also support economic development. Amongst others, FDI can facilitate the inflows of capital and technology into host countries, help generate employment and have other positive spillover effects. Accordingly, developing country governments seek to establish an adequate framework to encourage such inflows, amongst others through the conclusion of IIAs.|$|E

40|$|Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) {{has grown}} to be an {{attractive}} alternative to borrowing from multilateral {{institutions such as the}} World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for emerging economies. Global investors prefer investing in countries which have received a Sovereign Credit Rating (SCR) as they perceive it as a good measure of risk allocation. This research applied an event study methodology to SCR downgrades from the three international CRAs (Moody, Standard and Poor and Fitch) over the period 2004 to 2014 to investigate the impact of SCR change on <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> into South Africa. Empirical findings show that there is a statistically significant relationship between FDI and SCR downgrades. Evidence also shows that not all downgrades from the three CRAs equally affect investors’ decisions as Moody’s downgrades tend to dominate, causing FDI to reaction at with a higher magnitude. However, not only SCR downgrade determines <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> into SA but there is a host of other fundamentals that government should address to attract investment and stabilise financial market...|$|R

50|$|Another new {{development}} in the global system of IIAs is the increased conclusion of such agreements among developing countries. In the past, industrialized countries usually concluded IIAs to protect their firms when they undertake overseas investments, while developing countries tended to sign IIAs {{in order to encourage}} and promote inflows of FDI from industrialized countries. The current trend towards increased conclusions of IIAs among developing countries reflects the economic changes underlying international investment relations. Developing countries and emerging economies are increasingly not only destinations, but also significant source countries of <b>FDI</b> <b>flows.</b> In line with their emerging role as outward investors, and their improved economic competitiveness, developing countries are increasingly pursuing the dual interests of encouraging FDI inflows but also seeking to protect the investments of their companies abroad.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the best determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach – This paper investigates whether FDI determinants affect FDI based on both a panel of data (FMOLS-fully modified OLS) and cross-section SUR (seemingly unrelated regression) for 24 developing countries, over the period 1983 - 2005 for FMOLS and 1976 - 2005 for cross-section SUR. Findings – The interaction of FDI with some FDI determinants have a strong positive effect on economic progress in developing countries, while the interaction of FDI with the total debt service/GDP and inflation have a negative impact. The most important determinant of FDI is the communication variable. Research limitations/implications – The limitations of the study are based on the development of data set which could be found uninterrupted for 30 years in 24 developing countries. Originality/value – The main objective of this study is to define the main FDI determinants that show the capital flows to developing countries in a globalization framework. The secondary objective of this study is to assign countries' convergence by using the same <b>FDI</b> determinants. <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> is one of the main dynamics of globalization phenomenon thus <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> determinations will contribute to countries' process of political development.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate determinants of the general <b>FDI</b> <b>flow</b> to Visegrad countries and the effect of participation in EMU and EU. It was decided to investigate how augmented Gravity Model of trade allows identifying and evaluating the significance of pull and push factors of FDI. In an empirical analysis of panel data Hausman‐Taylor estimator was used because of the time‐invariant variables presence. While investment decisions regarding the choice of country are determined by the size of the target market, the distance is still a negative factor in creation of FDI volume. Additionally, it was proven that membership in EMU, differences in taxation, historical background, access to the sea and prices stability have significant impact of FDI stock formation in each country belonging to V 4. Is was also noted that Poland became a leader of the V 4 as well as EU‐ 12 FDI market sourcing from the old EU Member States. It is necessary to develop an “FDI attracting mechanism” using existing resources. Business regulations and taxation policy as well as main macroeconomic variables which are responsible for the economy standing are also examined as attracting the <b>FDI</b> <b>flow.</b> The originality of this work lies in studying some aspects of FDI inflow into the group of both similar and different countries in economic measures terms...|$|R
