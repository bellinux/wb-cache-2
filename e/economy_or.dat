For instance, the RAN escorted over 1,100coastal convoys the Army established coastal defences to protect important ports and {{a high proportion of}} the RAAF's operational squadrons were used to protect shipping at various times.

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its <b>economy</b> <b>or</b> infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the performance of}} Markov-switching model on business cycle by applying the model to various economies. Specifically, three comparison groups are used: (1) the USA and Japan serving as the representatives for the industrialized <b>economies</b> (<b>or</b> IEs hereafter); (2) Taiwan and South Korea serving as the representatives for newly industrialized <b>economies</b> (<b>or</b> NIEs hereafter); and (3) Malaysia and Indonesia serving as the representatives for the developing <b>economies</b> (<b>or</b> DEs hereafter). The empirical {{results are consistent with}} the following notions. First, the Markov-switching model serves well to depict the business cycles for IEs and DEs. Nevertheless, the model is ineffective for the two NIEs, which underwent structural economic shifts to slower growth during our sample period of 1970 - 1998. Second, the two-period Markov-switching by dividing the sample periods into two sub-periods thus more effectively measures the two NIEs' business cycles. ...|$|R
5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel <b>economy</b> <b>or</b> taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E
5|$|Spanish Florida {{never really}} {{recovered}} its <b>economy</b> <b>or</b> population {{from the effects}} of the war, and it was ceded to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris following the Seven Years' War. Indians who had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule, as did those allied to the British in this war. This discontentment flared into the 1715 Yamasee War that posed a major threat to South Carolina's viability. The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the Province of Georgia, which was granted on territory that Spain had originally claimed, as was also the case with Carolina. James Moore took military action against the Tuscaroras of North Carolina in the Tuscarora War which began in 1711, and many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins the Iroquois.|$|E
5|$|The final {{demobilisation}} plan assigned differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points {{for each year}} of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service {{if they did not}} have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married {{before the end of the}} war. Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian <b>economy</b> <b>or</b> had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E

5|$|The {{organisational}} {{ability of}} the government agencies charged with overseeing {{the integration of the}} refugees into society was frequently criticised by American officials. In many cases, the individual officials simply made their own decisions and the goal of resettling the northerners without disruption to the existing local <b>economy</b> <b>or</b> social structure was not achieved. In other cases, the northern Catholics formed their own committees and settled and built on areas as they saw fit. By the end of September, the shortage of funds and equipment had eased, but their distribution was not organised or coordinated effectively. At the same time, some Viet Minh cadres who stayed in the south after the partition pretended to be refugees and stirred up trouble inside the camps. Aside from disruption by communists, other non-communist movements such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng were strong in areas of central Vietnam, were opponents of Diem and some of them were military personnel. This sometimes caused hindrance in civilian-military cooperation in the resettlement program, as some of Diem's public servants were suspicious of the military's reliability as a working partner.|$|E

This section of the highway had the highest traffic count with 9,088vehicles in 2009. At Front Street, M-51 merges with M-62, and the two run concurrently to the west through town. M-62 continues westerly after M-51 separates and turns southwesterly near the Dowagiac Municipal Airport. The highway crosses into Berrien County south of Indian Lake and continues west through more scattered farms and woodland to a junction with M-140. At this intersection, M-140 turns west along the roadway, and M-62 ends.
