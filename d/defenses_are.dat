5|$|Plant {{defenses}} can {{be classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> always present in the plant, while induced <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory.|$|E

5|$|A {{follow-up}} to , Battle for Naboo is a fast-paced, arcade-style action game. Each of the game's 15levels introduces mission objectives {{that must be}} completed to progress to the next level. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines. Ground <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> more varied and include battle and destroyer droids, laser and missile turrets, Armored Assault Tanks (AATs), Multi-troop transports (MTTs), gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform (STAPs).|$|E
50|$|Strategic <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> {{not always}} passive in nature. In fact, it often {{involves}} military deception, propaganda and psychological warfare, {{as well as}} pre-emptive strategies. All forms of military <b>defense</b> <b>are</b> included in the planning, and often civil <b>defense</b> organisations <b>are</b> also included.|$|R
5000|$|On <b>defense,</b> Georgia Tech <b>was</b> ranked 47th in {{the nation}} in scoring defense (25) and 63rd in yards allowed per game (408.1). The Yellow Jacket's run <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked 64th {{in the nation}}, while the pass <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked 73rd. The team's <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> led by {{defensive}} back Corey Griffin, who led the team with 79 tackles. Griffin also had a sack, two interceptions and a fumble recovery.|$|R

5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E
5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hans has led a {{group of}} {{soldiers}} to the ice palace. Elsa's <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> not enough and she is taken back to Arendelle's dungeon unconscious. At the castle, Anna's request for a kiss is denied by Hans, who reveals their engagement was merely a ploy to seize the throne of Arendelle. He locks Anna in her room without a fire, leaving her to die. Hans falsely claims that Anna is already dead and that they spoke their marriage vows before she died, making him the ruler of Arendelle. Olaf aids Anna while revealing to her Kristoff's love for her. Elsa also escapes into the fjord, her fears triggering a massive blizzard, but breaks down in shock when Hans tells her that she killed Anna and the blizzard stops. While {{the end of the}} storm allows Anna to reunite with Kristoff, she sees Hans ready to kill Elsa, and with her final breath, she stops him from killing her sister and inadvertently knocks him unconscious just as she freezes solid—a result of the earlier accident.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E
5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{environmental}} constraint hypothesis or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model (CNBM), states that the various types of plant <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.|$|E

25|$|A {{successful}} {{prima facie}} <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> rare. Not {{only does the}} burden of proof rest upon the accused, a successful defense may involve expenses well in excess of the cost of a ticket, such as an expert witness. Furthermore, because prima facie <b>defenses</b> must <b>be</b> presented in a court, such a <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> difficult for out-of-town motorists.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{variations}} of the English Opening is called the Korchnoi Variation, a variation for White against the French <b>Defense</b> <b>is</b> called the Korchnoi Gambit and a closed variation of the Sicilian <b>Defense</b> <b>is</b> called the Korchnoi Defense.|$|R

25|$|The hilltop {{location}} of the wooden forts {{would have given the}} defending slingers the advantage of range over the attackers, and multiple concentric ramparts, each higher than the other, would allow a large number of men to create a hailstorm of stone. Consistent with this, it has been noted that <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> generally narrow where the natural slope is steep, and wider where the slope is more gradual.|$|E
25|$|Similar to its predecessor, , Rogue Leader is a fast-paced, flight action game. Each of the game's ten levels {{introduces}} mission objectives such as {{search and}} destroy or protection {{that must be}} completed to progress to the next level.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus expresses many {{proteins}} {{that are involved}} in evasion or downregulation of the human immune system. Proteins involved in evading the complement system and neutrophil <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> are studied by discussing primary data. A basic overview of the complement system and neutrophil <b>defenses</b> <b>is</b> given. The origin and reason for the vast number of proteins involved in immune evasion is discussed...|$|R
25|$|Throughout the arthropod, and insect, realm, however, {{chemical}} <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> quite unevenly distributed. There {{is great}} {{variation in the}} presence and absence of chemical arms among orders and families to even within families. Moreover, there is diversity among insects {{as to whether the}} defensive compounds are obtained intrinsically or extrinsically. Many compounds are derived from the main food source of insect larvae, and occasionally adults, feed, whereas other insects are able to synthesize their own toxins.|$|E
25|$|In severe or {{untreated}} cases, {{the tympanic}} membrane may perforate, allowing the pus in the middle-ear space to drain into the ear canal. If there is enough, this drainage may be obvious. Even though the perforation of {{the tympanic membrane}} suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, it is almost always associated with a dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of acute otitis media in an otherwise healthy person, the body's <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> likely to resolve the infection and the ear drum nearly always heals.|$|E
25|$|More {{aggressive}} self-defense {{measures are}} taken by some caterpillars. These measures include having spiny bristles or long fine hair-like setae with detachable tips that will irritate by lodging {{in the skin}} or mucous membranes. However some birds (such as cuckoos) will swallow even the hairiest of caterpillars. Other caterpillars acquire toxins from their host plants that render them unpalatable to most of their predators. For instance, ornate moth caterpillars utilize pyrrolizidine alkaloids that they obtain from their food plants to deter predators. The most aggressive caterpillar <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> bristles associated with venom glands. These bristles are called urticating hairs. A venom which {{is among the most}} potent defensive chemicals in any animal is produced by the South American silk moth genus Lonomia. Its venom is an anticoagulant powerful enough to cause a human to hemorrhage to death (See Lonomiasis). This chemical is being investigated for potential medical applications. Most urticating hairs range in effect from mild irritation to dermatitis.|$|E

500|$|Unlike the [...] that {{emphasizes}} space combat simulation, Rogue Squadron is a fast-paced, arcade-style action game. Each of the game's sixteen levels introduces mission objectives {{that must be}} completed to progress to the next level. These objectives are divided into four categories: search and destroy, reconnaissance, rescue, and protect. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of TIE fighters. Ground <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> more varied and include three different walkers, laser and missile turrets, tanks, probe droids, shuttles, stormtroopers and speeder bikes.|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms or toxins that {{successfully}} {{enter an}} organism encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system. [...] The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors, which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms, or when damaged, injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals, {{many of which}} (but not all) are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens. Innate immune <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> non-specific, meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way. This system does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen. The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from moving}} around a {{restricted}} space, fighting games limit the player's actions to different {{offensive and defensive}} maneuvers. Players must learn which attacks and <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> effective against each other, often by trial and error. Blocking is a basic technique that allows a player to defend against attacks. Some games feature more advanced blocking techniques: for example, Capcom's Street Fighter III features a move termed [...] "parrying" [...] which causes the attacker to become momentarily incapacitated (a similar state is termed [...] "just defended" [...] in SNK's [...] ). In addition to blows such as punches and kicks, players can utilize throwing or [...] "grappling" [...] to circumvent [...] "blocks". Predicting opponents' moves and counter-attacking, known as [...] "countering", is a common element of gameplay. Fighting games also emphasize {{the difference between the}} height of blows, ranging from low to jumping attacks. Thus, strategy becomes important as players attempt to predict each other's moves, similar to rock–paper–scissors.|$|E
