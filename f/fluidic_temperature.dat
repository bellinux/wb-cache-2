It is demonstrated that it is feasible to mount the pressure transducer away from the oscillator body, thus creating a system capable of measuring high temperatures in gas flows.

40|$|Refinements are {{described}} to an existing <b>fluidic</b> <b>temperature</b> control system developed under a prior study which modulated temperature at the inlet to the liquid-cooled garment by using existing liquid supply and return lines to transmit signals to a fluidic controller {{located in the}} spacecraft. This earlier system produced a limited range of garment inlet temperatures, requiring some bypassing of flow around the suit to make the astronaut comfortable at rest conditions. Refinements {{were based on a}} flow visualization study of the key element in the fluidic controller: the fluidic mixing valve. The valve's mixing-ratio range was achieved by making five key changes: (1) geometrical changes to the valve; (2) attenuation of noise generated in proportional amplifier cascades; (3) elimination of vortices at the exit of the fluidic mixing valve; (4) reduction of internal heat transfer; and (5) flow balancing through venting. As a result, the refined system is capable of modulating garment inlet temperature from 45 F to 70 F with a single manual control valve in series with the garment. This control valve signals without changing or bypassing flow through the garment...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a novel polymer-based micro robotic gripper that can be actuated in a fluidic medium is presented in this paper. Our current work is to explore new materials and designs for thermal actuators to achieve micromanipulation of live biological cells. We used parylene C to encapsulate a metal heater, resulting in effectively a tri-layered thermal actuator. Parylene C is a bio-compatible dielectric polymer that {{can serve as a}} barrier to various gases and chemicals. Therefore, it is suitable to serve as a thermal/electrical/chemical isolation material for protecting the metal heater from exposing to an aqueous environment. We have demonstrated parylene actuators (2 mm× 100 μm× 0. 5 μm) to operate in an aqueous environment using 10 to 80 mW input power. The temperature of these actuators at full deflection was estimated to be ∼ 60 °C, which is much lower than the typical requirement of > 100 °C to actuate other conventional MEMS actuators. Danio rerio follicles in fluidic medium were captured successfully using these actuators. Moreover, these actuators were found to be responsive to moderate rise in environmental temperature, and hence, we could vary the fluidic medium temperature to actuate trimorphs on a chip without any input of electrical energy, i. e., raising the <b>fluidic</b> <b>temperature</b> from 23 °C to 60 °C could actuate the trimorphs to grasp follicles of ∼ 1 mm size in diameter. At 60 °C, the embryos inside the follicles were observed to be alive, i. e., they were still moving in the biological fluid isolated by the follicle membrane. The smallest follicles grasped were ∼ 500 μm in diameter using 800 μm× 130 μm× 0. 6 μm actuators. The fabrication process, modeling, and optimization of the trimorph actuators are presented. Based on the successful operation of these polymer-based actuators, we are currently developing multifinger thermal microgrippers for cellular grasping and manipulation, which can potentially be hybridly integrated with circuits for computer control...|$|E
40|$|ISBN: 978 - 1 - 4673 - 1168 - 7 International audienceIn the {{objective}} of power increase for transport applications or on-board auxiliaries systems, long fuel cell stacks {{may be subject to}} disparities (<b>fluidics,</b> <b>temperature)</b> and can be the cause of possible failures. Coupled with a fault detection strategy, the power converter associated with the fuel cell can act to manage the fault. This article is about power converter topologies applied to a segmented high power fuel cell. The fuel cell generator is a 3 -part segmented Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Each fuel cell segment can be controlled independently according to its state of health (SoH). The converter topology has to be simple, compact, reliable and with a high efficiency. The resonant isolated boost as converter "technology brick", allowing soft switching is a candidate topology to meet the technical specifications of the multi-port fuel cell-converter system...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{temperature probe}} package containing a <b>fluidic</b> oscillator <b>temperature</b> probe and a shielded thermocouple temperature probe was tested during several X- 15 flights. The X- 15 flights provided greatly varying test conditions, including {{a wide range}} of rapidly changing total temperatures and Mach numbers which extended from subsonic to hypersonic speeds. Within restricted ranges of free-stream Mach number, free-stream unit weight flow, and local stagnation pressure, both probes yielded ramp outputs of temperature parallel to ramp inputs of free-stream total temperature. Within these ranges both probes were used to determine total temperature in the Mach 6 temperature environment. Because ambient temperature was known, both probes were used to estimate velocity and Mach number. Includes bibliographical references (p. 14).

40|$|Optical microcoil {{resonators}} (OMRs), {{formed by}} coiling a micron-diameter fibre around a rod {{as shown in}} Figure 1 a, provide a unique resonator geometry in which light can evanescently couple between adjacent turns to produce high Q resonances. Furthermore, OMRs fabricated from a pigtailed fibre taper offer much lower coupling losses than cavity resonators. Applications in fields such as <b>fluidic</b> and <b>temperature</b> sensing have already been investigated, and the small fibre diameter and effective modal area indicate that OMRs are a promising platform for studying nonlinear interactions. A detailed understanding of OMR optical characteristics is crucial for further development, but theoretical studies have thus far neglected any polarization dependency. In this work, {{the influence of the}} fibre’s birefringence on the polarization of propagating light was studied by numerically solving polarization dependant coupled mode equations. The resulting transmission and dispersion properties are discussed for different degrees of fibre twist (Figure 1 b). In addition to the linear behaviour, the nonlinear regime was explored, by incorporating a Kerr term, and found to be strongly enhanced around resonances...|$|R
50|$|The {{integrated}} nanoliter system {{consists of}} microfabricated <b>fluidic</b> channels, heaters, <b>temperature</b> sensors, and fluorescence detectors. The microfabricated fluidic channels (basically very small pipes) {{act as the}} main transportation structures for any fluids as well as where reactions occur within the system. For the desired reactions to occur, the temperature needs to be adjusted. Therefore, heaters are attached to some microfabricated fluidic channels. To monitor and maintain the desired temperature, temperature sensors are crucial for successful and desired reactions. In order to accurately track the fluids before and after a reaction, fluorescence detectors are used for detecting {{the movements of the}} fluids within the system. For instance, when a specific fluid passes a certain point where it triggers or excites emission of light, the fluorescence detector is able to receive that emission and calculate {{the time it takes to}} reach that certain point.|$|R
50|$|A {{thin layer}} of grease made for this {{application}} {{can be applied to}} the ground glass surfaces to be connected, and the inner joint is inserted into the outer joint such that the ground glass surfaces of each are next to each other to make the connection. In addition to making a leak-tight connection, the grease lets two joints be later separated more easily. A potential drawback of such grease is that if used on laboratory glassware for a long time in high-temperature applications (such as for continuous distillation), the grease may eventually contaminate the chemicals. Also, reagents may react with the grease, especially under vacuum. For these reasons, it is advisable to apply a light ring of grease at the fat end of the taper and not its tip, to keep it from inside the glassware. If the grease smears over the entire taper surface on mating, too much was used. Using greases specifically designed for this purpose is also a good idea, as these are often better at sealing under vacuum, thicker and so less likely to flow out of the taper, become <b>fluidic</b> at higher <b>temperatures</b> than Vaseline (a common substitute) and are more chemically inert than other substitutes.|$|R
