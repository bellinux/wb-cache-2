40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{addition}} of systemic drugs to whole-brain irradiation has not improved {{the survival of}} patients with multiple brain metastases, most likely because the agents did not readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Radiolabeling of cetuximab was performed to investigate whether this antibody crosses the BBB. Case Report: A patient with multiple brain lesions from {{non-small cell lung cancer}} was investigated. The largest metastasis (40 × 33 × 27 mm) was selected the reference lesion. On day 1, 200 mg/m 2 cetuximab (0. 25 % hot and 99. 75 % <b>cold</b> <b>antibody)</b> were given. On day 3, 200 mg/m 2 cetuximab (<b>cold</b> <b>antibody)</b> were given. Weekly doses of 250 mg/m 2 cetuximab were administered for 3 months. Results: The reference lesion showed enhancement of radiolabeled cetuximab (123 I-Erbi) on scintigraphy; 123 I-Erbi crossed the BBB and accumulated in the lesion. The reference lesion measured 31 × 22 × 21 mm at 4 months. Enhancement of contrast me-dium was less pronounced.

40|$|Two {{series of}} {{experiments}} were performed on rabbits to investigate the role of fixed C 3 in the non-lytic destruction of red cells. In the first series, intravenous injection of a potentially lytic IgM <b>cold</b> <b>antibody</b> (anti-I) into C 6 -deficient rabbits caused a severe thrombocytopenia and neutropenia and a fall in haemoglobin concentration and PCV with only minimal haemoglobinaemia; all were of short duration. A sharp fall in plasma C 3 concentration, the demonstration of C 3 on the red cells and the occurrence of immune-adherence in vivo suggested that red cell-complement intermediates in the form EA(IgM) C 1423 {{were present in the}} circulation at this time. Subsequently, when the fixed-C 3 activity of the circulating red cells was markedly diminishing, the haemoglobin and PCV and platelet and neutrophil counts recovered towards the pre-injection values, indicating the sequestration rather than the acute destruction of these cells. In contrast to the findings in the C 6 -deficient rabbits, injection of the same IgM <b>cold</b> <b>antibody</b> into C 3 -depleted rabbits caused no significant haematological changes. In a second {{series of experiments}}, red cells in the form EC 43 (5) and EC 4 were injected intravenously into C 6 -deficient, C 3 -depleted and normal rabbits. EC 4 survived normally during the period of observation, whereas EC 43 (5) were removed exponentially (t½: 1 ½– 4 min) from the circulation at sites in the reticuloendothelial system. In the liver, the main site of sequestration, EC 43 (5) attached to Kupffer cells, where some were immediately ingested. With time, unphagocytosed EC 43 (5) returned to the circulation at a slow exponential rate (t½: 25 – 100 min), apparently as damaged, spherocytic cells. It is suggested that the return of EC 43 (5) to the circulation from sites of attachment on fixed macrophages is due to the progressive in vivo inactivation of fixed-C 3. It would therefore appear that the presence of fixed C 3 in an active form is essential for the non-lytic sequestration and damage of red cells which have been exposed to IgM <b>cold</b> <b>antibody...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{antibody}} involved in warm antibody AIHA is IgG, though sometimes IgA is found.

Spherocytes are not as flexible as normal RBCs and will be singled-out for destruction in the red pulp of the spleen as well as other portions of the reticuloendothelial system.

This was tested in 6 patients with primary colorectal tumours using a high affinity (10 (10) M- 1) technetium labelled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (BW 431 / 26).

40|$|Summary. -Sera from {{patients}} with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a disease associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), {{were found to}} be cytotoxic at 15 °C in the presence of complement for a panel of human lymphocytes, with a higher fre-quency than those of matched controls. The <b>cold</b> lymphocytotoxic <b>antibodies</b> (LTA) responsible for this activity have the same properties as those described in sera from individuals with acute viral infections. The frequency and geometric mean titres (GMT) of LTA varied with the origin of the patient (Chinese> North African> Caucasian) and the stage of the disease (Stage IV> Stage I). A positive correlation between LTA and anti-EBV titres was found with regard to antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and the EBV-specified nuclear antigen (EBNA). The absence of correlation between LTA and anti-early antigen (EA) titres probably reflects the complex relationships existing between viral infection and LTA pro-duction, but is compatible with the hypothesis that LTA acts as an immune regula-tory mechanism in viral infections. CYTOTOXIC activity against a panel of human lymphocytes, complement-de-pendent and optimal at 15 °C, was describ-ed by Mottironi and Terasaki in patients with acute viral infections such as in-fectious mononucleosis, rubella and measles (Mottironi and Terasaki, 1970).

Short video-transects were run at 4 -h intervals {{during the first week}} of successive calendar months, over a 14 month period (February 14 th 2013 to April 14 th 2014). Within each recorded transect video megafauna abundances were computed and changes in environmental conditions concurrently measured. The responses of fauna to environmental conditions as a proxy of seasonality were assessed through analysis of abundances in a total of 438 video-transects (over 92 h of total footage). 7698 fauna individuals from 6 phyla (Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, Mollusca, and Chordata) were logged and patterns in abundances of the 7 most abundant taxa (i. e. rockfish Sebastidae, sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, hagfish Eptatretus stoutii, buccinids (Buccinoidea), undefined small crabs, ctenophores Bolinopsis infundibulum, and Scyphomedusa Poralia rufescens) were identified. Patterns in the reproductive behaviour of the grooved tanner crab (Chionnecetes tanneri) were also indicated. Temporal variations in biodiversity and abundance in megabenthic fauna was significantly influenced by variabilities in flow velocity flow direction (up or down canyon), dissolved oxygen concentration and month of study. Also reported here for the first time are transient mass aggregations of grooved tanner crabs through these depths of the canyon system, in early spring and likely linked to the crab's reproductive cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of a feline Coombs serum (rabbit antifeline gamma globulin) is described. The direct antiglobulin test using this serum {{was performed on}} 20 anemic and 20 healthy control cats. Red cell membrane antibodies were detected in cats with feline leukemia virus infection and in others with inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. A low titre of <b>cold</b> agglutinating <b>antibody</b> was present in {{a high proportion of}} the control cats. Positive direct antiglobulin tests were noted in cats without overt hemolytic disease. It was concluded that the direct antiglobulin test in anemic cats has certain diagnostic limitations. A positive reaction should be interpreted cautiously especially when there is no clinical or laboratory evidence to support a diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia...|$|R
