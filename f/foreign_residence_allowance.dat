40|$|Background A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that migration is a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia, although the putative mechanism remains obscure. Aims To examine immigrant background and history of <b>foreign</b> <b>residence</b> as risk factors for schizophrenia. Method Using data from the Danish Civil Registration System, we established a population-based cohort of 2. 14 million persons resident in Denmark by their fifteenth birthday. Schizophrenia in cohort members and parental psychiatric disorder were identified by cross-linkage with the Danish Psychiatric Case Register. Results The relative risk of developing schizophrenia was 2. 45 (95 % Cl 2. 25 - 2. 67) and 1. 92 (95 % Cl 1. 74 - 2. 12) among first- and second-generation immigrants respectively, and 1. 60 (95 % Cl 1. 25 - 2. 05) among Danes with a history of <b>foreign</b> <b>residence.</b> Conclusions Migration confers an increased risk for schizophrenia that is not solely attributable to selection factors and may also be independent of foreign birth...|$|R

On 28 February 2017, Nardella announced he would retire from politics at the next state election. Premier Daniel Andrews demanded that Nardella repay the $100,000 he had claimed, which he refused; accordingly Andrews demanded his resignation from the Labor Party, and Nardella resigned to sit as an independent on 7 March 2017.|$|R

40|$|Deployment of {{resident}} female Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to {{a remote}} rural community led to major and sustained increases in service utilization, including antenatal care and facility-based deliveries. Key components to success: (1) providing an additional rural <b>residence</b> <b>allowance</b> to help recruit and retain CHEWs; (2) posting the female CHEWs in pairs to avoid isolation and provide mutual support; (3) ensuring supplies and transportation means for home visits; and (4) allowing CHEWs to perform deliveries. Introduction: Nigeria {{has one of the}} highest maternal mortality ratios in the world. Poor health outcomes are linked to weak health infrastructure, barriers to service access, and consequent low rates of service utilization. In the northern state of Jigawa, a pilot study was conducted to explore the feasibility of deploying resident female Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to rural areas to provide essential maternal, newborn, and child health services. Methods: Between February and August 2011, a quasi-experimental design compared service utilization in the pilo...|$|R
