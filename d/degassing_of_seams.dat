40|$|Most coal seams, {{currently}} mined in the Karaganda Coal Basin, {{are prone}} to outburst. The main thick D 6 coal seam is considered as most prone to outburst risk. Trials <b>of</b> advance <b>degassing</b> from the surface have not given positive results because of low permeability. 100 mm diameter inseam holes are subsequently drilled in almost all longwall blocks to facilitate preliminary <b>degassing</b> <b>of</b> the coal <b>seams.</b> Gas extraction quantities are however low, even the holes are placed on suction To facilitate the gas release during longwall block development, <b>of</b> the main <b>seam,</b> a method <b>of</b> development below the seam was used. This gave rise to increase in permeability <b>of</b> overlying thick <b>seam</b> with high gas content, achieving a local degasification <b>of</b> the overlying <b>seam</b> by up to 90 %. The initial development roadway was driven under the seam, in rock, {{at a distance of}} between 8 - 12 m from seam floor in the same contour of the future development roadway in the coal seam. A relief area was created as a result of stress redistribution above the roadway. Degassing holes were drilled from the rock development, into the <b>seam</b> area <b>of</b> the future coal seam development heading. During traditional in seam development, outburst preventive measures were taken, which increased the labour intensiveness of development working, sharply decreasing the development rate. Application of these new techniques allowed increased development rates in seams to be realised, from 25 - 40 m per month to 120 - 150 m in the outburst prone areas...|$|R

40|$|Drape of {{the fabric}} {{is its ability to}} hang freely in graceful folds when some area of it is {{supported}} over a surface and the rest is unsupported. Drape is a unique property that allows a fabric to be bent in more than in one direction, When two-dimensional fabric are converted to three-dimensional garment form. In the present study, the effects of sewing <b>of</b> different <b>seam</b> were selected on different fabric and their behaviors were studied. In this study drape of ten fabrics are analyzed with three types <b>of</b> <b>seams</b> and three stitch densities. Sample without seam is a control sample and drape <b>of</b> <b>seamed</b> samples are compared with control sample to analyse the drape behavior <b>of</b> <b>seamed</b> fabrics. This paper presents a fundamental drape analysis <b>of</b> <b>seamed</b> fabrics using drape meter. Drape behavior is determined in terms of drape coefficient. The effect <b>of</b> <b>seams</b> on the drape coefficient and Drape profile has been made. Drape coefficients significantly differs between the fabrics and also between the seam stitch density combinations. Investigating drape on seamed fabrics can improve fabric end use application.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{reports the}} results of batch and semibatch experiments involving bubbling of nitrogen in aqueous solutions of magnesium bicarbonate, with and without the addition of either carbonic anhydrase (CA) or Scenedesmus alga to the solution. Precipitation of nesquehonite occurred during both an accelerated <b>degassing</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 induced by sparging small nitrogen bubbles (representative diameter of 20 μm), and during slow degassing engendered by introducing large nitrogen bubbles (representative diameter of 5 mm). The response of the system during low rates <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> closely approached quasi-thermodynamic predictions, which permitted an estimation {{of the level of}} supersaturation of nesquehonite, prior to the onset of precipitation. Small bubbles and CA significantly increased rates <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> and indirectly the production of nesquehonite, as the rate <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> can limit the precipitation process. The response of the system during rapid rates <b>of</b> <b>degassing,</b> prior to precipitation, was not entirely consistent with quasi-thermodynamic predictions. During precipitation, higher rates <b>of</b> <b>degassing</b> produced similar alkalisation and precipitation trends to that observed for lower rates <b>of</b> <b>degassing.</b> Our results agree with the formation of travertine deposits in nature, where the <b>degassing</b> <b>of</b> solutions enriched with inorganic carbon, and enhanced alkalisation by microorganisms, have been shown to influence carbonate formation. The results demonstrate a catalytic effect of CA on the rate limiting carbonate reactions, increasing CO 2 exchange between nitrogen and water, and indirectly accelerating the precipitation of carbonates for a system controlled by rate <b>of</b> <b>degassing.</b> The results <b>of</b> this study have applications to large-scale storage of CO 2 by mineralisation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- In {{automatically}} {{seam tracking}} system with structured light vision sensor in girth-welding of pipeline, {{there is a}} lot <b>of</b> noise in <b>seam</b> images. To extract seam information reliably, it is important to process the original images to eliminate influence of noise. A novel compounding process method is presented. Firstly, one dimension Laplacian of Gaussian filter was applied to transform noises whose width was larger than laser light stripe to isolated and small noise. Then the image was smoothed with neighborhood median filter. Due to gray distribution variety <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> image, binary image was created with maximal square difference adaptive threshold within selected section based on priori information. Acnode noise was cleared up by region labeling and selected threshold, consequently a binary image <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> is obtained. Finally, smooth and consecutive skeleton <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> is extracted with morphologic thinning method. Experiments indicate that this process method satisfies requirement <b>of</b> real-time <b>seam</b> tracking. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{sound field}} {{simulations}} can also demonstrate {{the relationship between}} the transmission measurement for the evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> loop c and the degree of adhesive filling in seam areas a or b. The simulation results show that under identical excitation, detection and evaluation range the integral energy method within a gate G <b>of</b> a <b>seam</b> completely filled with air is 2.1 times greater than in the case <b>of</b> a <b>seam</b> bond completely filled with adhesive. This deviation between OK and not okay bonding is already reduced to 1.4 times if the defect area only extends to seam loop C. Subsequently, the selective evaluation <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> loop C by transmission measurement is only possible if this result is used in connection with the results of the pulse echo measurement <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> areas a or b. Consequently there are two conditions for the test of the adhesive filling <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> loop C. First the position in x and y direction <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> in the sensor must be within a certain range (±  1  mm). This is ensured by three impulse echo measurements of the arrays A, B and C. The second condition assumes a complete filling <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> areas a and b. This is checked by the ultrasonic system. Only if both conditions for a test position are fulfilled, the validation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> area c is possible. In the present case, a negative adhesive evaluation for areas a and b has been established by the pulse echo measurement of arrays A and B. Subsequently, because of {{the relationship between the}} transmission measurement and the degree of adhesive filling of areas a and b, no result of the transmission measurement for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> loop c can be indicated for this test position.|$|R

30|$|Figure  11 {{shows the}} result of the {{ultrasonic}} examination for determining the degree <b>of</b> filling <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> loop C. Influences due to a deviation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> loop position in the sensor can be excluded because of the good coupling. The red marked areas in coupling evaluation in the upper seam bond area b arises due to the larger active sensor area (6.5  mm) in contrast to the flange length <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> area b (6  mm). Consequently, the inner sheet is sounded in this area, whereby the echo resulting from the material transition is generated outside the gate for an OK coupling. A change in the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> bond loop <b>of</b> the sample within the sensor can be excluded as a further factor influencing the result. For this purpose, the straight edge of the laboratory sample has been investigated in this series of tests. Consequently, it can be ensured that the ultrasound results are solely related to the adhesive distribution and not to the geometrical shape <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> bond or the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> loop. Further investigations must show the extent to which this can be ensured later in the series process.|$|R
