The cytosolic estrogen receptor content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>livers</b> of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were abstaining was 4. 2 ± 3. 6 fmoles per mg of cytosolic protein, but it increased to 10. 4 ± 4. 9 fmoles per mg of protein <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>livers</b> of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were drinking, to 17. 3 ± 8. 7 fmoles per mg of protein <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>livers</b> of patients with alcoholic hepatitis with cirrhosis and to 22. 7 ± 15. 7 fmoles per mg of protein <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>livers</b> of patients with alcoholic hepatitis without cirrhosis.

Detection of the HHV- 6 genomes in liver, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and in plasma was performed by PCR or by in situ hybridization. Liver biopsy materials from 48 patients, in whom HHV- 6 infection was serologically confirmed, were available for PCR analysis. Sequences of the HHV- 6 B genome were detectable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>livers</b> of 36 of 48 patients (75 %). The presence of the genome was not associated with serum transaminase activities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{determined}} {{whether the}} neurotensin gene (NT/N) is expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal adult <b>liver</b> and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and confirmed NT/N expression in fibrolamellar carcinoma; whether NT/N or the neurotensin receptor is expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fetal liver; and whether hepatic resection leads to expression of NT/N. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Neurotensin (NT), a gut tridecapeptide localized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastrointestinal tract {{of the adult}} to the small bowel, is an important hormone-regulating gut motility, secretion, and mucosal growth. Expression of the NT/N gene has been identified in fibrolamellar carcinomas, but NT/N is not known to be expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>liver.</b> METHODS: Sensitive ribonuclease (RNase) protection assays {{were used to determine}} whether NT/N is expressed in fibrolamellar carcinoma, FNH, or healthy fetal and adult <b>livers.</b> <b>The</b> authors also determined whether the receptor for NT was present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fetal <b>liver</b> and whether liver resection and subsequent regeneration could lead to re-expression of NT/N <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rat. RESULTS: Neurotensin is expressed in fibrolamellar carcinoma and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fetal human <b>liver,</b> but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adult <b>liver</b> or <b>the</b> samples of FNH. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> authors were not able to detect expression of <b>the</b> NT receptor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fetal <b>liver</b> and did not identify NT/N gene activation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regenerating <b>liver</b> of <b>the</b> rat. CONCLUSIONS: The NT/N gene will be a useful molecular marker to differentiate fibrolamellar carcinoma from other <b>liver</b> tumors. <b>The</b> finding of NT/N expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fetal <b>liver</b> suggests a stem cell descendant that is common to both <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> and gut. <b>The</b> absence of NT/N expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regenerating <b>liver</b> suggests that NT does not play a role in this rapid growth process...|$|R

5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized.

For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E

In this study, we established hepatitis B virus (HBV) -transgenic (Tg) /IDO-knockout (KO) mice and examined the influence of IDO in a murine fulminant hepatitis model induced by HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). An increase of IDO expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>livers</b> of HBV-Tg/IDO-wild-type (WT) mice administered HBV-specific CTL was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and evaluating IDO activity. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in HBV-Tg/IDO-KO mice after HBV-specific CTL injection significantly decreased compared with those in HBV-Tg/IDO-WT mice. An inhibitor of IDO, 1 -methyl-d-tryptophan (1 -MT), could also attenuated <b>the</b> observed <b>liver</b> injury induced by this HBV-specific CTL. The expression levels of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>livers</b> of HBV-Tg/IDO-WT mice were higher than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>livers</b> of HBV-Tg/IDO-KO mice.
