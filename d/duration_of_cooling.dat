Among other criteria are the user's need for physical mobility and autonomy. For example, active-liquid systems operate by chilling water and circulating it through a garment; the skin surface area is thereby cooled through conduction. This type of system has proven successful in certain military, law enforcement, and industrial applications. Bomb-disposal technicians wearing special suits to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) use a small, ice-based chiller unit that is strapped to one leg; a liquid-circulating garment, usually a vest, is worn over the torso to maintain a safe core body temperature. By contrast, soldiers traveling in combat vehicles can face microclimate temperatures in excess of 65°C and require a multiple-user, vehicle-powered cooling system with rapid connection capabilities.

The kinetics of austenite phase transformations during continuous cooling were determined by means of analysis of the dilatometric curves and structure investigations. The influence of the austenite grain size and the higher Cr content was analysed in two hypo-eutectoid steels containing about 0. 4 % C. One of them had, Cr content higher, by about 1 %. In both steels, the austenite grain size was changing insignificantly up to the austenitising temperature of about 950 fl.

The austenite grain in the Cr enriched steel was smaller than that in carbon steel and, in spite <b>of</b> that, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooled</b> austenite transformations were several times longer.

The activation energy of all the phase transformations varied slightly with the increase of austenitising temperature.

40|$|Introduction. The {{single most}} {{important}} clinically relevant cause of global cerebral ischemia is cardiac arrest. The estimated rate of sudden cardiac arrest is between 40 and 130 cases per 100. 000 people per year. Almost 80 % of patients initially resuscitated from cardiac arrest remain comatose {{for more than one}} hour. One year after cardiac arrest only 10 - 30 % of these patients survive with good neurological outcome. The ability to survive anoxic no-flow states is dramatically increased with protective and preservative hypothermia. The results of clinical studies show a marked neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia in resuscitation. Material and Methods. In our clinic, 12 patients were treated with therapeutic hypothermia. A combination of intravascular and external method of cooling was used according to the ILCOR (International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation) guidelines. The target temperature was 33 oC, while the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> was 24 hours. After that, passive rewarming was allowed. All patients also received other necessary therapy.

Five patients (41. 66 %) survived, while 7 (58. 33 %) patients died. The main cause of cardiac arrest was acute myocardial infarction (91. 6 %). One patient had acute myocarditis. Conclusion.

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{demonstrates that}} therapeutic temperature modulation {{with the use}} of mild induced hypothermia (MIH, defined as the maintenance of body temperature at 32 - 35  °C) exerts significant neuroprotection and attenuates secondary cerebral insults after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In adult TBI patients, MIH has been used during the acute "early" phase as prophylactic neuroprotectant and in the sub-acute "late" phase to control brain edema. When used to control brain edema, MIH is effective in reducing elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and is a valid therapy of refractory intracranial hypertension in TBI patients. Based on the available evidence, we recommend: applying standardized algorithms for the management of induced cooling; paying attention to limit potential side effects (shivering, infections, electrolyte disorders, arrhythmias, reduced cardiac output); and using controlled, slow (0. 1 - 0. 2  °C/h) rewarming, to avoid rebound ICP.

The anti-infarct benefit depends upon the target temperature and the time at which cooling is instituted. Protection primarily results from cooling during the ischaemic period, whereas cooling during reperfusion or beyond offers little protection. In animal studies, protection is proportional to both the depth and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling.</b> An optimal cooling protocol must appreciably shorten the normothermic ischaemic time to effectively salvage myocardium. Patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction could be candidates for mild hypothermia since the current door-to-balloon time is typically 90 min.

Several strategies have been proposed for ultra-fast cooling, but most like liquid ventilation and pericardial perfusion are too invasive. More feasible strategies might include cutaneous cooling, peritoneal lavage with cold solutions, and endovascular cooling with intravenous thermodes. This last option has been investigated clinically, but the results have been disappointing possibly because the devices lacked capacity to cool the patient quickly or cooling was not implemented soon enough. The mechanism of hypothermia's protection has been assumed to be energy conservation. However, whereas deep hypothermia clearly preserves ATP, mild hypothermia has only a modest effect on ATP depletion during ischaemia.

Scalp cooling can prevent or minimise CIA; the results may depend on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling.</b> Since a previous study on post-infusion cooling time in patients treated with docetaxel chemotherapy found no difference between 90 and 45 min, we investigated whether hair-preserving results could be maintained with a shorter post-infusion cooling time. METHODS: In this prospective, multi-centre randomised study, 134 patients who started treatment with docetaxel 75 - 100 mg/m(2) in a 3 -weekly schedule were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to a post-infusion cooling time of 45 or 20 min. The primary end point was the need for a wig or other head covering as assessed by the patient. A visual analogue scale (VAS) with a range from 0 (not tolerable) to 10 (very tolerable) was used to measure tolerance. RESULTS: Scalp cooling results were similar for 45 - and 20 -min post-infusion cooling times. Thirty-three out of 45 patients (73 %) treated with 20 min of post-infusion cooling did not need a form of head covering, compared with 41 out of 52 patients (79 %) treated with 45 min of post-infusion cooling (p = 0. 5). The procedure was well tolerated (mean visual analogue score 8. 3). Six patients stopped due to intolerance during the first treatment cycle. CONCLUSIONS: A 20 -min post-infusion cooling time is effective and tolerable for patients treated with scalp cooling to prevent docetaxel-induced alopecia.

40|$|Engineers need a {{simplified}} procedure {{to predict the}} residual axial capacity and stiffness of Reinforced Concrete (RC) columns exposed to a complete heating-cooling cycle. Finite difference heat transfer and sectional analysis models are developed to determine the axial behavior of such columns with various end-restraint conditions at different fire <b>durations.</b> The influence <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> phase on temperature distribution and residual mechanical properties are considered in the analysis. The ability of the model to predict the axial behavior of the damaged columns is validated in view of related experimental studies and shown to be in very good agreement. A parametric study is then conducted to assess the axial performance of fire-damaged RC columns. A procedure is proposed to determine the residual strength and stiffness of fire-damaged RC columns in typical frame structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Chandra {{images of}} galaxy {{clusters}} have revealed {{a wealth of}} structure unseen by previous generations of low resolution X-ray observatories. In the cores of clusters, bright, irregular X-ray emission is now routinely seen within central dominant galaxies (CDGs) harboring powerful radio sources. The radio sources are interacting with and are often displacing the hot gas leaving cavities in their wakes. The cavities rise buoyantly, transporting up to 10 61 ergs of energy to the intracluster medium {{over the life of}} a cluster. The dynamically important magnetic fields observed in cooling flows may have originated from these cavities. The cooling rates found by Chandra and XMM-Newton are much smaller than previously reported, and they are more in line with the levels of cold gas and star formation seen in other bandpasses. I discuss the emerging correlation between extended Hα emission, star formation, and bright X-ray emission at locations where the <b>cooling</b> time <b>of</b> the keV gas approaches a few hundred million years. Data from a variety of disciplines suggest repeated, short <b>duration</b> bursts <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> and star formation are occurring, possibly induced and regulated in some instances by the central radio source. Finally, I discuss the interesting possibility that radio sources quench cooling flows, while emphasizing the difficulties with some proposed scenarios. 1...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{congenital}} {{heart disease}} (CHD) {{are at risk for}} neurocognitive impairments. Little is known about the impact of CHD on the organization of large-scale brain networks. We applied graph analysis techniques to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data obtained from 49 adolescents with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) repaired with the arterial switch operation in early infancy and 29 healthy referent adolescents. We examined whether differences in neurocognitive functioning were related to white matter network topology. We developed mediation models revealing the respective contributions of peri-operative variables and network topology on cognitive outcome. Adolescents with d-TGA had reduced global efficiency at a trend level (p =  0. 061), increased modularity (p =  0. 012), and increased small-worldness (p =  0. 026) as compared to controls. Moreover, these network properties mediated neurocognitive differences between the d-TGA and referent adolescents across every domain assessed. Finally, structural network topology mediated the neuroprotective effect <b>of</b> longer <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> core <b>cooling</b> during reparative neonatal cardiac surgery, as well as the detrimental effects of prolonged hospitalization. Taken together, worse neurocognitive function in adolescents with d-TGA is mediated by global differences in white matter network topology, suggesting that disruption of this configuration of large-scale networks drives neurocognitive dysfunction. These data provide new insights into the interplay between perioperative factors, brain organization, and cognition in patients with complex CHD...|$|R
