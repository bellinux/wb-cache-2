40|$|The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 2 {{indicated}} that tax arbitrage via <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatch</b> <b>arrangements</b> "result in a substantial {{erosion of the}} taxable bases of the countries concerned" and "have an overall negative impact on competition, efficiency, transparency and fairness. " The relevant action allowing for neutralising the effects of <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatch</b> <b>arrangements</b> is therefore needed and justified. To achieve that purpose, the OECD developed different anti-hybrid rules under BEPS Action 2. In that regard, however, one may ask whether addressing tax arbitrage via hybrid mismatches as proposed by the OECD is of interest and relevance for developing countries. This paper aims to map that unexplored research area {{by means of a}} comparative analysis in four developing countries - Uruguay, Colombia, Brazil, and South Africa.

The effect on countries hosting investment from multinational companies is laid out in, for example, comments made by Oxfam South Africa to the UN: [...] "The negative impact of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) on South Africa is evident in the escalating rates of poverty, inequality and unemployment. This continues despite some impressive developmental strides taken by the government.

40|$|Curbing tax {{arbitrage}} {{is one of}} the main priorities of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (endorsed by the G 20 and the G 8) ever since the public debate on base erosion fully erupted. Neutralizing the effect of <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatch</b> <b>arrangements</b> has become Action No. 2 of the OECD Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. This has resulted in the recent 2014 deliverable, which is divided into two parts: recommendations for domestic law (part I), and treaty issues (part II). The authors analyse and evaluate the report on the 2014 deliverables on BEPS action point 2. They submit that, given the draw backs of specific anti-hybrid rules as to practical and political feasibility, a further review of alternatives is warranted, particularly with respect to CFC and interest deduction limitations. A more simplified mismatch rule applicable to interest seems particularly worthy of further analysis, given that <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatch</b> <b>arrangements</b> almost always evolve around interest deduction (a notable exception applies with respect to payments to reverse hybrids; however, effective CFC rules may be effective in countering this particular brand of mismatches). In addition, more generic interest deduction limitations (as opposed to specific hybrid mismatch rules) may be a viable complementary way to mitigate double non-taxation resulting from hybrid mismatches and thus act as a sufficient discouragement for entering into such arrangements...|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses whether, {{and to what}} extent, the OECD's recent {{initiative}} on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) is likely to affect holding company structures commonly used by Finnish tax planners. Building on the OECD’s previous “harmful tax planning” initiatives released around the millennium, the BEPS initiative is a political instrument aiming to curb cross-border tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs) through 15 specific action points targeting such tax-related areas as CFC rules, treaty shopping, hybrid financing, interest deductions, permanent establishment (PE) avoidance, transfer pricing (TP), and exchange of tax information. Since its release in 2013, the BEPS initiative has received {{a great deal of}} political support by governments and lots of attention by diverse interest groups. Many commentaries on and analyses of the initiative, mostly by tax consultant firms, have already been released, but despite the attention, no academic research on the subject has yet been conducted from a Finnish perspective. This paper attempts to fill that gap. The importance of the research is obvious for both governments and MNEs, since tax planning is an economically significant field for both of these stakeholders, and thus any impact on the scope of possible tax planning structures is worth our attention. Methodologically, I have tackled the research problem by focusing on both political and legal factors. Surveying a wide range of expert commentaries, analyses and political declarations, I have first analysed the political momentum behind the BEPS initiative as a whole and the likelihood of each specific action point to be enacted in domestic legislation or through international treaties affecting tax planning. I have also looked at the BEPS initiative in a historical context of the OECD’s earlier post-millennium initiatives, assessing how the former’s global reception differs, or is likely to differ, from that of the latter. After the political analysis, the focus of the paper shifts to actual Finnish holding company structures presented in Finnish guidebooks and training material on tax-efficient corporate structures. In this part of the paper, I assess the likelihood of five specific commonly used Finnish holding company structures to be affected by the BEPS action points. The findings of this paper suggest that the BEPS initiative is almost certain {{to have an impact on}} holding company structures in some areas; that in others, political potential is considerable but lots of technical and problems still remain; and that many BEPS action points are either not at all relevant to holding companies or unlikely to affect them for other reasons. Politically, the OECD’s most potent proposals are those on transfer pricing (action points 8 to 10) and tax information exchange (action points 11 to 13), although the latter will only affect holding company structures indirectly. Another action that seems likely to be enacted in legislation is the BEPS action point 2 on <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatches,</b> mainly because of a recent EU proposal against tax avoidance relying on hybrid financing. However, the findings of this paper suggest that even though some other actions, particularly action 4 on interest-stripping and action point 6 on treaty shopping, enjoy a lot of political support, there are still significant unsolved political and technical problems on these fronts. Finally, this paper’s analysis on specific Finnish holding company structures suggests that the Finnish structures most likely to be affected by the OECD’s proposals are those relying on tax rate shopping (“capitalisation on tax rate differences”) and <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatches</b> (“re-characterisation of income”). In particular, the former is likely to be affected by the OECD’s current thinking on transfer pricing and its “important people” doctrine, while the latter has a fair change of being affected, for example, by the OECD’s proposal against <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatches,</b> at least if the EU’s current efforts in this area are successful...|$|R

40|$|This article {{looks at}} the recent actions taken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to prevent <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatches</b> and tax base erosion. These actions have {{come in the form}} of the “Action Plan for Base Erosion and Profits” (BEPS). BEPS has spanned from 2013 to 2015 and has been the {{collaborative}} effort of representatives from 34 countries (with much help from the G- 20 countries) as well as input from other non-member countries. Through this project, the OECD seeks to eradicate the problems caused by the current corporate tax structure and the tendency of countries to choose country-specific solutions to global problems of tax avoidance by large multinational corporations. Some of the areas targeted by the BEPS project include abuses of transfer pricing, corporate inversions, the use of tax havens, and hybrid entities. Most recently, the OECD has released its final set of deliverables in October 2015. This article seeks to explain some of the problems with the current state of corporate taxation and explain some of the BEPS deliverables. The article will also take a critical look at the suggestions made by the OECD, the challenges companies will face, unilateral steps that countries have already taken, whether or not the OECD is the correct body to promulgate these solutions, and what the United States has done in response to BEPS...|$|R

40|$|The EU Directive {{laying down}} rules against tax {{avoidance}} practices that directly affect {{the functioning of}} the Internal Market—the so-called Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) —was adopted on 12 July 2016. It {{has become one of the}} core vehicles for implementing the output of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, a process led by the G 20 and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), at the EU level. The ATAD has imposed a legally binding obligation upon EU Member States to incorporate the conclusions of Action 2 (<b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatch</b> <b>arrangements),</b> Action 3 (controlled foreign company (CFC) rules) and Action 4 (interest deductions) of the BEPS in their domestic laws and regulations, and it has secured a certain uniformity of national implementing measures across the EU by imposing a common minimum level of protection. In addition, the ATAD has also set out a general anti-abuse rule (GAAR) and exit tax provisions, which further strengthen the EU’s baseline protection of tax revenues. The potential impact of this milestone Directive on the Internal Market and the tax systems of Member States in a short- to long-term period is still to be evaluated. This article offers preliminary thoughts, focusing primarily on the UK’s perspective. The author first briefly addresses possible consequences for the EU as a whole, and then analyses the ATAD from the UK’s point of view, showing how the adoption of this Directive fits into a broader UK tax policy and law both prior to and following the Brexit vote...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) {{project has}} been one of the biggest issues in {{international}} taxation. The OECD refers to BEPS as “tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations. ” In 2014, the OECD released BEPS Action 2 as responds on <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Mismatch</b> <b>Arrangements</b> (“HMA”s), which are arrangements exploiting differences in the tax treatment of instruments, entities or transfers between two or more countries. Two of the major factors of HMAs are hybrid entities and hybrid instruments. In Action 2, OECD recommends that counties introduce a “linking rule” that denies the deduction of costs which give rise to HMA outcomes in the payer jurisdiction, such as double deduction, deduction with no inclusion, indirect deduction with no inclusion, as the main measures for addressing HMAs. Among the 15 Actions of the BEPS Project, Action on HMAs is strongly recommended by OECD and G 20 to the 100 countries that plan to implement BEPS. However, considering the historical and economic background of each country, it is difficult to solve HMAs solely with the uniform introduction of a linking rule. Some countries have developed their own countermeasures to HMAs. To successfully counter HMAs, one needs to study the HMA phenomenon and research the current rules. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the ways of responding to the hybrid entities and hybrid instruments of countries including the U. S. and to make policy proposals to solve HMA problems in Korea...|$|E

40|$|European Union (EU) law {{has played}} a key role in {{enforcing}} the EU BEPS agenda, while also introducing limits to the application thereof. The European Commission (EC) sees a clear link between aggressive tax planning and competition law. Against this background, EU State aid law has been employed to challenge the business models of multinational enterprises. At present there are a number of opened cases, where a decision either by the EC or the General Court of the EU is pending. These cases deal with the application of EU State aid law on inter alia tax regimes (e. g. exemption of interest and royalty payments), transfer pricing, and the misapplication of law. The approach the EC is taking in those cases, especially in matters of competence, raises a number of questions, which can only be addressed in a definitive manner by the EU Courts. Similar issues may arise in the field of positive harmonization through the recently adopted Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). For instance, given that a general anti-abuse rule has been included in Art. 6 ATAD and has therefore become EU law, the EC and the EU Courts are competent to decide whether it should be applied in certain situations, and whether non-application thereof may amount to unlawful State aid. However, EU free movement law should be respected by Member States when implementing anti-BEPs measures. Accordingly, so far, the limitation on benefits clause contained in double tax treaties has been challenged by the EC, while the compatibility of the anti-avoidance rules against <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatches</b> with EU free movement law is questionable...|$|R

40|$|In 2013, the OECD {{initiated}} {{its very}} comprehensive and ambitious project against base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Largely {{inspired by the}} OECD, similar action to curb BEPS has been taken within the EU. An important part of these organisations’ measures concerns <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatch</b> <b>arrangements,</b> commonly used by multinationals to achieve BEPS. Hybrid financial instruments, a form of hybrid mismatch arrangement, are financial instruments that bear characteristics of both debt and equity, which often leads to one country characterising the instrument as debt and another characterising it as equity. This difference in characterisation can be exploited to achieve double non-taxation. However, these instruments are not only used for tax arbitrage, but also for real business reasons. Various rules against mismatches from hybrid financial instruments have been proposed. As an example, the EU amended the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (PSD, 2011 / 96 /EU) with the directive 2014 / 86 /EU to obligate Member States to tax profit distributions that have been deductible by the distributing subsidiary. Wider action against mismatches from hybrid financial instruments has been proposed by the EU in directive proposal COM(2016) 26 final and by the OECD in Action 2 of its 15 -point Action Plan against BEPS. Only one of these anti-hybrid rules, the PSD rule, has been implemented in national laws, although only recently. The other two rules are mere proposals, which together {{with the fact that}} countries have little previous experience of such rules makes a study on them motivated. This thesis examines the feasibility of the EU and OECD measures as one of the tools available to counter mismatches from hybrid financial instruments. It analyses and compares these three rules in order to make observations on their interpretation, problems and mutual compatibility, suggesting improvements where fit. The main research method of this study is the dogmatic method. However, even the comparative method is used when the study ventures into the national implementation solutions of the PSD rule in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. 	 The rules are by no means unproblematic. Compatibility with EU primary law, chiefly the basic freedoms, is highly doubtful. There is thus a risk for these actions to be declared void within the Union. Further, these rules link the domestic tax treatment to that of another jurisdiction (linking rules), which causes complexity. This complexity together with sometimes even poorly drafted rules risks causing undesirable effects, such as mutual incompatibility, double taxation and undue compliance burden for the taxpayer. Therefore, care should be taken before introducing any of these rules...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the taxation of hybrid instruments {{and the impact}} of the new amendments adopted to the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive in Finland. A Government Bill 59 / 2015 proposed the Directive amendments to be implemented to 6 a§ of the Business Income Tax Act (EVL) to tackle <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatch</b> <b>arrangements</b> and to prevent any misuse of the Directive. Hybrid instruments are financial instruments that have both equity and debt characteristics, which makes the classification to either equity or debt difficult. Finnish legislation does not recognize hybrid instruments but the classification in practice follows the legal form of the instrument. Classification problems typically arise when a hybrid loan has equity characteristics but there has been no case law so far where a hybrid loan has been reclassified as equity for tax purposes. Hybrid mismatches are born in cross-border transactions e. g. when hybrid instrument is classified differently in different tax jurisdictions. These arrangements can lead to double non-taxation, i. e. to an outcome where the income generated by the instrument is not taxed anywhere. Lately, EU and OECD have aimed to prevent aggressive tax planning and the amendments to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive are part of EU's larger plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion. Amendments aim to refrain from granting the Directive benefits, i. e. tax exemption on direct investment dividends in the parent company's Member State, in situations where the same distribution is considered tax deductible in the Member State of the subsidiary. Furthermore, a general anti-abuse clause was adopted to prevent any misuse of the Directive and to ensure a greater consistency in its application in different Member States. It is applicable in situations where the arrangement is not seen "genuine" or if one of its main purposes is tax avoidance. Amendments to the Directive were implemented to Finnish Business Income Tax Act 6 a§ by adding paragraphs 8 and 9, which are applied from tax year 2016 onwards. Impacts to Finnish entities remain somewhat unclear regarding the new anti-abuse rule. Since hybrid instruments are in principle considered as debt, situations where a Finnish entity is a debtor in a hybrid arrangement seem more common than vice versa. Thus, the impact of the new legislation regarding new paragraph 8 is not likely very significant. However, companies' administrative burden will grow, as tax treatment of the dividend distribution in the source state needs to be figured out. The new regulation will also overrule any dividend exemptions in tax treaties, since it is argued {{that the purpose of the}} new regulation is to prevent double non-taxation whereas double tax treaties' purpose is to eliminate double taxation, not to enable it...|$|E
40|$|With recent {{advances}} in post-Newtonian (PN) theory and numerical relativity (NR) it has become possible to construct inspiral-merger-ringdown gravitational waveforms from coalescing compact binaries by combining both descriptions into one complete hybrid signal. It is important to estimate the error of such waveforms. Previous studies have identified the PN contribution as the dominant source of error, which can be reduced by incorporating longer NR simulations. There are two outstanding issues that {{make it difficult to}} determine the minimum simulation length necessary to produce suitably accurate hybrids: (1) the relevant criteria for a signal search is the mismatch between the true waveform and a set of model waveforms, optimized over all waveforms in the model. For discrete hybrids this optimization is not possible. (2) these calculations require that NR waveforms already exist, while ideally we would like to know the necessary length before performing the simulation. Here we overcome these difficulties by developing a general procedure that allows us to estimate <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatch</b> errors without numerical data, and to optimize them over all physical parameters. Using this procedure we find that, contrary to some earlier studies, ~ 10 NR orbits before merger allow for the construction of waveform families that are accurate enough for detection in a broad range of parameters, only excluding highly spinning, unequal-mass systems. Nonspinning binaries, even with high mass-ratio (> 20) are well modeled for astrophysically reasonable component masses. In addition, the parameter bias is only of the order of 1 % for total mass and symmetric mass-ratio and less than 0. 1 for the dimensionless spin magnitude. We take the view that similar NR waveform lengths will remain {{the state of the art}} in the Advanced detector era, and begin to assess the limits of the science that can be done with them...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of the gravitational-wave (GW) signal from inspiraling compact binaries is essential to detect these signatures in the data from GW interferometers. With recent advances in post- Newtonian (PN) theory and numerical relativity (NR) it has become possible to construct inspiral-mergerringdown waveforms by combining both descriptions into one complete hybrid signal. While addressing the reliability of such waveforms in different points of the physical parameter space, previous studies have identified the PN contribution as the dominant source of error, which can be reduced by incorporating longer NR simulations. In this paper we overcome the two outstanding issues that {{make it difficult to}} determine the minimum simulation length necessary to produce suitably accurate hybrids for GW astronomy applications: (1) the relevant criteria for a GW search is the mismatch between the true waveform and a set of model waveforms, optimized over all waveforms in the model, but for discrete hybrids this optimization was not yet possible. (2) these calculations typically require that numerical waveforms already exist, while we develop an algorithm to estimate <b>hybrid</b> <b>mismatch</b> errors without numerical data, which enables us to estimate the necessary NR waveform length before performing the simulation. Our procedure relies on combining supposedly equivalent PN models at highest available order with common data in the NR regime, and their difference serves as a measure of the uncertainty assumed in each waveform. Contrary to some earlier studies, we estimate that � 10 NR orbits before merger should allow for the construction of waveform families that are accurate enough for detection in a broad range of parameters, only excluding highly spinning, unequal-mass systems.

The advantages {{of these devices}} include reduction of sample and reagent requirements and analysis time. The work in this thesis focuses on investigating DNA attachment and hybridization at the solid-liquid interface in a DNA microarray. Methods were developed to investigate the attachment of fluorescently-labeled, amino-modified oligonucleotides probes to surfaces modified with either 1, 4 -phenylene diisothiocyanate or glutaraldehyde. Hybridization of fluorescently-labeled target molecules, 15 nt and 219 nt, was investigated. Fluorescent intensities were imaged with a cooled charge-coupled device mounted on an epifluorescent microscope. Fluorescent intensity was not always proportional to hybridization or attachment levels {{as a result of}} fluorescent quenching, indicating analysis of fluorescent data must be interpreted within a range where fluorescent quenching does not occur in order not to underestimate the degree of attachment or hybridization. Discrimination between perfectly matched <b>hybrids</b> and <b>mismatched</b> <b>hybrids</b> was possible for single-base mismatches {{near the center of the}} probe. The effect of spacer molecule length was also studied. A 3 -fold enhancement in hybridization was found for an increase in polyethylene glycol spacer length from 0 - 54 atoms.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe OECD {{made certain}} {{recommendations}} in its 2014 discussion draft, "Neutralising the Effects of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Mismatch</b> Arrangements", comprising recommendations on domestic law and double tax convention measures. This dissertation assesses the potential implication of these recommendations for South Africa's tax laws and double tax conventions as these relate to cross border financing arrangements between two taxpayers using hybrid instruments or hybrid entities. These <b>hybrid</b> entities and <b>mismatches</b> and which {{give rise to}} mismatch outcomes either through a deduction arising in either jurisdictions or a deduction arising in one jurisdiction without an inclusion in income in the other jurisdiction. This assessment is made to understand how these recommendations could impact on South Africa's tax laws and double tax conventions. This impact is assessed by determining the publically expressed sentiment of the South African government towards the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting proposals and thereafter by assessing how the above noted recommendations may interact with the Income Tax Act and South Africa's double tax conventions to address mismatches {{within the scope of}} this dissertation. This interactions is assessed by: reviewing the treatment of cross border hybrid instrument and hybrid entity arrangements in the Income Tax Act, the withholding tax measures in the Income Tax Act, the treatment of these arrangements in double tax conventions concluded by South Africa, and the interaction of the recommendations in the above OECD report with the Income Tax Act and double tax conventions concluded by South Africa. Conclusions are then drawn from this analysis. The review of publically expressed sentiments of the South African government evidenced support for the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting proposals but also a sensitivity to South Africa's tax sovereignty. The review of the treatment in the Income Tax Act of the arrangements within the scope of this dissertation found that at times the Income Tax Act potentially did not resolve the mismatches of concern and that withholding tax may not have the potential to comprehensively preserve the tax base against these arrangements, particularly taking into account the influence of double tax conventions. The review of the recommendations in the above OECD report found that these recommendations could assist existing domestic tax law measures in addressing the mismatch outcomes of concern, albeit not necessarily comprehensively and potentially at the cost of added complexity. It was also found that the double tax convention recommendations appeared to have limited impact to clarifying and confirming the existing treatment of arrangements involving hybrid entities. These findings are significant as they indicate a support for the OECD's recommendations by the South African government and that the recommendations could assist in addressing the mismatch outcomes addressed in this dissertation...|$|R

The acid {{is produced by}} electrochemical oxidation controlled by an array of independent microelectrodes. Deblocking is complete in a few seconds, when competing sideproduct reactions are minimal. We demonstrate the successful synthesis of 17 mers and discrimination of single base pair <b>mismatched</b> <b>hybrids.</b> Features generated {{in this study are}} 40 mm wide, with sharply defined edges. The synthetic technique may be applicable to fabrication of other molecular arrays...|$|R
40|$|Heteroepitaxy of {{wurtzite}} semiconductors on corundum substrates {{is widely}} used in modern optoelectronic devices, because both crystals {{belong to the same}} hexagonal close-packed system. However, the constituent atoms in the wurtzite structure align in an ideal hexagon within the (0001) plane, whereas those in the corundum structure are displaced due to empty octahedral sites. Herein, we demonstrate that this atomic <b>arrangement</b> <b>mismatch</b> at the interface generates low-angle grain boundaries in epilayers, and step bunching of corundum substrates with an even number of molecular layers can eliminate the boundaries. Furthermore, we propose that the weakened epitaxial relationship between epilayers and substrates also eliminates low-angle grain boundaries, which may be useful for practical applications...|$|R
30|$|Crystalline nanomembranes (NMs) are {{distinguished}} from bulk materials most significantly by thinness, flexibility, nearness of two surfaces or interfaces, and the essential {{fact that in}} some part of their processing, nanomembranes are free of any constraint: they are released from a rigid handling substrate via removal of a sacrificial layer. Unique structural, electronic, and optical properties have been measured for these nanomembranes, both for flat and curled films[1 – 19, 24 – 26]. NMs may be transferred to a large variety of hosts. This ability to transfer has been successfully used for the fabrication of <b>hybrid</b> or highly <b>mismatched</b> single-crystal multilayer stacks and {{for the development of}} bendable and stretchable electronics[2, 4, 18, 20].|$|R
40|$|Meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{initiate}} crossover (CO) recombination, {{which is}} necessary for accurate chromosome segregation, but DSBs may also repair as non-crossovers (NCOs). Multiple recombination pathways with specific intermediates are expected to lead to COs and NCOs. We revisited the mechanisms of meiotic DSB repair and the regulation of CO formation, by conducting a genome-wide analysis of strand-transfer intermediates associated with recombination events. We performed this analysis in a SK 16 S 288 C Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>hybrid</b> lacking the <b>mismatch</b> repair (MMR) protein Msh 2, to allow efficient detection of heteroduplex DNAs (hDNAs). First, we observed that the anti-recombinogenic activity of MMR is responsible for a 20 % drop in CO number, suggesting that in MMR–proficient cells som...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for identifying specific cosmid clones containing recognition sites for "rare cutting" restriction enzymes has been developed. Cosmid clones containing human inserts were selected by hybridisation to human repetitive DNA. An oligonucleotide {{corresponding to the}} NotI recognition site, eight bases long, was labelled and used to probe DNA samples from one hundred cosmids. By optimising the difference in melting characteristics between eight-base perfect match and six-base match/two base <b>mismatch</b> <b>hybrids,</b> {{we were able to}} detect the cosmids containing either NotI (8 bp match) or XmaIII/EagI (6 bp match) sites. The generation of a map for rare cutter sites along a human chromosome, or a chromosome region, should be simplified using this approach, which will enable the identification of a set of "milestones" at intervals of several hundred kilobases (kb) along the DNA sequence...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrent {{methods of}} {{detecting}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations are time consuming, labor intensive, and {{not suitable for}} screening large numbers of samples. A multiplex real-time PCR approach {{presented in this article}} is a hepatitis B virus quantification method that employs the SYBR Green I dye in conjunction with wild-type HBV sequence-specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes. The three short LNA probes distinguished the wild-type strain or three groups of mutants (rt 173, rt 180 /rt 181, and rt 202 /rt 204) depending on perfect-match <b>hybrids</b> or <b>mismatch</b> within one template simultaneously. Primers labeled with quencher minimized the background signals. This sensitive approach could quantify 102 copies of HBV virus, and as low as 1 % mutants among 104 copies of wild-type HBV could be identified. The technique is handy and convenient, requiring only 3. 5  h to analyze 30 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive serum samples. The HBV isolates were confirmed by direct sequencing. Our data indicate that real-time PCR with SYBR Green I dye is a reliable, rapid, and convenient technique for HBV quantification. Furthermore, by incorporating fluorescent LNA probes, this technique becomes handy in identifying and classifying mutations in the HBV polymerase gene. Being sensitive, specific, accurate, rapid, and convenient in nature, this technique could be a suitable diagnostic tool with wide application particularly in cases in which large volumes of clinical samples are handled...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that in situ optical surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy {{can be used}} to monitor hybridization kinetics for unlabeled DNA in tethered monolayer nucleic acid films on gold in the presence of an applied electrostatic field. The dc field can enhance or retard hybridization and can also denature surface-immobilized DNA duplexes. Discrimination between matched and <b>mismatched</b> <b>hybrids</b> is achieved by simple adjustment of the electrode potential. Although the electric field at the interface is extremely large, the tethered single-stranded DNA thiol probes remain bound and can be reused for subsequent hybridization reactions without loss of efficiency. Only capacitive charging currents are drawn; redox reactions are avoided by maintaining the gold electrode potential within the ideally polarizable region. Because of potential-induced changes {{in the shape of the}} surface plasmon resonance curve, we account for the full curve rather than simply the shift in the resonance minimum...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{enormous}} diversity {{and complexity of}} financial instruments, the current taxation of hybrid financial instruments and the remuneration derived therefrom are characterized by a neat division into dividend-generating equity and interest-generating debt {{as well as by}} a coexistence of source- and residence-based taxation. This book provides a comparative analysis of the classification of hybrid financial instruments in the national tax rules currently applied by Australia, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands {{as well as in the}} relevant tax treaties and EU Directives. Moreover, based on selected <b>hybrid</b> financial instruments, <b>mismatches</b> in these tax classifications, which lead to tax planning opportunities and risks and thus are in conflict with the single tax principle, are identified. To address these issues, the author provides reform options that are in line with the dichotomous debt-equity framework, as he/she suggests the coordination of either tax classifications or tax treatments...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{financial}} resources for maintenance have certainly decreased in many fields of application {{due to the}} Global Economic Crisis. In this context, the need for high performing inspections in pavement engineering has become a priority, {{and the use of}} non-destructive techniques has increased. In that respect, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is proving to be {{as one of the most}} promising tools for retrieving both physical and geometrical properties of pavements. In this study, an off-ground GPR system, 1 -GHz centre frequency of investigation, was used for surveying a large-scale rural road network. Data processing was aimed to accurately identify the geometry of pavement layer interfaces. Results showed the high effectiveness and efficiency of such GPR system and procedure. The high productivity, approximately 160 km/day, along with the capability to identify <b>mismatches</b> in layers <b>arrangement,</b> even in case of undisclosed defects, demonstrated the importance of such technique in road inspections. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R
