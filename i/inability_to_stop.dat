5|$|In Lightning Returns, {{after being}} {{released}} from his imprisonment, Snow meets up with Noel and Hope before coming upon the city of Yusnaan and becomes its protector and patron. Over the next five hundred years, he becomes jaded and depressed, brooding on Serah's death and being weighed down by guilt at his <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the world decaying. When Lightning meets up with him, his changed appearance and attitude makes her fear that he has gone insane. When they next meet, Snow reveals his intention to absorb a massive cloud of Chaos {{at the center of}} Yusnaan's palace, transform into a Cie'th and have Lightning kill him as a punishment for his failure. He performs this act and Lightning does battle him, but she manages to reverse the transformation and convince him to keep hoping and help guide Serah to the new world.|$|E

25|$|On September 30, 1995 Damascus opened {{contacts}} with high ranking German CDU MP Heinrich Lummer and intelligence officials in Damascus. The CDU demanded PKK end all its activities in Germany. The PKK demanded {{that it should}} be recognized as a legitimate entity and not as a terrorist organization. The PKK had been banned in Germany in 1993. If the PKK's demand had passed, {{it would be a big}} step for Damascus, not just for the water issues and Hatay demands, but also because a Western country was negotiating with a banned organization. It would be a big blow to Turkey as the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> terrorism in the country could end with balkanization of the region.|$|E

[...] Sontag and Roth argued that the process God’s <b>inability</b> <b>to,</b> for instance, <b>stop</b> the genocide at Auschwitz meant that God was not worthy of worship, since {{there is no point in}} worshipping a God that cannot save us from such atrocities.

50|$|In {{addition}} to chemotherapy, an additive called Didox {{can be added}} to aid in the reduction of drug resistance and further treatment efforts. Didox is used to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) which contributes to the cells resistance of the chemotherapy treatment resulting in a large number of relapse (Wilson 2016). RRM2 is upregulated within these specific Triple Negative cancer cells leading to a higher rate of drug resistance and <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> slow or <b>stop</b> the tumor progression which leads to more aggressive forms of triple negative breast cancer that are often fatal (Wilson 2016).|$|R
25|$|Emperor Yang grew {{dissatisfied}} with Li Yuan and Wang Rengong (王仁恭), {{the governor of}} Mayi Commandery (馬邑, roughly modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), over their <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> incursions by the Eastern Turks (Tujue) and the growing strength of agrarian rebels—particularly the Turk-supported Liu Wuzhou, the Dingyang Khan, who soon rose against Wang and killed him and captured Emperor Yang's secondary palace near Taiyuan. Li Yuan also became fearful due to prophecies circulating throughout the empire that the next emperor would be named Li—and because Emperor Yang had killed another official, Li Hun (李渾) and his clan over his fears that Li Hun's nephew Li Min (李敏, the son-in-law of Emperor Yang's sister Yang Lihua, the Princess Leping) had imperial ambitions.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} half of 1944, Allied attacks on railway {{networks}} had thoroughly frustrated Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. Göring was not at all happy with the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Allied operations over Germany, and he questioned the commitment of several fighter wing leaders who were not flying and personally leading their units on a regular basis. On 11 May 1944, 1,000 B-17 and B-24 bombers of the 8th Air Force attacked vital railway networks in north east Belgium and eastern France, escorted by an even greater number of fighters. Oesau was sick and in bed at the time but, angered by Göring's insinuations, took off with two other fighters of the Headquarters Flight in his [...] "Green 12" [...] Bf 109.|$|E
500|$|Anne Lauenroth of the Anime News Network praised Lenalee's fight {{scenes in}} the anime's sequel D.Gray-man Hallow as she alone defeats {{multiple}} Akumas sent by the Noah Clan. Nevertheless, Lauenroth found Lenalee's <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Allen from leaving the Order sad, but praised the direction of their farewell scene. Thanasis Karavasilis from Manga Tokyo agreed with the direction of Lenalee's actions in Hallow as she becomes one of Allen's last allies when he is being treated as a traitor by his comrades and how she jumps in at the climax of one episode to save him and prove Allen is a friend. Although Lenalee fails to rescue Allen in the end, Karavasilis felt their farewell [...] implied a romantic interaction between them, but joked {{he did not want}} that due to his obsession with her. In addition he liked Lenalee's action scenes calling her [...] "Bat-Lenalee". Karavasilis selected Lenalee as his favorite female character in the series as well {{as one of the best}} parts of Hallow. He also noted that although some fans were annoyed with Shizuka Itō being replaced by Ai Kakuma, he did not mind the change of voice actress for Lenalee.|$|E
5000|$|Newly {{promoted}} Courier Rangers from Otahuhu in Auckland finished fifth, {{followed by}} North Shore United. Rangers played excellently at home, but had difficulty finding the net away, leaving {{them with a}} mid-table finish. Loss of squad members from the previous season weighed against Shore, who were unable to mount any substantial bid to retain their title. Nelson United finished seventh {{for the second year}} in a row, hampered by a seeming <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> score goals. <b>Stop</b> Out trailed them in eighth, largely a result of a dreadful away season which saw them win just one from eleven games on the road.|$|R

I {{walked out}} with Swanston[411] {{for about an}} hour: {{everything}} gloomy as {{the back of the}} chimney when there is no fire in it. My walk was a melancholy one, feeling myself weaker at every step and not very able to speak. This surely cannot be fancy, yet it looks something like it. If I knew but the extent at which my <b>inability</b> was like <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> but every day is worse than another.

50|$|Previously, the Ottoman {{position}} in their Bosnia Vilayet had been {{weakened by the}} 1875-78 Herzegovina Uprising, an armed revolt by the local ethnic Serb population {{that began in the}} Herzegovina region in July 1875 before spreading {{to the rest of the}} vilayet. The uprising lasted more than two years before the Ottomans, aided by the local Muslim population, managed to put it down. During the fall of 1875, inspired and spurred into action by the Serb uprising in the Bosnia Vilayet as well as the Ottoman initial <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> put a <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> it, the exiled Bulgarian revolutionaries operating out of the neighbouring United Romanian Principalities (another de jure Ottoman vassal which was steadily moving towards independence) began planning for their own uprising which began in the spring of 1876. The Ottoman reaction to the Bulgarian insurrection was swift and brutal, leading to many atrocities as well as universal international condemnation as the uprising was put down within months.|$|R

The description in the First Step {{of the life of the}} alcoholic or addict as [...] "unmanageable" [...] refers to the lack of choice that the mind of the addict or alcoholic affords concerning whether to drink or use again.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Wireless capsule {{endoscopy}} for gastrointestinal (GI) tract is {{a modern}} technology {{that has the potential}} to replace conventional endoscopy techniques. Capsule endoscopy is a pill-shaped device embedded with a camera, a coin battery and a data transfer. Without a locomotion system, this capsule endoscopy can only passively travel inside the GI tract via natural peristalsis, thus causing several disadvantages such as <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> control and <b>stop,</b> and risk of capsule retention. Therefore, a locomotion system needs to be added to optimize the current capsule endoscopy. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art locomotion methods along with the desired locomotion features such as size, speed, power and temperature and compares properties of different methods. In addition, properties and motility mechanisms of the GI tract are described. The main purpose of this review is to understand the features of GI tract and diverse locomotion methods {{in order to create a}} future capsule endoscopy compatible with GI tract properties.

2500|$|In 1933 Wilson was {{committed}} to the Charles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions in New York City four times {{under the care of}} Dr. William D. Silkworth. Silkworth's theory was that alcoholism was a matter of both physical and mental control: [...] a craving, the manifestation of a physical allergy (the physical <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> drinking once started) and an obsession of the mind (to take the first drink). Wilson gained hope from Silkworth's assertion that alcoholism was a medical condition rather than a moral failing, but even that knowledge could not help him. He was eventually told that he would either die from his alcoholism or have to be locked up permanently due to Wernicke encephalopathy (commonly referred to as [...] "wet brain").|$|E
2500|$|In late 880, as {{the major}} agrarian rebel Huang Chao was {{approaching}} Chang'an, the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi, in order to deflect blame for the imperial forces' <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Huang, blamed the leading chancellor Lu Xi for erroneous strategies and had Lu demoted. [...] (Lu, in response, committed suicide.) [...] Wang and Pei Che were made chancellors (with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事)) to replace Lu. [...] However, on the same day, news arrived that Huang was about to attack Chang'an. [...] Tian took Emperor Xizong and fled toward Chengdu, and the officials scrambled to either try to follow the emperor or to hide. [...] Wang tried to follow the emperor in flight, but {{in his attempt to}} do so fell into a bush in a valley and was injured. [...] He was captured by Huang's soldiers, who took him back to Chang'an, where Huang had declared himself emperor of a new state of Qi. [...] Huang tried to force Wang to accept a commission in the Qi government, but Wang pretended to have been so severely injured that he could not speak, even when swords were placed against him. [...] Huang had Wang returned to his mansion to recuperate, under close watch, and he sent doctors to treat Wang. [...] After about a month, though, when the guards had relaxed, Wang disguised himself as a merchant and fled to Hezhong (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). [...] He submitted a report to Emperor Xizong (who was then at Chengdu), and Emperor Xizong had him remotely made the minister of defense (兵部尚書, Bingbu Shangshu).|$|E

Two weigh in events were held within one day, carefully planned by the Green promotion team to aid in weight draining Cameron and ensuring {{he was not able}} to re-hydrate to a decent level. Referee Pat Russell was criticized for his <b>inability</b> and inclination <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Green using Rabbit punches and excessive holding. Following the fight, Green revealed that he had fought with broken ribs as a result of a training injury received several weeks before the fight. Green conceded about [...] to Cameron (the Commonwealth champion), and said of his opponent [...] "I'm proud I did it against a warrior and a much respected athlete." ...|$|R
