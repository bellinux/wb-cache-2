5|$|The match {{began as}} a scrappy affair, with plenty of {{challenges}} and little expansive football on show. The game's first notable chance went to Rooney, but Kolo Touré intervened and blocked his effort. Rooney then played in Giggs, whose shot was closed down by Sol Campbell. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> before Arsenal gained composure and played their usual passing game, and a move involving Edu and Fredrik Ljungberg in the 19th minute resulted in Rio Ferdinand carelessly tackling the latter. Ferdinand was not shown a card for his challenge – the first controversial decision referee Riley made during the match, which surprised Arsenal as the defender made a professional foul to prevent Ljungberg running clear on goal. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Reyes {{to open up the}} United defence, but the Dutchman's shot was saved by Roy Carroll. The United goalkeeper was on hand to save Henry's low shot three minutes before the break, after the striker was put through by Edu. During the first half action, both Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) were booked for fouling Reyes. Ashley Cole also received a yellow card for his tackle on Rooney. The Arsenal defender was {{on the receiving end of}} a challenge by Van Nistelrooy minutes after, as he attempted to shield the ball and hold on to possession. Television replays showed Van Nistelrooy ran his studs down Cole's shins, but the striker was not punished by Riley despite the action being in full view of his assistant at the touchline.|$|E

It could produce no more than 300PS (295bhp/224kW) and must be Rear-Wheel-Drive. The power was limited by air restrictors placed in the engine bay. The gearbox was a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the Super GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to be competitive, only being consistently at the top during the 2009 season.|$|E

However, the poor performances of the TF106 in the opening two races of the season, particularly in Bahrain where the team had finished on the podium 12 months earlier, prompted disagreement over the team's technical direction. Gascoyne disliked the corporate way the team's management operated while team management were unimpressed by the TF106 car Gascoyne had produced and he was duly dismissed. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> for Toyota to replace the technical director, eventually promoting Pascal Vasselon to the role, saying that a technical department run by one man alone was becoming old fashioned.|$|E

25|$|In East Germany, {{the head}} of the central {{pharmacy}} control commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of glutamic acid. Meanwhile, in West Germany, it took some time before the increase in dysmelia {{at the end of the}} 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958 Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in Bayreuth wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children. Based on this, FDP whip Erich Mende requested an official statement from the federal government. For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide. After the Nazi regime with its Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various crimes, western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor congenital disorders in a similarly strict way. The parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia. Also the DFG research project installed after the Mende request was not helpful. The project was led by pathologist Franz Büchner who ran the project to propagate his teratological theory. Büchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons. Furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to install a Surgeon General in Germany; the Federal Ministry of Health (Germany) was not founded until 1962, some months after thalidomide was banned from the market. In Germany approximately 2,500 thalidomide babies were born.|$|E

500|$|The First Strike was Kamei's first movie, and {{he wanted}} to rely on an {{experienced}} screenwriter. He eventually requested Reiko Yoshida's help as the Tales series had a strong female fanbase and thus needed [...] "feminine sensitiveness" [...] in designing the script.

He started from the director of photography, Kazuhiro Yamada, who he personally insisted to join the production.

While he appreciated the new characters that join the series, specifically MacLachlan's portrayal of Cal, he felt Triplett was [...] "never fully utilized", which made his death in the midseason finale less impactful. Additionally, Goldman criticized the tie-in to Age of Ultron, calling it [...] "forced" [...] and distracting from the Inhuman/S.H.I.E.L.D. 2.0 storylines. Nick Hogan at TV Overmind rated the season 9 out of 10 stars, calling it, [...] "for the most part, a very enjoyable season of television."
