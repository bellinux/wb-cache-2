5|$|The {{origin of}} the coat of arms of Póvoa de Varzim is unknown, but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> local traits and symbolism. The coat of arms {{consists}} of a golden sun and a silver moon; in the middle a golden cross completed by two anchor silver arms, representing safety at sea. Over the cross, a ring, of which falls a golden rosary that interlaces with the anchor arms, representing faith and divine protection. The crest is made of five silver towers due to its city status. The flag is broken in blue and white. Between 1939 and 1958, a different coat of Arms and flag were used, which the population criticized; it consisted of a golden shield, covered by a red net, the sea and a black Poveiro boat; the flag was plain red. The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "The Job" [...] 8.2/10. He {{believed}} that the episode [...] "pulled off some rather brilliant turns" [...] with the storylines concerning Jan and Jim, Karen, and Pam. Fickett opined however that the episode was at its weakest during the Dwight's take-over scenes in Scranton, as he knew Michael would be returning. He concluded his review on a more positive note by commenting that Ryan's selection [...] "makes for some interesting scenarios for next season. All in all this was a funny episode that wrapped up some key story lines while still leaving open some questions to be answered next season. It wasn't a home run finale, but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> us eagerly await the fall premiere." [...] AOL TV contributor Jay Black highlighted scenes he found humorous, including Dwight's preferred choice of an assistant and Michael's reaction to Jan's implants. He gave the episode [...] "7 Shrute Bucks out of 7." [...] Various cast members were also lauded for their performances, including Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski, and Melora Hardin.|$|E
500|$|Fonda, in The Huffington Post, {{said she}} regretted {{some of the}} {{language}} used in the original protest letter and how it [...] "was perhaps too easily misunderstood. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers." [...] She continued, writing [...] "the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens." [...] Fonda emphasized that she, [...] "in no way, support the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people." [...] Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to The Huffington Post rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as [...] "a strong supporter and friend of Israel".|$|E

[...] In one of the first major-daily newspaper reviews, Frank Lovece of Newsday lauded the film's [...] "emotional truth [...] pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science" [...] that made it [...] "faithful to the source material while updating it [...] and recognizing what's made that material so enduring isn't just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit, but the human condition that got him there". A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film [...] "an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least – since <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> its problems – a superhero movie that's good in unusual ways." [...] Among the specialty press, Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons commended the [...] "impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG", and said, [...] "Robert Downey Jr., along with director Jon Favreau [...] help this rise above formula. The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes".|$|E
2500|$|American-born British {{journalist}} Janet Daley {{remarked that}} the uproar in the French media over Strauss-Kahn's treatment {{missed the point}} about America's robustly open society: [...] "The U.S. does not like secrets. Its political culture takes as a basic premise that nothing should take place {{out of the public}} view except the most critical life-or-death security matters[...] [...] And <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> no privacy law of the kind that has protected the great and powerful in France for generations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by Thomas Hardy's play 'The Famous Tragedy of The Queen of Cornwall' the English {{composer}} Rutland Boughton, ( [...] 1878-1960), {{composed the}} music-drama 'The Queen of Cornwall' in 1923/24. The first performance {{took place at}} the Glastonbury Festival on August 21, 1924. Already famous for 'The Immortal Hour' and 'Bethlehem', Boughton's growth as a unique and powerful operatic composer is evident in this treatment of the Tristram and Isolde legend. Feeling that Hardy's play offered too much unrelieved grimness he received the playwright's permission to import a handful of lyrics from his earlier published poetical works. The result is an altogether impressive and effective work, thought by many to be Boughton's masterpiece in this genre. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> been well-served by its 2010 recording on the Dutton Epoch label, in which Ronald Corp conducts the New London Orchestra, members of the London Chorus and with soloists [...] Neal Davies ( [...] King Mark), Heather Shipp ( [...] Queen Iseult), Jacques Imbrailo ( [...] Sir Tristam) and Joan Rodgers ( [...] Iseult of Brittany [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|While most press {{coverage}} {{continued to be}} positive, with criticism only from leftist publications like The Nation and The New Republic, one attorney raised the first noteworthy protest. Francis Fisher Kane, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, resigned in protest. In his letter of resignation to the President and the Attorney General he wrote: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} the policy of raids against large numbers of individuals is generally unwise and very apt to result in injustice. People not really guilty are likely to be arrested and railroaded through their hearings....We appear to be attempting to repress a political party....By such methods we drive underground and make dangerous what was not dangerous before." [...] Palmer replied that he could not use individual arrests to treat an [...] "epidemic" [...] and asserted his own fidelity to constitutional principles. He added: [...] "The Government should encourage free political thinking and political action, but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> the right for its own preservation to discourage and prevent the use of force and violence to accomplish that which ought to be accomplished, if at all, by parliamentary or political methods." [...] The Washington Post endorsed Palmer's claim for urgency over legal process: [...] "There is no time to waste on hairsplitting over infringement of liberties." ...|$|E

We've always had trouble dealing with racial issues on film, so, in that regard, the film could be a landmark." [...] Claire Sutherland, in her review for the Herald Sun (Melbourne) wrote, [...] "A love letter to the Australian landscape and our history, Australia has international blockbuster written all over it", and Sydney's The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Kidman's screen presence {{is nothing short of}} radiant." [...] In his review for The Australian (Sydney), David Stratton wrote, [...] "It's not the masterpiece that we were hoping for, but I think you could say that it's a very good film in many ways. While it will be very popular with many people I think there's a slight air of disappointment after it all. Despite its flaws — and <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> flaws — I think Australia is an impressive and important film." [...] Mark Naglazas of The West Australian (Perth) accused positive reviews from News Ltd press outlets of being manipulated by 20th Century Fox, as they are all owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, calling Australia a film of [...] "unrelenting awfulness" [...] that [...] "lurches drunkenly from crazy comedy to Mills and Boonish melodrama {{in the space of a}} couple of scenes".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E

2500|$|Rating {{the film}} 4/5 stars, Eye for Film commented that [...] "Of all the {{films in the}} Texas Chainsaw series, this is {{probably}} the least gory, a fact that will no doubt disappoint some fans. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> its moments and those disturbed by gore should still approach it with caution, but it's nothing like as gratuitous as much of what has gone before. Events happen to serve the story more than the theme. Horror is found in different places." [...] Staci Wilson of Dread Central wrote that [...] "Not to say I loved Leatherface - It’s far too disgusting for my taste (I'm okay with gore, but there's some gooey necrophilia in this flick that I felt was just thrown in for the ick of it), and there are too many plot holes. Still, it's a very well made film, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the acting is aces across the board", giving a final verdict of 3/5 stars. Anton Bitel of SciFiNow appraised, [...] "In spite, or perhaps because, of all the splatter and excess, this still does not come close to the elusively non-explicit horrors of the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even as it serves as their grim rites of passage. If 'Nobody messes with our family' is the ultimate message, then Maury and Bustillo certainly maintain a respectful continuity to reunite the old clan, as Jed pieces together his future identity from the different influences around him." [...] For being what he called [...] "the most entertaining and pleasing TCM film since 1974's classic", ComingSoon.Net writer Jerry Smith gave the prequel a positive review. He assessed that [...] "Do we really need yet another horror icon origin story and if so, would the explanation be anything we haven't seen before? The answers to these questions are quite refreshing", contrasting the origin story given to that of [...] as having been able to [...] "acknowledge what came before it without ever seeming like a wink-wink to the previous films in the series". V.O.D.zillas Matthew Turner assigned a 6.2 rating, opining [...] "This Texas Chainsaw prequel lacks the original's terror but gets by on style, strong performances and a bucket or two of the red stuff." ...|$|E
