500|$|... "Polkarama!", {{a medley}} of popular hit songs set to a polka beat, was {{recorded}} during the second parody session. Yankovic explained that, [...] "if there’s a song that I think is really ripe for parody but I just can’t think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it’ll {{end up in the}} polka medley." [...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley. Fans would be rioting in the streets, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't do a polka medley." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level for me. It was just weird and creepy, but I think the whole idea was distasteful to me." [...] He later bluntly {{concluded}} that [...] "it's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn't done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suggest nothing," [...] {{answered}} Wilding, unmoved. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>I</b> state. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> {{thought a}} man's honour imperilled in this service, {{you would not}} see me at this table now. I can make you no more convincing answer." ...|$|R

500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Gregory of Time {{wrote of}} Lin's zero Division I {{scholarship}} offers: [...] " [...] was scrawny, but don't doubt {{that a little}} racial profiling, intentional or otherwise, contributed to his underrecruitment." [...] Diepenbrock stated, [...] "If [...] was African American or Caucasian, {{it might have been}} a different deal"; he did not think Lin's race affected his recruiting until later seeing 10 Division I coaches express interest in a black student who Diepenbrock assessed as [...] "a nice junior college player". Lin said: [...] "I'm not saying top-5 state automatically gets you offers, but I do think [...] did affect the way coaches recruited me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were a different race, I would've been treated differently." [...] Walters added, [...] "People who don't think stereotypes exist are crazy. If [...] white, he's either a good shooter or heady. If he's Asian, he's good at math. We're not taking him." [...] During Lin's college career, fewer than 0.5% of men's Division 1 basketball players were Asian-American.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{tired of}} it," [...] I said. [...] "I {{want to come}} to grips with all these Rawdons. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> perhaps <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was hungry and savage I could talk to hungry men--" ...|$|R

500|$|The glass cage might imply {{a vacuum}} that the figure's voice {{is unable to}} escape; {{as if it is}} {{screaming}} in silence. Rueful later in life, Bacon said that he had [...] "wanted to paint the scream more than the horror. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream, it would have made the scream... more successful". The work evokes memories of the Second World War. The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann's 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court, when he was held within a similar cage. Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though, and stated that he used the device so he could frame and [...] "really see the image—for no other reason. I know it's been interpreted as being many other things." [...] Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity. Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to Orwellian [...] "shouting voices... and trembling hands... convey the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation." ...|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{closed session}} {{as a result}} of {{security}} constraints, U.S. Representative William Dickinson (R-Alabama) told Lavelle, [...] "I am not sure why we are here today. But <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had been in your position, I would have done the very same thing. And if that means stretching the rules is part of it, then good for you." [...] Dickinson blamed the [...] "crazy rules for this crazy war which has no parallel or anything to compare with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your wish was an {{unreasonable}} one," [...] she protested. [...] "Linda and I were school-girls together. She is my dearest friend {{and she is}} a hopeless invalid. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to desert her she would die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it weren't for Laura," [...] she said, [...] "you'd find {{it pretty}} hard to keep me away. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could see the {{handcuffs}} put on that man, {{it would be the}} happiest moment of my life." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think,</b> however, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> now say {{briefly and}} clearly what I meant my hearers to understand, and what I wanted, and still would fain have, them to do, there may {{afterwards}} be found some better {{service in the}} passionately written text.|$|R
2500|$|The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh {{were present}} at the {{coronation}} of her brother, Tsar Alexander III, in Moscow in May 1883. Their family was completed {{with the birth of}} a fourth daughter, Princess Beatrice, born at Eastwell on 20 April 1884. Years later, the Duchess lamented her failure to have more children: [...] "The only real heavenly moment is the birth of the child. This cannot be compared to anything else. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had even a dozen children I would have kept the same feeling." [...] In July 1884, they traveled to Ilinskoe, outside Moscow, to visit Maria’s younger brother Grand Duke Sergei, who had married Queen Victoria’s granddaughter Elisabeth of Hesse.|$|E
2500|$|In Gillette's rented room, {{authorities}} confiscated Brown's {{love letters}} to Gillette as evidence. District attorney George Ward read the letters aloud {{to the court}} during the trial {{in the fall of}} 1906, and Brown's letters gave the trial national attention. Brown pleaded with Gillette in the letters to accept responsibility for her condition, the pregnancy. In her final letter, written July 5, Brown looked forward to her impending Adirondack trip with Gillette, and she said farewell to her childhood home of South Otselic, wishing she could confess her pregnancy to her mother: [...] "I know I shall never see any of them again. And mamma! Great heavens, how I do love Mamma! I don't know what I shall do without her (...) Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could tell mamma, but I can't. She has trouble enough as it is, and I couldn't break her heart like that. If I come back dead, perhaps if she does not know, she won't be angry with me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 February 2016, {{a series}} {{representative}} confirmed Grimshaw's {{departure from the}} judging panel, confirming: [...] "We are sad {{to see him go}} but wish him all the best." [...] On 5 April 2016, Fernandez-Versini announced her departure from the series, choosing instead to concentrate on her music career. On 10 May, Ora confirmed she would not return for the 13th series of the show. On 1 June 2016, the line-up for series 13 was confirmed as Cowell, Scherzinger, Osbourne and Walsh. In December 2016, Walsh confirmed we would continue to judge the series through 2018, stating he had signed through [...] "the next two years". That same month, both Osbourne and Scherzinger cast doubt on their return, with Osbourne citing her dual-work on The Talk, and Scherzinger stating: [...] "I can't confirm that I'm going to [...] but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did return {{it would have to be}} with this panel because I'm really close with this panel. [...] I've really enjoyed myself and we're really close." [...] On 13 April 2017, Cowell announced his intentions to retain the same judging panel for the fourteenth series. In June 2017, it was announced that the judging panel would remain the same as the previous series.|$|E

6000|$|The doctor stood {{silent for}} a moment, and then he said, [...] "I am not a love-making man myself, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were much {{in love with a}} young lady I should not write such a letter as that to her father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am thankful," [...] she answered, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> bide here much longer, with {{ghosts and}} {{memories}} for company, I shall go mad," [...] and {{she glanced at}} a spot near by, where the earth showed signs of recent disturbance.|$|R
