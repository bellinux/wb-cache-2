500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post {{praised the}} scene in which Yang broke down to Meredith, noting the {{exceptional}} chemistry between them. Pascua was positive of the storyline between Torres, Carlos, and Robbins, writing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see {{an emphasis on the}} gay storyline. Adam Bryant of TV Guide wrote that Baker's character [...] "seems like the only decent guy in the bunch", though PopSugar asserted that Williams' character [...] "proves to be most likable of the new doctors".|$|E
500|$|Compared to [...] "Colonel Homer", Lurleen's {{comeback}} episode [...] "Papa Don't Leech" [...] received rather negative {{reviews from}} television critics. Richard Keller of TV Squad expressed dislike for the episode, stating {{that he hopes}} the show will reconsider {{the next time they}} decide to give a [...] "solo opportunity" [...] to a one-off character [...] "many people don't remember". Robert Canning of IGN said, [...] "there were too few laugh-out-loud moments in this lackluster episode. Overall, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see Lurleen again, but she'd probably get more laughs in future cameos than in carrying an entire episode." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1987, he {{was chosen}} to captain the England B team in a match against the full {{national}} team of Malta, but {{it was to be}} his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described {{as one of the best}} defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, [...] "I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). He came up to me and said 'I should have capped you'. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be a little disappointed I didn't get one." ...|$|E
500|$|The press {{were given}} {{advanced}} {{copies of the}} episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> {{get that kind of}} space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.|$|E
500|$|Several film reviewers drew precise {{parallels}} between the film and certain superhero comic books, like Powers, Watchmen, Fantastic Four, and The Avengers. Indeed, the producers of the 2005 adaptation of Fantastic Four were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to The Incredibles. Bird was not surprised that comparisons arose due to superheroes being [...] "the most well-trod turf on the planet," [...] but noted {{that he had not}} been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of Watchmen. He did comment that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be compared to it, since [...] "if you're going to be compared to something, it's nice if it's something good".|$|E

500|$|The {{staff were}} {{concerned}} over the animation of the characters' {{eyes in the}} episode, as the pupils were larger than normal, making the characters look [...] "stoned", and the eyeballs were [...] "too round" [...] and large. The animation artists at the animation studio in South Korea, {{where much of the}} animation process takes place, had begun stenciling the eyes with a template, which according to Lynch resulted in [...] "strangely round eyes which look a little too big sometimes and much too perfect. Which is very un-Simpsons like." [...] Marge was designed with shorter hair in the flashback sequences to make her appear younger. Lynch thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see Marge in a [...] "younger, more attractive mode, and sort of watching her progress through pregnancy." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick. Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role".|$|E
500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought {{it sounded like}} a title The Beta Band would use. Taylor supported the name [...] "IV" [...] because he liked [...] "giving people the wrong impression all the time", and defended his opinion, saying [...] "if [...] give us any time, they would see that we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E

500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Cindy White {{praised the}} writing for Deangelo's character saying that [...] "Ferrell {{is much better}} carrying the show on his own than being second banana to Carell. It seemed like he was having more fun with the role in this episode". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. New Yorks Phoebe Reilly wrote that [...] "while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see the staff responding to someone new, it didn't feel like enough to make an audience antsy to come back after a long summer." [...] Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly also gave the episode a mediocre review commenting that [...] "judging by tonight's episode alone, {{the transition from the}} Carell era to the post-Carell era is going to be shaky, to say the least". [...] "The Inner Circle" [...] was voted the fourth lowest-rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally. In another poll, the episode was voted the third lowest-rated episode out of 24 episode out of 24 from the seventh season and was rated 6.86 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{praised the}} episode and specific elements of it, like Michael {{wandering around the}} office drunk {{and many of the}} documentary-style interviews, like Charles talking about his effect on women, Toby comparing Michael to a movie on a plane and Kevin being too lazy to compliment Michael in person. But he said the episode was [...] "elevated" [...] by Michael and Pam forming a partnership at the end: [...] "Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer are always brilliant in those moments when they have to show multiple emotions at once, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> finally see them get to do it side-by-side." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Jerry's Painting" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis {{called the}} episode [...] "one that may just {{have been the}} season's best — and that’s saying something when a show is as consistent as this one". She called the main plotline about the painting [...] "brilliant" [...] and said the subplot with Ben, April and Andy was so funny she hoped they had more pairings in the future. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic called [...] "Jerry's Painting" [...] {{one of the strongest}} episodes of the season, and said he enjoyed seeing Leslie's character so empowered. McHatton also praised seeing April and Andy facing adulthood, writing, [...] "It's something many of us young adults go through and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see it reflected" [...] in the characters. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said the show demonstrated how Leslie Knope has developed into a strong and confident character since the [...] "daffy, wide-eyed dreamer" [...] she was in the first season. He also praised the show's [...] "new funniest pairing" [...] of Ben, April and Andy, and said the episode demonstrated that [...] "even this late in the season, the show can still feel surprising and fresh".|$|E

500|$|TV Guides Matt Mitovich {{observed}} that [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] was the [...] "best {{episode of the}} season" [...] as it [...] "kept all of the comedy rooted in the actual storylines". He wrote that the Tracy story was [...] "packed [...] plenty of amusement", and that the character's spending problem was [...] "funny for the sight gags alone". Mitovich commented that Hayek's character was [...] "one of Jack's best matches yet". Jeremy Median of Paste opined that [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] featured one of the [...] "funniest sight gags in 30 Rock history", referring to Tracy wearing a coat made out of money, shoes made of gold, and [...] "a Mad Hatter-like hat made out of money, as only Tracy could pull off." [...] He also wrote that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be reminded of Liz's [...] "baby-cravings, a story that's been bubbling on the surface {{for a while now}} but reemerged here." [...] Nathan Rabin for The A.V. Club noted that this episode [...] "juggled its various lovestruck plots with aplomb", and gave this episode an A−. Rabin liked all the plots, but most enjoyed Jenna's story of her trying to play Janis Joplin.|$|E
500|$|On the character's {{transformation}} Dawson told Digital Spy {{that when}} Darren was younger he was [...] "just a horrible child {{and he had}} nothing nice to say about anyone" [...] before Darren matured and softened. Dawson added that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see a different side to the character. Dawson later added that the character's change was good as [...] "everyone goes through changes in their life and Darren just hit that time. It was good timing for him". He also explained that his character becoming a father led him to develop and mature further, stating that Darren accepted his responsibilities as a father and [...] "tries hard {{to be the father}} that he wants to be". He felt that Darren enjoyed being a father and that it made him feel [...] "complete and like he has a purpose in life, whereas before he was always chasing his tail". Dawson felt that as time went on, Darren became more helpful, sympathetic and more empathetic towards other characters, especially Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre). Dawson stated, [...] "It's very uncharacteristic but Darren is softening up". Dawson added that Darren's difficult life has led him to mature and act like a [...] "bit of a saint", but that Darren was still greatly misunderstood.|$|E
500|$|Hoping to {{continue}} the series, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder: Doggett. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, with only about ten considered by the producers. Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees, and Phillips, Bochner and Bruce Campbell were considered for the role. In particular, Campbell, following his involvement with the sixth season episode [...] "Terms of Endearment", was considered, but, due to a contractual obligation, could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed {{him out of the}} role". In the end, the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. Reportedly, Patrick was cast {{due to the fact that}} his featured role in [...] (1991) would attract a great 18- to 35-year-old male demographic to the show. In fact, Fox executives reported a 10 percent overall increase in the demographic, solely due to Patrick's casting.|$|E

[...] Discussing the character {{in terms of her}} relationship with Hahn, Williams was largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] LGBT website AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Sloan's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] AfterEllen.com included Torres in their list of the Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking her at No. 6 and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters.

500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be able to – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first time}} Karofsky {{received}} significant notice from critics {{was for the}} second season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience {{as much as it}} did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and [...] "emotionally unsound". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as The Atlantic Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on [...] "Furt" [...] of the bullying storyline as a [...] "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved". In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially was a smart move. Up until now, he's been kind of a walking cliché, and now he gets to be someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies." [...] Reiter commented, [...] "And best of all, we got to watch Karofsky's character develop a bit more. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing." ...|$|E
