50|$|Distinguished in {{plan form}} and massing {{from the other}} {{buildings}} in the group, J Block was opened in 1915 accommodating the trades workshops. The planning and siting of the building reflect the consideration given to massing and ventilation suitable for accommodating noisy and often <b>hot</b> <b>workshops.</b> Further pavilions (K block 1920, R block 1929, W block 1956) have been constructed west of J Block to accommodate additional workshops and teaching spaces. The first floor workshops have been altered during the 1996-98 refurbishment to accommodate architecture and interior design studios in a mezzanine inserted into these workshop spaces. The building retains its general planning arrangement.|$|R

5000|$|The {{band was}} a popular fixture of the Tempe music scene in the 1990s, when Tempe was being dubbed as [...] "The Next Seattle" [...] by music reps, and as a region that would produce many new, talented bands that would be ripe for {{national}} discovery. [...] The band got their start at a Tempe club named Long Wong's, {{which at the time}} {{was at the center of}} downtown Tempe's music scene and the starting point for bands such as the Gin Blossoms, The Refreshments and The Pistoleros, who all (including Dead <b>Hot</b> <b>Workshop)</b> signed with major record labels in the 1990s. During the mid-1990s, the band toured using a used 1992 van named [...] "Sugar", that the Gin Blossoms had taken on tour ten times before Dead <b>Hot</b> <b>Workshop</b> acquired it. The band released its album White House and then EP River Otis in 1994.|$|E

50|$|After he {{returned}} to Tempe, Hopkins started another band, The Chimeras, with brothers Lawrence and Mark Zubia.

It would be the last band he ever played with in public as a member, though he appeared on stage with Dead <b>Hot</b> <b>Workshop</b> and Hans Olson in Tucson shortly before his death. The Chimeras later changed their name to The Pistoleros, upon signing a short-lived recording contract. The first several singles released by the Gin Blossoms, and the only mainstream hit released by the Pistoleros prior to being dropped by their label, were penned by Hopkins.|$|E
40|$|We have {{observed}} 51 high mass star forming cores associated with water masers at 350 micron. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and dust continuum normalized radial intensity profiles were modeled for 28 sources using a one-dimensional dust radiative transfer code assuming a power law density {{distribution in the}} envelope n = n_ 0 (r/r_ 0) ^{-p}. The best fit density power law exponent, p, ranged from 1. 0 to 2. 5 with a mean value of p = 1. 72. We determined the dust masses for the modeled cores and found a mean mass of 209 M_{sun}.

San Francisco, Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 2002. We {{have found}} that {{methanol}} masers provide a signpost to the very earliest stages of the massive star formation process, {{before the onset of}} the UCHII region phase. They are invariably associated with embedded sources whose bolometric luminosities suggest they will soon become OB stars. Outflows frequently occur, and hot molecular cores are also associated with them. The absence of nearby UCHII regions implies that some cores must be internally heated. We also find cold sub-mm cores that do not have any other signposts of star formation. We suggest these may represent the earliest stages in the massive star formation process, soon after cloud collapse has begun...|$|R
