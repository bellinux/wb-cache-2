25|$|Water use {{is about}} 83.5 km3, or 20% of water {{availability}} {{in an average}} year. However, there are large variations in the utilization rate between years and regions. For example, in the coastal part of the Kantō region that includes Tokyo the utilization rate is over 90% in a <b>dry</b> <b>year.</b> In the relatively dry north of Kyushu {{it is more than}} 50%. Of the total use 55.2 km3 was for agriculture, 16.2 km3 for domestic use and 12.1 km3 for industrial use. Despite the introduction of water-saving devices domestic per capita use declined only slightly from 322 liter per capita per day in 2000 to 314 in 2004. Per capita water use thus is slightly lower than in the United States (371 liter in 2005) and more than twice as high as in Germany (122 liter in 2007) or in England (145 liter in 2009).|$|E
25|$|National {{overview}} of water resources. Water resources are scarce in Burkina Faso. Water availability varies greatly between regions and seasons, {{as well as}} from year to year. In the South, average rainfall is as high as 1,200mm during a six-month wet season, while in the North the wet season lasts only three months and rainfall is only 300mm. The only rivers in the country that carry water all year around are the Mouhoun River (Black Volta) and the Nakambe River (White Volta), the other rivers carrying water only during the wet season. Building dams has been the most common way of storing water for the dry season, even though evaporation can reach 2,000mm/year thus causing substantial water losses from open reservoirs. A substantial portion of surface water resources is shared with neighboring countries. For example, the Nakambe River - the main source of supply for the capital, Ouagadougou - and the Mouhoun River are shared with Ghana. Surface water resources vary between 8 billion cubic meters (BCM)/year in an average year and 4 BCM in a <b>dry</b> <b>year.</b> The lower figure corresponds to less than 300 cubic meters per capita and year, which is well below the level of 1,000 cubic meters per capita and year that is considered the threshold for “water stress”.|$|E

Characterised by moderate to high year-round temperatures, even in the foothills, its rainfall is seasonal but heavy—typically above [...] per year. Most rainfall occurs between May and November; this moisture is enough to sustain lush forests and other vegetation {{for the rest of}} the mainly <b>dry</b> <b>year.</b> December to March are the driest months, when days with precipitation are rare.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{research}} was to study differences in groundwater runoff parameters development under different geological conditions, with the emphasis to extreme climatic conditions in <b>dry</b> <b>years.</b> Groundwater runoff parameters, represented by values of the base flow, groundwater recharge and groundwater storage were modelled using the BILAN model, which is a lumped parameter hydrological model. Three sub-catchments were selected – the Upper Nitra, Upper Poprad and Upper Topľa in the Western Carpathians. The catchments differ not only by geological, but also by climatic conditions. The {{results showed that the}} lowest groundwater runoff represented by the specific groundwater runoff values forms in the crystalline rocks of the Vysoké Tatry Mts. The highest values were obtained in the Upper Nitra River sub-catchment. Results obtained by hydrological model were compared with values of groundwater runoff calculated using the method of Kille and the BFI+ 2 model. Different years were identified in evaluated catchments as the <b>dry</b> <b>years.</b> While in the Upper Nitra River sub-catchment, years 1983 and 1989 were identified as <b>dry</b> <b>years,</b> in the Poprad and Topľa River sub-catchments, the <b>driest</b> <b>years</b> were 1986 (in both catchments) and 1982 (Topľa) and 1993 (Poprad).

2500|$|Conditional {{differentiation}} (sometimes called temporal niche partitioning) {{occurs when}} species {{differ in their}} competitive abilities based on varying environmental conditions. For example, in the Sonoran Desert, some annual plants are more successful during wet years, while others are more successful during dry years. [...] As a result, each species will have an advantage in some years, but not others. [...] When environmental conditions are most favorable, individuals will tend to compete most strongly with member of the same species. [...] For example, in a <b>dry</b> <b>year,</b> dry-adapted plants will tend to be most limited by other dry-adapted plants. [...] This can help them to coexist through a storage effect.|$|E
2500|$|The coastal prairie soils on {{the marine}} terrace above the beach are {{moderately}} well drained and granular with moderate soil permeability; these features manifest high erosion potential and moderately high bio-productivity. Acidity of these loamy soils is medium to high, and thus some vegetative stunting and hospitality to rare plants is offered; however the tree stunting {{is not as}} pronounced as farther north along the Mendocino coast, which presents extensive and exaggerated pygmy forests. The upland environment on the coastal prairie offers a range of grass species and wildflowers including varieties of lupine, thistle and wild oats.

Some summers it rained, and {{occasionally}} {{there would be a}} <b>dry</b> <b>year,</b> the dreaded ano seco of the Mexicans. Rain was always expected and prayed for in the midsummer months, and when it came the grama-grass sprang up, making the valleys green from mountain to mountain. The intersecting valleys, ranging between the long slope of foothills, afforded the best pasture for cattle, and these were jealously sought by the Mexicans who had only small herds to look after. Stillwell's cowboys were always chasing these vaqueros off land that belonged to Stillwell. He owned twenty thousand acres of unfenced land adjoining the open range. Don Carlos possessed more acreage than that, and his cattle were always mingling with Stillwell's. And in turn Don Carlos's vaqueros were always chasing Stillwell's cattle away from the Mexican's watering-place. Bad feeling had been manifested for years, and now relations were strained to the breaking-point.|$|E
