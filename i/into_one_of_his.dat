5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon {{thought of as}} a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. He snaps his fingers, and the space station's onboard computer warns {{of a large number of}} UFOs heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world. Joe attempts to leave but not before Silvia requests a V-Watch from her father and to accompany her boyfriend. Viewtiful Joe and a newly transformed Silvia head out to stop the impending threat together.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Kurt Angle, who was {{accompanied}} by Karen Angle, fought Christian Cage. The duration of the match was eighteen minutes and forty-five seconds. Near the end, Angle performed his signature Angle Slam maneuver, resulting in a near-fall. Cage then performed his signature Unprettier maneuver, also resulting in a near-fall. Angle attempted his ankle lock submission maneuver which was countered by Cage <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own. Angle soon submitted to the hold, however the referee was distracted by the Karen. A.J. Styles ran down to the ring and pulled Karen away from the ring. Styles then hugged Cage, before springboarding off the top rope and bashing Cage {{in the back of}} the head with his forearm, effectively siding with The Angle Alliance. Angle then performed the Angle Slam to gain the victory and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

500|$|Several anime and manga {{publications}} {{have provided}} both praise and criticism of Sanosuke's character.

In the Critical Survey of Graphic Novels: Manga, multiple writers acknowledged how both Sanosuke and Yahiko spend their time in the series searching for ways to become stronger. However, they do it for a heroic reason which is assisting Kenshin. SciFi.com commended him for being a good source of comic relief and described his appearance as a video-game icon. However, they commented he was a [...] "tragic figure [...] whose goofy peccadilloes have solid reasons behind them" [...] due to being unable to avoid the destruction of the Sekihotai army and feeling guilty due to it.

These people were gifted killers in life and Harman absorbed their souls through his condition after their deaths. The killer7 were temporarily incapacitated in an incident 50 years ago, in which the members of the group were systematically tracked and killed while performing a job at the Union Hotel in Pennsylvania. Garcian, whose power is to revive fallen personae, became the dominant personality as a result.

Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon also causes Harman and his personae to see [...] "remnant psyches"—ghosts of their past victims. Iwazaru, a man in a bondage suit, and Travis Bell, the killer7's first target, are the main remnant psyches who aid them throughout the game. The primary antagonist is an old friend of Harman's named Kun Lan. He has the [...] "Hand of God", a supernatural power that produces the Heaven Smile virus.|$|E
