40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} early computed tomography findings around the <b>driveline</b> which would predict mediastinal or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) pocket abscess formation. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 128 LVAD recipients between January 2007 and December 2011. Infectious complications were subdivided into those affecting the <b>driveline</b> and those resulting in abscess formation either around the LVAD pump or mediastinum. The size and location of infiltrative changes surrounding the <b>driveline</b> were used to predict infection propagation resulting in abscess. Results: Of the 128 patients, 49 (38. 3 %) patients developed <b>driveline</b> infections and 24 (18. 8 %) patients developed abscess. 87. 5 % patients who developed abscess had a preceding <b>driveline</b> infection. The mean time from <b>driveline</b> infection to the development of pump pocket abscess was approximately 7 months. In addition, patients with abscess in the pump pocket or mediastinum had preceding infiltrative changes surrounding the <b>driveline</b> ≥ 14 mm (P = 0. 0001). A preperitoneal location and size of infiltrative changes ≥ 14 mm were correlated with a higher likelihood of abscess formation (P = 0. 0002). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the predictive value of infection/infiltrative changes around the <b>driveline,</b> which increases the risk for abscess formation in the LVAD pump pocket and/or in the mediastinum...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Power-split hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) provide {{a great opportunity}} to improve fuel economy and emissions. This power-split hybrid system has inherent low damping in <b>driveline</b> since it uses planetary gear sets to directly connect the engine, the generator, and the motor to the <b>driveline</b> for improved vehicle efficiency, thus lacking a clutch or a torque converter that provides the conventional vehicles with <b>driveline</b> damping. When they are subjected to acceleration or disturbances, the low damping in the <b>driveline</b> may cause torsional vibrations. Since the power-split control system is closed loop in nature, these torsional vibrations can result in sustained <b>driveline</b> oscillations. These oscillations can be very objectionable to the driver as they affect the vehicle’s drivability. In this paper, we present the design of an active damping wheel-torque control system to suppress such oscilla-tions to improve the drivability of a power-split HEV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported use of an active damping wheel-torque control system to suppress the <b>driveline</b> oscillations in a power-split HEV. Simulations in a power-split HEV environment and experimental tests in the field using a Ford Escape Hybrid demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in suppressing the oscillations. The <b>driveline</b> disturbances are suppressed to below the perceptible level of wheel torque (< 100 N · m). Additional simulations are performed to validate the system to other key factors that can affect its performance. Even with increased motor/generator disturbances by a factor of 2 and change in <b>driveline</b> stiffness of ± 50 %, the proposed control system can still effectively suppress <b>driveline</b> oscillations and thereby improve drivability.
