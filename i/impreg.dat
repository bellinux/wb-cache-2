40|$|The {{formaldehyde}} emission, {{properties and}} decay durability of Dyera constulata wood, impregnated with {{low molecular weight}} phenol formaldehyde (LmwPF) resin mixed with urea were investigated. The air-dry wood was impregnated with 20 - 40 % LmwPF (M w 600) mixed separately with urea (30 % based on solid PF), partially cured at 60 C for 30 min and subsequently heated at 150 C for 60 - 120 min. The treatments had successfully reduced the formaldehyde emission (FE) of the <b>impreg</b> and the degrees of reduction depend on curing time. Statistical analyses showed that the concentration of resin affected the density, stiffness, water absorption and thickness swelling, while the curing time affected the density, polymer loading, water absorption and thickness swelling. <b>Impreg</b> product had higher MOR, MOE and dimensional stability compared to the untreated wood. The treatments rendered the <b>impreg</b> product with approximately 20 % in anti-swelling efficiency and had also changed the wood into highly resistant to fungal decay...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In the chironomid Acricotopus lucidus, two {{cells with}} quite {{different}} chromo some complements {{arise from the}} last unequal spermato-gonial mitosis, {{as a consequence of}} monopolar migration of the so-called germ line limited chromosomes (Ks). The cell receiving all the Ks, in ad-dition to two sets of the regularly segregating somatic chromosomes (Ss), develops into the primary spermatocyte, while the cell getting only Ss dif-ferentiates into an aberrant spermatocyte. Only the primary spermatocyte enters meiosis. These nuclear events in the primary spermatocytes of A. lucidus during prophase I were analyzed by carmine-orcein staining, sil-ver <b>impreg</b> nation, live-cell RNA fluorescence labeling, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, using painting probes of the three Ss and the K centromeres. Early prophase I nuclei display large con densed chromatin blocks showing intense carmine staining, dark silver nitrate impregnation and bright DAPI fluores cence. The first clear signs of meiotic prophase progression are loops arising at early pachytene, which originate from th...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the scope of the recently developed polymerization molding system for polyamide 12 (PA 12), especially with respect to the formation of carbon fiber-reinforced PA 12 composites. Initial screening of PA 12 composite formation was performed by means of an internal mixer in order to identify the suitable type of surface-treated carbon fiber (CF). The content of residual lauryllactam (LL) monomer reflected the influence of the CF-treatment on the polymerization molding involving anionic in situ polymerization of LL. The cryogenic fracture surfaces were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to evaluate the adhesion quality between the components. Finally, a bench-scale polymerization molding process was established successfully for the fabrication of multi-axial laminates. Macromechanical tests and dynamic mechanical thermo-analysis (DMTA) indicated that the performance of the new polymerization molding process is very similar to that of state-of-the-art PA 12 /CF composites.

40|$|I. The {{histology}} of the cuticle and epidermis {{of certain}} chilopods and diplopods is described. Two principal {{layers of the}} cuticle are recognized, an outer homogeneous and refractile exocuticle which is usually but not invariably pigmented and an inner endocuticle. 2. The endocuticle and the exocuticle both contain chitin. The exocuticle is con-sidered as a modification of the outer part of the chitinous matrix by an impregnating substance. 3. Certain properties of the impregnating substance are described. It {{appears to be a}} substance rich in phenolic groups, perhaps a protein, which has a stability and resistance to acids in its own right irrespective of the presence of pigment or aromatic cross-links. Pro-sclerotin is suggested as a name for this substance. Chemical tests show that it is present in regions not optically definable as exocuticle. 4. The epidermis is virtually an epithelium of gland cells which appear to secrete lipoid material. The lipoid passes on {{to the surface of the}} cuticle by means of ducts passing through the cuticle. Here it appears to form a superficial layer and to <b>impreg...</b>|$|E
40|$|The bulking {{treatment}} with phenolic resin {{is well known}} as a treatment to improve the properties of low density wood but high amount of formaldehyde emission will be released during and after treatment. A {{study was conducted to}} determine the performance of phenolic resin treated sesenduk (Endospermum diadenum) wood post treated with ammonium carbonate and urea. Wood strips were treated separately with 30 % low molecular weight phenol formaldehyde resin (LmwPF) resin and mixture of LmwPF with urea (30 % based on solid PF) using empty-cell process. Two products were produced from the treatment, i. e. <b>impreg</b> and compreg. After conditioning, the surfaces of the samples were applied with ammonium carbonate solution at 10, 20 and 30 g/m 2. The samples were then stacked and stored at 60 Â°C for 48 h. Properties such as formaldehyde emission, strength and dimensional stability were evaluated. The results showed that the post {{treatment with}} ammonium carbonate has successfully reduced the formaldehyde emission from the sesenduk wood. The degree of reduction was depended on the amount of ammonium carbonate applied on the samples. The results also showed that the sesenduk wood treated with mixture of PF and urea had lower formaldehyde emission. Post treatment with ammonium carbonate did not significantly affect the physical and mechanical properties of the sesenduk wood...|$|E
40|$|Modern day oil & {{gas well}} costs {{are driven by}} {{drilling}} performance as time becomes the dominant capital expense source. The ability to lower drilling costs becomes paramount when tight economic margins and high uncertainties/risk exist. Penetration rate decreases drastically in ultra deep formations, and substantial time is spent drilling the deepest section of these wells. Therefore, significant cost savings may be obtained through an improvement in penetration rate in deep formations. This paper shows that in HTHP (High Temperature High Pressure) hard shale/sand environments that PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) bits paired with water based mud experience 88 % improvement in penetration rate than those paired with oil based mud. With this improvement in drilling rate, well costs can be substantially reduced making future ultra-deep hydrocarbon accumulations economically producible. Also observed was a drastic decrease in penetration rate in PDC bits with oil base mud {{which led to the}} use of diamond <b>impreg</b> bits, as the water base with PDC still maintained respectable penetration rates. The conventional penetration rate controls are still applicable in this case, but there exists a fundamental difference between the rock/fluid interactions of each mud type. Bit type, operating conditions, formation characteristics, and bit hydraulics are shown to not be the dominant influencing factor of this performance trend. The water base fluids examined have higher filtrate rates than the oil base fluids. However, a consistent data set of increasing filtrate rate corresponding to increasing penetration rate cannot be derived. Therefore filtration characteristics remain as a possible and partial influencing factor behind this data. Future experimental research is needed to confirm or disprove this theory. At this time the actual cause of this behavior is unknown, however the trend has been established showing water base drilling fluids performance versus oil base in the HTHP/hard rock environment...|$|E
