40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to strengthen the institutional and staff capability of Zambia's Department of Agriculture at the Southern Province in providing cost-effective agricultural extension services, including training of extension workers in developing extension strategies, plan, methods, and multi-media support materials. In addition, the project also assisted in improving the participatory-approach extension programme planning process, field implementation procedures, and its monitoring/ evaluation, to ensure timeliness, relevance, and appropriateness of extension service delivery. An in-depth evaluation of project ZAM/ 88 / 021 {{was carried out in}} March 1991. The <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Mission,</b> which was led by a UNDP consultant, found that the project had been successful in its implementation and commended it highly for the Strategic Extension Campaign (SEC) methodology used, its high implementation rate, and its overall technical and operational soundness. The <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Mission</b> report strongly recommended that the project be expanded and donor funding be continued into the second phase. It is also recommended that the experience gained and skills developed in the KAP base-line survey and SEC methodology be made available to other provinces in Zambia through personnel training and programme implementation efforts. In dealing with rain-fed agriculture, keeping in mind the diversity of Zambia's ecological zones, area-specific, problem-solving oriented message development should become a necessary requisite for improved extension services. In order to achieve this, it is recommended that the National Extension Action Plan adopt the KAP survey and Strategic Extension Campaign (SEC) methodologies to support and enhance the existing Training and Visit (T&V) extension approach. To ensure food security at the farm level, improved post-harvest techniques, including the promotion of improved storage structures should be extended {{to other parts of the}} country...|$|R

40|$|The SMART- 1 {{mission has}} {{recently}} {{arrived at the}} Moon. Its payload includes D-CIXS, a compact X-ray spectrometer. SMART- 1 is a technology <b>evaluation</b> <b>mission,</b> and D-CIXS {{is the first of}} a new generation of planetary X-ray spectrometers. Novel technologies enable new capabilities for measuring the fluorescent yield of a planetary surface or atmosphere which is illuminated by solar X-rays. During the extended SMART- 1 cruise phase, observations of the Earth showed strong argon emission, providing a good source for calibration and demonstrating the potential of the technique. At the Moon, our initial observations over Mare Crisium show a first unambiguous remote sensing of calcium in the lunar regolith. Data obtained are broadly consistent with current understanding of mare and highland composition. Ground truth is provided by the returned Luna 20 and 24 sample sets. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
