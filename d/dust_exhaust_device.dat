40|$|In recent years, tunnel fire {{accidents}} {{of about}} 20 occur {{every year in}} Japan. The Nihonzaka and the Sakai tunnel fire accidents are as famous typical examples. When concentrated <b>exhaust</b> ventilation <b>device</b> is activated in such a tunnel fire, it is of concern {{that the people who}} take shelter receive damage from the fire smoke. When a tunnel fire occurs, the concentrated <b>exhaust</b> ventilation <b>device</b> is stopped in Japan. Therefore, the research on the use of concentrated <b>exhaust</b> ventilation <b>device</b> at a tunnel fire has not advanced in Japan. The {{purpose of this study is}} to clarify the smoke propagation when concentrated <b>exhaust</b> ventilation <b>device</b> is activated. The model tunnel in the scale of 1 / 5 was used in this study. Froude scaling law was used to make the experimental results of the model tunnel correspond to the real scale tunnel. The concentrated <b>exhaust</b> ventilation <b>device</b> installed on the model tunnel extracts the fire smoke from a chimney. The smoke distribution in the model tunnel was measured with smoke concentration meters.

40|$|The {{performance}} metrics of airflow, sound, and {{combustion product}} capture efficiency (CE) were measured for {{a convenience sample}} of fifteen cooking <b>exhaust</b> <b>devices,</b> as installed in residences. Results were analyzed to quantify the impact of various device- and installation-dependent parameters on CE. Measured maximum airflows were 70 % or lower than values noted on product literature for 10 of the devices. Above-the-cooktop devices with flat bottom surfaces (no capture hood) – including exhaust fan/microwave combination appliances – were found to have much lower CE at similar flow rates, compared to devices with capture hoods. For almost all <b>exhaust</b> <b>devices</b> and especially for rear-mounted downdraft exhaust and microwaves, CE was substantially higher for back compared with front burner use. Flow rate, {{and the extent to which}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>device</b> extends over the burners that are in use, also had a large effect on CE. A flow rate of 95 liters per second (200 cubic feet per minute) was necessary, but not sufficient, to attain capture efficiency in excess of 75 % for the front burners.

40|$|Direct contact {{condensation}} {{is widely}} used in industrial applications due to the required low driving potential and high energy conversion efficiency. It {{plays an important role}} in the performance of the suppression pool in the Simplified Boiling Water Reactor. Transport phenomena in the pool start from the initial generation of interfacial structures and gas composition from <b>exhaust</b> <b>devices.</b> In particular for the bubbly regime, the bubble detaching size, gas concentration at the bubble detachment and bubble formation frequency are the boundary conditions for later liquid-gas interactions in the liquid pool. These parameters are coupled together with system operational variables, including system pressure, liquid subcooling, sizes of <b>exhaust</b> <b>devices</b> and gas composition. ^ The bubble formation experiments with and without the presence of noncondensable gas have been conducted in a subcooled water pool with the variations of the liquid subcooling, noncondensable gas concentration, nozzle size, system pressure and gas mass flow rate. The bubble formation device chosen was an up-standing double-walled nozzle. Nitrogen was used as noncondensable gas. The temperature and pressure of fluids and gas flow rates were measured appropriately. The bubble formation behaviors were recorded by using a high speed video camera and the images were stored digitally. ^ A bubble formation hydrodynamic equation was obtained from a constant flow bubble formation model to predict bubble detaching sizes with and without phase change. A linear combination of analytical formulas for static and dynamic regimes was found to be appropriate for both regimes and the transition between them. The condensation at the bubble interface was considered as the flow similarity of film condensation at the surface of a solid sphere including effects of gravitational and interfacial shear forces. Thermodynamic simplifications of interfacial variables allow for analysis of coupled heat and mass transfer without knowing the distributions of the temperature and noncondensable gas in detail. The model equations have been expressed explicitly and compared with the present database in terms of heat transfer at the interface, bubble detachment volume, bubble formation frequency and gas composition at the detachment. ...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis aims {{to study}} the effect of human {{movements}} on local exhaust ventilation. In its simplest terms, local exhaust ventilation is a system which has the function of extracting contaminated air situated close to the contaminant source, protecting a working person from exposure to hazardous substances by containing or capturing them locally, at the emission point. As an important security measure referred to terms of health, it is crucial for the healthiness of workers to control and prevent them from the exposure to vapour, mist, dust or other airborne contaminants. Additionally, {{to a lesser degree}} of significance, it can be stressed an expected increase in worker performance due to an improvement of the working conditions. There is an existing necessity for well-defined and appropriate methods to test the performance of local <b>exhaust</b> <b>devices</b> in order to reach standard efficiency values. The lack of an international standardization led to the realization of this study, which, ultimately, has the purpose of obtaining relevant results that can be utilized for future normalized test procedures. The study entails full scale experimental measurements that include air velocity measurements in 3 dimensions, a local <b>exhaust</b> ventilation <b>device</b> with circular hood and a flat flanged plate and a controlled generation of air turbulence through physical movements of a human-sized cylinder, simulating a walking person. The present study extends previous similar studies at the University of Gävle, where the controlled air turbulence was generated by a moving plate. After meaningful results obtained in that study, one of the considerations was to better simulate a walking person, by replacing the plate for a movable cylinder. The present study points at a larger similarity occurring with a cylinder than with a plate, as regards the air flow pattern produced by a real walking person. As in the previous study, the Percentage of Negative Velocities, PNV, has been used as the main measure of turbulence induced risk of contaminant spread. The PNV represents the fraction of the time when the flow is directed opposite to the suction air stream in front of the local exhaust hood. The obtained results conclude that the use of the cylinder as a moving object has been an improvement to simulate the effect of the movement of a human being on a relaxed walking pace. The present study was carried out in parallel with the thesis work by Leyre Catalán Ros, which complements this study by analyzing the effect of an added heated dummy, simulating a person seated in front of the local <b>exhaust</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Endotoxin {{exposure}} {{associated with}} organic dust exposure {{has been studied}} in several industries. Coffee cherries that are dried directly after harvest may differ in dust and endotoxin emissions to those that are peeled and washed before drying. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure personal total dust and endotoxin levels and to evaluate their determinants of exposure in coffee processing factories. Methods: Using Sidekick Casella pumps at a flow rate of 2 l/min, total dust levels were measured in the workers’ breathing zone throughout the shift. Endotoxin was analyzed using the kinetic chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Separate linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate exposure determinants for dust and endotoxin. Results: Total dust and endotoxin exposure were significantly higher in Robusta than in Arabica coffee factories (geometric mean 3. 41 mg/m³ and 10 800 EU/m 3 versus 2. 10 mg/m³ and 1400 EU/m³, respectively). Dry pre-processed coffee and differences in work tasks explained 30 % of the total variance for total dust and 71 % of the variance for endotoxin exposure. High exposure in Robusta processing is associated with the dry pre-processing method used after harvest.
