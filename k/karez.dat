2500|$|Operation <b>Karez</b> was a {{military}} operation between May 13–23, 2008 involving Norwegian and German ISAF and Afghan [...] government forces against the Taliban {{as part of the}} war in Afghanistan. [...] Their objective was to eliminate the presence of Taliban insurgents who had regrouped in the area in the aftermath of Operation Harekate Yolo in late 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{origin of}} the name Paniala is {{attributed}} {{to the meaning of}} combination of Urdu words, pani and wala. Pani wala thus meant [...] "a place with water". This was the only oasis town in the surrounding desert area of about 30 km radius where even drinking water was not available to the population around, and the habitat around would fetch drinking water from the natural fountains/springs and <b>KAREZs</b> of Paniala. Thus the name Pani wala became Paniala with the passage of time. Water is, nonetheless, still supplied to numerous villages on the east, west and south from Paniala even now through pipelines, though.|$|R
2500|$|The long planned {{operation}} was initiated on May 13 and lasted for ten days. By {{the twilight of}} {{the first day of the}} operation, the 250 Norwegian soldiers had encamped next to the village of Kor-i <b>Karez,</b> all according to plan. [...] Suddenly the Norwegian soldiers came under fire from Taliban insurgents armed with assault rifles, machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. [...] The Taliban insurgents attacked from a distance of around 1200 metres, in what Major Rune Wenneberg described as a [...] "well coordinated assault" [...] against the soldiers of Telemark Battalion. [...] While initially surprising the Norwegian ISAF soldiers, they quickly took control of the situation, and supported by CV 9030 armoured vehicles and mortars, the soldiers of the Telemark Battalion were able to successfully repel the Taliban assault. [...] The exchange of fire dropped in intensity after the Norwegian soldiers used heavy weaponry against the insurgents, and after a couple of hours the Taliban insurgents had fled the scene.|$|E
2500|$|The {{circumstances}} of {{the participation of the}} German soldiers in the operation is disputed. Whilst German sources stated that they were participating in Operation <b>Karez</b> in northern Afghanistan in conjunction with the Afghan army and the Norwegian QRF, the German magazine Der Spiegel stated that the German government hesitated to deploy the reconnaissance, logistics and KSK forces originally promised by the German regional commander. The reason given was that the area of operation, which is in Ghormach district, lay exactly on the border with the area under Italian command. [...] For domestic political reasons, the German government is very intent on only deploying ISAF soldiers to RC North and Kabul, which are covered by the mandate from parliament, even if this interferes with operational realities. [...] It was only on May 17 that the German Minister of defense, Franz Josef Jung, decided to approve the German participation in the operation. [...] At that point, the Norwegian and Afghan forces active in the engagement had already been fighting the Taliban for a week.|$|E

50|$|The {{district}} has 86 villages and {{divided into four}} parts (Khoshi,Karizona,Manai,and Dobandi). Main villages where Pashtuns are living are Dobandi, Manai, Darkh, Kandaw, Chenari, Tora Chena, Sher Agha, Baryam, fatihkhio <b>Karez,</b> Darya Khan Karez,sulimankhailo Karez,Degaan kariz,Kajer <b>Karez,</b> Shinkai, Gul Mohammad Khailo <b>Karez</b> and Sraghowanda.|$|E
5000|$|In India, {{there are}} <b>karez</b> (qanat) systems. These are located at Bidar, Bijapur, Burhanpur [...] "(Kundi Bhandara)" [...] and Aurgangabad. The <b>Karez</b> does exist few other places as well, but {{investigations}} are in progress {{to determine the}} reality. The Bidar <b>Karez</b> systems where probably {{the first one to}} have ever been dug in India. It dates to Bahmani period. Valliyil Govindankutty Assistant Professor in Geography Government College Chittur was responsible for unraveling <b>Karez</b> Systems of Bidar and has been supporting District Administration with research outputs towards conservation of the <b>Karez</b> system. He was responsible for mapping these wonderful water system. Bidar is having three <b>karez</b> systems as per Gulam Yazdani's documentation. Detailed Documentation of Naubad <b>Karez</b> System was dome by Valliyil Govindankutty in August 2013 and report submitted to District Administration of Bidar and highlights many new facts which does not exist in previous documentations. The research support provided by Valliyil Govindankutty to District Administration has lead to initiation of Cleaning the debris and collapsed sections paving the way to its rejuvenation. The cleaning of <b>Karez</b> has lead to bringing water to higher areas of plateau and it has in-turn recharged the wells in the vicinity. Other than Naubad there are two more <b>Karez</b> Systems in Bidar [...] "Shukla Theerth" [...] and [...] "Jamna Mori". The Shukla theerth is the longest <b>karez</b> system in Bidar. The Mother well of this <b>karez</b> has been discovered by Valliyil Govindankutty and Team YUVAA during survey near Gornalli Kere, a historic embankment. The Third System called Jamna mori is more of a Distribution system within the old city area with many channels crisscrossing the city lanes.|$|E
5000|$|Aurangabad the <b>Karez</b> Systems are Called Nahars. These are shallow aqueducts {{running through}} the city. There are 14 aqueducts in Aurangabad. The Nahar-i-Ambari being the oldest ad longest. Its again a {{combination}} of Shallow Aqueduts, Open CHannels, Pipes, Cisterns etc. The Source of water is surface water body. The <b>karez</b> has been constructed right below the bed of lake. The lake water seeps through the soil into the <b>Karez</b> Gallery.|$|E
5000|$|A {{survey of}} qanat {{systems in the}} Kurdistan region of Iraq {{conducted}} by the Department of Geography at Oklahoma State University (USA) on behalf of UNESCO in 2009 found that out of 683 <b>karez</b> systems, some 380 were still active in 2004, but only 116 in 2009. Reasons for the decline of qanats include [...] "abandonment and neglect" [...] prior to 2004, [...] "excessive pumping from wells" [...] and, since 2005, drought. Water shortages {{are said to have}} forced, since 2005, over 100,000 people who depended for their livelihoods on <b>karez</b> systems to leave their homes. The study says that a single <b>karez</b> has the potential to provide enough household water for nearly 9,000 individuals and irrigate over 200 hectares of farmland. UNESCO and the government of Iraq plan to rehabilitate the <b>karez</b> through a <b>Karez</b> Initiative for Community Revitalization to be launched in 2010. Most of the <b>karez</b> are in Sulaymaniyah Governorate (84%). A large number are also found in Erbil Governorate (13%), especially on the broad plain around and in Erbil city.|$|E
5000|$|Turpan <b>Karez</b> Paradise (...) is {{a museum}} {{featuring}} Turpan's water management system in Turpan, Xinjiang, China. Its visitors {{can learn about}} the underground irrigation system in the desert area, and visitors can see the <b>karez</b> in operation.|$|E
5000|$|The Turpan {{water system}} or Turfan water system (locally called <b>karez,</b> [...] ) in Turpan, {{located in the}} Turpan Hollow, Xinjiang, China, is a {{vertical}} tunnel system adapted by the Turpan people. The word <b>karez</b> means [...] "well" [...] in the local Uyghur language. Turpan has the Turpan Water Museum (a Protected Area of the People's Republic of China) dedicated to demonstrating its <b>karez</b> water system, as well as exhibiting other historical artifacts. Turpan's well system was crucial in Turpan's development as an important oasis stopover on the ancient Silk Road skirting the barren and hostile Taklamakan Desert. Turpan owes its prosperity to the water provided by its <b>karez</b> well system.|$|E
5000|$|This {{facility}} is {{in a relatively}} convenient location, about five kilometers from the city center of Turpan, about one kilometers from China National Highway 312. The <b>karez</b> there, called Miyim Haji's <b>Karez</b> (...) was built about 800 years ago.|$|E
50|$|The {{oasis of}} Turpan, in {{the deserts of}} Xinjiang in northwestern China, uses water {{provided}} by qanat (locally called <b>karez).</b> The number of <b>karez</b> systems in the area is slightly below 1,000, and the total length of the canals is about 5,000 kilometers.|$|E
50|$|Ancient <b>Karez</b> System in {{the city}} have been {{recently}} discovered. The <b>Karez</b> (Qanat) is an underground network of aqueducts for water supply. The Bidar <b>Karez,</b> built in the 15th century, is more than 3 km long with 21 air vents. Underground canals, built to connect underground water streams, were meant to provide drinking water to civilian settlements and the garrison inside the Bidar fort. This was necessary {{in a city where}} the soil was rocky and drilling wells was difficult.|$|E
50|$|The 1998 census report lists two sub-divisions: Lower Zhob (comprising Zhob tehsil and Sambaza sub-tehsil) and Kakar Khurasan (encompassing the tehsil of Qamar Din <b>Karez</b> and the subtehsil of Ashewat). A {{government}} webpage lists {{these as}} Ashwat, Qamar Din <b>Karez,</b> Sambaza and Zhob, without indicating {{if any of}} them are sub-tehsils.|$|E

5000|$|As {{described}} by Yazdani, [...] "The <b>Karez</b> at Naubad was probably given up owing {{to death of}} king or due to some other causes". This is evident in their present state. Probably, if the Naubad settlement had come up, the <b>karez</b> would have been well maintained and traditional knowledge prevailed to this day.|$|E

50|$|In Tejaban {{agricultural}} water is accomplished through the <b>Karez</b> System. <b>Karez</b> {{is a local}} system in which {{a large number of}} wells are interconnected to collect and share water. Water flows in the form of channels, which is then used for farming. The best thing about this system is that it saves energy. No fuel is used for collecting water, unlike tube-wells.|$|E
50|$|The rocky soil in Bidar makes {{access to}} {{drinking}} water {{very difficult and}} the <b>karez</b> was built {{in order to provide}} drinking water to civilian settlements and the garrison inside the Bidar fort. The system in Bidar has 21 vertical shafts, and extends for about 2 km. A few <b>karez</b> shafts have been closed by builders and developers, leaving only 17 visible today.|$|E
50|$|The <b>karez</b> {{consists}} basically of {{a network}} underground canals, punctuated by vertical shafts to the surface, The <b>karez</b> taps into the ground water sources (or natural springs) and transports it through the underground tunnel to the settlement, ending in a surface canal and/or pools in the village for various uses like drinking, washing, ablution, watering livestock, and also further used for irrigating fields, orchards and gardens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kařez</b> is {{a village}} and {{municipality}} (obec) in Rokycany District in the Plzeň Region of the Czech Republic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kařez</b> lies {{approximately}} 17 km north-east of Rokycany, 31 km east of Plzeň, and 55 km south-west of Prague.|$|E

50|$|Balochistan is an arid {{region and}} {{receives}} very little annual rainfall. But innumerable streams and natural springs known as <b>karez</b> {{can be found}} {{in most parts of the}} province. There are more than a half dozen gorges around Ziarat formed by <b>karez</b> spring water falling through narrow openings in the mountain rocks, producing a dramatic effect. The gorges along the road to Ziarat are Chutair Tangi, Kahn Tangi, Kawas Tangi, Faran Tangi and Sandman Tangi.|$|E
5000|$|Burhanpur the <b>Karez</b> {{is called}} [...] "Kundi-Bhandara" [...] {{sometimes}} wrongly referred to as"Khuni Bhandara". The system is approx 6 km long starts from the Aluvial fans of Satpura hills {{in the north}} of the town. Unlike Bidar, Bijapur and Aurgangabad the System airvents are round in shape. Inside the <b>Karez</b> one could see lime depositions on the walls. The Systems ends to carry water further to palaces and public fountains through pipe line.|$|E
50|$|In Xinjiang, the {{greatest}} number of <b>karez</b> wells are in the Turpan Depression, where today there remain over 1100 <b>karez</b> wells and channels having a total length of over 5000 km. The local geography makes <b>karez</b> wells practical for agricultural irrigation and other uses. Turpan is located in the second deepest geographical depression in the world, with over 4000 km2 of land below sea level and with soil that forms a sturdy basin. Water naturally flows down from the nearby mountains during the rainy season in an underground current to the low depression basin under the desert. The Turpan summer is very hot and dry with periods of wind and blowing sand. The water from the underground channels provides a stable water source year round, independent of season.|$|E
50|$|An {{estimated}} 60,000 traditional <b>Karez</b> (کاریز) {{systems in}} the plateau regions of Iran in Yazd, Khorasan and Kerman - are still in use today for irrigation and drinking water supply in rural areas and small towns. The oldest and largest known <b>Karez</b> is in the Iranian city of Gonabad which after 2700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people. Its main well depth is more than 360 meters and its length is 45 kilometers.|$|E
50|$|Turpan {{has long}} been the center of a fertile oasis and an {{important}} trade center along the Northern Silk Road, at which time it was adjacent to the kingdoms of Korla and Karashahr to the southwest. The historical record of the <b>karez</b> extends back to the Han Dynasty. The Turfan Water Museum is a Protected Area of the People's Republic of China because {{of the importance of the}} Turpan <b>karez</b> water system to the history of the area.|$|E
50|$|Notable localities in this {{district}} include Ab-i-Garmak, Arzanak, Du Abi, Garband, Husayn, Joy-i-Shor, <b>Karez,</b> Khatun, Khushki, Pamakhtu, Petaw, Rangin, Rashid, Sartakit, Sawriwon, Senjetak and Sharshari.|$|E
50|$|In June 2011, the FOB {{was renamed}} Sarkari <b>Karez</b> after 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor Regiment, 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division out of Fort Riley, Kansas assumed responsibility.|$|E
50|$|Bijapur the <b>Karez</b> {{system is}} much complicated. The Study done by Valliyil Govindankutty reveals {{that it has}} surface water and {{groundwater}} connections. The Bijapur <b>Karez</b> is a network of Shallow masonry aqueducts, terracotta/ ceramic Pipes, Embankments and Reservoirs, Tanks etc. All weave together a network to ensure water reaches the old city. The System starts at Torwi and extends as Shallow Aqueducts and further as pipes, further it becomes deeper from the Sainik school area onward which exists as tunnel dug through the geology. the system can be clearly traced up to Ibrahim Roja.|$|E
