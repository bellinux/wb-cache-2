Staurakios, however, found his own position increasingly challenged by another powerful eunuch and trusted servant of the empress, Aetios.

He said later that he could not continue to live in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council.

50|$|In the film, Elliot {{separates}} people {{according to}} their eye color. The brown or green eye-color people {{are considered to be}} superior to the blue eye-color people.

25|$|Thirty-eight {{thousand}} {{people were killed}} in the Republican zone during the war, 17,000 of whom were killed in Madrid or Catalonia within a month of the coup. Whilst the Communists were forthright in their support of extrajudicial killings, much of the Republican side was appalled by the murders. Azaña came close to resigning. He, alongside other members of Parliament and a great number of other local officials, attempted to prevent Nationalist supporters being lynched. Some of those <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> intervened personally to stop the killings.|$|E
25|$|James {{also created}} a large {{standing}} army and employed Catholics <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> within it. To his opponents in Parliament this seemed like a prelude to arbitrary rule, so James prorogued Parliament without gaining Parliament's consent. At this time, the English regiments of the army were encamped at Hounslow, near the capital. It was feared that the location was intended to overawe the City. The army in Ireland was purged of Protestants, who were replaced with Catholics, and by 1688 James had more than 34,000 men under arms in his three kingdoms.|$|E
25|$|Bolt also {{establishes}} an anti-authoritarian theme which recurs {{throughout his}} works. All people <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> – King Henry, Cromwell, Wolsey, Cranmer, Chapuys, even Norfolk – are depicted as being either corrupt, evil, or at best expedient and power-hungry. Bolt's later plays and film screenplays also delve into this theme. The theme of corruption is also illustrated, in Rich's rise to power, the Common Man being {{drawn into the}} events of the storyline, and in the (deliberately) anachronistic portrayal of Henry as a younger, athletic man (in 1530 he would have been almost forty and already putting on weight).|$|E

25|$|In {{the process}} of the Mongols' {{invasion}} of China proper, many Han Chinese were enslaved by the Mongols. According to Japanese historian Sugiyama Masaaki (杉山正明) and Funada Yoshiyuki (舩田善之), there were also a certain number of Mongolian slaves owned by Han Chinese during the Yuan dynasty. Moreover, {{there is no evidence that}} Han Chinese, who were considered people of the bottom of Yuan society by some research, were suffered a particularly cruel abuse. In the early Qing dynasty, many Han Chinese were enslaved by the Manchurian rulers, although some of them found themselves <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and influence in Manchu administrations and owned their own Han Chinese slaves.|$|E
25|$|Irene now divided her favour between Staurakios, her old-established chief minister, and Aetios. This began {{a period}} of intense rivalry between the two and their {{respective}} supporters, as they raced to place their relatives <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> so as to secure control of the empire after Irene's eventual death. This competition {{came to the fore}} in 797/798, and intensified in May 799, when Irene fell seriously ill. Aetios, who had won the backing of Niketas Triphyllios, the commander of the Scholai guards, accused Staurakios before the Empress of plotting to usurp the throne. Irene duly convened a council at the Palace of Hieria where she severely rebuked her favourite minister, but Staurakios escaped with an apology.|$|E
25|$|The hypodescent social {{construction}} {{related to the}} racial caste that was associated with African slavery and {{the conditions of the}} slave societies. It was made explicit by Virginia and other colonies' laws as early as 1662. Virginia incorporated the Roman principle of partus sequitur ventrem into slave law, saying that children of slave mothers were born into their status. Under English common law for subjects, children's social status was determined by the father, not the mother. But the colonists put Africans outside the category of English subjects. Generally, white men were <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to take sexual advantage of black women slaves. But, historian Paul Heinegg has shown that most free African-American families listed in the censuses of 1790–1810 were, in fact, descended from unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, from the years when working classes lived and worked closely together, and before slavery had hardened as a racial caste.|$|E

25|$|His {{subsequent}} book, {{released in}} summer 2006, is titled Conservatives without Conscience, {{a play on}} Barry Goldwater's book The Conscience of a Conservative. In it, he asserts that post-Goldwater conservatism has been co-opted by people with authoritarian personalities and policies, citing data from Bob Altemeyer. According to Dean, modern conservatism, specifically in the Christian Right, embraces obedience, inequality, intolerance, and strong intrusive government, {{in stark contrast to}} Goldwater's philosophies and policies. Using Altemeyer's scholarly work, he contends that there is a tendency toward ethically questionable political practices when authoritarians are placed <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> and that the current political situation is dangerously unsound because of it. Dean cites the behavior of key members of the Republican leadership, including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Tom DeLay, Newt Gingrich, and Bill Frist, as clear evidence of a relationship between modern right-wing conservatism and this authoritarian approach to governance. He places particular emphasis on the abdication of checks and balances by the Republican Congress, and of the dishonesty of the conservative intellectual class in support of the GOP, {{as a result of the}} obedience and arrogance innate to the authoritarian mentality.|$|E

In a newspaper interview, Nelson responded that the criticism was [...] "the one thing that did make me kind of angry. I don't think the painting was poorly executed, though it wasn't my favorite painting." [...] In his book Arresting Images— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions, Stephen C.

She continued, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the show really gelled... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove: human experimentation. That's what links all the scooby gang's investigations together into the Pattern, and that's what makes this show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity." ...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The nuclear {{accident}} in Fukushima, Japan, raised global criticism against nuclear power. In Sweden, the criticism {{has not been}} very visible and the government now allows a renewal <b>of</b> the nuclear <b>power</b> plants. The purpose with the study {{is to have a}} closer look on how Swedes <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> motivate their positive attitude to nuclear power and how they conduct themselves {{to each other and to}} their opponents. The rhetorical perspective will be in focus for the analysing. Method: Four different artifacts represented by Swedes <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> having a positiveattitude to nuclear power were chosen. Three rhetorical theories (the rhetorical arena, stasis andethos, pathos and logos) were used with the research question in focus. Result & Conclusions: The analyses resulted in conclusions about the strategies used by the participants such as: the importance of contexts, meaning for example that the greenhouse effect legitimizes nuclear power as a source of energy with important benefits. Redefining the meaning of key words such as “environment friendly”. Using authority, emotions and knowledge as a way to persuade. Suggestions for future research: It would be interesting to go further with the fundamental values and ideologies which seem to have an important role in the Swedish nuclear <b>power</b> debate. Contribution <b>of</b> the thesis: This study has hopefully brought new light on the nuclear power debate and can be a contribution to a broader understanding how to bring more nuance and transparency to it...|$|R

500|$|After this loss, McGovern {{remained}} in the Senate. He was scarred by the enormous defeat, and his wife Eleanor took it even worse; {{during the winter of}} 1972–73, the couple seriously considered moving to England. His allies were replaced <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> within the Democratic Party leadership, and the McGoverns did not get publicly introduced at party affairs they attended. On January 20, 1973, a few hours after Richard Nixon was re-inaugurated, McGovern gave a speech at the Oxford Union that talked about the abuses of Nixon's presidency; it brought criticism, including from some Democrats, for being ill-mannered. In order to get past the [...] "bitterness and self-pity" [...] he felt, McGovern forced himself to deal with the defeat humorously before audiences; starting at the March 1973 Gridiron Dinner, he frequently related his campaign misadventures in a self-deprecating fashion, such as saying, [...] "For many years, I wanted to run for the Presidency in the worst possible way – and last year I sure did." [...] Nevertheless, emotions surrounding the loss would remain with McGovern for decades, as it did with some other defeated presidential nominees. Nixon resigned in August 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. McGovern said President Gerald R. Ford's subsequent September 1974 pardon of Nixon was difficult to understand given that Nixon's subordinates were going to prison.|$|E
500|$|Duyệt's {{policy towards}} criminals and former rebels also courted {{conflict}} with Minh Mạng. In the early-19th century, the nascent {{years of the}} Nguyễn Dynasty were plagued by incessant revolts, particularly in northern and central Vietnam. This resulted in {{a large number of}} rebels being captured along with common criminals and bandits. Such people were usually internally exiled to the opposite part of the country, so a large number ended up in southern Vietnam. These included many former rebels who were spared the death penalty after being defeated by Duyệt in northern and central Vietnam during his pacification campaigns in the late 1810s, and had sworn loyalty towards the general personally. These men were sent south with their wives and children to remove them from potentially rebellious areas and to punish them, but another objective was to start military colonies to help develop southern Vietnam, which had only recently been acquired by ethnic Vietnamese. The convicts were given equipment to work on the land and some were later pardoned. Duyệt and Gia Long had employed surrendered Tây Sơn officers in positions of authority, and this policy had continued due a shortage of manpower until Minh Mạng came to power. Duyệt wanted to continue this policy and wrote to Minh Mạng for permission, but was rejected. The emperor replied that such a policy was [...] "like releasing a monkey to climb up a tree". For Minh Mạng, the placement of former convicts and rebels <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> was contrary to the Confucian system of order and debauched the prestige of the state, whereas Duyet was only concerned with practicality.|$|E
500|$|On July 25, 2000, the EPB {{published}} a message discussing the 102th {{anniversary of the}} Navy's invasion during the Spanish–American War. The organization remembered that after annexing Puerto Rico, the United States began an Americanization campaign that led {{to changes in the}} official language from Spanish to English and the name [...] "Porto Rico" [...] being adopted for the archipelago. By remembering expressions made by congressmen during this timeframe describing Puerto Ricans as [...] "ignorant and undeveloped natives", the EPB quoted that an attempt made by Eugenio María de Hostos to regulate an independence referendum was ignored by the United States, who instead declared Puerto Rico an unincorporated territory. Calling the policies and institutions established during the following decades as [...] "cultural genocide" [...] and [...] "a violation of fundamental human and civil rights", the organization insisted that the American rule was marked with the [...] "creation of divisions" [...] and propagation of [...] "servile" [...] groups such as the statehood movement and status quo supporters <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> This, in their view, as an attempt to manipulate the economy in their benefit and to supply a constant military force [...] "by directing hundreds of Puerto Rican men and women [...] thanks to poverty". The EPB argued that [...] "any kind of struggle, with the exception of actual terrorism, is more than justified", citing India and the civil rights movement {{as an example of a}} type of civilian disobedience that was particularly relevant. The organization then clarified that its inactivity on the matter was a product of [...] "being alert [...] keeping [...] guard high", while patiently observing [...] "with a lack of trust" [...] if the pacific strategies being employed in Vieques worked out, but not discarding [...] "revolutionary actions" [...] if otherwise. On the same date, the Macheteros held a homage to the victims of the Cerro Maravilla murders as well as other historical figures by celebrating the [...] "Day of the Martyrs". In citing an ongoing [...] "psychological warfare [...] division, insecurity, conformism and individualism", the organization argued that this were manifesting itself in attempts to weaken the morale of the Vieques protests.|$|E

While such instances do suggest the continuing trend of attenuation in sex-based hierarchy that has been evident in western culture for centuries, no example of a non-subsistence society where males do not dominate <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> high <b>power</b> or that is free of sex-based discrimination has yet emerged. Social Dominance Theory suggests that extreme sex-group discrimination arises in societies where economic surplus creates the opportunity for large power dynamics. This view suggests that sex-based hierarchy will persist in societies {{in which it is}} the status quo unless some form of radical political, economic, and/or cultural changes take place.|$|R
40|$|Monotheism and violence: A {{perspective}} on the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> J Assmann. The problem of monotheism and violence, as put forward by Assmann in a recent article "Monotheismus und Ikonoklasmus als politische Theologie", is addressed.  Violence in a religious context {{more often than not}} emanates from a paradigm of exclusive monotheism. The origin of this kind of violence can be traced back to people <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> who held the opinion that the truth was entrusted to them alone and that their enemies were also the enemies of their god. This also held true for interest groups in Judah. Old Testament literature promoting violence should be read critically within the broader context of books like Genesis, Ruth, Jonah and New Testament writings...|$|R
500|$|Las Casas {{arrived in}} Spain {{with the plan}} of convincing the King to end the encomienda system. This was easier thought than done, {{as most of the}} people who were <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> were {{themselves}} either encomenderos or otherwise profiting from the influx of wealth from the Indies. In the winter of 1515, King Ferdinand lay ill in Plasencia, but Las Casas was able to get a letter of introduction to the Majesty from the Archbishop of Seville, Diego de Deza. On Christmas Eve of 1515, Las Casas met the Monarch and discussed the situation in the Indies with him; the King agreed to hear him out in more detail at a later date. While waiting, Las Casas produced a report that he presented to the Bishop of Burgos, Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, and secretary Lope Conchillos, who were functionaries in complete charge of the Royal policies regarding the Indies; both were encomenderos. They were not impressed by his account, and Las Casas had to find a different avenue of change. He put his faith in his coming audience with the King, but it never came, for King Ferdinand died on January 25, 1516. The regency of Castile passed on to Ximenez Cisneros and Adrian of Utrecht who were guardians for the under-age Prince Charles. Las Casas was resolved to see Prince Charles who resided in Flanders, but on his way there he passed Madrid and delivered to the regents a written account of the situation in the Indies and his proposed remedies. This was his [...] "Memorial de Remedios para Las Indias" [...] of 1516. In this early work, Las Casas advocated importing Black slaves from Africa to relieve the suffering Indians, a stance he later retracted, becoming an advocate for the Africans in the colonies as well. This shows that Las Casas's first concern was not to end slavery as an institution, but to end the physical abuse and suffering of the Indians. In keeping with the legal and moral doctrine of the time Las Casas believed that slavery could be justified if it was the result of Just War, and at the time he assumed that the enslavement of Africans was justified. Worried by the visions that Las Casas had drawn up of the situation in the Indies, Cardinal Cisneros decided to send a group of Hieronymite friars to take over the government of the islands.|$|E
