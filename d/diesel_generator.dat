5|$|With {{modifications}} {{that were}} aimed at improving the ships endurance by including a <b>diesel</b> <b>generator,</b> it was launched as Velebit (P-01) in 1996. A few years later {{it was out of}} service because of the need to acquire a new set of batteries, which in turn, never happened. After unsuccessful attempts of selling it to a foreign buyer, it was offered to various museums in Croatia with a final destination still pending.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} a 1989 {{failure of the}} submarine cable and problems with the <b>diesel</b> <b>generator,</b> the light was converted to solar power with battery storage. The caretaker stayed in the premises until March 1991, when lease arrangement difficulties and the previous failure of the mains forced the caretaker's withdrawal. It only took until September 1991 for vandals to destroy the keepers' cottages by fire. In 1992 the Australian Construction Services cleared the site and stabilised some of the building elements, and a security fence was installed.|$|E

25|$|For {{electricity}} production Sevmorput has three 1,700kW turbogenerators and three 2,000kW standby <b>diesel</b> <b>generators.</b> In addition {{in case of}} blackout the vessel also has two 200kW emergency <b>diesel</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{domestic}} {{consumers in}} the remote areas that are not served by the main electrical grid network, <b>diesel</b> <b>generators</b> are the usual choice for electrical supply. As a result, plenty of servicing and maintenance {{needed to be done}} onto these <b>diesel</b> <b>generators.</b> Thus, researchers have come out with the ideas of introducing wind turbine working together with the <b>diesel</b> <b>generators</b> to form a hybrid power system. This paper utilised the MATLAB SIMULINK software in the modelling of such a wind/diesel/battery hybrid power system for a stand-alone unit in a remote location. This design allows for the addition of wind energy inputs in conjunction with the <b>diesel</b> <b>generators</b> for fuel saving. In addition, a battery bank was introduced to manage the load demand during peak hours. The economic dispatch of the <b>diesel</b> <b>generators</b> was also analysed for the system...|$|R
5|$|The bunker complex was self-contained. However, as the Führerbunker {{was below}} the water table, {{conditions}} were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater. A <b>diesel</b> <b>generator</b> provided electricity, and well water was pumped {{in as the}} water supply. Communications systems included a telex, a telephone switchboard, and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated {{at the end of}} the war, Hitler received much of his war news from BBC radio broadcasts and via courier.|$|E

Of the two rooms, one was the report room used for administrative work, record keeping and logbooks. It is currently used as a radio room. The second room housed a spare mantle holder. It currently houses the electrical controls, including the sensors responsible for starting the light. It also houses the backup batteries, backup <b>diesel</b> <b>generator</b> and fuel tank, {{as well as a}} small workshop.|$|E
5|$|Before the Croatian War of Independence Velebit {{served with}} the 88th Submarine Flotilla of the Yugoslav Navy {{entering}} service during the late 1980s. Velebit, then named Soča, was like other Una-class submarines, named after rivers in Yugoslavia. In 1991, it was being overhauled in Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata {{until the beginning of}} the war, when Croatian forces captured it. In 1993, Brodarski Institut (BI) of Zagreb started a modification program to improve the operational capabilities of the submarine captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthend to create space needed for the installation of a single MTU 105kW <b>diesel</b> <b>generator,</b> a feature the original Una-class design lacked. A new steering system developed by BI was also installed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT There {{is a need}} to {{quantify}} the environ-mental impact of powering macro base transmitter station sites with <b>diesel</b> <b>generators.</b> The energy con-sumption of <b>diesel</b> <b>generators</b> to power base stations for telecommunication networks is a contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents a model for calculating emission generation. The model was used to study the environmental im-pact of macro radio base stations powered by <b>diesel</b> <b>generators</b> using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) - optimization and simulation software tool. The environmental impact of powering base stations with <b>diesel</b> <b>generators</b> was assessed by quantifying the emissions generated in terms of pollution and the impact in terms of environ-mental cost ($ 200 t/yr). From the results of emissions generated from <b>diesel</b> <b>generators</b> and presented in this study [105. 96 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO 2), 0. 26 tonnes of carbon monoxide (CO), 0. 03 tonnes of un-burned hydrocarbons (UHC), 0. 02 tonnes of particu-late matter (PM), 0. 21 tonnes of sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and 2. 33 tonnes of nitrogen oxides (NOX) ], the use of <b>diesel</b> <b>generators</b> to power GSM base station sites is concluded to have significant environmental impact...|$|R

5|$|With the {{destruction}} wrought by Cyclone Laurence in 2009 still fresh in their minds, residents, business owners, and farmers worked hurriedly to prepare their properties and livestock for Lua's onslaught. Horizon Power temporarily redirected power {{supply in the}} towns of Marble Bar and Nullagine from solar power stations to <b>diesel</b> <b>generator</b> stations. Evacuation shelters were opened to refugees of the storm with no safe living arrangements starting 16 March. About 110 individuals sought shelter at one such location in Nullagine. As the storm moved inland, flood warnings were posted throughout the Kimberley and the Pilbara, where officials closed public access to Karijini National Park. The impending cyclone forced {{the closure of the}} Great Northern and North West Coast highways, while flights to and from several airports were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|After her refit was {{completed}} on 18 January 1944, Steinbrinck {{and her sister}} Theodor Riedel spent {{the first half of}} the year laying minefields at the entrance to the Skaggerak and escorting convoys to and from Norway. On 3 May the ship passed through the Kiel Canal en route to Hamburg for a lengthy refit. While in the dockyard, she was struck by a bomb in the <b>diesel</b> <b>generator</b> room on 18 June. Despite the extent of the damage, the dockyard reported that her refit would be completed as scheduled on 20 November. On 4 November another bomb detonated alongside Steinbrinck and caused extensive flooding and shock damage from the explosion. The ship was patched up and towed to Wesermünde for more thorough repairs, but her completion was seriously delayed. By 1 April 1945, only a single engine was operable and the Kriegsmarine made the decision to strip her crew for combat duties ashore after she was moved to Cuxhaven. She was still there in May when the Germans surrendered.|$|E
25|$|The {{numbering}} system {{was divided into}} two series, one for AC locomotives and one for DC locomotives.

25|$|Diesel {{generators}} commonly provide {{electricity in}} remote areas. About 40%–50% {{of the energy}} output is low-grade heat that leaves the engine via the exhaust. Connecting a membrane distillation system to the diesel engine exhaust repurposes this low-grade heat for desalination. The system actively cools the <b>diesel</b> <b>generator,</b> improving its efficiency and increasing its electricity output. This results in an energy-neutral desalination solution. An example plant was commissioned by Dutch company Aquaver in March 2014 for Gulhi, Maldives.|$|E
