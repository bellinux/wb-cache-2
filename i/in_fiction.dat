5|$|The {{style of}} {{narrative}} writing, {{in this passage}} and throughout the piece, was alien to journalism at the time, and was considered the province of fiction writing.

5|$|Themes {{from these}} social {{investigations}} {{have been drawn}} out <b>in</b> <b>fiction.</b> Crime, poverty, vice, sexual transgression, drugs, class-conflict and multi-cultural encounters and fantasies involving Jewish, Chinese and Indian immigrants are major themes.

5|$|Due to the town's {{traditional}} seaside appearance, it {{has often}} been used as a setting for television programmes and films.

Hornung's fragile constitution was further weakened by the stress of his war work. To aid his recuperation, he and his wife visited the South of France in 1921. He fell ill from influenza on the journey, and died on 22 March 1922, aged 54.|$|E
