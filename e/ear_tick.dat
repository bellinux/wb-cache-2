50|$|Otobius megnini, {{also known}} as the spinose <b>ear</b> <b>tick,</b> is a soft-bodied tick that is only {{parasitic}} in the larval and nymphal stages. As its common name suggests, the spinose ear tick's parasitic forms are usually found within the ears of the definitive host. This tick has a worldwide distribution, with common hosts that include horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and dogs.|$|E
50|$|Although spinose <b>ear</b> <b>ticks</b> are {{generally}} associated with semiarid or arid environments {{such as those}} found in the southwestern United States, they can also be found in other climate areas due to widespread interstate transportation of animals. Larvae and nymphs usually remain within the ears of their host. Fully grown nymphs and adults live off the host, but still within the host's general environment. They usually prefer dry, protected places such as in cracks and crevices or under logs and fence posts.|$|R
50|$|Spinose <b>ear</b> <b>ticks</b> are a {{constant}} source of annoyance and irritation for their definitive hosts. Their tendency to occur in large numbers can cause ulceration of the inner ear, high sensitivity of the ears, large amounts of blood loss, and even deafness.

50|$|Tick {{species are}} widely {{distributed}} around the world, but {{they tend to}} flourish more in countries with warm, humid climates, because they require a certain amount of moisture in the air to undergo metamorphosis, and because low temperatures inhibit their development from egg to larva. Ticks are also widely distributed among host taxa, which include marsupial and placental mammals, birds, reptiles such as snakes, iguanas and lizards, and amphibians.Ticks of domestic animals cause considerable harm to livestock by transmission of many species of pathogen, as well as causing anaemia and damaging wool and hides.

50|$|Other genera with {{species that}} are often of high local {{importance}} to domestic animals include these examples: Ixodes (Ixodes ricinus, the deer tick of Europe; Ixodes scapularis, the black-legged tick of North America; Ixodes holocyclus, the paralysis tick of Australia). Haemaphysalis (Ha. leachii, the yellow dog tick of the tropics). Dermacentor (Dermacentor andersoni, the Rocky Mountain wood tick; Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick; D. reticulatus, the ornate dog tick of Europe). Dermacentor nitens the tropical horse tick of the Americas has a one-host lifecycle similar to the boophilids. Margaropus winthemi, the beady-legged tick, infests horses and cattle in South Africa. The soft tick Otobius megnini, the spinose <b>ear</b> <b>tick,</b> has its nymphs feeding within the ear canal of many species of domestic animals. Adults of Ot. megnini do not feed. This tick occurs in the Americas and has spread to Africa and Asia.|$|E
50|$|O. megnini has {{a single}} host life cycle in which the larvae and nymphs remain deep within the {{external}} ear canal of their definitive host {{for long periods of}} time. The eggs are laid on or near the ground and hatch in 18 days or more. The larvae then crawl up vegetation, fence posts, or anything else they can find to wait for a host. They are capable of surviving without a host for more than 2 months. Once the larvae find a host, they migrate to the ears and feed for 5-10 days. They then molt and become nymphs, still remaining within the host's ear. The nymphs feed for about a month, after which they crawl out of the ear onto the ground in order to molt again and become adults. It is possible for the nymphal stages to remain in the ear for 1-7 months, and adults can produce eggs for up to 6 months. Spinose <b>ear</b> <b>tick</b> adults do not feed; they absorb water from the atmosphere in order to survive.|$|E

50|$|The world {{population}} of Arctic foxes is thus not endangered, but two Arctic fox subpopulations are. One is on Medny Island (Commander Islands, Russia), which was reduced by some 85-90%, to around 90 animals, {{as a result}} of mange caused by an <b>ear</b> <b>tick</b> introduced by dogs in the 1970s. The population is currently under treatment with antiparasitic drugs, but the result is still uncertain.The other threatened population is the one in Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Kola Peninsula). This population decreased drastically around the start of the 20th century {{as a result of}} extreme fur prices, which caused severe hunting also during population lows. The population has remained at a low density for more than 90 years, with additional reductions during the last decade. The total population estimate for 1997 is around 60 adults in Sweden, 11 adults in Finland, and 50 in Norway. From Kola, there are indications of a similar situation, suggesting a population of around 20 adults. The Fennoscandian population thus numbers around 140 breeding adults. Even after local lemming peaks, the Arctic fox population tends to collapse back to levels dangerously close to nonviability.|$|E

Carcases of freshly shot red deer, mouflon and wild boar were examined for the {{presence of}} any stage of I. ricinus. Questing ticks were collected from locations where red deer and wild boar are known to occur. Presence of Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. DNA was examined in a fraction of the collected ticks. Larvae, nymphs and adult ticks were found on the three large grazers. Red deer had the highest tick burden, with many of the nymphs and adult females attached for engorgement. Most larvae had not attached. The mean number of ticks on the animals varied from 13 to 67. Ticks were highly aggregated amongst the animals: some animals had no ticks, while others had high numbers. Larvae and nymphs were mostly found on the <b>ears,</b> while adult <b>ticks</b> were attached to the axillae. The Borrelia infection rate of questing nymphs was 8. 5 %. Unengorged wandering nymphs on deer had a Borrelia infection rate of 12. 5 %, while only 0. 9 % of feeding nymphs carried a Borrelia infection. The infection rate of unengorged adult male ticks was 4. 5 %, and that of feeding female ticks was 0. 7 %.

40|$|East Coast Fever (ECF) - 2 Cue: For cattle keepers in East and Central Africa, one of {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} to threaten their herds is East Coast fever. The disease is of particular danger to young animals, especially those of exotic breeds. Spread to livestock by brown <b>ear</b> <b>ticks,</b> the first sign of infection that cattle owners should be aware of is a swelling that occurs just below the ear of the animal. A few days after this swelling takes place, the animal develops a fever, and within a week it may begin to experience other symptoms. These can include difficulty in breathing and a soft cough, caused by fluid in the lungs; diarrhoea; a general wasting or weakening of muscle strength, and unusual whiteness in the eyes and gums. Treatment of the disease is possible, using drugs such as parvaquone or buparvaquone, commonly known as Parvexon. But farmers should also consider protecting their animals from the disease where possible. Dr Jaribu Sultan is a veterinary specialist working for the NGO Farm-Africa in northern Tanzania. He spoke recently to Lazarus Laiser about East Coast fever, and in particular, how cattle owners can protect their animals against this deadly disease. IN:		?East Coast fever is one of ? OUT:		?many problems of animal health care. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 12 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Jaribu Sultan speaking about the value of investing in livestock health. Transcript Sultan	East Coast fever is {{one of the}} killer diseases in most of the livestock, and the mortality rate can reach as high as 100 %, especially to the young animals of exotic breeds. And in relation to the indigenous cattle, it also causes a lot of death to these young animals. Laiser	How can the farmer prevent the disease spreading to other animals? Sultan	East Coast fever can be prevented by two methods. First, animals can be dipped; animals can be sent to the dip tank and dipped there. Or the animal can be sprayed by the farmer, using a knapsack sprayer, with a reputable acaricide. And the second method is through immunisation. They can be immunised or vaccinated against East Coast fever when they are still young or even when they are adult. The vaccine is a long-life vaccine, so you don?t need to repeat it. So it is economical actually to immunise your animal. Firstly you will protect the animal, and second, you can even reduce the cost of acaricides. Laiser	One of the ways of preventing the disease is to spray or dip the animals. Is it good for a farmer to spray an animal himself or herself? Sultan	Yes, it is much better if a farmer knows how to mix the acaricide, and he knows the area where ticks are mostly found in the body of the animal, then he can spray himself. That is very good, because at least he can protect the animal. But in case, if the farmer does not know, it is much better to use a dip tank, if the dip tank is available in the village. Or else the farmer can also get assistance from a nearby Community Based Animal Health Worker, or can even ask a village extension officer, so that he can be trained. He can be shown how to calculate the dosage of acaricide with water, and shown the areas where he is supposed to spray the animal on the body. Laiser	How many livestock can be affected, according to your experience ? you are living in the villages and treating animals all the time? Sultan	Actually if you look at the trend of the life-cycle of the ticks, you find that, especially during the rainy season the incidence of East Coast fever is very high. And you may also find that many animals are suffering. And the high mortality rate is to the young animals ? it is very very high. If you don?t protect the young animals, then you may eventually lose most of them. But it is advisable that farmers should adhere to the advice from the extension officers, that they should regularly dip their animals or spray their animals, so that they can reduce the tick burdens, and hence reduce even tick borne diseases, and especially East Coast fever. Laiser	Do you have any word you would like to say to the farmers? Sultan	Yes, thank you very much. What I would like to say to the farmers, is that the farmers should come together, even to form their own small association. So that they will be able to discuss the welfare of their animals, and how can they also increase the production. They have to organise themselves to manage the dip tank. Suppose someone comes from outside and wants to manage the dip tank, they have to go there and dip their animals. Not that they send two out of 100 hundred animals to dip there, because they feel that if they dip all animals that is very expensive. But what I advise them, is that if you have 50 cattle, and you sell one, that money can assist you to solve many problems of animal health care. End of track.

40|$|Assessment {{of adult}} female tick burden was {{performed}} on 160, 151 and 150 yearling sheep in coastal Kenya {{at the end of}} three consecutive infestation periods, respectively. The main attachment sites of fully engorged female ticks were ears, head, body sides, perianal and scrotal/udder regions. Averaged over the three sampling periods, 87 percent of the ticks counted were on the ears. The correlation between tick count on the ears and total body tick count was high (0. 97). The average repeatability for two recorders of tick counts on the ears and the whole body was similar and high (0. 95 and 0. 93, respectively).

40|$|Diapause {{in adults}} of the African brown <b>ear</b> <b>tick</b> Rhipicephalus appendiculatus is {{dependent}} on latitude and stock origin. Lower latitude populations, that is, those nearer the equator, show no diapause response to long or short day exposure. Diapause response to short daylengths is found in higher latitude populations, further south, and increases with increasing latitude. Nearly all individuals in the southen most population, used in this study, enter diapause under short and long day exposure which implies that the onset of diapause in this population is obligatory. Diapause termination in higher latitude populations is induced by increasing photoperiod, further north, but still south of the equator, diapause is terminated by ageing. The differences in diapausing behaviour of the different populations are discussed {{in relation to their}} climatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Hard ticks (Ixodidae) are {{obligatory}} hematophagous ectoparasites {{of worldwide}} medical and veterinary importance.

To investigate the role of duplication events on genome size, bioinformatics was used to identify putatively duplicated genes (paralogs) from expressed sequence tag sequences (ESTs) from four species of hard ticks, including the prostriate tick Ixodes scapularis (Lyme disease tick) and the metastriate ticks Amblyomma variegatum (tropical bont tick), Rhipicephalus microplus (southern cattle tick) and R. appendiculatus (brown <b>ear</b> <b>tick).</b> Among these ticks, 2 â€“ 10...|$|E

40|$|Ra-KLP, a 75 {{amino acid}} protein {{secreted}} by the salivary gland {{of the brown}} <b>ear</b> <b>tick</b> Rhipicephalus appendiculatus has a sequence resembling those of Kunitz/BPTI proteins.

Even more unusually, the N-terminal portion of the polypeptide chain is pinned to the "Kunitz head" by two disulphide bridges not found in classical Kunitz/BPTI proteins. The disulphide bond pattern has been further altered by the loss of the bridge that normally stabilizes the protease-binding loop.

40|$|Identification {{and control}} of ticks common to Nebraska. Ticks {{are members of the}} same phylum (Arthropoda) of the animal kingdom as insects, but are in a {{different}} class (Arachnida). The main difference is the body of a tick is composed of only two sections while insect bodies have three sections. There are over 800 species of ticks, 100 of which are important to man and animals because of economic losses or disease transmission. Fortunately in the United States, only about 12 species are economically important because they transmit disease organisms (viral, bacterial, protozoan, and rickettsial) or cause economic losses to livestock. In Nebraska only three tick species, Dermacentor andersoni (Rocky Mountain wood tick), Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick), and Rhipicephalus sanquineus (brown dog tick), are found in enough numbers to be considered economically important.

40|$|Ticks, {{like other}} {{haematophagous}} ectoparasites, secrete in their saliva bioactive substances that counter the host animal's defence reactions at the feeding site and thus facilitate {{the acquisition of}} the bloodmeal. We discovered a family of histamine-binding proteins (HBPs) in the saliva of the brown <b>ear</b> <b>tick,</b> Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. HBPs most probably act by mopping up free histamine at the wound site, making it unavailable to the host's H 1 - and H 2 -histamine receptors, thus suppressing inflammation. The tick proteins show no sequence homology with known histamine receptors, nor do histamine receptor agonists or antagonists effectively compete with histamine for the binding sites on the tick proteins. The HBPs were expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell expression system. Binding-assays with 3 H-histamine reveal high affinities {{for two of the}} proteins, but a weaker binding for a third HBP. The high-affinity binders very efficiently suppress histamine-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum.

40|$|The brown <b>ear</b> <b>tick</b> Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, vector of East Coast fever (ECF) {{and related}} cattle {{diseases}} caused by Theileria parva {{has never been}} reported from the Horn of Africa. Habitat suitability for this tick species was predicted using Maxent modelling technique based on R. appendiculatus records in Sub-Saharan Africa. Two models were developed: the first {{is based on the}} tropical R. appendiculatus distribution and the one is based on the distribution records in the temperate region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The tropical model shows favourable habitat in much of the Ethiopian highlands. The whole Djibouti, the south eastern Ethiopian lowlands, majority of Somalia and Eritrea were found to be not suitable for the survival and development of this tick species. Highly suitable areas occur in areas which have moderate temperature and high precipitation. Introductions of R. appendiculatus into the Horn of Africa probably have been prevented by the natural barrier between the known R. appendiculatus distribution range in East Africa and the Horn of Africa. The effect of an introduction of R. appendiculatus and thereby ECF into the Horn of Africa could be catastrophic since the cattle in this area have no immunity against ECF, and mortality might be considerable in all age groups of cattle.

These differences have important implications for both the impact and control of ECF. A paradigm for evaluating production systems for theileriosis based on the epidemiological states i. e. degree of endemic stability or instability has been developed. In endemically stable systems, there is an equilibrium between Theileria parasites and hosts so that ECF impact is minimal despite high infection challenge. In unstable situations, ECF impact can be considerable, either through direct losses from ECF or in costs associated with its control. The prevalence, sero-conversion risk and morbidity/mortality risks of ECF for female calves up to 6 months of age in 5 contrasting agro-ecological zone (AEZ) -grazing system strata in Murang a District, Kenya has been previously described. This paper uses the indicators of theileriosis infection quantified in that study to characterise the epidemiological states of ECF in the 5 AEZ-grazing strata studied in Muranga District, Kenya...|$|E

We describe herein sequence polymorphism in genes encoding Ra 86 homologues of Bm 86 in the brown <b>ear</b> <b>tick,</b> Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, isolated from four Kenyan field populations and one laboratory colony. Sequencing of 19 Ra 86 sequences defined two alleles differentiated by indels, encoding 693 amino acids (aa) and 654 aa respectively, from the Muguga laboratory reference strain. Ra 86 sequences were also determined from gut cDNA from four field populations of R. appendiculatuscollected in different livestock production systems in Kenya. Analysis of approximately 20 Ra 86 sequences {{from each of the}} four field sites in central and Western Kenya; Makuyu, Kiambu, Kakamega and Uasin Gishu, revealed three additional size types differentiated by 39 â€“ 49 amino acid indels resulting in a total of 5 indel-defined genotypes. The 693 aa type 5 was isolated only from the laboratory tick stock; genotypes 1, 2 and 3 were identified in ticks from the four Kenyan field sites and appeared to be derivatives of the shorter RA 86 genotype found in Muguga laboratory stock genotype 4. By contrast no large indels have yet been observed between R. microplus sequences from Australia, South America or Africa. Evidence that selection contributes to the observed sequence variation was provided by analysis of ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions and application of the selective neutrality and neutral evolution tests to the primary data. Phylogenetic analysis clustered sequences from all Ra 86 size types and Bm 86, into four major clades based on amino acid substitutions, but {{there was no evidence that}} these groupings correlated with geographical separation of R. appendiculatus populationsGerman Academic Exchange ServicePeer Revie...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the transmission dynamics of Theileria parva (T. parva) by the brown <b>ear</b> <b>tick,</b> Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (R. appendiculatus), under experimental conditions, detection of T. parva in ticks and cattle was performed by a quantitative real-time PCR assay. A calf inoculated with a T. parva mixture became PCR-positive for T. parva infection on day 8 post-inoculation, and subsequently, nymphal ticks were introduced and maintained to feed on the infected calf for 6 days. Engorged nymphs were collected daily and allowed to molt into adults, and overall, 70. 8 % (121 / 171) of the adult ticks acquired the T. parva infection. Furthermore, the T. parva infection rate in ticks under field conditions was monitored by real-time PCR in R. appendiculatus ticks collected from a traditionally managed pastoral land of Zambia, on which Sanga breed cattle are traditionally reared and the area has endemic East Coast fever (ECF). A total of 70 cattle were randomly selected {{in the same area}} and 67 (95. 7 %) were found to be serologically positive for R. appendiculatus tick antigen (RIM 36). Twenty-nine (43. 3 %) of the 67 serologically positive cattle were real-time PCR-positive for T. parva, although no piroplasms could be detected in the blood smears. Unexpectedly, out of 614 R. appendiculatus nymphal and adult ticks collected by flagging vegetation, 4. 1 % were positive for T. parva DNA. However, since the rate of transmission of T. parva from infected cattle to ticks and vice versa and the serological evidence of exposure to R. appendiculatus ticks in naturally exposed cattle were relatively high, it would be wise in such a case to consider vector control as well as vaccination against ECF as control measures...|$|E
