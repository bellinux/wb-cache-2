25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's counter gear shaft. The revision of the four speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the <b>differential</b> <b>pinion</b> shaft to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the course corrections undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{rear-mounted}} engine, {{the differential}} lies between the transmission and engine, so {{drive to the}} transmission from the engine is carried forward via a hollow turbine shaft from the engine mounted torque converter to the transmission gearbox. Power from the gearbox was carried rearward again to the <b>differential</b> <b>pinion</b> gear via yet another, concentric hollow shaft of larger diameter. A small concentric shaft inside the turbine shaft operated the front pump of the transmission to permit engagement of drive/reverse ranges when the car was stopped or moving slowly; at speeds over 15 mph, a differential-driven (from the car motion) rear pump of smaller capacity and greater efficiency took over and the front pump shut down to improve fuel economy.|$|E

50|$|The new chassis {{allowed the}} floor to be placed much lower, which in turn led to a lower and longer look overall. The major {{component}} of this chassis was a <b>differential</b> whose <b>pinion</b> gear was exceptionally low relative to the axleshafts, lower than in conventional hypoid differentials.|$|R
50|$|The AAM 9.25 {{solid axle}} was {{developed}} for 3rd generation Dodge Rams (3/4 and 1 Ton). The axle uses a modified Saginaw 9.5 <b>differential,</b> ring and <b>pinion.</b> The <b>differential</b> housing covers are identical. Model year 2010 and later Rams use larger universal joints than the 2003-2009 models.|$|R
50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and bleed valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the depositâ€™s corrosion resistance. <b>Differential</b> <b>pinion</b> shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the first}} part of the bachelor`s thesis is {{creating}} an examination of basic types of the differential. The beginning of the work is devoted to the division of permanent transmission. The following chapter deals with the differential system and describes basic qualities of the differentials. The actual body of the first part is a description of individual types of differentials. The second part of the bachelor`s thesis focuses on storing of the <b>differential</b> <b>pinion.</b> The storing in this part is divided according to the gear of the transmission. The constructional examples from practice for the individual types are given. The end of the chapter contains an evaluation and advice for the construction of storing of the <b>differential</b> <b>pinion...</b>|$|E

5000|$|Both IFS 100 and Live-axle 105 {{models have}} been {{reported}} as suffering from broken front differential centres when driven in harsh conditions. The most common front differential failures in IFS models are reported in vehicles produced between mid-1997 and mid-1999 (i.e. the model years 1998 and 1999), when Toyota fitted the 100 Series IFS with a 2-pinion front <b>differential</b> (the <b>pinion</b> gear would flex away from the ring gear under shock loads). In 1999 (model year 2000) the IFS Landcruiser received a 4-pinion front differential that was more robust - fewer failures were reported.|$|R
50|$|The GM 9.25 IFS {{has been}} the main front {{differential}} in Four-wheel drive 3/4 Ton and 1 Ton GM trucks since 1988. The Dana 60 solid axle front end was used selectively in trucks with a higher GVWR from 1988-1991. The original Saginaw 9.5 <b>differential,</b> ring and <b>pinion</b> were modified {{to work with the}} independent front suspension. The ring and pinion were also reverse-cut as well.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the <b>differential</b> carrier, <b>pinion</b> and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999 Ford revamped {{their heavy}} trucks, {{including}} their own Sterling axle. An upgraded 3 <b>pinion</b> <b>differential</b> carrier was added. The differentials are interchangeable {{between the two}} variations. The new axle also came with disc brakes and a unique 8x170mm metric lug pattern. Options and features remained unchanged until model year 2011 trucks. 2011 models with this axle {{have the option of}} being equipped with an electronic locking differential.|$|R
5000|$|From January 1963 an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1703 cc engine was introduced for the range being uprated to [...] in low compression form, while for premium petrol users a high compression head was offered which gave this Zephyr 4 unit an output of [...] A four speed all synchromesh gearbox was also available from this time, and if fitted a heavy duty back axle with a four <b>pinion</b> <b>differential</b> was specified.|$|R
5000|$|An ideal {{engine and}} {{transmission}} existed amongst Dagenham's passenger car range, {{this being the}} Consul's 1703 cc ohv engine, with its associated three speed gearbox with synchromesh between the upper two ratios and a column gearchange mechanism, and the two <b>pinion</b> <b>differential</b> three quarter floating final drive. The low compression (6.9: 1) version of this engine, developing [...] at 4400 rpm was chosen, with the Consul's regular high compression cylinder head (7.8:1) being optional on the new van, A further option {{was to be the}} Perkins 4/99 diesel, this being a 1.6 litre four cylinder unit producing only , therefore somewhat marginal from a performance viewpoint but offering useful long term economies over the petrol engine.|$|R
50|$|Model AA Ford has a four-speed manual gearbox. The {{transmission}} is geared {{lower than the}} Model A Ford to provide more torque to move a loaded truck. This lower gearing reduced the top speed of the truck {{when compared to the}} Model A Ford. The transmission also featured a lock-out on the shift knob for reverse that required a lever to be activated with the thumb so reverse could be engaged. This was done to prevent accidental engagement of reverse while the truck was in motion. Early trucks had a worm gear rear-end that limited the top speed of the truck. That rear-end was replaced by a ring and <b>pinion</b> <b>differential</b> to improve the speed of the truck. Later models were fitted with braces on the outer casing of the rear-end to provide additional support to the rear-end housing.|$|R
