5|$|Like the Patriarch in García Márquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch, Bolívar was an {{absolute}} dictator. The Patriarch is never identified by name; Bolívar, too, is identified chiefly by his title.

In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles Buendía in One <b>Hundred</b> <b>Years</b> of Solitude and Santiago Nasar in Chronicle of a Death Foretold.|$|E

Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
