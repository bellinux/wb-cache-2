25|$|Classical {{models of}} {{unemployment}} occurs when wages {{are too high}} for employers {{to be willing to}} hire more workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployment</b> occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{unemployment}} {{covers a}} variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers' skills and the skills required for open jobs. Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills {{are no longer in}} demand. Structural unemployment is similar to <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployment</b> since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployment</b> {{refers to}} the period when workers are searching for a job or {{changing}} jobs. It is sometimes called search unemployment and can be voluntary based on {{the circumstances of the}} unemployed individual. <b>Frictional</b> <b>unemployment</b> is always present in an economy, so the level of involuntary unemployment is properly the unemployment rate minus the rate of <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployment.</b>|$|E
40|$|A large {{exclusion}} from {{the labor market}} or an important unemployment of lowskilled workers is observed in numerous countries that set a minimum wage. Unemployment benefit or subsidizing low-skilled job policies can be mixed {{to deal with this}} situation. We introduce a matching model where (i)  co-exist classical and <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployments,</b> (ii)  the labor market is dual. Low-skilled jobs pay the minimum wage, while high-skilled wages result from bargaining. High-skilled unemployed can apply for both types of jobs, while opportunities for low-skilled ones are limited to low-skilled jobs. In this set-up, increasing low-skilled job subsidies with a balanced budget does not necessarily reduce low-skilled unemployment or unemployment spells. The model is calibrated for the French labor market. Classifications JEL : H 21, H 23, J 41...|$|R

40|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that there exists job search and recruiting friction in urban areas. This paper constructs a two-sector (rural and urban) model involving this factor and investigates how it affects migration and what the optimal policies should be. An analysis shows that <b>frictional</b> urban <b>unemployment</b> brings about intersector wage differentials and that an economy almost always has distortion {{in the absence of}} government intervention. Tax and subsidy policies that remove the distortion are explored. Setting urban wages appropriately is also shown to attain the optimum. Finally, we explore the criterion to judge whether changing urban wages as a policy, such as the minimum wage law, enhances social welfare. Copyright Blackwell Publishing, Inc. 2004...|$|R
30|$|In fact, both {{arguments}} {{have some}} credence and, especially when youth unemployment is so massive {{as it is}} in Italy, all components of youth unemployment coexist: Keynesian, neoclassical, as well as <b>frictional</b> and mismatch <b>unemployment.</b> Keynesian unemployment, which is due to insufficient aggregate demand, has recently increased because of low economic growth. Without stimulating growth, the EYG is bound to fail as a tool to bring full employment.|$|R
30|$|The urban {{labor market}} has been {{experiencing}} painful adjustments since the late 1990 s, {{and a total of}} 40 million workers were laid off up to 2002. As the economy continues to grow and the labor market to evolve, people who had been laid off and were officially registered as unemployed have either found new jobs or retired. It seems, therefore, that while these kinds of adjustments help eliminate hidden unemployment in urban areas, older workers are more vulnerable to <b>frictional</b> and structural <b>unemployment.</b>|$|R
50|$|Structural {{unemployment}} {{occurs when}} a labour market is unable to provide jobs for everyone who wants one {{because there is a}} mismatch between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills needed for the available jobs.

30|$|Without {{reforming}} {{labor market}} institutions, <b>frictional</b> and mismatch <b>unemployment</b> will remain high. Structural reforms, which are meant here {{not as a}} new labor market regulation but rather as the reinforcement of the PES and the re-organization of labor market institutions, will have several positive effects. First, they will reactivate many jobless young people, not only the unemployed, but also those out of the labor market. In turn, this will {{increase the number of}} tax payers and, indirectly, consumption by generating a redistribution of resources from high to low incomes and especially to the unemployed. This is in fact a pre-condition for a really expansionary fiscal policy.|$|R
50|$|Structural {{unemployment}} {{is one of}} several major categories of unemployment distinguished by economists, including <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployment,</b> cyclical unemployment, involuntary unemployment, and classical unemployment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frictional</b> <b>unemployment</b> exists {{because both}} jobs and workers are heterogeneous, and a {{mismatch}} can result between {{the characteristics of}} supply and demand. Such a mismatch {{can be related to}} skills, payment, worktime, location, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other factors. New entrants (such as graduating students) and re-entrants (such as former homemakers) can also suffer a spell of <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployment.</b> Workers as well as employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually not right away; they will invest some time and effort to find a match. This is in fact beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources. However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy suffers, since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployment.</b>|$|E

30|$|In {{studying}} unemployment, {{scholars in}} macroeconomics and labor economics have mostly focused on {{two types of}} unemployment: cyclical unemployment and natural <b>unemployment</b> (which includes <b>frictional</b> and structural <b>unemployment).</b> In a typical labor market and under normal conditions, macroeconomic fluctuations are associated with temporary changes {{in the relationship between}} labor demand and supply, which generate cyclical unemployment. By contrast, natural unemployment, either in the form of frictional or structural employment, is the effect of a mismatch between the employment objectives of workers on one hand and employment opportunities employers can offer on the other. More specifically, such a mismatch can reflect either the time cost of job search or changes in skill requirements.|$|R

5000|$|An alternative, more normative, {{definition}} (used by some labor economists) {{would see}} [...] "full employment" [...] as {{the attainment of}} the ideal unemployment rate, where the types of unemployment that reflect labor-market inefficiency (such as mismatch or structural unemployment) do not exist.

40|$|What Korea has {{is not an}} "un{{employment}} problem " {{but rather}} an "employment problem. " The employment problem includes continued high unemployment, but it goes well beyond it, also encompassing falling labor earnings, rising poverty and inequality, disproportionate impacts on disadvantaged groups, informalization of employment, increased job insecurity, and consequent social strains. This paper documents Korea's employment problem, characterizes the problem as deficient aggregate demand rather than <b>frictional</b> or structural <b>unemployment,</b> examines in some detail {{three of the most}} important elements of the social safety net (the Employment Insurance System, the Livelihood Protection Program, and public works), and considers four major ways of strengthening conditions in product markets and labor markets: stimulating macroeconomic growth, fighting unemployment and low earnings, improving the industrial relations climate, and establishing appropriate labor market flexibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{social welfare}} {{implications}} of income tax policy are shown to critically {{depend on whether}} or not labor markets are rationed – i. e., on the existence of involuntary unemployment. With rationed labor markets, raising taxes on the employed and transfers to the unemployed might improve both equity and efficiency. It improves equity by redistributing income from the employed to the unemployed; it improves efficiency as it encourages people with a small utility surplus of employment to exit the labor market, leaving their jobs for people with a higher utility surplus. I derive conditions under which this result continues to hold when only part of the labor market is rationed, when there is both <b>frictional</b> and rationing <b>unemployment,</b> and when rationing endogenously follows from trade unions' monopoly power...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{this group}} of laborers is subject {{not only to the}} risks of layoffs induced by the {{campaign}} to break the iron rice bowl of SOEs but also to the risks of <b>frictional</b> and structural <b>unemployment.</b> One silver lining for them, however, is that since most of them have urban hukou, or household registrations, and are already living in urban communities, they tend to be counted properly in official statistics in regard to their employment status. By contrast, migrant workers are often discounted, undercounted, or uncounted altogether. This is evidenced {{by the fact that they}} have consistently accounted for a large share of the registered unemployed in official records. On the one hand, since the difficulties those laborers face are long-standing and persistent, registered unemployment in urban areas has been relatively insensitive to macroeconomic fluctuations. But on the other hand, they are also relatively well protected by the urban social security system and safety net.|$|R
5000|$|Frictional unemployment; a {{decrease}} in frictions would {{reduce the number of}} firms searching for employees and the number of unemployed searching for jobs.

50|$|Mortensen's {{research}} {{focused on}} labor economics, macroeconomics and economic theory.

50|$|In {{addition}} to these comprehensive theories of unemployment, {{there are a few}} categorizations of unemployment that are used to more precisely model the effects of unemployment within the economic system. The main types of unemployment include structural unemployment which focuses on structural problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labour markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets. Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization. Discussions of <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployment</b> focus on voluntary decisions to work based on each individuals' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates plus the time and effort required to find a job. Causes and solutions for <b>frictional</b> <b>unemployment</b> often address job entry threshold and wage rates. Behavioral economists highlight individual biases in decision making, and often involve problems and solutions concerning sticky wages and efficiency wages.|$|E
40|$|A general {{equilibrium}} search model makes layoff costs {{affect the}} aggregate {{unemployment rate in}} ways that depend on equilibrium proportions of <b>frictional</b> and structural <b>unemployment</b> that in turn depend on the generosity of government unemployment benefits and skill losses among newly displaced workers. The model explains how, before the 1970 s, lower flows into unemployment gave Europe lower unemployment rates than the United States and also how, after 1980, higher durations have kept unemployment rates in Europe persistently {{higher than in the}} United States. These outcomes arise from the way Europe’s higher firing costs and more generous unemployment compensation make its unemployment rate respond to bigger skill losses among newly displaced workers. Those bigger skill losses also explain why U. S. workers have experienced more earnings volatility since 1980 and why, especially among older workers, hazard rates of gaining employment in Europe now fall sharply with increases in the duration of unemployment...|$|R
40|$|Persistently high {{unemployment}} in South Africa, {{especially in the}} face of improved economic conditions since 1994, begs the question: Does unemployment in South Africa respond to changes in output? When considering the linkages between output and unemployment, it is useful to decompose unemployment into its three components: structural, <b>frictional</b> and cyclical <b>unemployment.</b> Deficient aggregate demand gives rise to cyclical unemployment. Okun's law (1962) refers to the inverse relationship that exists between cyclical output and cyclical unemployment This paper estimates the relationship between economic activity (cyclical GDP) and changes in the unemployment rate (cyclical unemployment) for South Africa. A variety of detrending methods is used to decompose output and unemployment series into their trend and cyclical components. The paper also addresses the question of asymmetries in Okun's coefficient. The results indicate the presence of an Okun's law relationship in South Africa over the period 1970 - 2005 with more evidence in favour of asymmetries during recessions. ...|$|R
5000|$|The natural rate of {{unemployment}} {{is a concept}} of economic activity developed in particular by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps in the 1960s, both recipients of the Nobel prize in economics. In both cases, the development of the concept is cited as a main motivation behind the prize.It represents the hypothetical unemployment rate consistent with aggregate production being at the [...] "long-run" [...] level. This level is consistent with aggregate production in the absence of various temporary frictions such as incomplete price adjustment in labor and goods markets. The natural rate {{of unemployment}} therefore corresponds to the unemployment rate prevailing under a classical view of determination of activity. It is mainly determined by the economy's supply side, and hence production possibilities and economic institutions. If these institutional features involve permanent mismatches in the labor market or real wage rigidities, the natural rate of unemployment may feature involuntary unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is a combination of <b>frictional</b> and structural <b>unemployment</b> that persists in an efficient, expanding economy when labor and resource markets are in equilibrium.|$|R
