40|$|Most {{approaches}} to the synthesis of reactive systems study the problem {{in terms of a}} two-player game with complete observation. In many applications, however, the system's environment consists of several distinct entities, and the system must actively communicate with these entities in order to obtain information available in the environment. In this paper, we model such environments as a team of players and keep track of the information known to each individual player. This allows us to synthesize programs that interact with a distributed environment and leverage multiple interacting sources of information. The synthesis problem in distributed environments corresponds to solving a special class of Petri games, i. e., multi-player games played over Petri nets, where the net has a distinguished token representing the system and an arbitrary number of tokens representing the environment. While, in general, even the decidability of Petri games is an open question, we show that the synthesis problem in distributed environments can be solved in polynomial time for nets with up to two environment tokens. For an arbitrary but fixed number of three or more environment tokens, the problem is NP-complete. If the number of environment tokens grows with the size of the net, the problem is EXPTIME-complete.

Now it is a billion dollar industry including recruitment of international students, establishment of university campuses abroad, franchised provision and on line education. WTO requires each member nation to make its own schedule <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> in education services, and to explain its limitations on market access and national treatment {{as well as other}} limitations. In the schedules <b>of</b> <b>commitments,</b> commitments are split into two sections: First, “horizontal” commitments which stipulate limitations that apply to all of the sectors included in the schedule; these often refer to a particular mode of supply, notably commercial presence and the presence of natural persons.

40|$|Answering {{questions}} completely, {{accurately and}} honestly {{is not always}} the top priority for survey respondents. In their pioneering work in the 1970 s and 80 s, Charles Cannell and colleagues at the University of Michigan demonstrated the promise of directly asking respondents to commit to providing complete and accurate answers. While promising, these studies were conducted decades ago, in interviewer administered modes, with limited data quality measures. This dissertation consists of two experimental studies investigating the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> as well as automatic feedback in improving data quality in online surveys. Study 1 measures the effect <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> – “yes” or “no” – in an online labor force survey. Study 2 measures the effect of asking respondents to commit to engaging in several response behaviors that seem likely to promote data quality, such as reading the questions carefully, and trying to be as precise as possible, in an survey of parents about their child’s health and healthcare. Study 2 also examines the effect of providing feedback in response to behaviors that are associated with reduced data quality such as speeding and reporting an incomplete date. Both studies verify the accuracy of select responses using administrative records, in contrast to the indirect quality measures in previous <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and feedback. In Study 1, results were stronger for those who committed versus those who were invited to commit but did not, and in Study 2 for those who committed to all of the requested response behaviors versus those who committed to engage in a few. Study 2 also found that feedback substantially reduced unwanted respondent behaviors and improved data quality by some measures over and above the effect <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Overall, in both studies, commitment had a positive effect on data quality including response accuracy, much as Cannell and his colleagues would have expected, although in Study 2, some negative consequences were also evident. For example, it appeared that committed respondents were more likely to skip a question rather than answer it inadequately. On balance, practitioners will likely find the trade-offs produced by asking for commitment to be favorable and worth considering in production surveys...|$|R

In general, multi-linked negotiation (including both the directly linked and the indirectly linked relationships) describes situations where one agent needs to negotiate with multiple agents about different issues, where the negotiation over one issue influences the negotiations over other issues.

40|$|In this paper, I {{attempt to}} show how Davidson’s anti-sceptical {{argument}} can respond to the closureRK-based radical scepticism. My approach {{will focus on the}} closureRK principle rather than the possibility that our beliefs could be massively wrong. I first review Davidson’s principle of charity and the triangulation argument, and then I extract his theory on content of a belief. According to this theory, content of a belief is determined by its typical cause and other relevant beliefs. With this constraint on content, I argue that doubt must be local. Furthermore, since one cannot rationally believe that one’s commitment to the cause of beliefs could be false, our commitment to the denial of a sceptical hypothesis is not a knowledge-apt belief. Therefore, the closureRK principle is not applicable to rational <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> this <b>commitment.</b> As a result, the closureRK-based sceptical argument fails while the closureRK principle remains...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{goal was}} to {{investigate}} the quality in terms of formal and content-based comprehensiveness of the forms for involuntary admission before and after the introduction of the new law (KESR, “Kindes- und Erwachsenenschutzrecht”) for the regulation of involuntary admission. Moreover, the study aimed at assessing if the quality of the admission forms was associated with the professional qualifications of the professionals ordering them. Finally, the patients were characterized. Methods Retrospective <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> all <b>commitment</b> reports at the University Hospital of Psychiatry within a six month period before and after the introduction the KESR (N(2012) [*]=[*] 489; N(2013) [*]=[*] 651). Formal and content-related criteria for the commitment certificates were recorded as well as the socio-demographic and clinical data of the cases admitted. There were no exclusion criteria. The data was descriptively evaluated, formal and content-based criteria were compared between groups of admitting professionals. The Chi-Square-Test following Pearson and T-Test were used to test for group differences. Results Formal and content-related quality criteria deficiencies were noted. The best-documented forms came from psychiatrists and emergency physicians, followed by general practitioners and hospital doctors. There have been improvements in the quality of the documents since the new KESR within all professional subsamples. Conclusions Psychiatrists and those who regularly deal with emergency commitments were likely to issue forms of high quality. Due to the considerable consequences associated with involuntary admission for affected individuals, their relatives and also professionals, the considerable deficits in the quality of the documentation must be intensively addressed in training, advanced training, continuing education and in daily routines...|$|R

Data <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to business ethics and nonfinancial business performance were collected from 100 participants through a questionnaire survey.

The questionnaire for assessing commitment to business ethics contained nine different dimensions while the nonfinancial business performance contained three dimensions: client satisfaction, human resource management plus innovativeness and efficiency of business processes. Multiple regression methods were applied in the analysis. The empirical results of three multiple linear regression models show that certain dimension <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to business ethics had {{a positive influence on}} the nonfinancial performance of the companies.

30|$|The {{results of}} the study reveal that lack <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> the {{authorities}} of different sectors is an obstacle for cross-sectoral collaborative governance activity. Because collaborative governance activity is guided by mutual terms of agreements that specify the forms of interactions, the respective responsibilities of each sector, how collective activities of implementing action plans are conducted and other tasks, low level <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> from other sectors creates a setback from having an agreement and working together on various tasks. Bryson et al. (2015) explained that mutual term of agreements among the collaborating sectors is the key to create <b>commitment,</b> sense <b>of</b> responsibility, and sense of ownership on the part of other authorities of other sectors. In contrary to this, it is found out that because of the lack <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> other authorities and the bureaucratic systems, terms of agreements are not signed among sectors. This has effect in the later stages of collaborative governance activities as Emerson et al. (2011) noted. Emerson et al. (2011) noted that initial agreements and understandings are crucial to build the “capacity” of the collaborating sectors to engage into actions, such as mobilization of resources, supervision of river sites, regular <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> activities.

40|$|Our {{intention}} in {{this thesis}} is to illustrate how <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> pupil plans and parent-teacher meetings regulate pupils in specific ways that affect their subjectivity. Through this analysis we demonstrate how regulation of pupils is {{closely linked to the}} ways teachers work with the criteria <b>of</b> <b>evaluation</b> and how teachers place the pupils in certain positions, and also the opportunities given to pupils to negotiate these criteria and positions. A central aspect of the analysis is that teachers are operating with invisible or competenceoriented criteria in their <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> pupils. Thus both teachers puts particular emphasis on the criteria <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and motivation. Another key aspect of the analysis is that regulation of the pupils largely depends on the pupils’ ability to do pupil in a proper way in relation to the criteria <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and motivation. The analysis shows how a strong regulation of the pupil, gives that pupil a confined opportunity to be subjected as a pupil <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and motivation. When the adjustment is {{made on the basis of}} a competence-oriented criteria of engagement, and when only the teachers know when the pupil is committed enough, it deprives the pupil the opportunity to evaluate them self and to know when the goal is achieved. This leaves the pupil in a sort of vacuum, where he must constantly try to decipher when he is appropriately committed. We display through our analysis not only how the regulation of pupils affects their opportunities to be subjected as an appropriate pupil, but also how variation in different ways of regulations opens and closes the various opportunities to be subjected as an appropriate pupil. Regulation of pupils determines the positions offered to them. And because subjectivity is the sum of all positions, the way pupils are regulated is essential for their opportunity to be recognized as, and also see themselves as, appropriate pupils.
