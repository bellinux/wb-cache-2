40|$|Neurophysiologic, motor/expressive and {{cognitive}} emotional domains are central {{factors in the}} integrative processes between psyche and soma. For Emotional Regulation (ER) we mean the synergic functioning of these domains. A deficit in the cognitive elaboration of emotion (i. e. alexithymia) might determinate a dys-regulation of Autonomous Nervous System (ANS) able to explain the relationship between alexithymia and hypertension found in many studies. The aims of this research are measuring ANS reactivity of young normotensive students during emotional situations according to individual ER ability (study 1), and assessing the efficacy of a <b>group-therapy</b> aimed to Promoting ER ability (PROCRE) in reducing blood pressure (BP) values and in improving {{quality of life in}} hypertensive out-patients (study 2). Sixty normotensive university students (men/women= 30 / 30, mean age= 23. 57) {{selected on the basis of}} high (≥ 52) or low (≤ 35) alexithymia scores (TAS- 20) participated in the study 1. After a rest time lasting 14 minutes they were involved into three experimental situations different only for the emotional valence of one event (either positive= joy, happiness, gladness, or negative =anger, irritation, frustration or neutral) they were asked to think, imagine and narrate. These experimental conditions were in counter-balanced order. After each narration a physiologic recovery phase followed and the student rested quietly in silence for 10 minutes. Alexithymic students, compared to non alexithymic, showed higher systolic and diastolic BP values during baseline, narration phases and recovery time. Ninety hypertensive out-patients participated in the study 2 : five groups of 12 patients (tot= 60) followed PROCRE <b>group-therapy</b> and 30 patients in waiting list (WL) formed the control group. Participants to both groups were under similar antihypertensive drugs (medication?), were balanced for gender and alexithymia level. PROCRE groups followed 12 weekly sessions lasting 2 hours each; <b>group-therapy</b> consisted in emotion-focused games and emotional elaboration of everyday experiences. At the end of <b>group-therapy</b> each patient had an individual psychological consultation for making plans about how to use in every-day life what he learnt during <b>group-therapy.</b> Results showed a decrease of BP values greater in PROCRE groups rather than in WL group. In conclusion, results for young alexithymic normotensive students (study 1) with higher BP values during all experimental phases, suggest that a deficit in ER can work as a risk-factor for hypertension since youth. Results for PROCRE <b>group-therapy</b> (study 2), even if preliminary, point out that a psycho-health promotion permitting emotional skills development can improve physical well-being...|$|E
40|$|Summary (Social Situations as Experimental Conditions in Psychopharmacology) : To {{reduce a}} great {{variability}} of drug effects in healthy subjects, stress conditions are used often in pharmacopsychology. However, empirical {{results show that}} the desired stress effects are failing. This paper suggests to realize social stress Situations as interactions between subjects, expecting higher challenging effects than experimentator-subject-interactions, usually used in experimental designs. Two experimental studies are reported: the call-upsituation and the <b>group-therapy</b> situation. The experimental effects were measured by changes of pulse-frequencies. The results indicate that in the two situations high and low dosages of tranquilizing drugs lead to comparable (and so predictable) effects only, if a Situation is high challenging for the experimental subjects. The call-up situation, which proves performance, challenges male subjects highly. The emotional or social competence demanding <b>group-therapy</b> situation is a high challenging situation for warnen. It is concluded that no situation is stressing a person generally. Depending from personality characteristics, differential stressor effects appear. Consequences for experiments in pharmacopsychology are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) {{has already}} {{been shown to be}} highly {{effective}} in the treatment of various psychological disorders within mental health populations; however, it has not been widely tested in the treatment of cancer patients. In the last decade there has been growing interest in the application of CBT interventions within psycho-oncology, and some studies have reported on its efficacy, both with individuals and in <b>group-therapy</b> contexts. To date there have been few descriptions of how a CBT programme for cancer patient groups can be structured and delivered.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} an Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) program targeting difficulties and impairments associated with adult ADHD. METHOD: Forty-five adults diagnosed with ADHD were randomized to either self-help (iCBT self-help format [iCBT-S]), self-help with weekly group sessions (iCBT <b>group-therapy</b> format [iCBT-G]), or a waiting-list control group. Treatment efficacy was measured at pre- and posttreatment and at 6 -month follow-up. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed a significant reduction in ADHD symptoms for the iCBT-S group in comparison with the waiting-list controls at posttreatment, with a between-group effect size of d = 1. 07. The result was maintained at 6 -month follow-up. No significant difference was found at posttreatment or 6 -month follow-up between the iCBT-S and iCBT-G groups. CONCLUSION: The findings show that a CBT treatment program administered through the Internet can be a promising treatment for adult ADHD. Limitations of the study design and directions for future research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Individuals with {{a highly}} {{defensive}} personality style tend to present themselves in an overly favorable light and deny personal inadequacies. Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), denial may be an adaptive strategy to protect individuals from the overwhelming reality of their situation. However, persisting denial can interfere with the adjustment process and hinder {{the development of more}} adaptive coping strategies. A case study is presented of JK, a 45 -year-old woman {{with a highly}} defensive personality style, who sustained a TBI. JK developed social anxiety and depression and was referred for psychological support following a progressive deterioration in her overall functioning. The treatment program was based on an individual-psychotherapy approach, with generalization of skills in a <b>group-therapy</b> setting. A comparison of preand posttreatment functioning indicated a significant reduction in her level of social anxiety, depression, defensiveness, and functional impairment. Independent neuropsychological assessments, conducted for medico-legal purposes, prior to and following the intervention, indicated a significant improvement in JK's cognitive performance between periods of testing. The implications of this study are discussed in terms of the impact of defensive denial upon postinjury adjustment and therapeutic approaches. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Ninety {{subjects}} with severe and disabling psychiatric conditions, predominantly schizophrenia, {{participated in a}} controlled-outcome trial of the cognitive compo-nent of Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT), a <b>group-therapy</b> modality intended to reestablish basic neurocognitive functions. The cognitive therapy was delivered to subjects in the experimental condition during intensive 6 -month treatment periods. Control subjects received supportive group therapy. Before, during, and after the intensive treatment period, all subjects received an enriched regimen of comprehen-sive psychiatric rehabilitation, including social and liv-ing skills training, optimal pharmacotherapy, occupa-tional therapy, and milieu-based behavioral treatment. IPT subjects showed incrementally greater gains com-pared with controls on the primary outcome measure, the Assessment of Interpersonal Problem-Solving Skills, suggesting that procedures that target cognitive impairments of schizophrenia spectrum disorders can enhance patients ' response to standard psychiatric rehabilitation, {{at least in the}} short term, in the domain of social competence. There was equivocal evidence for greater improvement in the experimental condition on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale disorganization fac-tor and strong evidence for greater improvement on a laboratory measure of attentional processing. There was significant improvement in both conditions on measures of attention, memory, and executive func-tioning, providing support for the hypothesis that therapeutic procedures that target impaired cognition enhance response to conventional psychiatric rehabili-tation modalities over a 6 -month timeframe...|$|E
40|$|This {{present study}} {{examined}} the session-by-session content of group therapy for eating-disordered clients. The main objective {{of this study was}} to identify how therapist-client gender match affects group therapy process, regarding the disclosure of important issues relevant to eating-disordered clients. It was hypothesized that the group therapy process for eating-disordered clients would be qualitatively different if therapy was facilitated by a female as opposed to a male therapist. The evaluation of the research question required using an alternating treatments single-subject research design, in which the presentation of treatment conditions was counterbalanced across two therapy groups. The treatments consisted of three therapist conditions (i. e., male therapist only, female therapist-only, or both therapists) that were systematically presented during the study. All <b>group-therapy</b> sessions were videotaped and coded for verbal content. The results suggested that when a female therapist alone was leading group therapy sessions, eating-disordered clients were more inclined to discuss general emotional issues and specific issues involving negative affect. Furthermore, during the male therapist-only conditions, there was a tendency for female group members to talk more about the physical symptoms of eating disorders (i. e., food-related behaviors, body image issues). The relationship of these results regarding their practical implications on therapist knowledge, training, in-session behavior was discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anxiety {{disorders}} affect approximately 10 % to 20 % {{of young}} people, can be enduring if left untreated, {{and have been}} associated with psychopathology in later life. Despite this, there is a paucity of empirical research to assist clinicians in determining appropriate treatment options. We describe a protocol for a randomized controlled trial in which we will examine the effectiveness of a group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy program for children and adolescents with a primary diagnosis of anxiety disorder. For the adolescent participants we will also evaluate the elements of the intervention that act as mechanisms for change. Methods/design: We will recruit 150 young people (90 children and 60 adolescents) diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and their parent or caregiver. After completion of baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to one of three conditions (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Cognitive Behavior Therapy or waitlist control). Those in the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy groups will receive 10 x 1. 5 hour weekly <b>group-therapy</b> sessions using a manualized treatment program, in accordance with the relevant therapy, to be delivered by psychologists. Controls will receive the Cognitive Behavior Therapy program after 10 weeks waitlisted. Repeated measures will be taken immediately post-therapy and at three months after therapy cessation. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the largest trial of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in the treatment of children and young people to date. It will provide comprehensive data on the use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for anxiety disorders and will offer evidence for mechanisms involved in the process of change. Furthermore, additional data will be obtained for the use of Cognitive Behavior Therapy in this population and this research will illustrate the comparative effectiveness of these two interventions, which are currently implemented widely in contemporary clinical practice. Anticipated difficulties for the trial are the recruitment and retention of participants, particularly adolescents. To avert these concerns and maximize recruitment, several strategies will be adopted to optimize referral rates as well as reduce participant drop-outs...|$|E
40|$|Marie Ociskova, Jan Prasko, Klara Latalova, Dana Kamaradova, Ales Grambal Department of Psychiatry, Olomouc University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic Background: Anxiety {{disorders}} are {{a group of}} various mental syndromes that have been related with generally poor treatment response. Several psychological factors may improve or hinder treatment effectiveness. Hope has {{a direct impact on}} the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Also, dissociation is a significant factor influencing treatment efficiency in this group of disorders. Development of self-stigma could decrease treatment effectiveness, as well as several temperamental and character traits. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore a relationship between selected psychological factors and treatment efficacy in anxiety disorders. Subjects and methods: A total of 109 inpatients suffering from anxiety disorders with high frequency of comorbidity with depression and/or personality disorder were evaluated at the start of the treatment by the following scales: the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale, the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale, and the Temperament and Character Inventory – revised. The participants, who sought treatment for anxiety disorders, completed the following scales at the beginning and end of an inpatient-therapy program: Clinical Global Impression (objective and subjective) the Beck Depression Inventory – second edition, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale. The treatment consisted of 25 group sessions and five individual sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy or psychodynamic therapy in combination with pharmacotherapy. There was no randomization to the type of <b>group-therapy</b> program. Results: Greater improvement in psychopathology, assessed by relative change in objective Clinical Global Impression score, was connected with low initial dissociation level, harm avoidance, and self-stigma, and higher amounts of hope and self-directedness. Also, individuals without a comorbid personality disorder improved considerably more than comorbid patients. According to backward-stepwise multiple regression, the best significant predictor of treatment effectiveness was the initial level of self-stigma. Conclusion: The initial higher levels of self-stigma predict a lower effectiveness of treatment in resistant-anxiety-disorder patients with high comorbidity with depression and/or personality disorder. The results suggest that an increased focus on self-stigma during therapy could lead to better treatment outcomes.

40|$|Thesis (DPhil (Psychology)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This {{study has}} two {{purposes}} which are complementary: Firstly, an alternative prevention intervention {{was developed in}} order to introduce narrative group therapy as a therapeutical practice within preventative interventions in South Africa. Secondly, a training protocol was developed {{which can be used}} to train psychologists, counsellors, social workers, teachers and relevant persons to apply narrative group therapy as an alternative preventative intervention in their communities. In the context of this study, the personal stories of the adolescents who took part in this study reflect the problem stories of the Jamestown and Cloetesville community near Stellenbosch. After identifying 20 adolescents who experience problem stories with high-risk themes at two secondary schools in the respective communities, ten narrative group sessions were held, with social constructionism as philosophical approach. The training protocol was primarily of an experiential nature, consisting of 40 hours of training and 12 hours of supervision, with special focus on the personal stories of the four master’s degree psychology students who underwent training and facilitated the group therapy with the adolescents. For {{the purpose of this study}} qualitative research was done. During the development of the alternative preventative intervention, a qualitative description was given of the content of the personal stories of the adolescents within the interactional space of narrative group therapy and personal stories. The focus during this qualitative description was the following: • to establish whether the therapeutic process facilitated change, • to develop a new understanding of the therapeutic process by specifically focusing on applying narrative therapy in a group, and • to train and empower narrative-group-therapy facilitators to facilitate the narrative- <b>group-therapy</b> process. In this study two narrative-analytical research methods were used. Firstly, a qualitative narrative-analysis method was used to evaluate the psychotherapeutical transcripts. A part of these sessions was dedicated to this purpose and is presented in transcribed format. Secondly, the content-analysis method was applied: session data was examined, categories of the adolescents’ and students’ narratives were defined and thematic statements were extracted from the text, classified and sorted into categories or groups. This study provides supportive evidence that narrative group therapy as an alternative preventative intervention can be introduced as a therapeutic practice in South Africa. In addition, an effective training protocol was developed which can be used to train psychologists, counsellors, social workers, teachers and other relevant individuals to use narrative group therapy as an alternative preventative intervention in their communities...|$|E
