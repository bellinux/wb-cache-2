To optimize the results a microphone or a laser vibrometer {{can be used as}} there is no contact between the test-piece and the sensor. Laser vibrometers are preferred to measure signals in vacuum.

To calculate the optical broad-beam response, the impulse response of a pencil beam is convolved with the beam function. As shown by Equation 4, this is a 2-D convolution. To calculate the response of a light beam on a plane perpendicular to the z axis, the beam function (represented by a b × b matrix) is convolved with the impulse response on that plane (represented by an a × a matrix). Normally a is greater than b. The calculation efficiency of these two methods depends largely on b, {{the size of the}} light beam.|$|E

[...] Thomborson proved that important algorithms for sorting, <b>Fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformation,</b> and matrix-matrix multiplication become communication-limited—as opposed to CPU-limited or memory-limited—on computers with insufficient bisection width. F. Thomson Leighton's PhD research tightened Thomborson's loose bound [...] on the bisection width of a computationally-important variant of the De Bruijn graph known as the shuffle-exchange graph. Based on Bill Dally's analysis of latency, average case throughput, and hot-spot throughput of m-ary n-cube networks for various m, It can be observed that low-dimensional networks, in comparison to high-dimensional networks (e.g., binary n-cubes) with the same bisection width (e.g., tori), have reduced latency and higher hot-spot throughput.|$|E

McNulty (U.S. radio engineer) of Automation Industries, Inc., then, in El Segundo, California, {{an early}} {{improver}} {{of the many}} foibles and limits of this and other nondestructive testing methods, teaches in further detail on ultrasonic testing in his U.S. Patent 3,260,105 (application filed December 21, 1962, granted July 12, 1966, titled “Ultrasonic Testing Apparatus and Method”) that “Basically ultrasonic testing is performed by applying to a piezoelectric crystal transducer periodic electrical pulses of ultrasonic frequency. The crystal vibrates at the ultrasonic frequency and is mechanically coupled {{to the surface of}} the specimen to be tested. This coupling may be effected by immersion of both the transducer and the specimen in a body of liquid or by actual contact through a thin film of liquid such as oil. The ultrasonic vibrations pass through the specimen and are reflected by any discontinuities which may be encountered. The echo pulses that are reflected are received by the same or by a different transducer and are converted into electrical signals which indicate the presence of the defect.” To characterize micro-structural features in the early stages of fatigue or creep damage, more advanced nonlinear ultrasonic tests should be employed. These nonlinear methods are based on the fact that an intensive ultrasonic wave is getting distorted as it faces micro damages in the material. The intensity of distortion is correlated with the level of damage. This intensity can be quantified by acoustic non-linearity parameter (β). β is related to first and second harmonic amplitudes. These amplitudes can be measured by harmonic decomposition of the ultrasonic signal through <b>fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformation</b> or wavelet transformation.|$|E

The data from the Queensborough Bridge over the Fraser River in Van-couver, Canada have been applied. The loads produc-ing the dynamic response are ambient, e. g. wind, traf-fic and small ground motion. The Random Decrement technique is used to estimate the correlation function or the free decays from the ambient data. From these functions, the modal parameters are extracted using the Ibrahim Time Domain method. The possible influence of the traffic mass load on the bridge is investigated by as-suming that the response level of the bridge is dependent on the mass of the vehicle load. The eigenfrequencies of the bridge are estimated {{as a function of the}} response level. This indicates the degree of influence of the mass load on the estimated eigenfrequencies.
