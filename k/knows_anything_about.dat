500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Team" [...] is a [...] "tribute to {{her friends}} and country". During an {{interview}} with Billboard, Lorde described the song as [...] "her take on most modern music" [...] and explained, [...] "no one comes to New Zealand, no one <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> New Zealand, and here I am, trying {{to grow up and}} become a person." [...] Lorde explained that the line [...] "We live in cities you'll never see on screen" [...] was [...] "to be speaking for the minority" [...] from small cities. She also expresses distaste in common contemporary popular music lyrics telling listeners to [...] "put your hands in the air" [...] through the verse [...] "I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air". Writer Lily Rothman for the magazine Time commented that the lyrics [...] "we sure know how to run things" [...] in [...] "Team" [...] were a response to the lyrics [...] "we run things, things don’t run we" [...] in Miley Cyrus' [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013).|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E

500|$|Meeting with Mulder and Scully, Shannon tearfully {{tells them}} that Ausbury {{and the other}} Satanists {{repeatedly}} raped and impregnated her {{as part of their}} rituals, sacrificing her babies. When the agents confront Ausbury with the accusations, he is shocked, and denies them. Shannon stays after school to make up her assignment of dissecting the pig. Mrs. Paddock takes her bracelet and uses it as part of a spell that causes Shannon to slit her wrists. When Ausbury learns that the other faculty members plan to use Shannon as a scapegoat, he admits the sect's existence to Mulder. He confirms that rituals did happen while Shannon was present, but said that exposure to sensational media coverage led her to [...] "remember" [...] the sexual abuse. Meanwhile, Scully researches Mrs. Paddock and finds that no one <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> her or her background. During a sudden power outage, Mrs. Paddock steals Scully's pen and uses it to impersonate her in a call to Mulder, pretending to be in trouble. Mulder handcuffs Ausbury in the basement to prevent his possible escape, then leaves to help Scully. Soon after, a giant snake appears, controlled by Mrs. Paddock, and devours Ausbury.|$|E
500|$|... "The Door" [...] {{marks the}} final {{appearance}} of Kristian Nairn as Hodor, a role Nairn has played since the series pilot. Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] Because you have to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E

But to say that she did all of the dancing is {{absolutely}} ridiculous to anyone that <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> ballet." ...|$|E

[...] A younger Dumbledore appears in Riddle's diary, when Harry sees his memory, and asks Riddle if he <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> {{the attacks on the}} students. During {{the last half of the}} novel, Lucius Malfoy forces the school's other eleven governors to suspend Dumbledore as Headmaster in the wake of attacks by a basilisk in the school when the Chamber of Secrets is opened. Dumbledore is reinstated when the governors discover that Ginny Weasley was taken into the Chamber of Secrets and Lucius is found to have coerced the other governors into suspending him.|$|E
2500|$|Author Hilary Kingsley has {{described}} Pete as [...] "rough and ready [...] Rough {{with his tongue}} and his fists, and ready to jump to jump into an argument whether he <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it or not. Act first, think later, if at all, is Pete's attitude." [...] She inferred that he was unintelligent suggesting {{that he would not}} get into Mensa and that he seems [...] "thick as a brick". It has been suggested by writer Dorothy Hobson that the character of Pete was a portrayal of a typical East End male, [...] "macho and mouthy". Author Christine Geraghty has suggested that Pete was seemingly intolerant of difference, but that his position was always undermined [...] "by his blustering espousal of an excessively masculine position. Pete's , like much else he does, are not followed through." [...] Discussing the character's other qualities, author Kate Lock has suggested that Pete was [...] "a simple, amiable sort of chap [...] left others {{to get on with the}} complicated things in life." [...] Lock added that complications were beyond Pete's grasp and that he had trouble articulating emotions. Meanwhile, author Rupert Smith has classified Pete as a [...] "soft touch" [...] character. He added that Pete started off as [...] "a cheery chappy" [...] but became [...] "hard to like", using his failure to support his wife Kathy through her rape ordeal in 1988 as a reason why he lost public sympathy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{debate of}} Indian {{involvement}} in this war {{has been a source}} of tension and underlying conflict between India and Bangladesh since the emergence of the war itself. This section examines the role of India in this war by exploring the ways in which India largely contributed to the war and to what extent this aided the Bangladeshis. In exploring the latter, one can see that there are several ways in which India aided Bangladesh. For one, India was largely responsible for building the Mukti Bahini from a group of inexperienced rebel fighters to an army formidable enough to fight against the Pakistani army. When the war first broke out it in 1971, the initial state of the Bengali rebels can be understood from the remark of one Bengali rebel officer, who complained that [...] "No one in the Bangladesh cabinet <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> war". [...] This construed the dire situation of the army before India’s intervention. The Mukti Bahini was recounted as being “Without any supplies or assistance”. If a weapon became unserviceable the soldier carrying that weapon became useless, since he could not be given another weapon. There was a complete dearth of a “Modern communication system to be in constant touch with troops in different battle locations”. This is evidenced in that the Mukti Bahini’s position was threatened at Kumira, but the army had received the message three hours late because of the poor communication system.|$|E
