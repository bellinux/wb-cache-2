40|$|An {{electrohydraulic}} {{hybrid power}} cutting transmission system for roadheader under specific working condition was proposed in this paper. The overall {{model for the}} new system composed of an electric motor model, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump-motor</b> model, a torsional planetary set model, and a hybrid power train model was established. The working mode characteristics were simulated under the conditions of taking the effect of cutting picks into account. The advantages of new hybrid power cutting system about the dynamic response under shock load were investigated compared with the traditional cutting system. The results illustrated that the hybrid power system had an obvious cushioning {{in terms of the}} dynamic load of cutting electric motor and planetary gear set. Besides, the hydraulic motor could provide an auxiliary power to improve the performance of the electric motor. With further analysis, a dynamic load was found to have a high relation to the stiffness and damping of coupling in the transmission train. The results could be a useful guide for the design of cutting transmission of roadheader...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} fuel {{consumption}} of an articulated vehicle with a hydraulic regenerative braking system. The vehicle is a four-axle tractor-semitrailer with a volume-limited payload. It {{is equipped with}} hub-mounted <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump-motor</b> units that pump fluid from a low-pressure reservoir to a high-pressure reservoir during braking events and generate a propulsive torque when high-pressure fluid flows through them to the low-pressure reservoir during acceleration. Several possible control strategies are proposed and simulated using a validated mathematical model of the fuel consumption of the vehicle. A global optimisation calculation indicates that the maximum possible reduction in fuel consumption due to the regenerative braking system is 11 - 22 %, depending on the driving cycle. The simulations indicate that the simple 'greedy' algorithm decreases the fuel consumption by 9 - 17 % for the same conditions. Two heuristic algorithms and a model predictive control approach were also investigated. Although these more sophisticated controllers were able to improve on the greedy controller slightly for some conditions, {{they may not be}} implementable in practice...|$|E
40|$|Virtual {{environments and}} {{real-time}} simulators (VERS) {{are becoming more}} and more important tools in research and development (R&D) process of non-road mobile machinery (NRMM). The virtual prototyping techniques enable faster and more cost-efficient development of machines compared to use of real life prototypes. High energy efficiency has become an important topic in the world of NRMM because of environmental and economic demands. The objective of this thesis is to develop VERS based methods for research and development of NRMM. A process using VERS for assessing effects of human operators on the life-cycle efficiency of NRMM was developed. Human in the loop simulations are ran using an underground mining loader to study the developed process. The simulations were ran in the virtual environment of the Laboratory of Intelligent Machines of Lappeenranta University of Technology. A physically adequate real-time simulation model of NRMM was shown to be reliable and cost effective in testing of hardware components by the means of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. A control interface connecting integrated electro-hydraulic energy converter (IEHEC) with virtual simulation model of log crane was developed. IEHEC consists of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump-motor</b> and an integrated electrical permanent magnet synchronous motorgenerator. The results show that state of the art real-time NRMM simulators are capable to solve factors related to energy consumption and productivity of the NRMM. A significant variation between the test drivers is found. The results show that VERS can be used for assessing human effects on the life-cycle efficiency of NRMM. HIL simulation responses compared to that achieved with conventional simulation method demonstrate the advances and drawbacks of various possible interfaces between the simulator and hardware part of the system under study. Novel ideas for arranging the interface are successfully tested and compared with the more traditional one. The proposed process for assessing the effects of operators on the life-cycle efficiency will be applied for wider group of operators in the future. Driving styles of the operators can be analysed statistically from sufficient large result data. The statistical analysis can find the most life-cycle efficient driving style for the specific environment and machinery. The proposed control interface for HIL simulation need to be further studied. The robustness and the adaptation of the interface in different situations must be verified. The future work will also include studying the suitability of the IEHEC for different working machines using the proposed HIL simulation method...|$|E
