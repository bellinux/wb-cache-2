5|$|In April 2012, Strasburg {{accumulated}} an NL-best 34 strikeouts and second-best 1.13 ERA. He totaled 6 {{walks and}} did not <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> home run. Consequently, he was named NL Pitcher of the Month. On May 20, Strasburg went 2-for-2 as a hitter {{in a game against}} the Baltimore Orioles and hit his first career home run, a solo shot off of Wei-Yin Chen.|$|E

5|$|Affeldt {{spent the}} entire 2007 season in the bullpen, where he {{was used as a}} lefty specialist. Affeldt had a 2.15 ERA through his first fiftysix games of the year. He did not <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> home run until Pete Laforest hit one off of him in an 119 loss to the San Diego Padres on August 16. He {{struggled}} {{at the end of the}} year, with a 7.30 ERA in his final nineteen games. He still finished the year 43, with a 3.51 ERA in seventy-five games, and the Rockies made the playoffs as the NL Wild Card. He made his postseason debut on October 4 in the Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies and gave up one run (on a home run by Ryan Howard) in one inning in a 105 win by Colorado. The Rockies swept the series to advance to the Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In the first game, Affeldt entered with two outs and the bases loaded with the Rockies leading 51. He retired Stephen Drew to help the Rockies win 5–1. The Rockies swept the Diamondbacks to meet the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. Affeldt pitched in all four games of the World Series without giving up a run, but the Rockies were swept by the Red Sox. Affeldt became a free agent after the season.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ruth {{reported}} to Hot Springs, Arkansas {{for his first}} major league spring training. Despite a relatively successful first season, he was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who already had two stellar left-handed pitchers: the established stars Dutch Leonard, who had broken {{the record for the}} lowest earned run average (ERA) in a single season; and Ray Collins, a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914. Ruth was ineffective in his first start, taking the loss in the third game of the season. Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave Ruth another chance, and after some good relief appearances, Carrigan allowed Ruth another start, and he won a rain-shortened seven inning game. Ten days later, the manager had him start against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds. Ruth took a 3–2 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4–3 in 13 innings. Ruth, hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck in right field off of Jack Warhop. At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd. The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> home run to Babe Ruth.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753, {{against the}} Chicago Cubs. He went 3–3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and {{a walk on}} that day. The {{struggling}} last place Giants still lost the game, 9–8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against Florida Marlins pitcher Rick VandenHurk. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12–10. It {{marked the first time}} since he had hit #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382foot(116m) home run against Clay Hensley of the San Diego Padres for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.|$|E

25|$|Against Chicago White Sox pitcher Javier Vázquez {{in early}} September at U.S. Cellular Field, Burnett took a no-hitter into the 6th inning before <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> hard hit that bounced off Scott Rolen's glove, but {{nevertheless}} got the win. Vazquez himself also pitched well, not <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> hit until the 4th inning but ultimately took the loss.|$|R

5|$|On September 1, Mota was {{the winning}} pitcher when he pitched a {{scoreless}} inning in an 8–7 victory over Houston. He got another win by pitching a scoreless inning on September 12 in a 6–4 victory over Florida. With the Mets, {{he had a}} 3–0 record with a 1.00 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 18 games to finish the season 4–3 with a 4.53 ERA in 52 games. He made {{the playoffs for the}} first time in his career as the Mets won the NL East. In the first game of the 2006 National League Division Series against the Dodgers, Mota was the winning pitcher when he pitched two innings, although he blew a 4–1 lead by giving up three runs and allowing the Dodgers to tie the game. Mota pitched two scoreless innings in the Mets' series-winning 9–5 victory over the Dodgers in Game 3. In the 2006 National League Championship Series, Mota appeared in five of the seven games in the series. He blew a lead in an eventual Game 2 loss, but he did not <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> run in the other four games as the Mets lost to St. Louis in seven games. On October 30, he filed for free agency.|$|E
5|$|On the {{division}} right, Tabu-dong was in North Korean hands, {{on the left}} Waegwan was a no-man's land, {{and in the center}} strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road behind it, and was in danger of being surrounded. After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker, Gay on September 5 issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position. The movement was to progress from right to left beginning with the 8th Cavalry Regiment, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area, and finally the 5th Cavalry in the Waegwan area. This withdrawal caused the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> hill it had just attacked and captured near the Tabu-dong road on the approaches of the Walled City of Ka-san. In the 7th Cavalry sector the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions were to withdraw in that order, after the withdrawal of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on their right. The 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 north of Waegwan was to cover the withdrawal of the 7th Cavalry and hold open the escape road.|$|E

25|$|Later in {{the third}} quarter, Smith intercepted a pass {{intended}} for Rams wide receiver Torry Holt after Holt slipped while coming off the line of scrimmage, and returned the ball 30 yards to the Rams 33-yard line. Though St. Louis' defense did not <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> touchdown to the Patriots, kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 37-yard field goal to increase New England's lead to 17–3.|$|E

Sollazzo was a 45-year-old jeweler and gambler who had spent five years in prison during the 1930s. Gard's family was poor and {{he did not want to}} <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> steady income of cash, which amounted to $1,000 per player per thrown game. The original LIU players involved were Gard, Bigos and Feurtado. Eventually White and LeRoy Smith joined.|$|E
25|$|The steel {{strike of}} 1959 was a 116-day labor union strike (July 15 – November 7, 1959) {{by members of}} the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) that idled the steel {{industry}} throughout the United States. The strike occurred over management's demand that the union <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> contract clause which limited management's ability to change the number of workers assigned to a task or to introduce new work rules or machinery which would result in reduced hours or numbers of employees. The strike's effects persuaded President Dwight D. Eisenhower to invoke the back-to-work provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. The union sued to have the Act declared unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court upheld the law.|$|E
25|$|John Forbes Royle was {{the only}} son of William Henry Royle and Isabella Forbes.

This led him to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> military career at Addiscombe and chose to study medicine. He joined the service of the East India Company as assistant surgeon and went to Calcutta in 1819. He served with the Bengal army (at various times with the 17th and 87th Regiments, Native Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry) at Dum-Dum and in parts of the North-Western Provinces where he found time to study botany and geology, and made large collections from the Himalayas.|$|E

25|$|The general {{election}} of July 1895 was disastrous for the Liberals, and the Conservatives under Lord Salisbury won {{a majority of}} 152. With no government post, Asquith divided his time between politics {{and a return to}} his law practice. Jenkins comments that in this period Asquith earned a substantial, though not stellar, income and was never worse off and often much higher-paid than when in office. Matthew writes that his income as a QC in the following years was around £5,000 to £10,000 per annum (around £500,000–£1,000,000 at 2015 prices). According to Haldane, on returning to government in 1905 Asquith had to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> £10,000 brief to act for the Khedive of Egypt. Margot later claimed (in the 1920s, when they were short of money) that he could have made £50,000 per annum had he remained at the bar.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the success}} and growth of the series in 2009 it was {{announced}} that a Celebrity version of the show was being sought by the producers and TV3. The producers began the task of finding a main sponsor for the show, celebrities to take part and finally smaller sponsors of each individual task. The producers were able to find a main sponsor for the launch of the spring show and would have started production in January or February 2010, however they were unable to find sponsors of each individual task. The producers also ran into trouble finding different personalities for the show and for them to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> month of their lives for the show. The production of the celebrity version of the show was postponed until the third series finished production in August 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{war between}} the two sides in England reached a {{stalemate}} in the mid-1140s, while Geoffrey of Anjou consolidated his hold on power in Normandy. 1143 started precariously for Stephen when he was besieged by Robert of Gloucester at Wilton Castle, an assembly point for royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the Battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, and for a moment it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time. On this occasion, however, William Martel, Stephen's steward, made a fierce rear guard effort, allowing Stephen to escape from the battlefield.

50|$|Gonzalez was {{relieved}} by Tetsuya Yamaguchi {{in the sixth}} inning after he allowed Fighters' hitters to reach first and second with one out. The Giants' lead was then cut to one after Yamaguchi <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> RBI single to Tomohiro Nioka before retiring the next two batters. The Giants responded when Yoshinori Tateyama relieved Takeda to start the seventh inning. Tateyama <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> single to Tani before being replaced by Masanori Hayashi who immediately <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> single to Abe. With runners at first and third, Noriyoshi Omichi was brought in as a pinch hitter, and Fighters' manager Masataka Nashida responded by bringing in Shintaro Ejiri. After this pitching change, Giants' manager Tatsunori Hara switched pinch hitters and sent Lee Seung-Yeop to the plate instead of Omichi. Ejiri <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> RBI single to Lee then retired the next two batters, finishing out {{the top half of}} the inning with the Giants leading 4-2.
