The battle was fought inside Grand Port, one of the harbours of Isle de France into which the French squadrons, dominant in the Indian Ocean during 1809, had been steadily pushed and blockaded by pressure from a British squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley. The British defeat had a noticeable <b>galvanising</b> effect on both the British and French naval commands: both recognised that the campaign would be won by the first to reinforce and resupply their forces. Although the French had achieved a significant victory, the naval bases on Isle de France lacked the military stores and food supplies to repair the battle damage to their ships or supply lengthy raiding voyages against British trade routes.|$|E

After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip <b>galvanising.</b>|$|E

They invested heavily on facilities; in 1909 the works covered a two-floor brickhouse with a forging shop, assembly shop, boiler room, wood drying room and <b>galvanising</b> shop. The boats were built in a large boathouse and launched on two slipways. The main building was for offices and material stock, which was in two floors total 1270 m².

25|$|The CEGB {{took over}} project management, imposed light {{penalties}} {{in order not}} to cripple Fairey and International Combustion, and appointed British Nuclear Design and Construction (BNDC) as main contractor. In 1971, problems with corrosion of mild steel components in the first generation Magnox reactors gave the designers cause for concern. The Dungeness B restraint couplings - mechanical linkages that held the graphite core in place whilst allowing it to expand and contract in response to temperature changes - were made of mild steel and could be subject to the same corrosion. It was decided to replace them with components made from a new material. In 1972, problems were found with the galvanised wire that was used to attach thermocouples to stainless steel boiler tubes. During heat treatment of the tubes at temperatures up to 1,050°C, the <b>galvanising</b> zinc diffused into the tubes and made them brittle. The cost had by then risen to £170million. By 1975, the CEGB was reporting that the power station would not be completed until 1977 and that its cost had risen to £280 million. By 1979 the cost had risen further to £410 million. Reactor 1 first generated power on 3 April 1983, some 13 years behind schedule and at a cost of £685 million, four times the initial estimate in inflation-adjusted terms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The uses of <b>galvanised</b> {{mild steel}} in many {{engineering}} facilities offshore necessitate its protection against {{all forms of}} service induced corrosion. This can only be achieved by devising innovative corrosion mitigation measures capable of providing effective and reliable control. Hence, this paper investigates the corrosion propensities of <b>galvanised</b> steel in seawater using specially prepared carbon doped aluminium as sacrificial anode. The 6063 aluminium was doped by adding varied amount of carbon in form of graphite particles to molten aluminium and mechanically stirred vigorously before casting. Then, the commercial <b>galvanised</b> steel and carbon doped aluminium coupons were coupled in a corrosion cell with seawater as the electrolyte. Corrosion simulation lasted seventy days and the data obtained was analysed. Results show that corrosion of the carbon doped aluminium increased with increase in doping of aluminium. The cathodically protected <b>galvanised</b> steel sufferred minimal corrosion rate of 4. 9 x 10 - 2 mpy compared with the undoped aluminium anode which exhibited a huge 38. 9 x 10 - 2 mpy corrosion rate. The microstructure before and after corrosion also revealed that surface attack was more pronounced on the carbon doped aluminium relative to the <b>galvanised</b> steel. It thus appears that doping of aluminium with carbon is an effective corrosion mitigation alternative for <b>galvanised</b> steel in seawater...|$|R

25|$|The {{arrest of}} the Bengali {{politician}} Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1968 would also spark intensive political protests and {{violence against the}} military regime of Ayub Khan. The 1970 Bhola cyclone devastated much of the region, killing numerous people. More than half the city of Dhaka was flooded and waterlogged, with millions of people marooned. The same year, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman won a landslide victory in general election. He was elected as {{the next president of}} Pakistan. However, the West Pakistan's military rulers and even the largest opposition party's (PPP) leader Zulfiker Ali Bhutto refused to hand over the presidency to East Pakistan leadership. The following year saw Sheikh Mujib hold a massive nationalist gathering on 7 March 1971 at the Race Course Ground that attracted an estimated one million people. <b>Galvanising</b> public anger against ethnic and regional discrimination and poor cyclone relief efforts from the central government, the gathering preceded near total consensus among East Pakistan population for independent movement. In response, on 25 March 1971 {{in the middle of the}} night, the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight, which led to the arrests, torture and killing of hundreds of thousands of people – just in that night alone. As a result, on behalf of East Pakistan leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a Bengali army Major named Ziaur Rahman (later General and President) declared Bangladesh's independence on 26 March 1971. This resulted in further mass genocide of approximately 3million people. Citizens and intellectuals from Dhaka was the largest victim of this mass genocide. The fall of the city to the Indian Army on 16 December 1971 marked the creation of the independent state of Bangladesh. Dhaka became the capital of Bangladesh.|$|E
