5|$|Parsnip {{is used as}} a <b>food</b> <b>plant</b> by {{the larvae}} of some {{lepidopteran}} species, including the parsnip swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes), the common swift moth (Korscheltellus lupulina), the garden dart moth (Euxoa nigricans), and the ghost moth (Hepialus humuli). The larvae of the parsnip moth (Depressaria radiella), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} this drastic {{population}} reduction {{are thought to be}} due to agricultural improvements, abandonment of extensive management, and deforestation. As the area of the Gentiana cruciata, the <b>food</b> <b>plant</b> that the P. rebeli depends on, decreases, the P. rebeli population also decreases.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the <b>food</b> <b>plant</b> on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, {{especially in the}} tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E

5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} <b>food</b> <b>plant.</b> This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce {{was first}} {{cultivated}} {{by the ancient}} Egyptians who turned it from a weed whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a <b>food</b> <b>plant</b> grown for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans, the latter of whom gave it the name , from which the English lettuce is ultimately derived. By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{discovered}} that where the P. rebeli {{lay their eggs}} {{is based on the}} size of the G. cruciata leaves and not upon the location of the closest Myrmica ant colony. Evidence for P. rebeli oviposition depending upon the range of the <b>food</b> <b>plant</b> rather than the range of the ants is supported by the timing of its oviposition. P. rebeli lays their eggs during the warm summer season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground. Researchers also observed females did not base their oviposition on where they found Myrmica nests.|$|E

5|$|Though P. rebeli parasitizes the Myrmica schencki ants and Gentiana cruciata <b>food</b> <b>plant,</b> it also {{acts as a}} host to the {{parasitoid}} ichneumon wasp (Ichneumon eumerus). The I. eumerus is a wasp {{that attempts}} to parasitize the P. rebeli {{after it has been}} introduced to the Myrmica ants' nests. The adult wasp searches for Myrmica ant nests by responding strongly to the scent of Myrmica schencki ants, the species that P. rebeli most commonly and successfully parasitizes.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{are usually}} solitary, with a South-East Queensland study {{estimating}} densities of only 50 per hectare (compared {{to some other}} Australian species nearly two orders of magnitude more dense). The adult floury baker normally perches facing downwards and on branches of trees rather than trunks. It is found {{on a wide variety}} of plants, most commonly on species in the family Myrtaceae, more specifically various species of Melaleuca and Callistemon plants, as well as brown hazelwood (Lysicarpus angustifolius) and pegunny (Bauhinia hookeri). These are expected to also be nymphal food plants. The species was associated with white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. The broad-leaved paperbark has been confirmed as a nymphal <b>food</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Behavioral ecologists {{have found}} {{its role as}} a brood {{parasite}} to be of particular interest as, unlike many brood parasites, it does not directly oviposit in the hosts' nests. The P. rebeli parasitizes the colony ant species Myrmica schencki as a larva by using chemical mimicry to trick the ants into believing that they are ant larvae; thus, the ants bring the P. rebeli larvae back to their own nests and feed them. It also parasitizes the <b>food</b> <b>plant</b> Gentiana cruciata early in its life cycle, but in turn, is parasitized by the Ichneumon eumerus when it is in the M. schencki nest. It was placed on the IUCN Red List in 2000 and is classified as a species 'vulnerable' to extinction. Although a separate species from the P. alcon, its DNA genome and appearance are extremely similar, leading many researchers to argue that any differences between the two species are due to intraspecific variation.|$|E

40|$|Rural Africa {{is rich in}} nutritious <b>food</b> <b>plants</b> but the {{majority}} have been ignored by research and then forgotten by farmers in the shift towards {{the production of a}} few major crops such as wheat rice and maize. Yet many traditional <b>food</b> <b>plants</b> can supplement the cereal staples because they contain essential nutrients. They are easily grown on small family plots and need minimal inputs of water, fertilizer and pesticide. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has published Traditional <b>food</b> <b>plants</b> as a resource book aimed at promoting the exploitation of these species, particularly in the arid and sub-humid lands of eastern Africa. More than 100 <b>food</b> <b>plants</b> are described and illustrated and detailed information is given about names distribution, food value, uses and other features.
