5|$|Lunars English {{version was}} handled by Working Designs, a small California-based {{publisher}} {{who had previously}} localized smaller games for the TurboGrafx-16 and TurboDuo. Their biggest project yet, the team, headed by company {{vice president and chief}} writer Victor Ireland, took to the project seriously, often collaborating with the original Japanese team themselves. New gameplay elements were often added at Ireland's request, including new sequences such as playing Alex's harp to awaken Luna {{near the end of the}} game. Working Designs also put extra effort into the game's packaging, giving the <b>instruction</b> <b>booklet</b> embossed lettering, and having seven separate stamps, each with different artwork, produced for the front of the game discs to increase collection value.|$|E

5|$|Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter {{in which}} players control Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark {{through a series}} of levels {{collected}} together into missions. The general gameplay {{is similar to that of}} its predecessor GoldenEye 007, with features such as stealth sections and objectives determined by difficulty settings carried over. Players can crouch, duck, lean, and drop from most ledges, but there is no jump ability. A number of tutorials and training activities can be taken at the Carrington Institute, which acts as the game's central hub. The Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is needed to access the game's campaign and most of the multiplayer features, although a limited subset of the Combat Simulator options are available without the device; around 35% of the game is playable without an Expansion Pak, as estimated on the game's box and <b>Instruction</b> <b>Booklet.</b>|$|E

A small kingdom {{in the land of}} Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her. After hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon.|$|E

25|$|The first Chief Constable was Captain Samuel Meredith RN {{who placed}} an {{advertisement}} {{in the local}} paper to recruit 200 constables who were paid 17/6d a week. New constables were given their uniform and an <b>instruction</b> <b>booklet</b> and then sent off to work without any training or guidance. It wasn't until 1843 (and later 1855) that they were given training. Wiltshire Constabulary started operating from January 1840 and had filled almost all its posts by summertime. The Chief Constable spent {{the first months of}} his time visiting all the boroughs in Wiltshire, spending almost all his £400 salary on travel. The first ranks were only Constable and Superintendent, but Sergeant, Inspector, Detectives and five classes of Constable were later introduced.|$|E
25|$|Some {{games and}} events are held every year {{due to high}} appeal and attendance. Speed Build {{is one of many}} games usually played at BrickFair conventions. In Speed Build, a team of six players work {{together}} to build a large Lego set, using an <b>instruction</b> <b>booklet.</b> Afterwards, the set is broken up into parts, and each participant takes home a part of that set. Lego Bingo is a game that involves winning Lego sets and prizes by showing a winning Bingo board. Parts drafts involve all participants buying a copy of the same set and arriving with it. The sets are then opened and the parts are formed into lots. Everyone takes turns selecting a pile of pieces to bring home and keep. Dirty Brickster involves each participant bringing a wrapped gift. Everyone takes turns grabbing gifts or taking from neighboring participants until the gifts are gone. Lego Hold Em is a poker tournament, Texas hold 'em-style, where the most successful win Lego prizes.|$|E

50|$|When the ukulele {{dropped in}} popularity, many {{performers}} distanced themselves from it, Hall was no exception. It wasn't until Arthur Godfrey brought the instrument {{back to life}} in the 1950s that it re-emerged. Due to this resurgence, Hall was able to land a radio show on WBKB five days a week. His <b>instruction</b> <b>booklets</b> were updated and republished at that time as well.|$|R
500|$|Katsuya Terada {{created some}} of the artwork for the early Dragon Warrior {{articles}} in Nintendo Power. Neither Terada nor those editing the artwork for the <b>instruction</b> <b>booklet</b> followed Toriyama's work; they instead used the settings and character poses to create alternate artwork in an American style. [...] While the Japanese hero was drawn in a super deformed manga style, the English version's appearance is based on [...] "the West's template of a medieval hero".|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) {{play and}} {{bet on the}} Dallas board game (which Kevin had for sale). As the <b>instruction</b> <b>booklet</b> is not with the game, Andy and Darryl make up the rules as they go along, much to Kevin's objection. Eventually, Kevin notices the money they had bet on the game with is missing, and storms out. As Darryl and Andy {{look at each other}} in confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras that he has the money, stating, [...] "And that... is Dallas", mocking Andy and Darryl's {{previous}} statement.|$|E

The project, headed by producer Yoichi Miyaji and directors Takeshi Miyaji and Toshiaki Hontani, was also originally intended for the Mega-CD system, but was shifted to the Saturn early in development due to Sega's abandoning the platform. According to a spokesman for Game Arts, Grandia was created as part of the company's on-going effort to [...] "provide consumers with good games rather than try to follow market trends", opting instead to create a product that would tell a compelling story catering primarily to their existing fanbase. The Saturn version was released in December 1997 exclusively in Japan, along with a special Limited Edition for those who pre-ordered the game between October 25 and November 30, 1997, which included a fold-out cloth map of the Grandia world, as well as a mini radio drama disc featuring voiced scenes from the game. In November 1998, Grandia was re-released in Japan as the Grandia Memorial Package, which featured new <b>instruction</b> <b>booklet</b> artwork and a lower sales price. Sega of America had commented that they had no plans to bring an English version of the game to North American audiences on their system, which prompted an online petition originating on the role-playing game fansite [...] designed to alert the company of consumer interest. Despite gathering several hundred signatures in only a few days, as well as promotion from gaming website GameSpot, the Saturn version was never released internationally.|$|E

The site also includes <b>instruction</b> <b>booklets</b> for all Lego sets dating back to 2002.|$|R
50|$|Around 1955, {{computer}} scientist Edmund Berkeley designed the computational toy Geniac, and in 1958 a similar toy called Brainiac. The rotary switch construction sets used combinational logic {{but had no}} memory and could not solve problems using sequential logic. <b>Instruction</b> <b>booklets</b> gave series of instructions for creating complex machines which could solve specific Boolean equations. Specific machines could play simple games like tic-tac-toe, or solve arithmetic puzzles, but the output resulted directly from the input given.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} {{vehicles}} {{to choose from}} originally (F-Type, COUPE, and 4WD), {{as well as a}} fourth one that is unlockable (2WD); a fifth vehicle is only used in bonus games (TRAILER). Stunt Race FXs use of eyes on the vehicles was a late-in-development addition, to give character to otherwise personality-free cars. Each vehicle has different capabilities in terms of speed, body and acceleration. According to the <b>instruction</b> <b>booklets</b> in English, the vehicles are male; however, according to the Japanese instruction manual and the Japanese television commercial, the COUPE is female and every other vehicle is male.|$|R
