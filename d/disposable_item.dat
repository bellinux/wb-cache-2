40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the potential causes {{and management of}} the clusters of diffuse lamellar keratitis(DLK) after laser corneal refractive surgery. METHODS: The study enrolled 98 eyes(53 patients) complicated with DLK after receiving laser in situ keratomileusis(LASIK), FS-LASIK or small-incision lenticule extraction(SMILE) in our center from February 10 th, 2016 to February 22 th, 2016. They were given clinical classification treatments according to corneal layer inflammatory extent and then followed up after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 d and 1 mo. RESULTS: The clusters of DLK occurred 5 times in the study period. The incidence and degree of DLK significantly decreased after changed the sterilization, surgical equipments, temperature and humidity of the operating room. There were 80 eyes(82 %) had stage 1 DLK, 11 eyes(11 %) had stage 2, 4 eyes(4 %) had stage 3 and 3 eyes(3 %) had stage 4. The incidence of DLK after FS-LASIK was 40 %(79 eyes in 42 patients), that after LASIK assistant by Hastome keratome was 45 %(10 eyes in 5 patients), that after SMILE was 20 %(9 eyes in 6 patients). After intensive treatment, as glucocorticoid treatment and flap lifting flushing, all cases recovered within 1 mo. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of DLK may be associated with the <b>disposable</b> <b>item,</b> flushing liquor, temperature and humidity of the operating room.

40|$|As a busy {{intensive}} care unit in a district general hospital in the UK, we are intrigued by the worst-case scenario plans for swine flu in our region and the ubiquitous algorithms that form part of this planning. A Department of Health document suggests {{for the purposes of}} planning that, during a first major UK pandemic wave, the peak clinical attack rate per week would be 8 % [1]. Of these patients, the hospitalization rate would be 2 % – and 25 % of these would require {{intensive care}} if the capacity exists. Our hospital serves a population of 220, 000. In our region, these estimates suggest that 352 patients will require hospital admission each week during the peak. Using these calculations, we could expect 88 patients per week to require {{intensive care unit}} support. In this hospital, there is the capacity to provide mechanical ventilation to 25 patients (utilizing all ventilators and anaesthetic machines). Clearly, as this is primarily a disease affecting the respiratory system, demand for mechanical ventilation could vastly outstrip supply. staff are fully trained in their use, and support staff and relatives could be utilized. Any excess stock could be used as part of normal resource turnover. A similar issue might occur with the requirement for renal replacement therapy in large numbers of patients. In this scenario, perhaps a similar solution would be a return to continuous arteriovenous haemodiafiltration – which requires only a simple <b>disposable</b> <b>item</b> rather than the complex and limited resource of haemofiltration machines.

40|$|AIM/BACKGROUND [...] This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the feasibility of objective compliance monitoring of amblyopia therapy in clinical research. Occlusion has been the mainstay of amblyopia therapy for over 250 years, yet {{it has never been}} subjected to rigorous evaluation. Treatment regimens range arbitrarily from a few minutes to most of the waking hours of the day. Compliance is problematic and as, hitherto, accurate objective monitoring has been impossible it is not known how much occlusion is required to effect an improvement in vision. METHODS [...] An occlusion dose monitor (ODM) has been developed. The ODM consists of a modified occlusion patch and a miniature battery driven datalogger which periodically monitors patch skin contact. The patch is a standard <b>disposable</b> <b>item</b> with two miniature electrocardiogram electrodes attached to its undersurface. The datalogger comprises a high speed static RAM and a clock driven address counter. Data are retrieved using an IBM PC/AT computer. Fifteen child amblyopes were randomly allocated unilateral occlusion of 1, 4, or 8 hours per day for 4 weeks. Owing to data loss, presumed because of accumulation and discharge of static electricity, an additional child was included in the 8 hour group. Outcome measures were objective (ODM) and subjective (diary) compliance with treatment, logMAR visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity. RESULTS [...] Objective monitoring of occlusion is technically feasible and clinically informative. CONCLUSION [...] Objective monitoring of occlusion has opened up new research opportunities which, it is hoped, will enable the dose-effect relation of occlusion therapy in the various types of amblyopia to be investigated objectively, and facilitate the design of effective therapeutic regimens...|$|E
40|$|Presently most {{road and}} railway {{vehicles}} designed to haul toxic or flammable liquids are built {{with a single}} shell tank construction. The transportation of hazardous liquids poses a problem if the vehicle hauling the liquid is involved in an accident. Loss of liquid can happen if the tank integrity is compromised. The current work {{is an attempt to}} develop a lightweight, relatively inexpensive, sparsely reinforced elastomer liner material to incorporate inside the containers, to contain leakage should the outer shell fail. The general design methodology is thus Fail-Safe Design. If this were designed properly to be an inexpensive easily replaceable <b>disposable</b> <b>item,</b> it could prevent significant liquid loss, and reduce subsequent clean-up costs. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomer is chosen as an ideal candidate for at least one side of the sheet matrix material because of its high strength, tear resistance, puncture and cut resistance, abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, and generally good impermeability to fluids being transported. In this project, sparsely reinforced TPU elastomer composites have been developed. The TPU matrix was reinforced with webs of continuous fibers of various types and patterns, wherein the reinforcement serves as a load carrying structural element designed to resist both crack initiation and propagation. A unique thermoforming process technique has been designed specifically to produce the sparsely reinforced sheet material. Representative sheets of these materials have been studied for strength, toughness and different deformation behaviours by the means of tensile tests, tear tests, snag tests, slow puncture tests, and hydraulic bulge tests. A series of test apparatus have been designed and built for examining these mechanical properties. Also, the effect of different reinforcements, web patterns and strand diameters on the mechanical properties has been investigated. The sparsely reinforced TPU composites produce outstanding tear strength, snagging resistance, and an increase in the elongation to failure in an ASTM Die-C type of tear test. The best material of those tested to date is TPU sheet reinforced sparsely with a web of extruded polyurethane fiber. The intersections of the polyurethane rod reinforcements are very effective crack arrestors. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.

40|$|Our {{times are}} {{characterized}} by the dichotomy between the increasing need for {{health care and the}} global decrease in economic resources. Neonatology is at the centre of this scenario for several reasons. Firstly, the availability of molecular and genetic tests has made possible the accurate prenatal diagnosis of a series of diseases caused by transmissible and non-transmissible genetic defects, thus leading to the development of large-scale screening programmes and the consequent proper medical and surgical treatments. Secondly, thanks to improvements in assistance in intensive therapy in the last fifteen years, there has been a substantial increase in low, very low and extremely low weight premature births (LBW, VLBW and ELBW respectively). The survival rate of these premature neonates is good and their quality of life following the neonatal period has also improved. How can we combine the need to count on excellent laboratory diagnoses with the need to reduce the cost of healthcare and, more in particular, the costs of purchasing advanced systems of diagnosis? Three considerations can be formulated: 1) it is essential to eliminate waste, but it is just as essential to ensure the quality of the products (instrumentation and diagnostic kits); 2) we should change the objective of issuing tenders for the supplying of health equipment and services from the present scenario, which provides for supply contracts, often in-service, of diagnostic systems, we should change to contracts that call for a policy of savings through the providing of products of excellence. Although at first sight this may appear paradoxical, in reality it masks a vaster matter that involves different stakeholders: health professionals, suppliers and the public administration; 3) the use of sophisticated techniques and the study of molecular profiles are capable of generating far-reaching prospects for healthcare, investments and savings. An example of this is represented by metabolomics, one of the emerging “omics” disciplines, applicable in numerous fields such as that of infections of neonates and children. If, by means of experimental studies properly validated in clinical trials, metabolomics were found to be capable of recognizing eight to ten metabolites, thus making early identification of a clinical picture of systemic infection possible, an industrial investment could lead to the production of a dipstick containing these freeze-dried metabolites, like the dipstick commonly used in the chemical and physical analysis of urine. Such a <b>disposable</b> <b>item</b> would be extremely easy to use, economical and available to all mothers for testing the risk of sepsis of their babies simply by immersing the stick in the urine at a cost estimated at less than half a US dollar. </p...|$|E
