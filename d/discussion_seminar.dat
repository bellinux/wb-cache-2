She read English at University College London in 1939-1940, teaching in secondary schools for the remainder of World War II.

She taught in schools and at Froebel College before training as a psychologist at Guy's Hospital, then as a psychoanalyst at the British Psychoanalytical Society, where she was a training analyst. She had supervision with Melanie Klein, [...] Wilfred Bion and Esther Bick, and personal analysis with Herbert Rosenfeld. At the Tavistock she introduced the Work <b>Discussion</b> <b>Seminar,</b> and the Personality Development Course.

Using infant observation methods of understanding primitive states of mind expressed through gestures of eyes, hands, body posture, she has worked in in-patient or out-patient settings with contributors: a group of psychiatrists, psychologists, family and child psychotherapists, physiotherapists, nurses, therapeutic care workers, teachers, parents’ groups and work <b>discussion</b> <b>seminar</b> members in out-patient and in-patient settings.

Threats to Earth's environment have increasingly become globalized {{and in response to}} at least ten major global threats—including global warming, deforestation, population growth and persistent organic pollutants—countries, NGOs and corporations have signed hundreds of treaties, conventions and various other types of agreements designed to protect or at least mitigate and minimize damage to the environment.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{consider}} the contribution that psychoanalytically-informed work can make to the training of workers in the field of Early Childhood Development in South Africa. The model chosen for the purposes o f this study was the Work <b>Discussion</b> <b>Seminar,</b> based on a model developed at the Tavistock Clinic in London. Six subjects, all educate workers running their own creches, were recruited. Five out o f the six participants belonged to the Impilo Pilot Project, an action research project launched by the Gauteng Department o f Education in 1997. The subjects took part in six Work Discussion Seminars once a week, for six weeks. Discussions focused upon the behaviour and inner preoccupations o f various children, as well as on the conscious and unconscious responses o f the workers to these children’s communications. The seminars were based upon, the view that caregivers of young children need nurture and understanding themselves, in order to fulfil the demanding role of child rearing. Data from recordings o f discussions in the sessions and from preand post-interview measures showed that the participants appreciated the opportunity o f working in a group, which encouraged the sharing o f ideas and also provided containment for their work-related anxieties. In addition, it revealed that the impact of discussions extended beyond the boundaries o f the seminars themselves in that suggestions made and understandings reached were shared with creche assistants, as well as with the parents o f the children concerned...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Pedagogy: Theories, Approaches 24 th National Conference on the Beginning Design StudentThe receipt of a degree is momentous; it is at once the end of an academic career and the beginning of practice life. Terminal coursework thus becomes a critical component in successfully preparing students for the classroom-to-office transition. Essential to student preparedness is the ability to critically analyze, synthesize and apply myriad skills and knowledge. Critical thinking and problem solving require an understanding of the intimate relationship between various aspects of theory, research, applied design, and construction methods, materials, and documentation technologies. Equally as important is the development of student confidence and ownership. The lessons offered within a final studio should therefore integrate these elements into a comprehensive process promoting independent exploration, discovery, and application. This approach allows students to make their own connections between design skills and, in turn, transform abstract knowledge into applied understanding. Armed with a holistic comprehension of core fundamentals, emerging practitioners can effectively, efficiently and creatively address the innumerable challenges of professional practice. This paper discusses the application of these ideals into a graduate level, terminal design studio. The exploration of meaning is used to organize the studio around a variety of in-depth urban design projects. Student work is augmented with a reading and <b>discussion</b> <b>seminar</b> that highlights the need for reading, writing and verbal skills in the design process, as well as promotes the continued use of theory and research within professional practice. In total, student design explorations represent successful theory-to-practice applications related to urban landscapes at scales ranging from 1 "= 40 '- 0 " to 1 / 8 "= 1 '- 0 "...|$|E

40|$|Group work, {{which is}} also known as {{collaborative}} or cooperative learning, {{is one of the best}} researched of all teaching strategies. Research results have shown that students who have opportunities to work collaboratively learn faster and more efficiently, have greater retention, and feel more positive about the learning experience (Johnson, Johnson & Smith, 1991). Although these teaching/learning strategies have undergone nearly fifty years of research and scores of studies, the extent of their recognition and application varies tremendously in various parts of the world. During a 3 -week International On-line Collaboration <b>Discussion</b> <b>Seminar,</b> (an event arranged by the Schools Around the World program held by the Council for Basic Education, Washington), teachers and national/regional facilitators from six participating nations/ regions shared their ideas and knowledge based on their experiences in implementing group work, particularly in the subject of science. Three major topics were explored within the seminar: defining group work, assessment of group work, and professional development for supporting implementation of group work. This paper provides insights for group work in science education by drawing references from the shared ideas in the international seminar, in order to provide its implication in the future direction for science teaching in Hong Kong consistent with the current reform. As stated in the Hong Kong Government curriculum development document, a design for a student-focused curriculum is called upon for meeting the best interest of students and developing their different intelligence (Curriculum Development Council, 2000). Group work consists of various teaching and learning strategies with a sound record of research history and experimental results worldwide; therefore, it can provide resources for meeting these objectives. This on-line seminar provides a global educational community for teachers in Hong Kong (General Studies teachers at primary schools and science teachers at secondary schools), first allowing them to realize their own stage of group work implementation compared to other countries, then forming a basis for strengthening or modifying their current teaching models...|$|E

The seminar was open to the college 2 ̆ 7 s faculty and staff. Both Meredith and I knew of various professors and professionals who have some interest in textiles, and we both hoped that they would take part in the seminar. Some of these people were connoisseurs and collectors with a narrow interest in one particular subject, such as kilim fragments or lace. Some were weavers themselves. Some had an interest in Women 2 ̆ 7 s Studies, while others were interested in the use of weaving language in storytelling. And finally, we had some who had no knowledge of any study of textiles or understanding of any aspect of the topic we were exploring. So we had a broad range of interests that could travel far. Also we had a wonderful coincidence take place as we began our preliminary meetings in the spring, when we discovered that Nancy Matthew 2 ̆ 7 s, a curator at the Williams College Museum of Art, was planning to exhibit textiles from the college 2 ̆ 7 s holdings in January 2000.
