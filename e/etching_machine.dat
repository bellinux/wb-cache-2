Its many advantages over traditional techniques like photolithography include lower cost, ability to pattern on non-planar surfaces, and compatibility with a variety of materials. Low production rates are one of the major limitations, as the process remains primarily a lab-scale technique at this point. Commercialization of the process depends on the development of innovative ways of applying the techniques to fast and flexible process paradigms. This thesis proposes the use of roll-to-roll techniques to increase the throughput, flexibility, and printable area for [mu]CP, while maintaining high quality outputs.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a low cost and environment- friendly method for the regeneration of the most widely used aqueous etchant, ferric chloride, found in photochemical machining (PCM) facilities. In order to implement the above process a comprehensive and automated chemical analysis and control system was designed to fully investigate the key parameters which previous research has suggested {{play a major role in}} the analysis of ferric chloride. Monitoring methods have been developed and deployed in a commercial environment such that the etchant could be analysed remotely across the business network or via the internet. This level of monitoring has removed much of the `black art' previously associated with etching and has allowed proactive control of the etchant and the PCM process in general. Detailed analysis of the data captured has resulted in a clear understanding of the role the free hydrochloric acid (HC 1) level plays in prolonging the life of the etchant. By keeping the free acid level high, dissolved metals remain in solution. The regeneration uses oxygen from the air, combined with surplus HCI, to regenerate the etchant within the <b>etching</b> <b>machine</b> itself. This environment-friendly system has allowed etching to continue in a very controlled way for nearly one year, during which time some 500 kg of metal have been dissolved. This has totally eliminated the need to change the etchant which otherwise would have been carried out every 16 weeks. The saving to the sponsoring company has been over £ 7000 per year. These combined activities are considered as a major advancement in knowledge and will be of considerable benefit to the PCM industry in general.

40|$|Traditionally, {{photography}} {{has been}} used to produce a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional subject. The work in this exhibit uses photography as a departure point from which a three-dimensional work is created from a three-dimensional subject. The technique may be unconventional, but it is the concepts behind the work which are intended to be the dominant concern. The execution of each sculpture begins with the camera. After photographing the selected building, the negative is then enlarged to the desired size and transferred to litho film, a process which eliminates all grey tones and reduces all values to positive or negative. The film is contacted to a photo-sensitized zinc plate and exposed with a carbon arc lamp. After the plate has been developed, it is put into a commercial <b>etching</b> <b>machine</b> and etched to the maximum depth possible without cutting through the plate. The shape of the sculpture, as determined by the photograph, is accomplished by cutting a wooden mold which is then bolted tightly to the plate. After applying a release agent to the plate and mold, the cement is poured into the mold. A drying period of at least seventy-two hours is required for proper hardening of the cement, at which time the piece may be removed from the mold. Based on the belief that creative thought should be a logical process, each piece of work is a single step towards solving a problem, not a solution in itself. My work deals with relationships: image to material, light to shadow, positive space to negative space, color to the absence of color, and construction to destruction. The decision to utilize cement as a sculptural material was made simultaneously with the selection of an image. The objective was to produce a piece with maximum congruity of material and image. In the resulting work, light and shadow become intertwined with positive and negative space and the relief image becomes a direct parallel to the illusionistic depth in a photograph.

Comparison is given between the studied and conventional techniques for machining silica, such as photolithography and <b>etching,</b> laser <b>machining,</b> etc [...] Precision dicing was used to create low loss input/output facets in the silica-on-silicon platform. It was demonstrated that ductile type dicing can produce facets in a silica-on-silicon substrate with a smooth, mirror like finish. The facet had a surface roughness (Sa) of 4. 9 nm, a factor of ~ 7. 5 improvement on previously reported roughnesses. An individual silica/air average interface loss, caused by surface roughness scatter, was calculated to be - 0. 63 dB and - 0. 76 dB for the TE and TM polarisations, respectively. Utilising dicing, glass photonic microcantilever devices are produced with integrated Bragg gratings and waveguides. Two cantilever interrogations methods have been shown; one utilising a single Bragg grating and the other using a pair of spectrally matched Bragg gratings to form a Fabry-Pérot interferometer. These cantilever devices were subjected to physical stimulus of external pressure change and profilometer actuation. A precision micromill was built by the author. Precision micromilling was used to remove the cladding material from the silica-on-silicon platform, for evanescent field access. By accessing the ductile milling regime, the mill enabled three-dimensional machining of flat, smooth, chip free grooves in silica.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a micro propulsion system. The trend of miniaturization of satellites requires small sized propulsion systems. For particular missions it is important to maintain an accurate distance between multiple satellites. Satellites drift apart due to differences in mass, area and position of the satellites. A miniaturized propulsion system of a cold gas blow-down rocket engine is presented. The system consists of two parts; the low pressure storage system and the feeding and thruster system. The feeding and thruster system can generate the thrust required for position corrections of the satellite. It consists of several functional modules; an active valve, a particle filter, a nozzle and an electronic module. A nozzle is needed which can deliver a thrust in the mN range. The nozzle is used to increase the efficiency of the propulsion system. We explored the fabrication of a 3 D conical converging-diverging nozzle shape by means of MST techniques. These techniques are: deep reactive ion <b>etching,</b> femtosecond laser <b>machining</b> and a technique which uses powder blasting in combination with a heat treatment. It is shown that the latter two methods are most promising. The valve has to be very leak-tight to ensure a successful satellite mission. In conventional valves a low leak-rate is obtained by a large and forceful actuator. To allow for smaller valves a novel design is presented requiring low force – and thus a smaller actuator - while still promising to be leak-tight.

This bonding process allows the fabrication of 3 x 8 coolers in one step in which the 5 structured copper plates of a size of 100 x 150 mm" 2 are bonded together. The structuring procedure is currently done by <b>etching</b> and laser <b>machining.</b> Microchannels with a width of 60 - 100 #mu#m and a depth of 300 #mu#m are used in the experiments as microstructures for better comparability to already existing theoretical and experimental results.

All experiments use water as coolant and flow rates of 25 - 37 l/h are measured for coolers with a fin/channel structure of 100 / 100 #mu#m at a pressure difference of #DELTA#p= 4 bar. A thermal resistance of 0. 44 K/W of these copper coolers is demonstrated for a device with a 10 mm laser diode bar mounted on the front edge of the cooler.

40|$|Glass {{has stirred}} human {{interest}} {{since the dawn}} of history due to its unique properties including its high mechanical strength, transparency, thermal and chemical properties. With the great technological advancement that we are witnessing today in the micro-technology field, glass micro-machining has already found applications in the optical, electronics, and biomedical applications. In fact, such applications require high-aspect-ratio structures of defined wall flatness and surface roughness. There exist nowadays several glass micro-machining technologies that are being developed to meet this demand. These are based on thermal (laser), chemical (dry and wet etching), and mechanical (ultrasonic, abrasive and diamond-tool drilling) processes. Spark Assisted Chemical Engraving (SACE) is a non conventional glass micro-machining technology which is based on discharge generation at the tool tip. This is known to heat up the glass surface. Today, the machining mechanism is highly questionable where it is explained differently by many researchers in the field. This {{is due to the fact}} that the basic understanding about the process and the local variables in the machining zone is still missing. Although research about SACE drilling has allowed achieving deeper and smaller holes, these results remain specific to certain machining conditions. In fact, they are achieved experimentally by trial and error due to limited knowledge about the process fundamentals. Therefore, it can be said that SACE machining is still blind where the idea of doing feed-back drilling has not been explored sufficiently. These are the basic reasons of why SACE glass machining remains in laboratories and is never applied in industry. The aim of this work is to unveil basic information about the SACE machining process and the local parameters in the machining zone. For this purpose, a methodology is developed for measuring the local machining zone parameters based on the force exerted on the tool during machining. Measurement errors caused by tool bending, wear and thermal expansion are quantified and considered while measuring and analysing the machining forces. Thus, in a first step, the machining force is characterized and analysed to get a deeper understanding about its origin and the reasons of its formation. This signal is used in a second step to extract information about local variables including the machining gap size, the local glass surface temperature and the origin of its texture. Based on the understanding of the machining process that this work brings, a thermal model is built which describes heat transfer to the glass surface. The agreement between calculations and measurements ensures the validity of both the model and measurement methodology. Based on the results, the machining mechanism is explained as a thermal assisted <b>etching</b> process. <b>Machining</b> can exist in two modes based on the electrolyte state (aqueous or molten) which depends on the local flushing. Force signal readings showed that tool-glass bonding can occur during machining which may hinder the drilling progress. Based on the understanding that this work brought about the machining mechanism and the factors that influence it, force feedback algorithms are built with the aim to establish a balance between local heating and flushing. The efficiency of the various algorithms in enhancing the drilling performance was compared and assessed based on the resulting drilling time. The knowledge acquired allowed building algorithms that succeeded in drilling high-aspect-ratio holes up to 1 : 9 while using very small tools (70 microns diameter) without breakage. The resulting drilling time is dramatically reduced to few seconds compared to several minutes in the state-of-the-art SACE drilling. ...|$|R
