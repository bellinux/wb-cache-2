60|$|A game {{started with}} crowns to while away the tedium of the <b>enforced</b> <b>sojourn</b> {{at the inn}} had grown to monstrous proportions. Fortune had favoured the youth at first, but as the stakes grew her favours to him diminished, {{and at the moment}} that Cynthia rode out of the inn-yard, Mr. Harry Foster flung his last gold piece with an oath upon the table.|$|E
60|$|The {{long ride}} {{had left her}} hot, dusty, scratched, with tangled hair and torn habit. She went over to her saddle, which Kells had removed from her pony, and, opening the saddlebag, she took {{inventory}} of her possessions. They were few enough, but now, in view of an unexpected and <b>enforced</b> <b>sojourn</b> in the wilds, beyond all calculation of value. And they included towel, soap, toothbrush, mirror and comb and brush, a red scarf, and gloves. It occurred to her how seldom she carried that bag on her saddle, and, thinking back, referred the fact to accident, and then with honest amusement owned that the motive might have been also a little vanity. Taking the bag, {{she went to a}} flat stone by the brook and, rolling up her sleeves, proceeded to improve her appearance. With deft fingers she rebraided her hair and arranged it as she had worn it when only sixteen. Then, resolutely, she got up and crossed over to where Kells was unpacking.|$|E
60|$|Most {{precious}} {{were they}} now, when, {{out of the}} reach of all teaching save her own, she had to infuse into the sinking girl's mind the great mysteries of life and death, that so she might not leave the world without more hope or faith than her heathen forefathers. For that Ermentrude would live Christina had never hoped, since that fleeting improvement had been cut short by the fever of the wine-cup; the look, voice, and tone had become so completely the same as those of Regina Grundt's little sister who had pined and died. She knew she could not cure, but she could, she felt she could, comfort, cheer, and soften, and she no longer repined at her <b>enforced</b> <b>sojourn</b> at Adlerstein. She heartily loved her charge, and could not bear to think how desolate Ermentrude would be without her. And now the poor girl had become responsive to her care. She was infinitely softened in manner, and treated her parents with forms of respect new to them; she had learnt even to thank old Ursel, dropped her imperious tone, and struggled with her petulance; and, towards her brother, the domineering, uncouth adherence was becoming real, tender affection; while the dependent, reverent love she bestowed upon Christina was touching and endearing in the extreme.|$|E
