5|$|In 1968, Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> that by {{the year}} , a machine would exist with an {{intelligence}} that matched or exceeded the capability of human beings. The character they created, HAL 9000, was based on a belief shared by many leading AI researchers that such a machine would exist by the year 2001.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1643 the {{commander}} of the local Parliamentary forces in Cheshire, Colonel Robert Duckenfield, was ordered to seize Wythenshawe Hall and to remove anything of value that could be found. Forewarned, Robert Tatton recruited a group of more than 50 defenders from among his staff and Royalist friends. After ransacking the nearby village of Northenden the Roundheads arrived at Wythenshawe Hall on 21 November 1643, but they did not find the task of taking it as easy as they <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> At one point during the siege the attackers almost took possession of the house in a struggle during which six of the defenders were killed. The Parliamentarians refused a truce to allow the bodies to be taken to the local church for proper services to be held, necessitating their burial in the garden behind the house. One of those killed was the fiancé of Mary Webb, a young woman who had been brought up by the Tattons and had remained in the house with the defenders. Towards the end of the siege Mary saw the man who had led the attack, Duckinfield's second-in-command Captain Adams, sitting on a wall near the house. Borrowing a musket from one of the defenders, she shot him dead.|$|E

In a video posted April 12, 2010, Randi stated {{that he has been}} given a clean bill of health.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{among the}} first {{officers}} the SAR service was not what they <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> when joining {{the air force and}} many applied to the Air Force Academy. This caused new first officers to be ordered to the 300 Sqn, which reinforced the problems, resulting in high turnover. The Sea Kings were designed to be maritime helicopters, but were increasingly used for terrestrial SAR missions, and on occasion aerial firefighting. Throughout the 1970s the number of air ambulance missions increased dramatically, hitting 242 in 1977.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Berkley Books {{published}} The Illustrated Dune, an {{edition of}} Dune with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by John Schoenherr, {{who had done}} the cover art for the first printing of Dune and had illustrated the Analog serializations of Dune and Children of Dune. Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author {{was surprised to find}} that the artwork appeared exactly as he <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.|$|E

25|$|The Northern {{public was}} shocked at the {{unexpected}} defeat of their army when an easy victory had been widely anticipated. Both sides quickly came to realize the war would be longer and more brutal than they <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> On July 22 President Lincoln signed a bill that provided for the enlistment of another 500,000 men {{for up to three}} years of service. On July 25, eleven thousand Pennsylvanians who had earlier been rejected by the U.S. Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, for federal service in either Patterson's or McDowell's command arrived in Washington, D.C., and were finally accepted.|$|E
25|$|Wing was set {{to appear}} in a stage play of Adrian Mole, which would have clashed with the filming of EastEnders. Julia Smith refused to offer her any leeway and {{informed}} {{her that she had}} to take a gamble — she could either turn down the play, meaning that if she failed to get the part of Lou she would have lost two jobs, or she could give up the possibility of playing Lou and accept the play. Wing decided to turn down the play and she was subsequently given the role of Lou. An early choice in the casting process, Wing had the face, voice and attitude that Tony Holland <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> for the character. She was told by producers to bring something from her own background to the role.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the other}} three indicted, Rødberg Larsen was also charged with {{embezzlement}} of money from several of the small, inactive chapters in Oslo. Elgsaas and Mathisen had stated that they had spent NOK 30,000 and NOK 11,000 each to 'advance' the membership fees, and had both stated that they had done this without believing they would be repaid the money. They also lent NOK 38,000 and NOK 18,000 to Rødberg Larsen to cover the deficit in the Oslo chapter. Rødberg Larsen claimed that it was Elgsaas and Mathisen that had emptied the inactive accounts, to cover their costs for the 'advancements'. He further claimed that he had only borrowed NOK 12–13,000 from Elgaas, and nothing from Mathisen. He claimed the deficit was something that Elgaas and Mathisen <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> afterwards. When questioned about where {{the money from the}} inactive chapters had gone, Rødberg Larsen claimed that they had been used to start new chapters. When questioned about why there were no receipts for this, he stated the all the receipts had either not been kept, or been stolen in a framed theft.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked [...] "How can we tell whether someone <b>has</b> relaxed or <b>imagined</b> something, or just thinks that he or she <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> it?" [...] In regards to the possibility of a placebo trial, Leavitt commented [...] "I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> something while we know that he has not." ...|$|R

25|$|Due {{to being}} in the demon dimension, Queen Hippolyta began to see visions of the future. One of those visions {{included}} Wonder Woman dying. Keeping this to herself, she called for a new Contest {{for the title of}} Wonder Woman, claiming that she felt that Diana had proven inadequate in the role despite Diana's insistence that the world outside was more complicated than they <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> Initially excluding the new Amazons, Queen Hippolyta submitted to a vote on the whole to include them at Diana's behest. Through some mystical managing on Hippolyta's part, Artemis eventually won the Contest and became the new Wonder Woman. Hippolyta then declared to both tribes that she considered Artemis her own daughter for winning the Contest, and during her entire tenure as Wonder Woman Artemis wore Diana's tiara. As gifts to aid her in her new mission, Artemis was given several magical objects. The Gauntlet of Atlas which increased its wearer's strength by ten times, The Sandals of Hermes which gave the gift of speed and flight, and the golden Lasso of Truth which forced anyone tied by it to speak only the truth.|$|E
500|$|Balzac insisted to Gozlan that by {{searching through}} the streets of Paris, they would find a name {{suitable}} for a character he <b>had</b> <b>imagined,</b> a political genius thwarted by the mediocrity of the time. They finally came upon a tailor's sign that enraptured Balzac, bearing the name Z. Marcas. He believed that the name suggested [...] ("some mysterious fatality"), and chose it for his story's protagonist. He wrote the 30-page story soon afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Safire, in his {{political}} dictionary published in 2008, recollected {{that when he}} asked Moore, some years after the inauguration, whether he had really seen the girl holding the sign, or whether he <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> it, [...] "his eyes took on a faraway look". In columns written in the final years before his 2009 death, Safire commented that the sign was [...] "almost {{too good to be}} true", and said of Moore, [...] "e may have made that up".|$|E

500|$|George Harrison's song [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] {{dates back}} to the {{recording}} sessions for his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass, and was {{one of a number of}} tracks left over from that project. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine (1980), Harrison recalls writing the tune on an organ and, not being an accomplished keyboard player, having difficulties doing the correct fingering in both hands. It was only when his friend Klaus Voormann took over the left-hand part, to play the bass line, that he was able to hear the piece as he <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> it.|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{announced}} the novel on October 6, 2006 on his blog, where {{fragments of the}} work were posted non-sequentially for some time, leading to much reader speculation on the content and plot of the novel. The following day, the blog featured {{an exploration of the}} mooted title by close friend and collaborator Jack Womack. In August 2007, Gibson made an appearance in the virtual world Second Life to give a reading of the novel; later reflecting on the experience, he remarked that the Second Life construct was [...] "a lot more corporate" [...] than he <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> A report in The Times described the event as [...] "heavily freighted with meaning" [...] in light of Gibson's role in shaping conceptions of cyberspace and virtual worlds.|$|E
500|$|Menfond Electronic Art adapted Bizenghast into {{animated}} short episodes or [...] "iManga".

She liked the [...] "kooky" [...] background effects and Edaniel's voice actor, but disliked Dinah's [...] "high-pitched" [...] voice which she <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> as [...] "deeper...with a slight edge to it. Sort of like Mandy from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, {{but without the}} sarcasm." [...] The episodes were also available on Verizon's V CAST.

500|$|The couple {{arrived in}} New York on 15 October 1936, with Kertész intent on finding fame in America. They {{lived at the}} Beaux Arts Hotel in Greenwich Village. Kertész found life in America more {{difficult}} than he <b>had</b> <b>imagined,</b> beginning a period which he later {{referred to as the}} [...] "absolute tragedy". Deprived of his artist friends, he also found that Americans rejected having their photos taken on the street. Soon after his arrival, Kertész approached Beaumont Newhall, director of the photographic department at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), who was preparing a show entitled Photography 1839–1937. Offering Newhall some of his Distortions photographs, Kertész bristled at his criticism, but Newhall did exhibit the photographs. In December 1937 Kertész had his first solo show in New York at the PM Gallery.|$|E
500|$|The Sum of Things was {{published}} posthumously, for on 4July 1980 Manning suffered a severe stroke while visiting {{friends in the}} Isle of Wight. She died in hospital on 23July; somewhat typically, Reggie, having been recalled from Ireland, was not present when she died. He {{could not bear to}} see her [...] "fade away" [...] and had gone to London to keep himself busy. Manning had long predicted that the frequently tardy Reggie would be late for her funeral, and he almost was. In addition, his mourning period, characterised by abrupt transitions from weeping to almost hysterical mirth, was precisely how Manning <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> Guy Pringle's reaction to Harriet's supposed death in The Sum of Things. Manning was cremated and her ashes buried at Billingham Manor on the Isle of Wight.|$|E
500|$|In March 1893, Crane {{spent hours}} {{lounging}} in Linson's studio while having his portrait painted. He became fascinated {{with issues of}} the Century that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the Civil War. [...] Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, [...] "I wonder {{that some of those}} fellows don't tell how they felt in those scraps. [...] They spout enough of what they did, but they're as emotionless as rocks." [...] Crane returned to these magazines during subsequent visits to Linson's studio, and eventually the idea of writing a war novel overtook him. [...] He would later state that he [...] "had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out through most of his boyhood" [...] and <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> [...] "war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers." [...] This novel would ultimately become The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E
