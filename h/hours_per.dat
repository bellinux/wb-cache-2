5|$|State schools provide {{textbooks}} free {{of charge}} to their students, while private schools generally require their students {{to pay for their}} textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five <b>hours</b> <b>per</b> week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two <b>hours</b> <b>per</b> weeks to arts and crafts, two <b>hours</b> <b>per</b> week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and two and a half <b>hours</b> <b>per</b> week to physical education and religion.

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} {{rates of}} intact sporophytes or gametophytes of the fern Todea barbara grown in sterile culture were measured using an infrared gas analyzer. Sporophytes consisted of single whole plants with roots and leaves grown in tubes of agar. Gametophytes were grown as several plants covering {{the surface of}} the agar. Sporophytes had photosynthetic rates at light saturation of 8. 50 microliters CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> milligram dry weight and 1, 300 microliters CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> milligram chlorophyll, whereas rates for gametophytes were lower, 2. 36 microliters CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> milligram dry weight and 236 microliters CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> milligram chlorophyll...|$|R

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of maintaining {{an air force}} with little funding {{during a time of}} rapid technological development was compounded by the Swiss militia system: all but a handful of military personnel were citizen soldiers who served only a few weeks each year following their initial recruitment phase. Military pilot candidates underwent the same recruit training, NCO school and officer candidate school as other Swiss army officers, followed by a pilot school of 173days, then re-entered civilian life. During his first two years of service, a pilot's training continued with ten logged flight <b>hours</b> <b>per</b> month, and thereafter he was required to fly fifty <b>hours</b> <b>per</b> year at his convenience.|$|E

5|$|Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau {{had succeeded}} in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, but had been {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use.

5|$|Despite the improvements, the {{in-service}} {{rates for}} the F-84E remained poor with {{less than half of}} the aircraft operational at any given time. This was primarily due to a severe shortage of spares for the Allison engines. The expectation was that F-84Es would fly 25 <b>hours</b> <b>per</b> month, accumulating 100 hours between engine overhauls. The actual flight hours for Korean War and NATO deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison's ability to manufacture new engines. The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.|$|E

5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during {{the day in the}} spring months, where they can be heard loudly squeaking, {{shuffling}} position and seen hanging out the bottom of the bat house during all hours of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 <b>hours</b> <b>per</b> day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E

50|$|The {{material}} has to undergo heat treatment involving normalization, {{quenching and tempering}} to develop the required austenitic microstructure, with subsequent tempering.

Held at 1750F for an <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> inch of section size, and then air-cooled to room temperature. Next the samples were austenized by repeating the process up to 1700F, and held for an <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> inch of section size, then oil quenched to below 125F.
