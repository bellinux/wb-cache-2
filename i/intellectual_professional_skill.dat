40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the Law Teacher of the Year keynote speech {{delivered}} at the Association of Law Teachers’ Annual Conference in April 2011 in Cardiff, Wales. Some refinement of the ideas expressed then took place and a further presentation formed my inaugural Readership seminar at Nottingham Law School in June 2011. The essence of the speeches was to seek to address the fitness for purpose of the Qualifying Law Degree (QLD) in the context of contemporary legal education, but more recently has focused the need for the requirements of the QLD better to reflect and promote what is best about law and legal education. Thus, rather than skills being incidental to academic legal study, I suggest that certain discipline-specific cognitive <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> should replace the foundation subjects in the QLD. This paper concludes with some sample programmes designed to meet legal <b>intellectual</b> <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> that {{meet the needs of the}} law student in the early 21 st century whilst respecting institutional autonomy in legal curriculum design...|$|R

During such generation all necessary requirements for supporting resources (such as information, know-how, <b>intellectual</b> and <b>professional</b> <b>skills,</b> inputs and outputs, quality and operational risk limitations, moderation, control and monitoring) are taken into consideration using the operational knowledge of experts and project participants that act inside the predefined business area.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to explore the {{complexities}} involved in understanding and planning for student orientation and engagement within the higher education context. Key understandings of {{what is meant by}} ‘student engagement’ are explored through a conceptual framework that draws together five dimensions of engagement: personal, academic, <b>intellectual,</b> social and <b>professional.</b> Findings: Discussion focuses on the challenges to student engagement in higher education, including contextual/environmental factors as well as personal factors. Examples are provided of ways in which these challenges can be addressed, with a particular focus on students’ orientation and transition into the higher education context. The framework articulated in this chapter has wide potential as a foundation for the planning and delivery of activities aimed at enhancing student engagement. The examples in the chapter, drawn from our own practice, illustrate the practical outcomes of using the framework in this way. Throughout the chapter, the context of teacher education is used as a lens through which to view the broader issues of student engagement, with specific reference to programmes and practices developed within the Australian context. Therefore, the chapter has direct applicability to those involved in teacher education. However, the framework has further value in that it allows for deeper understanding of the demands that engagement makes in terms of a student’s academic, personal, social, <b>intellectual,</b> and <b>professional</b> <b>skills,</b> knowledge, aspirations, and dispositions, and to therefore consider how such demands might be addressed for students across a range of backgrounds, within practice and policy...|$|R

Yet, programs across the nation have struggled to define, teach, and measure <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> since their introduction as ABET criteria for engineering programs in 2000. The Engineering <b>Professional</b> <b>Skills</b> Assessment (EPSA) is a direct assessment method centered on one of several inter-disciplinary scenarios that frame a contemporary societal problem, a generalized set of discussion questions intended to guide a meaningful, 45 minute discussion of multiple scenarios among 4 - 6 students, and the Engineering <b>Professional</b> <b>Skills</b> rubric that is broadly applicable for all scenarios. In this miniworkshop, participants will examine one scenario in detail along with self-scoring and peer-scoring of a scenario discussion among workshop participants. This experience will be structured to produce small-group and large-group insights about administering and scoring the EPSA in classroom situations. The intended audience for this workshop includes faculty who teach courses identified for collecting data on ABET <b>professional</b> <b>skills,</b> ABET coordinators from the entir...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSoft skills {{especially}} ethics, {{moral and}} <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> {{play an important}} role in sharpening individual's excellent personality by complementing his/her hard skills to the teacher communities. The complicated nature of teaching, in both practice and preparation, encourages teacher educators to explore the complexity of the novice teachers’ experiences and identify the concerns they face in their induction year. This study aims to examine the ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> of novice teachers in secondary schools of Malaysia from the views of their administrators. In addition, findings are triangulated by the self-rating data done by novice teachers themselves on this particular skill. The main purpose of this study is to explain and interpret the practice of ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> from the two different perspectives. This study employed qualitative method using focus group interviews to collect data from 31 administrators and quantitative method using self-rating questionnaire from 250 novice teachers. Among the seven soft skills components which comprised of communicative skill, critical thinking and problem solving skills, team work skill, life-long learning and management of information, entrepreneurship skill, ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill,</b> and leadership, quantitative finding showed that ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> has been rated as second least needed after entrepreneurship skill in the workplace according to novice teachers. However, quantitative finding found to be contradicted with qualitative data. School administrators stated that soft skill components are the most needed and most of the novice teachers are lacking of is ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill.</b> In conclusion, keeping abreast of developments in teacher education would ensure that novice teachers remain current and relevant in their profession, and that novice teachers be equipped with necessary ethics, moral and <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> to survive in an increasingly complex teaching environment...|$|R
