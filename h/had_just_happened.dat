500|$|Meanwhile, Coach McGuirk {{volunteers to}} {{assemble}} Paula's large and complicated new grill, but he {{proves to be}} both incredibly inexperienced and largely incompetent at performing such a task. When McGuirk believes that he has finally completed the grill, he gathers Paula and the three kids together to witness its first ignition, but he ultimately causes a large explosion. The five go off on a drive, covered in soot, and Brendon accidentally drops his camera on the road, where it is {{run over by a}} car. He groans [...] "oh no," [...] and almost begins to tell the others about what <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened,</b> but ends up getting drawn into a conversation about where to go for dinner.|$|E
500|$|H. W. Boynton, {{writing in}} The Atlantic in 1903, commented {{that only a}} century earlier {{children}} had had to be content with the Bible, Pilgrim's Progress, Paradise Lost, and Foxe's Book of Martyrs. But in his day [...] "A much pleasanter bill of fare is being provided for them". Boynton argued that with Just So Stories, Kipling did for [...] "very little children" [...] what The Jungle Book had done for older ones. He described the book as [...] "artfully artless, in its themes, in its repetitions, in its habitual limitation, and occasional abeyance, of adult humor. It strikes a child {{as the kind of}} yarn his father or uncle might have spun if he <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to think of it; and it has, like all good fairy-business, a sound core of philosophy".|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to him".|$|E

2500|$|On October 26, 2011, {{the first}} video setting footage of Occupy Wall Street {{to the song}} Love, That's America by Melvin Van Peebles was {{uploaded}} to YouTube. In an interview with Van Peebles several weeks later, he discussed the song going viral. Turkish newspaper Radikal described the song as becoming the surprising unofficial anthem of the movement. On January 17, 2012, Van Peebles performed at the Players' Club to honor {{the fact that the}} song has become a theme for the Occupy Wall Street movement. [...] On February 22, 2012, Van Peebles commented further, [...] "When I found out that the song had been co-opted by Occupy Wall Street, my jaw dropped. It went viral online. People were remixing it and mashing it up with videos from the protests. The time I wrote {{it was a time of}} social upheaval — the Stonewall Riots <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened.</b> Forty years later, the same thing was going down in the streets of New York City." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{tension and}} {{isolation}} {{in the recording}} process led to complications in the song selection, which would, in turn create further tensions within the band. Firstly was the song [...] "Slow Motion", a controversial ballad written by Jenkins about a student shooting a teacher's son. While Jenkins insisted that the song was satirical parody, and actually anti-violence, Elektra disapproved of the track being on the album, feeling it could cause controversy due to {{the proximity of the}} Columbine High School massacre, which <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> in April of that year. The band and the label fought over the song's inclusion for four months, with the label proposing a compromise that would allow only the instrumental to be on the album, and in return, the label would finance an EP to be released after the album, where the band could release the song in its entirety and have complete creative freedom, without restriction. Cadogan, already unhappy with his lack of ownership over the band, was the sole member of the band to object to the deal, knowing he would not have any control over the deal's terms of a cash advance and imprint label creation for the EP.|$|E
