Effect of inoculum level, foliar <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray,</b> and wheat cultivar mixtures were evaluated on disease development {{in the field and}} greenhouse in Nepal. Treatments were arranged in a split-split plot design with three replications in both experiments. Two inoculum levels of PST (low and high) were main plot factors; nontreated control and foliar spray of fungicides (Mancozeb and Bayleton) were subplot factors; and two-component cultivar mixtures, composed of different ratios of a susceptible (S) and a resistant (R) cultivars (90 : 10, 80 : 20, and 50 : 50, 100 : 0, and 0 : 100) were sub-subplot factors. WYR severity was assessed at different time intervals, and disease development was calculated as area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Inoculum level did not cause significant differences in AUDPC in the field but did in the greenhouse. Foliar spray of fungicides reduced the AUDPC in the greenhouse and field. In both experiments, AUDPC values were low in cultivar mixtures compared with a pure stand of a susceptible cultivar. As the proportion of resistant cultivar increased compared with the susceptible cultivar in the S:R mixture component, disease severity decreased with a consequent increase in grain yield. The greater yield obtained with cultivar mixtures compared with only the susceptible cultivar, independent of inoculum level and <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray</b> in the field, revealed a promising strategy to manage WYR in Nepal...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop and evaluate pre- and postharvest management strategies to reduce stem end rot (SER) incidence and extend saleable life of 'Carabao' mango fruits in Southern Philippines. Preharvest management focused on the development and improvement of <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray</b> program, while postharvest management {{aimed to develop}} alternative interventions aside from hot water treatment (HWT). Field evaluation of systemic fungicides, namely azoxystrobin (Amistar 25 SC), tebuconazole (Folicur 25 WP), carbendazim (Goldazim 500 SC), difenoconazole (Score 250 SC) and azoxystrobin+difenoconazole (Amistar Top), reduced blossom blight severity and improved fruit setting and retention, resulting in higher fruit yield but failed to sufficiently suppress SER incidence. Based on these findings, an improved <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray</b> program was developed {{taking into account the}} infection process of SER pathogens and fungicide resistance. Timely application of protectant (mancozeb) and systemic fungicides (azoxystrobin, carbendazim and difenoconazole) during the most critical stages of mango flower and fruit development ensured higher harvestable fruit yield and minimally lowered SER incidence. Control of SER was also achieved by employing postharvest treatment such as HWT (52 - 55 °C for 10 min), which significantly prolonged the saleable life of mango fruits. However, extended hot water treatment (EHWT; 46 °C pulp temperature for 15 min), rapid heat treatment (RHT; 59 °C for 30 - 60 sec), fungicide dip and promising biological control agents failed to satisfactorily reduce SER and prolong saleable life. In contrast, the integration of the improved spray program as preharvest management practice, and postharvest treatments such as HWT and fungicide dips (azoxystrobin, 150 - 175 ppm; carbendazim, 312. 5 ppm; and tebuconazole, 125 - 156 ppm), significantly reduced disease and extended marketable life for utmost 8 days...|$|E

The {{study was conducted in}} replicated field experiments located in four agricultural locations (representative of the main agro-ecological regions of the country) over a 10 -year period (2003 - 2012). Three <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray</b> strategies were compared: a single DSS-based system and two commonly used spray practices in the GDL, a double- (2 T) - and a triple- spray (3 T) spray treatment; there was also a non-treated control. In years with a high disease pressure, the DSS-based recommendation resulted in protection of the three upper leaves comparable to that achieved with the 2 T and 3 T treatments, with significant grain yield increases (P > 0. 05) compared to the control (a 4 to 42 % increase, depending on the site and year). Overall, the financial gain in treated plots compared with the control ranged from 3 to 16 % at the study sites. Furthermore, in seasons when dry weather conditions precluded epidemic development, no the DSS-basedDSS recommended no <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray</b> was recommended, reducing use of fungicide, and thus saving the cost of the product.

40|$|Fungicides are {{commonly}} applied as prophylactic sprays, {{with the expectation}} of increased yield and kernel quality, to control husk spot of macadamia in Australia. However, economic benefits from fungicide applications to control husk spot have rarely been quantified. We investigated the effectiveness, efficiency and economic returns of <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray</b> applications for husk spot control using three different spray application volumes and two dose rates of tank mixtures of carbendazim and cupric hydroxide under commercial macadamia orchard conditions. Husk spot incidence and severity were significantly (P < 0. 001) different among the treatments and between the two years. In both years, the rate of fruit abscission was highest in the untreated control followed by low spray application volumes, but reduced with increasing spray volume. The quality and value of nut-in-shell increased when nut abscission was delayed. Poor quality and low nut-in-shell value of $ 2. 85 kg(- 1) in 2010 and $ 2. 12 kg(- 1) in 2011 were obtained in the untreated control trees that abscised early in the harvest period compared with the average nut-in-shell value of $ 2. 95 kg(- 1) in 2010 and $ 2. 46 kg(- 1) in 2011 in the fungicide treated trees. Gross margins for each fungicide treatment schedule compared to the untreated control averaged over both years showed positive contributions of 20 %, 10 % and 6 % for the high, moderate and low dilute rate volume applications, respectively. Our data further indicates that dilute rate applications at higher volume may be more beneficial and cost-effective than concentrate rate applications in husk spot control programs. Overall, harvest yield increased by 11 %- 33 % when husk spot was controlled using fungicide sprays compared to no <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray</b> applications.

40|$|Reducing {{pesticide}} {{use is a}} major challenge in agriculture, and farmers are encouraged to develop integrated practices. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe, analyse and assess the current contribution of various options to pest, disease and weed management on the reduction of fungicides, herbicides and insecticides by quantifying both their use and their effect on {{pesticide use}} intensity, within the context of different wine-growing regions. We conducted a statistical analysis of pesticide use and crop management over two seasons (2006 and 2010) for 11 French wine-growing regions (10, 000 data). We used the Treatment Frequency Index (TFI) indicator to characterise the intensity of pesticide use. We analysed three crop management options: timing of first <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray,</b> type of soil cover cropping, and type of weed control. For each management option, we compared alternative or low-input practices to normal chemical-based practices, e. g., mechanical weed control (alternative option) vs. herbicide (normal chemical option). To strengthen the results, two quantitative variables completed the analysis: fungicide mean sprayed dose in the field and number of fungicides sprayed in the field. Results showed that each alternative or low input practice had an impact on TFI, but that this impact differed between wine-growing regions and between the management options under consideration. Regarding fungicides, our results showed that late timing of first <b>fungicide</b> <b>spray</b> (compared to regional reference) contributed to a reduction up to 50 % of the part of the TFI due to fungicides, as compared to fields sprayed at median or early timing. Regarding herbicides, results of low-input/alternative practices were more homogeneous in terms of their relative impact on TFI reduction. The differences in use and impact of crop protection practices were more important between regions than between the two studied years.

Field experiments were conducted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 at Jimma, Ethiopia, to {{determine the amount of}} yield loss due to ALS and to investigate the relationship between ALS and bean yield. Different levels of disease severity were created on two common bean varieties (GLPX- 92 and ICA 15541) using natural epidemics by <b>spraying</b> the <b>fungicide</b> benomyl at 7 - 14 - 21 and 28 -day intervals and by seed dressing. Generally, all <b>fungicide</b> <b>sprays</b> significantly reduced ALS severity and increased yield and seed weight but seed dressing did not affect significantly. The relative yield and seed weight losses to ALS ranged from 2 to 47 and 15 to 33 %, respectively. Single-point regression models predicted that for each per cent increase in ALS severity, there was a seed yield loss of 18 to 124. 5 kg ha - 1 in GLPX and 12. 9 to 103. 9 kg ha - 1 for ICA 15541 and 100 -seed weight loss per sample of 100 seeds of 10 to 13 g for GLPX- 92 and 13 to 22 mg for ICA 15541.
