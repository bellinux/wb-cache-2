25|$|Rossi (1977) {{suggests}} that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may enable us to locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere. He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, {{and that of the}} right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, <b>information</b> <b>processor</b> while the right hemisphere operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that the right hemisphere is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in the right hemisphere.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{results suggest}} that an array of quantum <b>information</b> <b>processors</b> communicating via classical channels {{can be used to}} solve fluid dynamics problems. Quantum lattice-gas algorithms (QLGA) running on such architectures have been shown to solve the diffusion equation, the Schrödinger equation, and the Dirac equation. In this report, we describe progress towards an ensemble nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) implementation of a QLGAthat solves the diffusion equation. The methods rely on NMR techniques to encode an initial mass density into an ensemble of two-qubit quantum <b>information</b> <b>processors.</b> Using standard pulse techniques, the mass density can then manipulated and evolved through the steps of the algorithm. We provide the experimental results of our first attempt to realize the NMR implementation.

The agreement between measurements and simple predictions shows the underlying coherence of the atom ensemble, and the inversion infidelity in a ? 80 ?K atom cloud is halved.
