25|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> form of router is the {{original}} form. It is a specialized type of hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade projecting well beyond its base plate (gaining it the nickname old woman's tooth). Today the power tool form of router, with an electric-motor-driven spindle, is the more common form, and the <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> is now often called a router plane. Although the <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> has a few advantages over the power tool and retains favour with some workers, it has been mostly replaced by the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work. Some workers consider {{it to be the}} single most versatile woodworking power tool. Becoming more popular is the use of a CNC wood router, which implements the advantages of CNC (Computer Numerical Control).|$|E
25|$|A {{knockout}} punch, {{also known}} as a chassis punch, panel punch, Greenlee punch, or a Q-max, is a <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> used to punch a hole through sheet metal. It is a very simple tool that consists of a punch, die, and screw. There are three different drive systems: manual, ratchet, and hydraulic.|$|E

40|$|To design {{comfortable}} <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> {{knowledge about}} comfort/discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> is required. We investigated which factors determine comfort/discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> according to users. Therefore, descriptors of comfort/discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> {{were collected from}} literature and interviews. After that, the relatedness of a selection of the descriptors to comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> was investigated. Six comfort factors could be distinguished (functionality, posture and muscles, irritation and pain of hand and fingers, irritation of hand surface, handle characteristics, aesthetics). These six factors can be classified into three meaningful groups: functionality, physical interaction and appearance. The main conclusions were that (1) the same descriptors were related to comfort and discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> (2) descriptors of functionality are most related to comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> followed by descriptors of physical interaction and (3) descriptors of appearance become secondary in comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Is artisans' {{comfort in}} using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> a {{necessity}} or a luxury? Ergonomically well-designed <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> which provide {{comfort to the}} user, decrease the risk of occupational health problems and increase the job performance. Therefore, {{it is not a}} luxury, but rather a necessity that <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> be designed with a focus on comfort, and that artisans make themselves informed about the use of ergonomically well-designed <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009...|$|R
25|$|The {{museum is}} staffed chiefly by volunteers with {{community}} support. A curator {{as well as}} 2 or 3 students are hired per season.

25|$|The {{center of}} the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood. There {{is no need for}} any force to push the bit into the workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a bit for a <b>hand</b> <b>tool.</b> The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.|$|E
500|$|Seven {{years after}} the {{outbreak}} began, a conference is held {{off the coast of}} Honolulu, aboard the , where most of the world's leaders argue that they can outlast the zombie plague if they stay in their safe zones. The U.S. President, however, argues for going on the offensive. Determined to lead by example, the U.S. military reinvents itself to meet the specific strategic requirements of fighting the undead: using semi-automatic, high-power rifles and volley firing, focusing on head shots and slow, steady rates of fire (a tactic [...] "re-invented" [...] by the Indian Army during the Great Panic); and devising a multipurpose <b>hand</b> <b>tool,</b> the [...] "Lobotomizer" [...] or [...] "Lobo" [...] (described as a combination of a shovel and a battle axe), for close-quarters combat. The military, backed by a resurgent U.S. wartime economy, begins the three-year-long process of retaking the contiguous United States from both the undead as well as groups of hostile human survivors. Prewar military tactics and equipment are mentioned as being employed to deal with sometimes well-armed and organized human opposition.|$|E

2500|$|Mechanical presses {{as used in}} European {{printing}} remained {{unknown in}} East Asia. Instead, printing remained an unmechanized, laborious process with pressing {{the back of the}} paper onto the inked block by manual [...] "rubbing" [...] with a <b>hand</b> <b>tool.</b> In Korea, the first printing presses were introduced as late as 1881-83, while in Japan, after an early but brief interlude in the 1590s, Gutenberg's printing press arrived in Nagasaki in 1848 on a Dutch ship.|$|E
