5|$|It was {{announced}} in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earth's crust, {{had been found in}} drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite, a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact. The findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earth, and was ejected to the surface. It had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, originating much deeper in the earth, and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest known layered bed of sand, around 100 m deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring. These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme water movement, where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains.|$|E
5|$|The Red Canyon Conglomerate, the basal {{member of}} the Moenkopi, fills broad east-flowing paleo{{channels}} carved into the Kaibab Limestone. Some of these channels are up to several tens of feet deep and may reach 200ft (61m) <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> St. George area. A thin, poorly developed soil, or regolith, formed over the paleotopographic high areas between the channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{countries}} {{surrounding the}} gulf have been actively monitoring the seismicity there since the 1980s and {{have found a}} consistent low level of activity, but a primary characteristic of the activity {{is that there are}} multiple sequences of earthquake swarms. Three swarm events, beginning in the north and ending in the south gulf, have been observed beginning in 1983 when more than 1,000 events occurred over a three-month period near the northeastern boundary of the Elat <b>Deep</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern gulf) with the largest three events approaching 5 on the Richter magnitude scale. A less pronounced swarm occurred in 1990 with the largest event reaching 4.3 in the central gulf near the Elat Deep and the Arogonese Deep. The last significant swarm happened in 1993 in the southwestern Arogonese <b>Deep</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern gulf) with the highest magnitude of 6.1 and more than 300 larger than magnitude 3 in the following weeks.|$|E
50|$|Narrowband UVB is less {{effective}} for {{the legs and}} hands, compared to the face and neck. To the hands and legs PUVA may be more effective. The reason can be because UVA penetrates <b>deeper</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin, and <b>the</b> melanocytes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin of the hands and legs is <b>deeper</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin. The Narrowband UVB does not reach the melanocytes.|$|R

5|$|A {{group of}} {{mountain}}eers dressed in Alpine costumes used {{to climb the}} mountain in early years, and eight divers between the ages 17 and 24 would dive off the waterfall. In the second season, all eight were Canadians who had competed in major diving competitions. Their schedule was six shows a day on every other day. The dive is 58 feet, and the pool is 13 feet <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre and only 7 feet deep at the edges. At {{the end of the}} dive, they were descending at 40 miles per hour.|$|E

5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|As Roman {{troops were}} spread {{increasingly}} thin over its long border, the Empire's territory continued to dwindle in {{size as the}} population of the empire declined. Barbarian war bands increasingly began to penetrate the Empire's vulnerable borders, both as settlers and invaders. In 451, the Romans defeated Attila the Hun, but only with assistance from a confederation of foederatii troops, which included Visigoths, Franks and Alans. As barbarian incursions continued, some advancing as far as the heart of Italy, Rome's borders began to collapse, with frontier forces swiftly finding themselves cut off <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enemy's rear.|$|E
5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sediment.|$|E

5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E

When he receives word that a plague has broken out and his bond Ares is one of the victims, he heads down to help with yet another of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies. His mother, however, hates the Underland and only allows Boots and Gregor below on the condition that she comes with them. The humans' plague expert, Dr. Neveeve, explains that there is a plant called starshade growing <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vineyard of Eyes which can be distilled into a cure. In the midst of the meeting, a dying bat infected with the plague inadvertently one of the delegates—Gregor's mother.|$|E
5|$|Ehrhoff {{is known}} as an {{offensive}} defenceman. He has strong skating ability, which allows him to quickly carry the puck up the ice, starting plays from his team's defensive zone, as well as join offensive plays <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposing team's zone. He also possesses a hard shot, which earns him significant time on the power play. Upon joining the NHL with San Jose, he had to adjust his game to be more defensive. He gradually became counted upon more in defensive situations and has been used on the penalty kill, as well.|$|E

Though able to penetrate <b>deeper</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain, they are less able to produce a focused, localized response and are relatively non-focal.|$|R
5|$|Endurance {{departed}} from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, first year ice was encountered, which slowed progress. <b>Deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, Endurance became frozen fast in an ice floe. On 24 February, realising {{that she would}} be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station. She drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the breaking of the ice and its later movements put extreme pressures on the ship's hull.|$|E

Pockets of enemy resistance still fought on behind the American front line, and the whole beachhead remained under artillery fire. At 21:00 the landing of the 26th RCT completed the planned landing of infantry, but losses in equipment were high, including 26 artillery pieces, over 50 tanks, about 50 landing craft and 10 larger vessels.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, {{working with}} Dr. Theodore Wadsworth, Todd gained {{permission}} {{to start a}} hospital near the present-day Farmington/Plainville border for smallpox inoculation.

He began corresponding with his friend Pete Fleming about his desire to minister in Ecuador, and in 1952 the two men set sail for Guayaquil as missionaries with the Plymouth Brethren. For six months they lived in Quito {{with the goal of}} learning Spanish. They then moved to Shandia, a Quechua mission station <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ecuadorian jungle. There they worked under the supervision of a Christian Missions in Many Lands missionary, Wilfred Tidmarsh, and began exposing themselves to the culture and studying the Quechua language.|$|E
