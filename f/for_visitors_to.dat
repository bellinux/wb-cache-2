5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within {{the grounds for}} athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground. It {{consisted}} of a stadium opened in 1896; the hope was to provide additional entertainment <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> the tower in the winter months. The capacity of the grounds varied, but at one point was as high as 100,000, although attendances rarely, if ever, approached that figure.|$|E

Pettigrew {{was one of the}} commanding officer's at the Battle of Gettysburg and led a company of soldiers at Pickett's Charge. He sustained mortal wounds during General Robert E. Lee's retreat from Gettysburg. The general, who grew up on a farm that adjoined Somerset Place, is buried with his father and grandfather. Their final resting place is a popular stopping point <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> the park.|$|E
5|$|Rivers in Boise National Forest {{offer the}} {{opportunity}} for rafting and kayaking through rapids up to class four, with the most difficult sections on the South Fork and main stems of the Payette River.

Motorized boating is permitted on Anderson Ranch Reservoir, Deadwood Reservoir, and Warm Lake.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{originally}} constructed to connect rural cities in eastern Utah with Grand Junction, Colorado, {{the largest city}} in the region.

Today, the highway is used as a scenic drive <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> the area.|$|E

5|$|The urban {{regeneration}} company Clydebank Re-Built started a £3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. A lift <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the gardens}} thrived {{in their early}} years, by 1842 Jennison was in {{financial}} difficulties, and on 13December bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Jennison's problems were caused by his failure to sell the Strawberry Gardens property, competition from the recently opened Manchester Zoological Gardens, and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway track cutting through the land Jennison had leased in December 1836, restricting access to the gardens. Jennison twice tried unsuccessfully to sell Belle Vue, after which his creditors allowed him {{time to make a}} success of the gardens; {{by the end of the}} 1843 season Jennison was able to repay his debts. The railway that had been a thorn in his side eventually proved to be an asset when Longsight railway station was re-sited closer to Belle Vue in 1842, making it easier <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> reach the gardens.|$|E
5|$|El Hatillo {{preserves}} {{some of its}} colonial architecture, {{including an}} 18th-century parish church and a unique Romanian Orthodox Church. The municipality also has a rich artistic culture, {{with at least two}} important musical festivals celebrated yearly, and numerous holiday celebrations reflecting the heritage of El Hatillo. The culture, the pleasant temperature, the rural landscape, and the gastronomy of the municipality have made it a place of interest <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> the city, and a desirable place to live. The municipality receives a part of its income from tourism, an activity that is promoted by the government.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{century the}} gorge was quarried to produce {{building}} stone for the city. Stone {{was taken by}} boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's Celestine, but the enterprise {{did not last long}} into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> the Hotwells spa in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side of the gorge are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.|$|E

5|$|South Florida is a {{transitional}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones, {{resulting in a}} wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> see species, particularly birds, that are not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in.|$|E
5|$|The Hospitium {{is located}} between {{the ruins of}} St. Mary's Abbey Church and the River Ouse and {{is thought to have}} {{originally}} been a guest house <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> the abbey of low social rank, or possibly a barn. It was originally {{part of a group of}} buildings in the abbey grounds that included a brew-house, stables, mill and, near the main gate, a boarding school with 50 pupils. The oldest parts of the ground floor were built around 1300, but the upper storey has been extensively restored in modern times. The ruined gateway at the side dates back to the 15th century, and was probably the entrance to a passage that ran towards the water-gate by the river.|$|E
5|$|The LNC {{continued}} to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s {{on the matter}} of cheap fares <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> the cemetery, but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s4d) for day return tickets from London to Brookwood. By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road. The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway, and the proposal was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|The Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead had {{initially}} {{objected to the}} line but gave consent {{on the condition that}} a station be constructed between Hampstead and Golders Green to provide access <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> the Heath. A new station was added to the plans at the northern edge of the Heath at North End where it could also serve a new residential development planned for the area. Once Parliament was satisfied that the extension would not damage the Heath, the CCE bills jointly received royal assent on 18 November 1902 as the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1902. On the same date, the E bill received its assent as the Edgware and Hampstead Railway Act, 1902.|$|E
5|$|The trails {{through the}} park, {{including}} one for mountain biking, run almost parallel along the ridge. There is a natural pond with fishes and turtles in the north-west of the park. A 280-metre long canopy walk was completed {{in the eastern part}} of the park in October 2003, linking Kent Ridge Park to the war museum, Reflections at Bukit Chandu, enhancing the park's and museum's accessibility to the public. Along the walk, there are information boards providing educational information on the flora and fauna in the park. At the half-way point, there is a shelter <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> take a short break or to enjoy a scenic view of Normanton Park and the National Parks Board's plant nursery.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in New York before {{returning}} to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} consumer advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms {{in the wake of the}} U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee <b>for</b> <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state.|$|E
