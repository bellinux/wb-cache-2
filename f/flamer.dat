40|$|This {{study of}} nitrogen-diluted non-premixed {{counterflow}} <b>flames</b> with finite burner diameters investigates {{the important role}} of the outer-edge <b>flame</b> on <b>flame</b> extinction through experimental and numerical analyses. It explores <b>flame</b> stability diagrams mapping the <b>flame</b> extinction response of nitrogen-diluted non-premixed counterflow <b>flames</b> to varying global strain rates in terms of burner diameter, burner gap, and velocity ratio. A critical nitrogen mole fraction exists beyond which the <b>flame</b> cannot be sustained; the critical nitrogen mole fraction versus global strain rate curves have C-shapes for various burner diameters, burner gaps, and velocity ratios. At sufficiently high strain-rate <b>flames,</b> these curves collapse into one curve; therefore, the <b>flames</b> follow the one-dimensional <b>flame</b> response of a typical diffusion <b>flame.</b> Low strain-rate <b>flames</b> are significantly affected by radial conductive heat loss, and therefore <b>flame</b> length. Three <b>flame</b> extinction modes are identified: <b>flame</b> extinction through shrinkage of the outer-edge <b>flame</b> with or without oscillations at the outer-edge <b>flame</b> prior to the extinction, and <b>flame</b> extinction through a <b>flame</b> hole at the <b>flame</b> center. The extinction modes are significantly affected by the behavior of the outer-edge <b>flame.</b> Detailed explanations are provided based on the measured flame-surface temperature and numerical evaluation of the fractional contribution of each term in the energy equation. Radial conductive heat loss at the <b>flame</b> edge to ambience is the main mechanism of extinction through shrinkage of the outer-edge <b>flame</b> in low strain-rate <b>flames.</b> Reduction of the burner diameter can extend the <b>flame</b> extinction mode by shrinking the outer-edge <b>flame</b> in higher strain-rate <b>flames.</b> © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Especially for the case with two lifted <b>flames,</b> such configuration could be suitable in studying interaction between two tribrachial <b>flames.</b> In the present study, the <b>flame</b> characteristics have been investigated numerically by adopting a reduced kinetic mechanism in the triple-port burner. Four different types of <b>flame</b> configurations, including two attached <b>flames,</b> inner lifted/outer attached <b>flames,</b> inner attached/outer lifted <b>flames,</b> and twin lifted <b>flames,</b> were successfully simulated depending on the flow conditions.

In the twin lifted <b>flames,</b> the inner lifted <b>flame</b> was affected appreciably when the other <b>flame</b> was located further upstream such that the lifted <b>flame</b> located further downstream encountered the axial velocity acceleration induced by the gas expansion from the lifted <b>flame</b> located upstream, while thermal effects were not observed since the temperature of the incoming flow toward the lifted <b>flame</b> was not affected.

50|$|In combustion, a {{diffusion}} <b>flame</b> is a <b>flame</b> {{in which}} the oxidizer combines with the fuel by diffusion.

Three kinds of <b>flames</b> are studied: steady, expanding, and imploding <b>flames.</b> To model the <b>flames</b> in detail, while minimalizing computational costs, a flamelet model is adapted to the spherical and cylindrical <b>flames</b> in combination with a skeletal reaction mechanism. The expression for the <b>flame</b> stretch rate follows directly from its mass-based definition and is shown to consist of two terms, one due to the propagation of the <b>flame</b> itself {{and the other one}} due to the variation of the <b>flame</b> thickness. This last term is usually ignored in literature. It is shown to be small compared with the other term, but important if one is interested in the dynamics of the <b>flame</b> itself. Parameters related to <b>flame</b> stretch such as the Karlovitz and Markstein numbers are obtained and analyzed. Furthermore, the <b>flame</b> propagation velocities of these expanding and imploding <b>flames</b> are shown to change only slightly throughout the <b>flame.</b> Both the gas and burning velocities, however, vary significantly when changing the position in the <b>flame.</b> The <b>flame</b> propagation velocity of the expanding spherical <b>flame</b> is in excellent agreement with experimental data...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to clarify <b>flame</b> characteristics through the evaluation of critical mole fractions at <b>flame</b> extinction and edge-flame oscillation of low strain rate <b>flames</b> using the global strain rate, velocity ratio, and burner distance as experimental variables. The transition from a shrinking <b>flame</b> disk to a <b>flame</b> hole was verified through gradient measurements of the maximum <b>flame</b> temperature. Evidence of edge-flame oscillation in <b>flame</b> disks was also found using numerical simulations in zero and normal gravity. The main mechanisms of <b>flame</b> extinction and edge-flame oscillation were analyzed by comparing the energy fractions in the energy equation. For low strain rate <b>flame</b> disks, radial conduction heat loss rather than <b>flame</b> radiation was a significant contributor to <b>flame</b> extinction and even edge-flame oscillation. This was experimentally demonstrated by evaluating the critical mole fraction at <b>flame</b> extinction and edge-flame oscillation, as well as measurements of the <b>flame</b> temperature gradient along the <b>flame</b> disk surface. These results suggest that low strain rate <b>flame</b> responses are determined not only by one-dimensional <b>flame</b> responses, but also by multi-dimensional <b>flame</b> responses such as radial conduction heat loss. The results also show that extinction of low strain rate <b>flames</b> is more probably due to multi-dimensional heat losses than to radiative extinction...|$|R
2500|$|The {{oxidizing}} <b>flame</b> is {{the third}} possible <b>flame</b> adjustment. It occurs when the ratio of oxygen to acetylene required for a neutral <b>flame</b> has been changed to give an excess of oxygen. This <b>flame</b> type is observed when welders add more oxygen to the neutral <b>flame.</b> This <b>flame</b> is hotter {{than the other two}} <b>flames</b> because the combustible gases will not have to search so far to find the necessary amount of oxygen, nor heat up as much thermally inert carbon. It is called an oxidizing <b>flame</b> because of its effect on metal. This <b>flame</b> adjustment is generally not preferred. The oxidizing <b>flame</b> creates undesirable oxides to the structural and mechanical detriment of most metals.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of rod-stabilized laminar inverted <b>flames</b> of ultra-lean hydrogen–methane–air mixtures has been performed. For mixtures with high hydrogen content, anomalous stabilization and blow-off behavior has been observed. <b>Flames</b> in those mixtures could be stabilized at equivalence ratios below the lean flammability limit for a zero-stretch planar <b>flame.</b> Stabilization of such <b>flames</b> was possible only when the mixture velocity exceeded some critical value. <b>Flames</b> were blown off when the mixture velocity was reduced below this value. The stand-off distance above the <b>flame</b> holder for those <b>flames</b> decreased and heat transfer from the <b>flame</b> base to the <b>flame</b> holder became more intense when the mixture velocity was increased. This is opposite to the regular behavior of inverted <b>flames.</b> These observed unusual phenomena were attributed to {{the combination of a}} strong <b>flame</b> stretch and preferential diffusion effects and to the negative value of the Markstein length in mixtures with high hydrogen content. According to the suggested explanation, increasing the velocity results in an increase of the <b>flame</b> stretch rate at the <b>flame</b> base. This, in turn leads to higher <b>flame</b> temperatures and higher burning velocities, making the survival of the <b>flame</b> below the flammability limits possible. Along with the anomalous blow-off behavior, normal blow-off occurring at increased velocity was observed for mixtures with high hydrogen content at the lowest tested equivalence ratios. The observation of the <b>flame</b> shape evolution showed that, when the normal blow-off limit is approached, a <b>flame</b> narrows slightly above the <b>flame</b> base, forming a 2 ̆ 2 neck 2 ̆ 2. The <b>flame</b> fronts merge at the 2 ̆ 2 neck 2 ̆ 2 location and <b>flame</b> breaks there, leading to complete <b>flame</b> extinction or leaving a very small flamelet near the <b>flame</b> holder. It is suggested that the <b>flame</b> local extinction in that case occurs {{as the result of the}} excessive <b>flame</b> stretch at the <b>flame</b> 2 ̆ 2 neck 2 ̆ 2 which leads to the <b>flame</b> fronts merging and to the incomplete reaction...|$|R

40|$|Formation of NOx in {{counterflow}} methane/air triple <b>flames</b> at {{atmospheric pressure}} was investigated by numerical simulation. Detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties were employed. Results indicate {{that in a}} triple <b>flame,</b> {{the appearance of the}} diffusion <b>flame</b> branch and the interaction between the diffusion <b>flame</b> branch and the premixed <b>flame</b> branches can significantly affect the formation of NOx, compared to the corresponding premixed <b>flames.</b> A triple <b>flame</b> produces more NO and NO 2 than the corresponding premixed <b>flames</b> due to the appearance of the diffusion <b>flame</b> branch where NO is mainly produced by the thermal mechanism. The contribution of the N 2 O intermediate route to the total NO production in a triple <b>flame</b> is much smaller than those of the thermal and prompt routes. The variation in the equivalence ratio of the lean or rich premixed mixture affects the amount of NO formation in a triple <b>flame.</b> The interaction between the diffusion and the premixed <b>flame</b> branches causes the NO and NO 2 formation in a triple <b>flame</b> to be higher than in the corresponding premixed <b>flames,</b> not only in the diffusion <b>flame</b> branch region but also in the premixed <b>flame</b> branch regions. However, this interaction reduces the N 2 O formation in a triple <b>flame</b> to a certain extent.

The {{dynamics of the}} large-scale <b>flame</b> structures, including variations in <b>flame</b> dimensions, the degree of turbulent <b>flame</b> puff interaction, and the turbulent <b>flame</b> puff celerity were determined from high-speed imaging of the luminous <b>flame.</b> All of the tests presented here were conducted with a fixed fuel injection velocity at a Reynolds number of 5000.

The decreased <b>flame</b> length, <b>flame</b> puff separation, and <b>flame</b> puff celerity are consistent with a greater momentum exchange between the <b>flame</b> and the surrounding co-flow, resulting from an increased rate of air entrainment due to swirl.

40|$|<b>Flame</b> {{characteristics}} when a non-premixed n-butane jet is ejected into a coaxial {{cylindrical tube}} are investigated experimentally. <b>Flame</b> stability depends {{mainly on the}} characteristics of <b>flame</b> propagation as well as air entrainment which depend on the jet momentum and on the distance between the nozzle exit and the base of a confined tube. As flow rate increases, the <b>flame</b> lifts off from a nozzle attached diffusion <b>flame</b> and a stationary lifted <b>flame</b> can be stabilized. The liftoff height increases nearly linearly with the average velocity at the nozzle exit.
