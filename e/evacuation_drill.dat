50|$|Eight years later, it is {{revealed}} that Mitsuha persuaded {{her father to}} conduct an emergency <b>evacuation</b> <b>drill</b> across the surrounding districts, allowing most of Itomori's residents to escape in time and survive. Taki has graduated from university {{and is trying to}} find a job, but still has lingering feelings that he is missing something important to him. He finds himself attracted to items relating to Itomori, such as magazines and people he thinks are familiar (whom he actually knew when he was in Mitsuha's body). While riding separate trains, Taki and Mitsuha are stunned to see each other when their trains suddenly run parallel to one another. They get out at their next stops and try to find each other; they finally meet at a staircase and, feeling as though they know each other somehow, ask for each other's name.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} contextualized as a {{contribution}} to the literature of the area tackling forms of psychosocial risks (Rutter, 1990); in detail, here it is focalized the relationship between the treatment, made up of antiseismic <b>evacuation</b> <b>drills,</b> and the development of those processes functional to an adequate adaptive management of a seismic event. The research contribution has been carried out within an experimental group made up of 50 children, whom the treatment was addressed to, represented by antiseismic <b>evacuation</b> <b>drills,</b> and by a control group, superimposable on the experimental one, by gender and age variables, but not benefiting from the treatment. Through the use of a questionnaire, whose items underwent the factorial analysis, and of a “narrative peak” semiprojective tool, some interesting data supporting the work hypotheses were pointed out. Among data, a discrepancy between a proper representation of an adaptive behaviour and a poor elaboration of the comprehension of seismic phenomenon is worth of particular interest...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an investigation into}} egress behaviour via stairways to increase understanding and further investigate the factors, which impede safe occupant movement. Fire <b>evacuation</b> <b>drills</b> of three different buildings were monitored by video cameras positioned throughout the stairwells. The purpose of the <b>evacuation</b> <b>drills</b> was to enable {{the analysis of the}} behaviour of the occupants, the merging process and the speed of movement. Studies in Human Egress Behaviour have become increasingly important in fire safety engineering research. The focus of the study is the merging process of the occupants and their behaviour at the stair-floor interface (landing). An investigation was made into the merging and deference behaviour that occurred on the stair-floor landings. Results demonstrated that occupants on higher floors are at an increased risk due to stoppage because of merging and deference behaviour. An investigation of the stair floor geometry and entrances onto landings was undertaken. In addition, further research is required to investigate the capabilities of advanced computer egress models to accurately predict merging and deference behavior...|$|R

50|$|While the {{hospital}} was still owned by HCA, the building was surveyed for possible renovations by independent contractors. Due to deteriorizations, {{it was determined that}} it would be better to build a new hospital than to renovate SWFRMC, so HCA began to construct expansions to Gulf Coast Hospital with plans to merge the facilities. When Lee Memorial Health System took over {{the hospital}}, they surveyed the SWFRMC facility for possible reuse as well, only to come to the same conclusion as the contractors hired by HCA. LMHS continued the expansions to GCH as planned by HCA. When expansions were finally completed in March 2009, all patients, staff, and equipment were transferred to the new Gulf Coast Medical Center. Lee County paramedics treated the transfer of patients as an emergency <b>evacuation</b> <b>drill.</b> As a final farewell to the facility, staff members signed their names and start dates on the interior walls of the hospital in permanent marker before leaving, and some left hand prints in colorful paint. The building was demolished in November 2009 to make way for a new distribution center for medical supplies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Considerable {{research}} efforts abound on safety issues during construction phase of built facilities, but very low {{attention is paid}} to safety during operation phase; instead security occupies top priority. Responding to factors such as technological and increase in student’s population, many higher institutions globally are expanding their built facilities in terms of quantity, size and sophistication. There are many situations that infringe on the safety of the end-users; they include fire, natural and man-made disasters. The simplest approach to test the emergency preparedness of the end-user of the facilities as well as the adequacies of critical components of the built facilities is to simulate emergency through <b>evacuation</b> <b>drill.</b> Conducting <b>evacuation</b> <b>drill</b> in Higher Education institution is complex due to the composition of its constituency, multiple activities, time constraints and the human dynamics: some view <b>evacuation</b> <b>drill</b> as a wasteful exercise. The case study method of qualitative research is adopted; the data are collected through semi-structured questionnaire complemented with interview, observation and participation. The findings include evidence of the display of safety awareness documents, sensitization lectures and running mini evacuation drills in the different segment of the institution. Although the response rate to <b>evacuation</b> <b>drill</b> is low at the moment, with more commitments and advocacy it is possible to progress towards benchmarking the exercise with regulatory standards...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a probabilistic approach to analyse evacuation movement data. The approach {{relies on a}} detailed video analysis of people movement and pattern reconstruction. Conditional probabilities for travel path trajectories, walking speeds, and physical area occupied on stair landings are calculated for the evacuee population. The approach has been applied {{as a case study}} using data from an <b>evacuation</b> <b>drill</b> performed in a six-storey office building in the United States. The <b>evacuation</b> <b>drill</b> was filmed and occupant's behaviours on stairs were analysed using the new method. A comparison with the deterministic methods currently employed in engineering practice has been performed. The benefits of the probabilistic approach are discussed, including (1) a more accurate representation of people movement and (2) the use of probabilistic data for modelling purposes, i. e., model validation and model development...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} {{carried out a}} {{questionnaire}} survey of local residents living in coastal areas in Ishikawa Prefecture. The survey involved {{a discussion of the}} problems associated with tsunami disaster mitigation. The surveyed districts were Misaki District in Suzu City, Ogi and Ushizu Districts in Noto-cho, and Hashidate District in Kaga City. All of these districts are located along the coast and are expected to experience serious tsunami damage if a tsunami strikes. This expectation is based on assessments conducted by prefectural officials. The results of the questionnaire indicate that the level of readiness for a tsunami disaster by residents is related to their experiences of disaster <b>evacuation</b> <b>drills.</b> In the case of districts which have lots of experiences of disaster <b>evacuation</b> <b>drills</b> that are supported by local governments and local communities, many residents are adequately prepared for a disaster, its after-effects, and the recommended mitigation measures. Disaster readiness also differed according to age and gender. The findings also indicated that {{more needs to be done}} to support younger people and women. The four surveyed areas have similar physical features, but each district has different demographic characteristics. These results show that it is necessary to consider appropriate measures according to each district's population and the types of residents' properties...|$|R
30|$|From {{a design}} perspective, office {{buildings}} have generally open floor plans, which limit {{the possibility of}} containing the fire within a compartment.

Occupants may be {{more familiar with the}} elevator egress component if elevator systems are used (Peacock 2009). Fire systems are generally well-maintained, and may include recorded voice messages and fire alarms. Trained staff with particular responsibilities in a fire may be available on hand to facilitate evacuation.|$|R
