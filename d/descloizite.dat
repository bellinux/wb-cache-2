40|$|SUMMARY. TWO vanadates, tangeRe and volborthite, new to Britain, their {{association}} with vana-diferous nodules, and their geological environment are described. A percentage composition graph for vanadium taken across a vanadiferous nodule, by scanning electron probe, is given. VANADIUM minerals are rare in Britain. Vanadinite, Pbs(VO 4) 3 C 1, was first discovered by Johnston (I 83 I) in the Wanlockhead mining district of Dumfriesshire; it was by his account comparatively plentiful and specimens appear in most large mineral collections. Mottramite, Pb(Cu, Zn) VQOH, first described by Roscoe (I 876, p. I I I), was so named after its considered origin at Mottram St. Andrews in Cheshire. Though vanadium does occur in the Lower Keuper Sandstone of the Alderley Edge area of Cheshire, of which Mottram St. Andrews {{is considered to be}} geologically a part, the minerals present have not yet been specifically identified. It was suggested by Kings-bury (I 956) that Roscoe's mottramite probably originated at Pim (or Harmer) Hill in Shropshire where the mineral does occur. Vanadinite, mottramite, and <b>descloizite,</b> Pb(Zn, Cu) VO 4 OH, have been described by Kingsbury and Hartley (I 956) from the Caldbeck Fells area of Cumberland...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{minerals}} (120) were tested {{as to their}} efficiency in removing Cs/sup 137 /, Sr/sup 90 /, and Ru/sup 106 / from dilute alkaline wastes prior to ground disposal. Strontium- 90 exchanged rapidly with calcium in Florida pebble phosphate. The best results were obtained with Tennessee phosphate heated to 600 deg C for one hour, {{but part of the}} increase in sorption of strontium was due to ion exchange. Heating Tennessee phosphate resulted in a material with excellent hydraulic properties that sorbed Cs/sup 137 / and Sr/sup 90 / from dilute alkaline solutions. Other calcium minerals such as calcite or dolomite were activated to adsorb Sr/sup 90 / by heating or by treating with caustic or phosphate solutions. Cesium- 137 in dilute alkaline solutions exchanged preferentially with the potassium present in a number of mica schists and mica minerals which possess a layer lattice type of structure. The high selectivity for cesium of Tennessee phosphate heated to 600 deg C for one hour ts ascribed to the presence of bentonitic impurities present in this material. The kinetics and adsorption of Ru/sup 106 / are shown to be complex and slow due to tbe large number of chemical forms and complexes of ruthenium which can exist under varying conditions. Copper in conglomerate, various sulfide minerals containing copper, cuprite (cuprous oxide), and <b>descloizite</b> (basic zinc lead vanadate) removed 90 % of the ruthenium under reducing conditions at a pH of 7 when heated at 60 deg C for 16 hours. At lower tempenatures (25 deg C) the removal of ruthenium from aged solutions took days or even weeks. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Mine {{tailings}} in African countries Zambia and Namibia {{have been}} investigated with an objective to determine the role of secondary hematite in immobilization of contaminants. Two sites, Chambishi and Mindolo, {{are located in the}} Copperbelt in Zambia with relatively humid climates and two sites, Berg Aukas and Kombat, are in Namibia, where the climate is semiarid. At the Chambishi site which is about 40 years old, a hardpan composed of hematite and gypsum has formed at a depth of about 60 cm and large amounts of Cu and Co have been deposited. At the much younger Mindolo site (30 years old, but most V remains in primary <b>descloizite,</b> embedded in a carbonate matrix while a relatively small amount of released V is incorporated into hematite. In contrast, released Zn and Pb are incorporated mainly into smithsonite and cerussite, which are less stable from an environmental viewpoint. Finally, at the Kombat mine tailings (< 5 years old), As released from pyrite is also incorporated into hematite, but Cu released by dissolution of chalcopyrite and bornite has precipitated as malachite, which is less stable than hematite. Water-leached concentrations of contaminants such as Cu, Zn, and Pb (also present in some carbonate phases) are an order of magnitude higher than water-leached concentrations of V and As which are bound to crystalline ferric minerals such as hematite and soluble only in the aqua regia fraction of sequential extraction. It seems that rapid formation of hematite under tropical climate conditions and incorporation of contaminants into this mineral phase is favourable for attenuation of released contaminants. These findings have implications at other mining sites with similar climates in Africa, South America and Asia...|$|E
40|$|The Keban mine {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} lead and zinc producers in Turkey. It is located 54 km NW of Elazig County, Eastern Turkey. The Keban metamorphic massif consists of calc-schists, dolomite marble, phyllite and marble. It forms part of the eastern Taurid belt, a prolongation of the Alpine orogenic belt. The principal structural feature of the area is the northern extension of the Malatya-Keban anticline, a major recumbent fold with a NE-SW axis. Later movements acting in different directions gave rise to N-S, E-W, NW-SE and NE-SW directed folding and faulting over the previous anticline. Small bodies of quartz-syenite porphyry, of paleocene age, intrude the metasediments. Detailed study by chemistry, petrography and x-ray techniques on sanidine accounts for a composition range between Or 65 Ab 35 and Or 99 Ab 1. The ratio of Or to Ab tends to increase outwards from the central parts of the igneous body. Skarn zones have developed in association with the intrusion of quartz-syenite porphyry. These are located mainly within the metasediments. The magnatite deposit of Zereyandere, the scheelite deposit of Kebandere and the main sulphide deposit were formed as part of the process of skarn formation. Minor amounts of some manganese minerals and the minerals vanadinite and <b>descloizite</b> derived from the main sulphide deposit, are also found in the district. The main sulphide deposit of economic importance chiefly incudes sphalerite, galena, iron and copper sulphides and several sulfo-salts in subordinate amounts. Of the by-products, silver comes from galena, polybasite and tennantite. Arsenopyrite in addition to chalcopyrite contains trace concentrations of gold. All the evidence suggests that the quartz- syenite porphyry is the source of mineralization. The location of ore minerals is controlled by certain rock types and by major and minor structural elements. Variation of vapour fugacity and temperature during mineralization are indicated by more than one stage of formation for certain ore minerals. The presence of different gangue minerals marks the fluctuating nature of the ore forming fluids whose last stage is believed to be alkaline rather than acidic. The main sulphide deposit is accepted as a semi-metasomatic contact deposit, while the magnetite and scheelite deposits are classified as being metamorphic. Using various methods, a temperature range of formation between 620 Â° and 78 Â°C is estimated for the ore minerals of the main sulphide deposit. For the ore minerals of the magnetite and scheelite deposits the range is from 743 Â°C down to 225 Â°C...|$|E
40|$|The Olavi Mountain Land is a 10 000 km 2 mineral {{province}} {{located at}} the eastern extremity of the exposed Northern Platform of the Damara Pan African orogenic belt. The Olavi Mountain Land is tbe most important mineral province on the Northern Platform. Exploitation of tbe Cu-Pb-Zn-V province has been on-going since the possession of the territory by the German colonial authority in 1890. Production has been mostly from four mines which in order of importance are Tsumeb, Kombat, Berg Aukas and Abeoab. A second mineral province on the Northern Platform located in the west is centred on Sesfontein where as yet only insignificant mineralization has been noted. Besides these localities, the Northern Platform is conspicuously devoid of notable mineralization. The aim of this thesis has been to document tbe Berg Aukas deposit, an important end-member type of mineralization in the Otavi Mountain Land. The basic premise bas been to show tbat the derivation and localization of the mineralization {{is a consequence of}} two broad controls which can be simply summarised as features of the basement and of the carbonate sequences. The geodynamic evolution of the Damara Belt commenced with intra-continental rifting approximately 900 Ma ago. Rift grabens trending north-east were filled by the Nosib Group which comprises mostly clastic lithologies but also some volcanics. The earliest and largest rift {{is referred to as the}} Northern Rift. Separation of the Congo, Kalahari, and proto-South American cratons resulted in rifting and rapid downwarping so that an encroaching sea and an Olavi Group carbonate shelf developed along the northern margin of the Northern Rift. Significantly, the carbonates only covered the Northern Rift in the area of the Otavi Mountain Land where a basinal dome, referred to as the Grootfontein Basement High, marked the basin edge. In the west, the carbonates covered the less important Sesfonfein Rift, and it is only in these two areas where Nosib sequences underlie the carbonate platform. Carbonate sedimentation was interrupted by a major period of crustal readjustment and the deposition of an extensive mixtite throughout the geosynclinal Swakop Trough and Northern Platform. This is referred to as the Chuos Formation and subdivides the Olavi Group into a lower Abenab and an upper Tsumeb Subgroup. Reversal of spreading led to plate collision and subduction of tbe Kalahari craton beneath the Congo craton. It was accompanied by orogenesis which resulted in F 1 folding of the Northern Platform into a series of north-easterly trending intermontane basins into which a molasse sequence known as the Mulden Group was unconformably deposited. Following this major north-south deformation mild east-west compression initiated F 2 folding and the formation of doubly plunging synclines. The Berg Aukas Syncline represents a primary depositional basin which was subsequently folded. The original basin was formed by late Nosib rifting wben spreading caused the Swakop geosynclinal Trough to form. Carbonates of the basal Berg Aukas Formation were deposited in a lagoonal setting typified by reef and fore-reef facies witb peri-platform conditions. Rapid subsidence caused these sediments to be overlain by deep water carbonates of the Gauss Formation. Two styles of mineralization known as the Tsumeb-type and Berg Aukas-type are stratigraphically, isotopically, and mineralogically distinct. The Tsumeb-type is a cupriferous variety of discordant bodies confined to the upper sequences beneath the Mulden unconformity. The Berg Aukas-type is a Zn-Pb variety confined to tbe basal unconformity. The Berg Aukas deposit comprises three ore bodies known as the Northern Ore Horizon, the Central Ore Body, and the Hanging Wall Ore Body. Sphalerite and galena constitute the bypogene ore. Willemite, smithsonite, cerussite, and <b>descloizite</b> are important supergene ores. A review of genetic models concludes that a magmatic origin initially proposed for tbe Tsumeb deposit is entirely rejected and a basin dewatering model in line with Mississippi Valley-type deposits is proposed. The syntectonic nature of mineralization at Berg Aukas and elsewhere in the Otavi Mountain Land indicates that orogenesis encouraged dewatering and leaching of metals from a broad mineralizing front along the margin of the Swakop Trough. These were transported by acidic saline brines which migrated along the clastic aquifers and structural conduits provided by the Northern Rift. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that the hydrothermal fluids at Berg Aukas were very saline (23 % TDS) and were transported at temperatures ranging between 92 Â° to 210 Â°C. Hydrothermal fluids which mineralized Berg AukaS-type deposits migrated along the basal unconformity towards the basement high and were responsible for hydrothermally altering the basement granites and gabbros and the Nosib clastic rocks. Tsumeb-type deposits resulted by migration of fluids through the carbonate pile and along north-easterly trending basement geofractures. As a consequence of variation in transport, the Berg Aukas-type and Tsumeb-type fluids leached different sources and therefore derived mineralogically and isotopically seperable characteristics. The localization of the Berg Aukas ores was controlled by the carbonate stratigraphy and structure. Hydrothermal karsting and ore deposition took place on the contact between Massive Grey and Light Grey Dolostones which represents a permeability contrast. The movement of the hydrothermal fluids was controlled by north-south trending vertical fractures caused by F 2 folding which resulted in a peric 1 inal structure. Hydrothermal karsting was accompanied by ca 1 citic, dolomitic and silicic alteration. The heated acidic fluids initiated solution collapse and a variety of breccia types. Supergene processes resulted in oxidation and upgrading of the ore. Vanadium derived indirectly from gabbros in the basement complex were transported as calcium metavanadate complexes and deposited on contact with the oxidizing base metal sulphides. ...|$|E
