5000|$|The atomic and <b>industrial</b> <b>espionages</b> in the United States by American sympathisers of {{communism}} who were controlled by their rezident Russian officials in North America greatly aided {{the speed of}} the Soviet atomic atomic project from 1942-54. Willingness of sharing classified information to Soviet Union by recruited American communist sympathizers increased when the Soviet Union faced possible defeat during the German invasion in World War II. The Russian intelligence network in the United Kingdom also played a vital role in setting up the spy rings in the United States when the Russian State Defense Committee approved resolution 2352, in September of 1942.|$|R

5|$|William McEwan {{opened the}} Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, then a suburb on the {{outskirts}} of Edinburgh, in 1856, using £2,000 loaned by his mother and his uncle. The area and the brewery are named after the spring waters from the vicinity, which, in addition to its proximity to the Caledonian railway line and the Union Canal, determined the location of the brewery. McEwan had employed geologists to identify the prime location for a supply of well water. Beforehand, McEwan had engaged in <b>industrial</b> <b>espionage</b> at Bass and Allsopp's breweries in order to learn techniques and assay costs. After establishing a market share in the industrial regions of the Scottish lowlands, from the early 1860s McEwan built up a successful colonial export trade by exploiting his family's shipowning connections. It was during this time that McEwan's India Pale Ale, the beer that was the foundation for much of the company's reputation, was first labelled Export.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] {{code name}} or cryptonym {{is a word}} or name used, {{sometimes}} clandestinely, to refer to another name, word, project or person. Names are often used for military purposes, or in espionage. They may also be used in <b>industrial</b> counter-industrial <b>espionage</b> to protect secret projects and the like from business rivals, or to give names to projects whose marketing name {{has not yet been}} determined. Another reason for the use of names and phrases in the military is that they transmit with a lower level of cumulative errors over a walkie-talkie or radio link than actual names.|$|R

25|$|The {{method of}} making mirrors out of plate glass {{was invented by}} 13th-century Venetian glassmakers {{on the island of}} Murano, who covered the back of the glass with an {{amorphous}} coat of tin using a fire-gilding technique, obtaining near-perfect and undistorted reflection.

25|$|A {{trade secret}} is {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor.

The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E
25|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>espionage</b> was {{implicated in}} the {{capacitor}} plague, {{in connection with the}} theft of an electrolyte formula. A materials scientist working for Rubycon in Japan left the company, taking the secret water-based electrolyte formula for Rubycon's ZA and ZL series capacitors, and began working for a Chinese company. The scientist then developed a copy of this electrolyte. Then, some staff members who defected from the Chinese company copied an incomplete version of the formula and began to market it to many of the aluminium electrolytic manufacturers in Taiwan, undercutting the prices of the Japanese manufacturers. This incomplete electrolyte lacked important proprietary ingredients which were essential to the long-term stability of the capacitors and was unstable when packaged in a finished aluminum capacitor. This faulty electrolyte allowed the unimpeded formation of hydroxide and produced hydrogen gas.|$|E

25|$|In {{the short}} {{time-frame}} of their rapid expansion, the Institutes {{have been the}} subject of much controversy.

There has also been organized opposition to the establishment of a Confucius Institute at University of Melbourne, University of Manitoba, Stockholm University, University of Chicago and many others. More significantly, some universities that hosted Confucius Institutes decided to terminate their contracts. These include Japan's Osaka Sangyo University in 2010; Canada's McMaster University and Université de Sherbrooke, and France's University of Lyon in 2013; the University of Chicago, Pennsylvania State University, and the Toronto District School Board in 2014. and the German Stuttgart Media University and University of Hohenheim in 2015.|$|R
25|$|The {{decline in}} the {{fortunes}} of Dunfermline lasted until {{the introduction of a}} linen industry in the early 18th century. One reason for which the town became a centre for linen was there was enough water to power the mills and nearby ports along the Fife Coast. These ports also did trade with the Baltic and Low Countries. Another reason was through an act of <b>industrial</b> <b>espionage</b> in 1709 by a weaver known as James Blake who gained access to the workshops of a damask linen factory in Edinburgh by pretending to act like a simpleton in order to find out and memorise the formula. On his return to his home town in 1718, Blake established a damask linen industry in the town. The largest of these factories was St Leonard's Mill which was established by Erskine Beveridge in 1851. A warehouse and office block was later added around 1869. Other linen factories were built on land to both the north and south ends of the burgh. During the mid-19th century, powerloom weaving started to replace linen damask. The latter did not survive, going into decline straight after the end of First World War. In 1909 the Royal Navy established Scotland's only Royal Naval Dockyard at nearby Rosyth.|$|E

This report is made up of a survey of some 250 leading authorities worldwide and of interviews carried out in late 2011 and early 2012 with over 80 cyber-security experts in government, companies, international organisations and academia. It offers a global snapshot of current thinking about the cyber-threat and the measures that should be taken to defend against it, and assesses the way ahead. It is aimed at the influential layperson, and deliberately avoids specialised language. For the moment, the “bad guys” have the upper hand – whether they are attacking systems for <b>industrial</b> or political <b>espionage</b> reasons, or simply to steal money - because the lack of international agreements allows them to operate swiftly and mostly with impunity. Protecting data and systems against cyber-attack has so far been about dousing the flames, although recently the focus has been shifting towards more assertive self-protection...|$|R

[...] Responding to Mosher's testimony, Rohrabacher argued, [...] "It appears as though Beijing is able to expand its campaign against academic freedom from China to America when U.S. universities value Chinese favors and money more than truth and integrity." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{identify}} threats to power substation controllers and SCADA systems, and discuss mitigating mechanisms to reduce vulnerability to malicious electronic intrusions. The U. S. National Institute of Standards and Technology lists nine threats to computer-related commerce in North America. Six of those threats are particularly pertinent to SCADA systems, {{and at least}} four are relevant to power substation controllers. Increasing reliance on automated control systems with remote access (via phone or internet) and the growing global economy have expanded the number of potential attackers with access to substation controllers and SCADA systems, and therefore magnified the risk electric utilities have from sabotage and espionage. It is estimated that <b>industrial</b> and foreign <b>espionage</b> in North America has increased over 260 % in the last decade, {{and it has been}} acknowledged by the U. S. government that other countries have nationally sponsored information warfare efforts targeted against North American commerce. The utilities industry needs to be aware of these threats to their systems and take steps to reduce risk and mitigate vulnerabilities. Protective relay developers and auxiliary service providers should use mechanisms that minimize the likelihood that persons with hostile intent can degrade or destroy commercial power systems. Product, project, and corporate-wide security policies are tools to identify vulnerabilities, assess risk, and implement mitigating mechanisms. Many of the risks involving networked controllers and SCADA systems are similar to those affecting traditional networked-based computer systems. Hence, implementations of security policies for substation controllers and SCADA systems can draw from lessons learned in commercial net [...] ...|$|R
