50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1968, the Apollo program hit another snag: the first pilot-rated Lunar Module (LM) was not ready for orbital tests {{in time for a}} December 1968 launch. NASA {{planners}} overcame this challenge by changing the mission <b>flight</b> <b>order,</b> delaying the first LM flight until March 1969, and sending Apollo 8 into lunar orbit without the LM in December. This mission was in part motivated by intelligence rumors the Soviet Union might be ready for a piloted Zond flight during late 1968. In September 1968, Zond 5 made a circumlunar flight with tortoises on board and returned to Earth, accomplishing the first successful water landing of the Soviet space program in the Indian Ocean. It also scared NASA planners, as it took them several days to figure out that it was only an automated flight, not piloted, because voice recordings were transmitted from the craft en route to the Moon. On November 10, 1968 another automated test flight, Zond 6 was launched, but this time encountered difficulties in its Earth reentry, and depressurized and deployed its parachute too early, causing it to crash-land only 16 km from where it had been launched six days earlier. It turned out there was no chance of a piloted Soviet circumlunar flight during 1968, due to the unreliability of the Zonds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. 1. A {{sequence}} of population estimates fortwo now-extinct populations of Euphydryas editha bayensis is presented. After removing biased sampling days, estimates of demographic parameters from the long-term data {{were used to}} test five hypotheses built from studies of shorter duration. Such tests of short-term conclusions are rare. 2. The long-term demographic parameters include sex ratio, mortality, dispersal, mean flight date, and duration of flight season. The two populations differed with respect to sex ratio and mean flight date, and sexes differed with respect to mortality and dispersal. 3. Three of the five hypotheses were supported directly or indirectly by patterns in the parameters. These hypotheses predict that dynamics are asynchronous over the long term, that larval mortality, not adult abundance and mortality, is the primary determinant of changes in population size, and that topography mediates larval mortality. 4. Two hypotheses were not supported or supported only in part. Flight phenology differed between the study populations as predicted, but <b>flight</b> <b>order</b> was opposite that expected from the topographic composition of each habitat. Variability in sex ratio and the occurrence of female-biased ratios in the habitat {{of one of the}} populations also suggest that previous observations of sex ratio are not generalisable. 5. Populations were extremely volatile over the study period. Removal of biased sampling days did not change basic trends or fluctuations in the data. This volatility suggests that E. editha populations residing in similar habitats may risk immediate extinction. Key words.

Methodology presents structured Lithuanian language templates for specifying SBVR business vocabularies and business rules with intention to implement them in a database. For this purpose SBVR Structured English templates were supplemented with detail templates for data formats, derivation rules and other elements. Metatables were proposed for keeping names for fact types and roles. The suitability of the templates were verified by describing and implementing an experimental <b>flight</b> <b>ordering</b> system. Various types of business rules related with <b>ordering</b> <b>flights</b> were implemented by SQL triggers and procedures...|$|R
