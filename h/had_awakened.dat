25|$|Several {{contemporary}} popular traditions {{also exist}} regarding Bodhidharma's origins. An Indian tradition regards Bodhidharma {{to be the}} third son of a Pallava king from Kanchipuram. This {{is consistent with the}} Southeast Asian traditions which also describe Bodhidharma as a former South Indian Tamil prince who <b>had</b> <b>awakened</b> his kundalini and renounced royal life to become a monk. The Tibetan version similarly characterises him as a dark-skinned siddha from South India. Conversely, the Japanese tradition generally regards Bodhidharma as Persian.|$|E
500|$|In June 1956, {{there was}} an insurrection in Poznań. The workers rioted to protest {{shortages}} of food and consumer goods, bad housing, decline in real income, trade relations with the Soviet Union and poor management of the economy. The Polish government initially responded by branding the rioters [...] "provocateurs, counterrevolutionaries and imperialist agents". Between 57 and 78 peoplemostly protesterswere killed, and hundreds were wounded and arrested. Soon, however, the party hierarchy recognized that the riots <b>had</b> <b>awakened</b> a nationalist movement and reversed their opinion. Wages were raised by 50 percent, and economic and political change was promised.|$|E

500|$|Some in {{the feminist}} {{movement}} saw Plath as speaking for their experience, as a [...] "symbol of blighted female genius." [...] Writer Honor Moore describes Ariel as marking {{the beginning of a}} movement, Plath suddenly visible as [...] "a woman on paper", certain and audacious. Moore says: [...] "When Sylvia Plath’s Ariel was published in the United States in 1966, American women noticed. Not only women who ordinarily read poems, but housewives and mothers whose ambitions <b>had</b> <b>awakened</b> [...] Here was a woman, superbly trained in her craft, whose final poems uncompromisingly charted female rage, ambivalence, and grief, in a voice with which many women identified." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{influence}} of the Haymarket affair {{was not limited to}} the celebration of May Day. Emma Goldman, the activist and political theorist, was attracted to anarchism after reading about the incident and the executions, which she later described as [...] "the events that had inspired my spiritual birth and growth." [...] She considered the Haymarket martyrs to be [...] "the most decisive influence in my existence". Her associate, Alexander Berkman also described the Haymarket anarchists as [...] "a potent and vital inspiration." [...] Others whose commitment to anarchism, or revolutionary socialism, crystallized {{as a result of the}} Haymarket affair included Voltairine de Cleyre and [...] "Big Bill" [...] Haywood, a founding member of the Industrial Workers of the World. Goldman wrote to historian Max Nettlau that the Haymarket affair <b>had</b> <b>awakened</b> the social consciousness of [...] "hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people".|$|E
500|$|Bottomley's {{association}} with Bradlaugh <b>had</b> <b>awakened</b> his interests in publishing and politics, and in 1884 he launched his first entrepreneurial venture, a magazine called the Hackney Hansard. This journal recorded {{the business of}} Hackney's local [...] "parliament"—essentially a debating society that mirrored the proceedings at Westminster. Advertisements from local tradesmen kept the paper mildly profitable. Bottomley produced a sister-paper, the Battersea Hansard, covering that borough's local parliament, before merging the two into The Debater. In 1885 he formed the Catherine Street Publishing Association and, using borrowed capital, acquired or started several magazines and papers. These included, among others, the Municipal Review, a prestigious local government publication; Youth, a boy's paper on which Alfred Harmondsworth, the future press magnate Lord Northcliffe, worked as a sub-editor; and the Financial Times. The last-named {{was set up to}} rival the Financial News, London's first specialist business paper, which had been started in 1884 by Harry Marks, a former sewing-machine salesman. In 1886 Bottomley's company acquired its own printing works through a merger with the printing firm of MacRae and Co., and after the absorption of another advertising and printing firm, became MacRae, Curtice and Company.|$|E

2500|$|After her death, several poems {{appeared}} in the Guatemalan press as a posthumous tribute, where the authors confess the admiration that she <b>had</b> <b>awakened</b> in them. José María Izaguirre, for example, proposed to strengthen the myth of death for love: [...] "When Martí returned with Carmen he {{did not return to}} the general's house, for the feeling was deeply rooted in María's soul, and she was of those that easily forget. Her passion was locked in this dilemma: be satisfied, or die. Unable to get the first, he had only the second option left. Indeed, her nature was declining gradually, a continuous sigh consumed, and despite the care of the family and the efforts of science, after staying a few days in bed without uttering a complaint, her life extinguished like the scent of a lily [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Hume {{has proved}} {{extremely}} influential on subsequent Western thought, especially on utilitarianism, logical positivism, William James, Immanuel Kant, {{the philosophy of}} science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive science, theology, and other movements and thinkers. Kant himself credited Hume as the spur to his philosophical thought who <b>had</b> <b>awakened</b> him from his [...] "dogmatic slumbers". Contemporary philosophers have opined that [...] "Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design", that [...] "No man has influenced the history of philosophy to a deeper or more disturbing degree", and that Hume's Treatise is [...] "the founding document of Cognitive Science" [...] {{and one of the}} most important philosophical works written in English. Arthur Schopenhauer once declared that [...] "there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of Hegel, Herbart and Schleiermacher taken together." [...] Hume is thus widely regarded as a pivotal figure in the history of philosophical thought.|$|E
2500|$|By 1922, renewed {{activity}} under Reverend George Neal saw {{a committee}} established {{to build the}} new church. A large meeting chaired by Archbishop Sharp was held in July to consider whether a new church should be built in timber or brick. The committee emphasised the need to act as soon as possible, as the present building was inadequate for its needs. The vote for a brick church was [...] "practically unanimous". St Paul's attained the status of parish in 1923 and in June 1923 the Corporation of the Synod of the Diocese of Brisbane formally acquired a new site for St Paul's {{on the corner of}} Vulture Street and Balmoral Terrace. The elevated site, [...] "nearer the tramline and in a more conspicuous position", was consciously chosen to enhance the prominence of the church within the suburb. At a fundraising event in November, Canon Francis de Witt Batty commended the decision to bring St Paul's Church out of [...] "comparative obscurity into the light of day", while also noting [...] "Brisbane <b>had</b> <b>awakened</b> at last to its duty in the matter of church building".|$|E

2500|$|A younger {{version of}} Jean, {{alongside}} teenage versions of Scott and Ororo, appears in [...] Now blue-eyed with long, loosely curled orange hair, this new variation of Jean had been located and enrolled sometime {{prior to the}} movie, as she, now in her mid-teens, is introduced as already being a student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. When Alex Summers brings his younger brother to the school after his own optic laser blasts powers had manifested, Scott bumped into Jean, as he couldn't see due to being blindfolded. [...] Jean drops the many books, binders, and papers she held, but instantly we watch as this new incarnation of Jean telekinetically pulls them back into her hands, exhibiting seemingly little effort, which seems {{to imply that the}} Professor has left her mind unbarred. She gets mad at this, but apologizes as Scott explains he can't exactly look where he's going. Later, Jean is studying by a tree when Scott attempts to talk to her. Seeing the other students show fear, Jean explains that they're afraid of her because they are aware of her full powers, and therefore is treated as an outcast. Jean is affected by the energy wave released by an ancient, god-like mutant who <b>had</b> <b>awakened</b> that day. This causes Jean to have a nightmare of the world ending during which the entire school shakes, most of the students are awoken from sleep, and the Professor hurries to her room to find [...] that her telekinetic powers, already immensely strong, are quite literally burning the walls of her room. Telepathically reaching into Jean's mind to awaken her - an act that causes Charles a sizeable amount of pain - the wooden walls cease to burn and to emit smoke, and the Professor slumps back, substantially exhausted now. The powerful young psychic is reassured by Xavier that she is not losing control of her powers, despite her doubts. When the mansion is destroyed, she comforts Scott over the loss of his own brother and conceals herself, Scott, and Nightcrawler from Stryker's men. While in Stryker's base, she connects with Weapon X (Wolverine), and releases him from his cell. Before he, fearfully, leaves the complex Jean restores the few remaining memories of his that she can. She then joins the fight in Cairo. She telekinetically protects the group from Angel's metal wings. After Xavier is saved, he mentally links with her and reveals to Apocalypse that he is not the most powerful psychic, and convinces Jean to unleash the full extent of her powers. Her eyes glowing with an orangey-golden light, the powerful young Mutant's walks through midair and within a matter of seconds, a massive burst of telekinetic energy explodes outward from within Jean's body, almost instantaneously taking the shape of a great, fiery bird. With a single powerful scream that is as much verbal as it is mental, Jean Grey incinerates Apocalypse and helps to psychically restore and revive Professor Xavier. She is last seen helping to re-build the mansion, alongside Erik Lensherr, before joining Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler, Quicksilver, under the leadership of Hank and Raven, to become the new official team of X-Men and preparing to test her powers in her very first Danger Room session against a group of Mark I Sentinels.|$|E
