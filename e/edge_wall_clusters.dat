40|$|Supersonic flow over {{cavities}} {{has been}} of interest since 1960 s because cavities represent the bomb bays of aircraft. The flow is transient, turbulent, and complicated. Pressure fluctuations inside the cavity can impede successful weapon release. The objective {{of this study is}} to use active and passive control methods on supersonic cavity flow numerically to decrease or eliminate pressure oscillations. Jet blowing at several locations on the front and aft walls of the cavity configuration is used as an active control method. Several techniques are used for passive control including using a cover plate to separate the flow dynamics inside and outside of the cavity, trailing <b>edge</b> <b>wall</b> modifications, such as inclination of the trailing edge, and providing curvature to the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>wall.</b> The results of active and passive control techniques are compared with the baseline case in terms of pressure fluctuations, sound pressure levels at the leading <b>edge,</b> trailing <b>edge</b> <b>walls,</b> and cavity floor and in terms of formation of the flow structures and the results are presented. It is observed from the results that modification of the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>wall</b> is the most effective of the control methods tested leading to up to 40 [*]dB reductions in cavity tones...|$|R

The amplitudes of each tone were approximately equal at each measurement location in the cavity.

40|$|This study evaluates a novel {{measurement}} method of determining vascular wall strain and wall shear rate, which are interrelated physiologic parameters fundamentally important in vascular disease. Wall strains during vascular wall dilation were performed using ultrasound 2 D speckle tracking; vascular <b>wall</b> <b>edges</b> and vascular <b>wall</b> shear rate were determined using decorrelation based velocity {{measurement method}} for in-vitro and in-vivo flow measurement. These experiments and measurements {{were performed to}} investigate both the novel measurement methods {{as well as the}} relationship between the vascular wall shear rate and vascular wall dilation. First, this study measures arterial wall strains using the ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) signals. Strains in the arterial wall during arterial dilation (from diastole to systole) were determined using a 2 D speckle tracking algorithm. These ultrasound results were compared with measurements of arterial strain as determined by finite-element analysis (FEA) models with and without the effects from surrounding tissue, which was represented by homogenous material with fixed elastic modulus. Under pressure equalization, the strain levels predicted by FEA model without surrounding tissue were considerably greater than the strain levels measured by both ultrasound and the FEA model with surrounding tissue. Second, this research aims to measure <b>wall</b> <b>edges</b> and <b>wall</b> shear rate for in-vitro flow experiment using decorrelation ultrasound based velocity measurement. The flow velocity was obtained by multiplying the speckle movement in two consecutive frames by the acoustic frame rate. The <b>wall</b> <b>edge</b> was determined using B-mode images and 2 nd order gradient of flow velocity profiles. The wall shear rate was measured at the <b>wall</b> <b>edge</b> and evaluated by comparison with velocity gradients from parabolic flow velocity profile based on Poiseuille theory. Third, this research measures the vascular wall shear rate in the brachial artery for healthy and renal disease subjects using the decorrelation based ultrasound velocity measurement. The vascular wall shear rate and vascular diameter pre-, during- and post-vascular occlusion with pressure cuffs were compared for the healthy and renal disease subjects at top and bottom <b>wall</b> <b>edges.</b> The mean vascular wall shear rate change between pre- and post-vascular occlusion was significantly different for the healthy versus renal disease subjects...|$|R
