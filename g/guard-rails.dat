25|$|The section between Humber River and Jameson Avenue was {{completed}} in 1958. The expressway, by then named the Gardiner Expressway, was officially opened by Gardiner and Ontario Premier Leslie Frost on August 8, 1958. When this section opened, it opened without <b>guard-rails</b> on the median dividing the different directions. Steel <b>guard-rails</b> and a 'glare shield' were approved for this section in 1965 {{at a cost of}} $200,000.|$|E

25|$|Although Hulme {{would claim}} {{third place in}} the 1970 Mexican Grand Prix, the race was marred by the immense crowd of over 200,000. The crowd proved almost {{uncontrollable}} and almost forced the cancellation of the race. They were crammed {{in front of the}} <b>guard-rails,</b> sat at the trackside and ran across the track itself. The drivers were concerned that someone would be killed. During qualifying Hulme missed some children by inches. They were playing a game of chicken to see who got nearest to the cars as they hurtled past.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I could jest kick {{my little}} sawed-off self," [...] said Poney, as [...] .007 was backed, with a bang, on to a grim and grimy car like a caboose, but full of tools--a flatcar and a derrick behind it. [...] "Some folks are one thing, {{and some are}} another; but you're in luck, kid. They push a wrecking-car. Now, don't get rattled. Your wheel-base will keep you on the track, and there ain't any curves worth mentionin'. Oh, say! Comanche told me there's one section o' sawedged track that's liable to jounce ye a little. Fifteen an' a half out, after the grade at Jackson's crossin'. You'll know it by a {{farmhouse}} an' a windmill an' five maples in the dooryard. Windmill's west o' the maples. An' there's an eighty-foot iron bridge in the middle o' that section with no <b>guard-rails.</b> See you later. Luck!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hauksbee began reading. I {{have said}} the batch was rather important. That is quite {{enough for you to}} know. It {{referred}} to some correspondence, two measures, a peremptory order to a native chief and two dozen other things. Mrs. Hauksbee gasped as she read, for the first glimpse of the naked machinery of the Great Indian Government, stripped of its casings, and lacquer, and paint, and <b>guard-rails,</b> impresses even the most stupid man. And Mrs. Hauksbee was a clever woman. She was a little afraid at first, and felt as if she had laid hold of a lightning-flash by the tail, and did not quite {{know what to do with}} it. There were remarks and initials at the side of the papers; and some of the remarks were rather more severe than the papers. The initials belonged to men who are all dead or gone now; but they were great in their day.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said. Her tone betrayed {{always a}} shade of anxiety, {{as though she}} were never certain how a {{conversation}} with him would end. She leaned on the <b>guard-rail</b> by his side.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} the driver ceased {{speaking}} the engine {{was on its way}} out of the building, and Seth, swaying to and fro, clung for dear life to the <b>guard-rail,</b> as the mighty machine was drawn swiftly over the pavement.|$|R
60|$|Jacob Welse {{closed the}} door, tilted his chair back, and cocked {{his feet on}} the <b>guard-rail</b> of the stove. For one half-minute a girlish vision wavered in the shimmering air above the stove, then merged into a woman of fair Saxon type.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{pass over}} the revolutionary Socialists, who, I admit, if they feel inclined, are {{justified}} in throwing away their votes on Saturday next, and I come to the Labour and to the Trade Union element in our midst. There I {{have one or two}} words to say of rather a straight character, if you don't object, and which, I hope, will be taken in good part, and will be studied and examined seriously. Labour in Britain is not Socialism. It is quite true that the Socialistic element has imposed a complexion on Labour, rather against its will, and is now supported in its action by funds almost entirely supplied by Trade Unions. But Trade Unions are not Socialistic. They are undoubtedly individualist organisations, more in the character of the old Guilds, and lean much more {{in the direction of the}} culture of the individual than in that of the smooth and bloodless uniformity of the mass. Now, the Trade Unions are the most respectable and the most powerful element in the labour world. They are the social bulwarks of our industrial system. They are the necessary <b>guard-rails</b> of a highly competitive machine, and I have the right, as a member of his Majesty's Government, to speak with good confidence to Trade Unionists, because we have done more for Trade Unionists than any other Government that has ever been.|$|E

The initials belonged to men who are all dead or gone now; but they were great in their day. Mrs. Hauksbee read on and thought calmly as she read. Then the value of her trove struck her, and she cast about for the best method of using it. Then Tarrion dropped in, and they read through all the papers together, and Tarrion, not knowing how she had come by them, vowed that Mrs. Hauksbee was the greatest woman on earth. Which I believe was true, or nearly so.|$|E

5000|$|Other cities used in filming {{included}} New York City, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, Thailand, Bangkok and Shangirey. Cimino said {{he often}} liked to shoot in different cities, with interiors in one city and exteriors in another. In one scene, Joey Tai {{and his lawyer}} walk through a Chinese textile mill, past a <b>guard-rail</b> and into a shoddy apartment building {{to meet up with}} two of his assassins. The textile mill was in Bangkok, the <b>guard-rail</b> was in New York and the apartment building was in Wilmington. When one of the script supervisors commented that the scene [...] "wouldn't cut" [...] (edit seamlessly together), Cimino bet her $1,000 that it would. Upon seeing the cut, the script supervisor conceded and Cimino won the bet but refused to take the $1,000.|$|R
2500|$|There were {{concerns}} about the promptness of Bandini's rescue.

5000|$|While pushing {{hard to make}} up time, Senna had a huge {{accident}} at the extremely fast Signes corner {{at the end of}} the long Mistral straight when his Lotus's Renault engine blew up, slipped on his own oil that was leaking onto the rear tyres, spun backwards at extremely high speed and went into the catch fencing and the Armco <b>guard-rails.</b> He emerged unscathed albeit a few bruises.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} the thing," [...] {{he said to}} Jake. [...] "The <b>guard-rail's</b> heavy and I watched the smith make the clamps we fixed it with. One claw went over the rail, the other under the flange of the metal that formed the track, and sudden pressure would jamb the guard down. Then, not long before the accident, I hardened up the clamp." ...|$|R

60|$|The engine snorted, {{the wheels}} ground through the {{fragments}} of concrete scattered about the line, and the big dark mass rolled slowly forward. It seemed to Dick to be going farther than it ought, but he had ascertained that the <b>guard-rail</b> was securely fastened. As he watched {{the front of the}} truck, Jake, who stood a few feet to one side, leaned out and seized his shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Concerns {{regarding}} the bridge's safety were raised when Chinese media {{reported that the}} bridge was opened with faulty elements, such as incomplete crash-barriers, missing lighting, and loose nuts on <b>guard-rails,</b> with workers stating {{that it would take}} two months before finishing all of the projects related to the bridge. Shao Xinpeng, the bridge's chief engineer, claimed that in spite of the safety report, the bridge was safe and ready for traffic, adding that the problems highlighted in the reports were not major.|$|E

50|$|Greenhill Avenue, {{from the}} east, was {{extended}} to the expressway. The area of the Greenhill interchange was a forested part of the valley, {{and is now a}} grassy area around the expressway and interchange. South of Greenhill, the expressway enters King's Forest park. The expressway stays along {{the east side of the}} valley, while on the west side is the King's Forest Golf Course. The expressway ascends the Niagara Escarpment along a viaduct, through a rock cut, to where it intersects and continues as the Lincoln Alexander to the west.From the QEW to Greenhill Avenue, the highway is two lanes in either direction. From Greenhill to the Lincoln Alexander, the highway is three lanes southbound (uphill) and two lanes northbound (downhill). The northbound and southbound lanes are separated by <b>guard-rails</b> and a grass median.|$|E
60|$|It {{was brought}} {{by a big}} mulatto, and Dick held up the light. The last-fitted block of the ribbed course was split in two, {{and the one that}} had fallen was {{scattered}} about in massive broken lumps. Amidst these lay the <b>guard-rail,</b> and the front wheels of the truck hung across the gap above. There was other damage, and Dick frowned as he looked about.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{my hand on}} the {{throttle}} when I got the order to go ahead, and let her make a stroke or two, reckoning the <b>guard-rail</b> would snub up the car. I heard the wheels clip and slammed the link-gear over, because it looked as if she wasn't going to stop. When she reversed, the couplings held the car and the block slipped off." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{struggled}} violently, Lingard forcing Willems slowly {{towards the}} <b>guard-rail.</b> Under their feet the jetty {{sounded like a}} drum in the quiet night. On the shore end the native caretaker of the wharf watched the combat, squatting behind the safe shelter of some big cases. The next day he informed his friends, with calm satisfaction, that two drunken white men had fought on the jetty.|$|R
50|$|The rounded {{surface of}} round bales poses a {{challenge}} for long-haul, flat-bed transport, as they could roll off of the flat surface if not properly supported. This is particularly the case with large round bales; their size makes them difficult to flip, so {{it may not be}} feasible to flip many of them onto the flat surface for transport and then re-position them on the round surface at the destination. One option that works with both large and small round bales is to equip the flat-bed trailer with <b>guard-rails</b> at either end, which prevent bales from rolling either forward or backward. Another solution is the saddle wagon, which has closely spaced rounded saddles or support posts in which round bales sit. The tall sides of each saddle prevent the bales from rolling around while on the wagon, as the bale settles down in between posts. On 3 September 2010, on the A381 in Halwell near Totnes, Devon, UK an early member of British rock group ELO Mike Edwards was killed when his van was crushed by a large round bale. The cellist, 62, died instantly when the 600 kg bale fell from a tractor on nearby farmland before rolling onto the road and crushing his van.|$|E
5000|$|When Ken Tyrrell, the team's owner, became {{disenchanted with}} the poor {{performance}} of March chassis during the [...] season, he decided he would design and build his own car. He employed Derek Gardner to design it in secret at his own house. The project, codenamed [...] "SP" [...] which meant [...] "Special Project" [...] cost Tyrrell over £22,000 of his own money. The resulting car made its debut at Oulton Park at a non-championship race but retired; the car was introduced {{too late in the}} season to make any difference in the championship; it competed in the final 3 rounds of the season in North America. Jackie Stewart took pole in the Canadian Grand Prix but retired with axle failure while leading, Stewart led again in the United States Grand Prix when the car suffered an oil leak. The Mexican Grand Prix was delayed due to the large crowd of 200,000 proving difficult to control, almost forcing the cancellation of the race. They were crammed in front of the <b>guard-rails,</b> sat at the trackside and ran across the track itself. Despite impassioned appeals from Stewart and local hero Pedro Rodríguez they still remained troublesome. Stewart had suspension failure caused by running over a dog. Stewart took pole in the South African Grand Prix but finished 2nd to Mario Andretti's Ferrari, Stewart raced the Tyrrell 003 for the reminder of the season. Peter Revson drove the 001's final race in the United States Grand Prix but retired with clutch failure.|$|E
40|$|Situation {{awareness}} for vehicular {{safety and}} autonomy functions includes {{knowledge of the}} drivable area. This area is normally constrained between stationary road-side objects as <b>guard-rails,</b> curbs, ditches and vegetation. We consider these as extended objects modeled by polynomials along the road, and propose an algorithm to track each polynomial based on noisy range and bearing detections, typically from a radar. A straightforward Kalman filter formulation of the problem suffers from the errors-in-variables (EIV) problem in that the noise enters the system model. We propose an EIV modification of the Kalman filter and demonstrates its usefulness using radar data from public roads. SEFSCadic...|$|E

5000|$|Alfredo Pián (October 21, 1912 in Las Rosas [...] - [...] July 25, 1990) was {{a racing}} driver from Argentina.

60|$|Dick pondered. He {{believed}} Kenwardine {{really was}} surprised to hear he had nearly been crushed by the block; but the fellow was clever and had begun {{to talk about the}} accidents. He must do nothing to rouse his suspicions, and began a painstaking account of the matter, explaining that the <b>guard-rail</b> had got loose, but saying nothing about the clamps being tampered with. Indeed, the trouble he took about the explanation was in harmony with his character and his interest in his work, and presently Kenwardine looked bored.|$|R
