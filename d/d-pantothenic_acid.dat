40|$|AbstractThe {{capillary}} electrophoretic {{separation of}} six water-soluble vitamins (thiamine, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, <b>d-pantothenic</b> <b>acid,</b> pyridoxine and ascorbic acid) was studied. Four CE backgrounds electrolytes were optimized {{and the most}} suitable ones were applied for investigation of analytes in real samples (yeast, beer, syrups). Several extraction procedures were performed in order to extract vitamins from proteins and phosphate groups. The research showed {{that it is possible}} to minimize interference from the solution with a complex composition and overcome the problem of peak overlapping by exchanging separation BGEs. Moreover, the second order data generated by CE-DAD instrument and Chemstation software (Agilents Technologies) were used to check of the peak purity...|$|E
40|$|A {{competitive}} CZE {{method for}} quality control analysis of multivitamin preparations and veterinary products containing B-group vitamins was developed. Vitamins of interest are thiamine hydrochloride (B 1), {{thiamine monophosphate chloride}} (B 1 a), riboflavine (B 2), riboflavine- 5 ′monophosphate (B 2 a), nicotinamide (B 3), <b>d-pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> calcium salt (B 5), pyridoxine hydrochloride (B 6), folic acid (B 9), and 4 -aminobenzoic acid (B 10). These analytes were separated optimizing the experimental conditions in 20 [*]mM tetraborate buffer pH = 9. 2 as a BGE (background electrolyte), on a Beckman P/ACE System MDQ instrument, using uncoated fused silica capillary. The effective capillary length was of 49. 5 [*]cm, I. D. = 50 [*]μm, the applied voltage 20 [*]kV and the temperature 25 °C. Detection was performed by a diode array detector at 214 [*]nm for all vitamins except B 5 (190 [*]nm) and B 2 a (260 [*]nm). Separation time was about 9 [*]min. After experimental conditions optimization, the proposed method was validated. Precision of migration time and corrected peak area, linearity range, LOD and LOQ, accuracy (recovery), robustness, and ruggedness were evaluated for each analyte demonstrating the good reliability of the method. Analyses of the pharmaceutical real samples were performed and confirmed the versatility of this method...|$|E
40|$|The {{conformational}} analysis of <b>d-pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> using classical semiempirical methods {{has been carried}} out. The pantothenic acid molecule can exist in the neutral form (I) or in the ionised form (II) with a deprotonated negatively charged carboxyl group. The neutral molecule {{as well as the}} anion is highly flexible and has an ensemble of several allowed conformations rather than one or two unique conformations. The distribution of allowed conformations indicate that the β-alanine as well as the pantoic acid part of the molecule prefers partially folded conformations. The conformation of the former is greatly affected by the ionisation state of the carboxyl group whereas that of the latter is not. Possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in different allowed conformations has also been explored. A bifurcated hydrogen bond involving a carboxyl (or carboxylate) oxygen atom and a hydroxyl oxygen atom, as acceptors, and the amide nitrogen atom as the donor occurs frequently in both I and II. Amongst the two crystal structures containing pantothenic acid reported so far, the conformation of the molecule in l-lysine d-pantothenate lies in the allowed region and is stabilised by a bifurcated intramolecular hydrogen bond, whereas that in the calcium bromide salt falls in a disallowed region, presumably due to the requirement of tridentate metal coordination...|$|E
40|$|Silk fibroin (SF) from Bombyx mori {{has many}} {{established}} excellent properties and has found various {{applications in the}} biomedical field. However, some abilities or capacities of SF still need improving to meet the need for using practically. Indeed, diverse SF-based composite biomaterials have been developed. Here we report the feasibility of fabricating pantothenic acid (vitamin B 5, VB 5) -reinforcing SF nanofibrous matrices for biomedical applications through green electrospinning. Results demonstrated the successful loading of <b>D-pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> hemicalcium salt (VB 5 -hs) into resulting composite nanofibers. The introduction of VB 5 -hs did not alter the smooth ribbon-like morphology and the silk I structure of SF, but significantly decreased the mean width of SF fibers. SF conformation transformed into β-sheet from random coil when composite nanofibrous matrices were exposed to 75 % (v/v) ethanol vapor. Furthermore, nanofibers still remained good morphology after being soaked in water environment for five days. Interestingly, as-prepared composite nanofibrous matrices supported {{a higher level of}} cell viability, especially in a long culture period and significantly assisted skin cells to survive under oxidative stress compared with pure SF nanofibrous matrices. These findings provide a basis for further extending the application of SF in the biomedical field, especially in the personal skin-care field...|$|E
40|$|The Gram-positive {{bacterium}} Corynebacterium glutamicum is {{used for}} the production of amino acids, e. g. of L-glutamate and L-lysine. The aim of my work was to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of pantothenic acid of this organism, and to increase the formation of L-valine and <b>D-pantothenic</b> <b>acid</b> in order to enable a microbiological production of these compounds. The genes panB and panC were cloned, which encode the ketopantoatehydroxymethyltransferase and the pantothenatesynthetase. The two enzymes catalyze important steps of the bisosynthetic pathway of pantothenate. Sequence analysis revealed that panB comprises 813 bp and panC 837 bp. The genes are organized as an operon. Assays for the enzymes of the pathway have been developed. The pantothenatesynthetase has a specific activity of 1 nmol/(min x mg protein), the ketopantoatehydroxymethyltransferase one of 0. 14 nmol/(min x mg protein) and the aspartate-#alpha#-decarboxylase one of 0. 11 nmol/(min x mg protein). The quantitative analysis of the formation of pantothenic acid revealed that C. glutamicum accumulates 10 #mu#g/l pantothenic acid. A system to isolate mutants with an increased formation of pantothenate, which is based on a deficiency of pantothenic acid induced by #alpha#-ketobutyrate, has been estbalished. The application of this method led to the isolation of a mutant which accumulates 250 #mu#g/l pantothenate and 1. 4 g/l valine. Overexpression of the genes of the valine and isoleucine biosynthetic pathway (ilvBNCD), in combination with the deletion of the threonine dehydratase gene ilvA resulted in the construction of a strain which accumulates 11, 3 g/l valine and 190 mg/l pantothenate. Additional overexpression of panBC led to an accumulation of up to 1 g/l pantothenic acid. Thus an increase of the formation of pantothenic acid in C. glutamicum by the factor of 10 " 5 has been achieved. (orig.)
