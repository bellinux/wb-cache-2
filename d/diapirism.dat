50|$|The {{sources of}} salt glaciers are salt deposits. Over time sediments, rock and debris cover the deposit causing layers {{to build up}} over the salt. Due to its {{crystalline}} structure, salt remains at the same density while the sediment above begins to compress and become denser. The density contrast is the mechanism in which salt begins to rise. Diapirs rise and pierce the surface allowing the salt to flow because of gravity. Piercing the overburden is crucial for salt glaciers to form, and can occur in three ways. Active <b>diapirism</b> develops as the rising salt itself pushes and forces the overburden upward and sideways. Passive <b>diapirism</b> occurs when the salt always remains near the surface and the sediment builds up around it rather than over it. Reactive <b>diapirism</b> {{is the result of}} regional extension caused by rifting. The overburden becomes weak and thin which allows the salt body to travel upwards.|$|E
50|$|Rock types such as evaporitic salt deposits, and gas charged muds are {{potential}} sources of diapirs. Diapirs also form in the earth's mantle when a sufficient mass of hot, less dense magma assembles. <b>Diapirism</b> in the mantle {{is thought to be}} associated with the development of large igneous provinces and some mantle plumes.|$|E
50|$|The {{occurrence}} of incipient seafloor spreading {{in the basin}} is under controversy. Some researchers suggest {{that it does not}} occur within the basin because of the crustal thickness, magnetic anomaly patterns, and intracrustal <b>diapirism.</b> Other geoscientists suggest that it is occurring and is related to seamount volcanism and normal faulting within the basin.|$|E
50|$|Diapirs {{commonly}} intrude vertically upward along fractures or {{zones of}} structural weakness through denser overlying rocks because of density contrast between a less dense, lower rock mass and overlying denser rocks. The density contrast manifests {{as a force}} of buoyancy. The process is known as <b>diapirism.</b> The resulting structures are {{also referred to as}} piercement structures.|$|E
50|$|If the {{pressure}} within the salt body becomes sufficiently high {{it may be}} able to push through its overburden, this is known as forceful <b>diapirism.</b> Many salt diapirs may contain elements of both active and passive salt movement.

50|$|As {{with all}} large {{intrusive}} bodies, the {{method by which}} the batholith's plutons were emplaced {{is a matter of}} debate, due to the space problem of adding such large masses to the upper crust.

50|$|The {{morphology}} and {{topography of}} the slope that any turbidite channel crosses is inevitably {{going to affect the}} geometry of the channel.

50|$|A {{structure}} that plunges {{in all directions}} to form a circular or elongate structure is a dome. Domes may be created via <b>diapirism</b> from underlying magmatic intrusions or upwardly mobile, mechanically ductile material such as rock salt (salt dome) and shale (shale diapir) that cause deformations and uplift in the surface rock. The Richat Structure of the Sahara is considered a dome that has been laid bare by erosion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diapirism</b> {{involves}} the vertical displacement of a parcel of material through overlying strata {{in order to}} reach equilibrium within a system that has an established density gradient (see Rayleigh-Taylor instability). To reach equilibrium, parcels from a stratum composed of less-dense material will rise towards Earth's surface, creating formations that are most often expressed in cross-section as “tear drop”-shaped, where the rounded end is that closest {{to the surface of the}} overlying strata. If overlying strata are weak enough to deform as the parcel rises, a dome can form; in cases where the overlying strata are particularly devoid of resistance to applied stress, the diapir may penetrate through the strata altogether and erupt on the surface. Potential materials comprised by these less-dense strata include salt (which is highly incompressible, thus creating the structural instability that leads to <b>diapirism</b> when buried under deposited strata and subject to overlying stress) and partially melted migmatite (a metamorphic-texture rock frequently found in domes due to the typical involvement of heat and/or pressure with their formation).|$|E

50|$|The 2,000 m isobath follows more or {{less the}} course of the Garonne River and divides the basin into a {{relatively}} shallow northern platform, the so-called Aquitaine Plateau, and into a much deeper, tightly folded, southern region. The tabular platform in the north contains only a much reduced sedimentary succession that is gently undulating and occasionally faulted. The folding intensity in the southern region increases steadily towards the south, the structures being further complicated by superimposed salt <b>diapirism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Possible {{forces that}} drive {{the flow of}} salt are {{differential}} loading on the source layer and density contrasts in the overburdening sediment. Forces that resist this flow are {{the mass of the}} roof block and the block's inherent resistance to faulting, aka strength. To accommodate common density contrast between the overburden sediment and the salt, beginning active <b>diapirism,</b> the diapir height must be more than two-thirds to three-quarters the thickness of the overburden. If the diapir is narrow its height must be greater.|$|E
50|$|Behavior of thrust sheets is {{currently}} explained {{on the model}} of the orogenic wedge, which is dependent on the internal wedge taper θ. Gravitational sliding is movement generated by the movement down an inclined plane under the action of gravity. Gravitational spreading, possibly accompanied by an initial phase of <b>diapirism,</b> is generated by large heat flow that causes detachment in a hinterland. Other mechanisms, such as push from behind, action of tangential compressive forces, and shortening of the basement, are essentially variations of the previous mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{structures}} of active <b>diapirism</b> are a central crestal graben flanked by flaps that rotate upward and outward. Reverse faults can separate the flaps from the overburden. Normal faults create the crestal graben and propagate downward. New faults form farther outward as the dome arch becomes more intense. These structures occur {{beneath the surface}} and are not necessarily associated with the dome at the surface. Emergence of the dome will not occur unless the dome is very wide or tall relative to the overburden's thickness.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} Pliocene, the {{sedimentation}} was most rapid. The shale diapirs ( [...] see figure 5) grew into the section, {{which is generally}} thought {{to be caused by}} the rapid deposition and resultant increase in over pressuring.The generation of overpressure, which drives <b>diapirism,</b> are complicated and controlled by many factors and there are many debates. Some researchers think that the major factors are (1) high sedimentation rate (especially during Plio-Pleistocene); (2) high palaeogeothermal gradient; and (3) strike-slip tectonism along the offshore extension of the Red River Fault.|$|E
5000|$|Ludovic Mrazek (July 17, 1867 in Craiova - June 9, 1944 in Bucharest) was a Romanian {{geologist}} {{and member}} of the Romanian Academy. He introduced the term diapir that denotes a type of intrusion in which a more mobile and ductily deformable material is forced into brittle overlying rocks. The phenomenon of [...] "diapirism" [...] allows rock salt to provide an effective trap for hydrocarbon deposits. In this way, Ludovik Mrazek explained the distribution of hydrocarbon accumulations in the Neogene Carpathian. <b>Diapirism</b> is commonly used as a basic concept in geological survey as well as in Planetary science.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{lines of}} {{research}} have stressed {{the role of}} climate in inducing erosion that induces an isostatic compensation; fluvial and glacial erosion and incision during the Quaternary {{is thought to have}} contributed to the uplift of the mountain by forcing an isostatic response. The total amount of uplift produced by this mechanism could be as much as 500 m. Others geoscientists have implied <b>diapirism</b> in the asthenosphere as being the cause of uplift. One hypothesis claim that the early uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains could be indebted to changes in the density of the lithosphere and asthenosphere caused by the Iceland plume when Greenland and Scandinavia rifted apart about 53 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|The tectonic {{movements}} {{were much more}} complicated in the Southern Province, having superimposed on them very strong halokinetic motions (salt <b>diapirism).</b> A {{large part of the}} formed structures is concealed under Plio-Quaternary detritus. The many exploration wells drilled for hydrocarbons and groundwater helped immensely in unravelling these structures. Similar to the Northern Province, the major structures are again trains of parallel anticlines whose wavelength steadily diminishes approaching the Pyrenean front. Inversely the effects of the salt movements become stronger towards the south. The anticlines were formed during the uplift of the Pyrenees during the Eocene/Oligocene. The structures were set in place by Miocene times. The following anticlines can be distinguished (from north to south): ...|$|E
50|$|The tectonic {{structures}} in the Niger Delta Basin are very typical of an extensional rift system, but the added shale <b>diapirism</b> due to compression makes this basin different. The main method of deformation is due to gravitational collapse of the basin, although the older faulting and deformation in the basin {{are related to the}} continental breakup and rifting of the African plate and South American plates. The overall basin is divided into a few different zones due to its tectonic structure. There is an extensional zone, which lies on the continental shelf, that is caused by the thickened crust. There is a transition zone, and then there is a contraction zone, which lies in the deep sea part of the basin.|$|E
5000|$|The Mio-Pliocene Zone in the Ploiești {{region has}} been {{exploited}} for hydrocarbons and coal since the 19th Century. The zone extends from the flysch on the north to the Moesian Platform on the south. [...] The zone is marked by alternating deposits of Clay, Marl, Shale and Sand, conglomerate, Salt and Limestone. [...] Structural traps and stratigraphic traps are formed from Salt <b>Diapirism</b> which gave rise to anticline folds and faulting. [...] There are four major alignments of the anticlines, all parallel to the Carpathian Range. [...] Pliocene sands are the main oil and gas producers, in particular the Meotian (60%) and Dacian (29%), followed by the Miocene Sarmatian (5%) but some oil exists in Miocene Helvetian and Oligocene sandstones. [...] Major producing structures include Moreni-Gura Ocnitei, Baicoi-Tintea and Boldesti.|$|E
40|$|It {{is thought}} likely that thermal {{thinning}} and/or <b>diapirism</b> {{can cause the}} extensional stress required for rifting. The rifting, however, will not occur unless the regional tectonic regime permits {{the sides of the}} rift to diverge. Whereas passive plate extension could cause rifting in isolation, the extension and rifting are likely to be localized where the lithosphere is weakest over an existing thermal anomaly. In those cases where asthenospheric <b>diapirism</b> occurs, which is essentially a response to thinning of the lithosphere by thermal thinning or plate extension, the effects of <b>diapirism</b> may completely mask the initiating mechanism. It is believed that anomalous heat transfer into the lithosphere, <b>diapirism,</b> and magmatism must all figure in rifting, along with a deviatoric stress field that will permit extension in a developing rift. Even though the models are useful in permitting idealized processes to be quantified and tested, better knowledge of lithosphere properties is considered necessary, in particular knowledge of mantle viscosity and its temperature dependence...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{detailed}} {{interpretation of}} seismic data {{has been carried}} out to analyse salt <b>diapirism</b> in the Straits of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Salt diapirs in the Zagros Foldbelt are mainly characterized by structures formed by mobilization of the Cambrian Hormuz salt as reactive diapirs during the Late Cretaceous–Tertiary Zagros orogeny. Interpretation of available data in the straits of Hormuz suggests that diapirs of Hormuz salt grew actively until the Early Miocene and then continued to rise passively by downbuilding of surrounding sediments until the present time. The syn- to post-Miocene Zagros sedimentation {{played a major role in}} passive <b>diapirism.</b> Sedimenta-tion of the thick Lower Miocene deposits led to greater subsidence of the basin and passive <b>diapirism</b> of the Early Miocene Fars salt as well as further inflation of the Hormuz salt into neighbouring structures.

40|$|International audienceThe Pénestin section (southern Brittany) {{presents}} large regular undulations, commonly {{interpreted as}} evidence of periglacial pingos. It is an upper Neogene palaeoestuary of the Vilaine River reactivated during the middle Quaternary (middle terrace). It is incised into a thick kaolinitic saprolite and deformed by saprolite diapirs. This paper presents the arguments leading to a mechanistic interpretation of the deformations at Pénestin. Neither recent transpressive tectonics nor diagnostic evidence of periglacial pingo have been found despite evidence for a late paleo-permafrost. The major deformational process is shale <b>diapirism,</b> initially triggered by co-seismic water supply, with further loading and lateral spreading on an already deformed and deeply weathered basement, which allowed the shale <b>diapirism</b> to develop. Deformations are favoured by the liquefaction of the saprolite and a seaward mass movement and recorded, rather distant, effects of an earthquake (c. 280 ka B. P.) resulting from the progressive subsidence of the southern Armorican margin. These deformations triggered by an earthquake {{are similar to those}} induced by classical shale <b>diapirism.</b> They are probably common in tectonically active continental environments with shallow water tabl...|$|E
40|$|Mud <b>diapirism</b> has {{recently}} been recognized in several modern accretionary wedges. It provides an important means of dewatering accretionary wedges and {{should be regarded as}} an important process for producing the melanges found in both modern and ancient accretionary terranes. Mud <b>diapirism</b> affects a large area of the Barbados Ridge Accretionary Complex. The distribution of the mud diapirs appears to be primarily controlled by the presence of underconsolidated terrigenous submarine fan deposits that are being accreted to the complex. The frequency of diapir occurrence decreases northward as the fan becomes thinner. Mud diapirs are absent from the very eastern most part of the complex formed from sediments accreted at its toe, {{with the exception of a}} few mud volcanoes on the ocean floor in front of the complex. The initiation of <b>diapirism</b> appears to be spatially coincident with the onset of subcretion, or underplating, of sediment to the base of the complex at a ramp between two levels of decollement. It is proposed that the release of mud and pore water from the subcreted sediments is a direct or indirect cause of most of the mud <b>diapirism</b> in the accretionary complex. There is a range of diapiric form dependent on the viscosity of the mud, from mud volcanoes fed by low viscosity mud, to higher viscosity mud ridges. The diapirs in the eastern areas of the complex are generally mud volcanoes with narrow conduits feeding a surface mound. Mud ridges are prominent in the western parts of the complex. This is interpreted as reflecting a general westward decrease in the fluid content of the accretionary complex. Bottom-simulating seismic reflectors formed by gas hydrate are commonly developed in the areas of mud volcano occurrences. The presence of the hydrate indicates that large volumes of methane are being generated at depth in these regions. The generation of methane may be contributing to zones of overpressuring in the wedge. Methane may also be partly responsible for driving the diapiric material to the surface to form mud volcanoes. Ridges in the subducting oceanic crust beneath the accretionary complex locally enhance <b>diapirism</b> above their crests and southern flanks. Faults formed later in the development of the complex are more commonly associated with <b>diapirism</b> than those resulting from accretion at the toe of the wedge. These later faults play an important role in controlling the sites of individual mud volcanoes, chains of mud volcanoes, and mud ridges...|$|E
