A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Gerlach opposed HR 2454, {{which was}} {{designed}} to amend several laws related to energy and the environment, and included a “cap-and-trade” program to limit greenhouse gas emissions. As Gerlach later explained, “While the bill included some positive provisions to develop alternative and renewable energy our country needs, I voted against this bill because of the devastating effect it will have on working families and the people who create jobs <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>district</b> and across Pennsylvania." [...] The League of Conservation Voters, “a national non-profit organization that works to turn environmental values into national priorities,” rated Gerlach at 44 percent on their National Environmental Scorecard. In his 2010 campaign, Gerlach received $41,250 from the Energy/Natural Resource sector.|$|E

40|$|Following {{the first}} report of Opisthorchis viverrini {{infection}} in a domestic duck <b>in</b> Phu <b>My</b> <b>District</b> of Binh Dinh Province, Central Vietnam, many other cases were observed in the province. We determined the infection rate and intensity of O. viverrini infection in ducks in 4 districts of the province. A total of 178 ducks {{were randomly selected from}} 34 farms for examination of flukes in the liver and gall bladder. An infection rate of 34. 3 % (range 20. 7 - 40. 4 % among districts) was found; the intensity of infection was 13. 8 worms per infected duck (range 1 - 100). These findings show the role of ducks as a host for O. viverrini, duck genotype, which is sympatric with the human O. viverrini genotype in this province. It also stresses the need for investigations on the zoonotic potential and the life cycle of this parasite...|$|R

40|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} was used to determine the sources of dietary nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) for shrimp during the rearing phase in extensive rice-shrimp ponds <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Xuyen and Gia Rai districts, Vietnam. Farm-made feed was added as a food source in shrimp ponds <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Xuyen <b>district,</b> and based on stable isotope analyses, was generally a poor dietary source. The commercial formulated feed used in Gia Rai also appeared to contribute little directly to the nutritional needs of the shrimp. In contrast, the natural biota in all ponds appeared to contribute substantially. In particular, biota from beam trawls and benthic organic matter were the most likely sources of nutrition <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Xuyen ponds, while benthic organic matter was the main source in Gia Rai ponds. d 15 N ratios in the natural biota <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Xuyen farms decreased over the growing season, suggesting increased N fixation {{in the case of the}} benthic organic matter reaching values as low as 1 鮠This suggests N-limitation in the ponds and that natural biota become increasingly dependent on N fixed by algae and/or other microorganisms.
