Capital punishment may be imposed in some jurisdictions for the most serious crimes. Physical or corporal punishment may be imposed such as whipping or caning, although these punishments are prohibited {{in much of the}} world. Individuals may be incarcerated in prison or jail in a variety of conditions depending on the jurisdiction. Confinement may be solitary. Length of incarceration may vary from a day to life. <b>Government</b> <b>supervision</b> may be imposed, including house arrest, and convicts may be required to conform to particularized guidelines as part of a parole or probation regimen.

40|$|Objective: Expose {{the weak}} loops in the Chinese medical {{insurance}} coverage and uncover hospitals' role of over-pricing hospitalized insured patients {{compared with those}} non-insured. Methods: A multi-linear regression method was used to analyze hospitalization expense for insured and uninsured patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, benign uterine tumors, and normal delivery. Results: Hospitalization cost is higher among insured than uninsured patients due to longer hospitalization lengths of stay, type of disease (highest among cholecystitis patients), type of gender - females, old-aged people, and type of marital status - singles, as well as drugs expenses, surgical expenses, and other medical acts. Conclusion: Require a better <b>government's</b> <b>supervision</b> system over medical insurance expenses such as reforming methods of payments, building up new cost compensation mechanism, and unifying and stabilizing prices for each category of medicines.

25|$|In 1974, {{after years}} of delays and legal proceedings, Continental started flights between Houston and Miami, and on May 21, 1976, Continental was {{authorized}} to operate long-sought routes between San Diego and Denver. President Jimmy Carter and Civil Aeronautics Board chairman Alfred Kahn had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry, which would dissolve the CAB {{and for the first}} time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without <b>government</b> <b>supervision</b> where they would fly, and how much they could charge. Continental began flights from Denver to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa/St. Petersburg in Florida. That year, President Carter authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between Air Micronesia destination Saipan and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via Honolulu, American Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979. After the 1978 passage of the Airline Deregulation Act Continental embarked on a route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to Houston and Denver, and from Denver to Phoenix. That month Continental started DC-10 flights between Los Angeles and Taipei, via Honolulu and Guam. Service between Houston and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979 Continental linked Denver with Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco and San Jose and also began Houston-Tampa service. The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide. Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, so flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental's post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, with the corresponding expansion of facilities at both of these airports. In Denver, Continental's rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new Denver International Airport, which would be completed almost fifteen years later.|$|E

2500|$|Arguing {{in favor}} of a Romanian {{communist}} society during the late 1940s, Pătrășcanu indicated a series of essential steps to this goal: after discarding all legislation passed by the Ion Antonescu regime and purging the administrative apparatus, a political amnesty was to be declared, all properties upwards of 50 hectares were to be confiscated, the National Bank passed into state property while trade unions came under <b>government</b> <b>supervision</b> and a new labour code was enforced, and civil liberties were enhanced. Ultimately, a new people's democratic government was to be imposed, removing all forms of antisemitism and chauvinism from public discourse and preserving good relations with the Soviet Union. Polemically, Pătrășcanu theorized that all these steps were [...] "democratic-bourgeois", and not socialist in their essence.|$|E

2500|$|During this time, European {{settlement}} accelerated, and in 1859 {{the number}} of Pākehā came to equal {{the number of}} Māori, at around 60,000 each. Settlers were keen to obtain land and some Māori were willing to sell, {{but there were also}} strong pressures to retain land - in particular from the Māori King Movement. Grey had to manage the demand for land for the settlers to farm and the commitments in the Treaty of Waitangi that the Māori chiefs retained full [...] "exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties." [...] The treaty also specifies that Māori will sell land only to the Crown. The potential for conflict between the Māori and settlers was exacerbated as the British authorities progressively eased restrictions on land sales after an agreement at the end of 1840 between the company and Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell, which provided for land purchases by the New Zealand Company from the Crown at a discount price, and a charter to buy and sell land under <b>government</b> <b>supervision.</b> Money raised by the government from sales to the company would be spent on assisting migration to New Zealand.

60|$|About {{the year}} 1720 it was {{generally}} acknowledged in Ireland {{that there was a}} want there of the small change, necessary in the transaction of petty dealings with shopkeepers and tradesmen. It has been indignantly denied by contemporary writers that this small change meant copper coins. They asserted that there was no lack of copper money, but that there was a great want of small silver. Be that as it may, the report that small change was wanting was sufficiently substantiated to the English government to warrant it to proceed to satisfy the want. In its dealings with Ireland, however, English governments appear to have consistently assumed that attitude which would most likely cause friction and arouse disturbance. In England coins for currency proceeded from a mint established under <b>government</b> <b>supervision.</b> In Scotland such a mint was specially provided for in the Act of Union.

However his proposals were discussed by the General Assembly only in 1899 due intentions from the Ministry of the Interior. However Márkus could manage to implement some corrections: few minor administrative cases (e.g. tax collection) were assigned to the lower-ranking committees and councils of the districts.
