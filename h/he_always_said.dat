25|$|Dink {{was one of}} Turkey's most {{prominent}} Armenian voices and, despite threats on his life, he refused to remain silent. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> his aim was to improve the difficult relationship between Turks and Armenians. Active in various democratic platforms and civil society organizations, Hrant Dink emphasized the need for democratization in Turkey {{and focused on the}} issues of free speech, minority rights, civic rights and issues pertaining to the Armenian community in Turkey. He was a very important peace activist. In his public speeches, which were often intensely emotional, he never refrained from using the word genocide when talking about the Armenian Genocide, a term fiercely rejected by Turkey.|$|E
500|$|Ian Ogilvy as Richard Marshall. Ogilvy {{had been}} a friend of Reeves since they were teenagers, and the actor had {{appeared}} {{in many of the}} director's amateur short films. Ogilvy had also starred in both of Reeves's two previous feature films, Revenge of the Blood Beast and The Sorcerers, and was the natural first choice for the role of Witchfinders heroic lead. Describing his working relationship with Reeves, Ogilvy noted that [...] "his mastery of the technical aspects was absolute", but added [...] "Mike never directed the actors. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> he knew nothing about acting, and preferred to leave it up to us." [...] Ogilvy enjoyed working with Price, finding him to be [...] "very funny, in a 'queeny' sort of way." ...|$|E
500|$|Truman {{had already}} {{emerged as a}} [...] "folk hero" [...] for his {{resistance}} to the evacuation efforts prior to his death. After his death, his friends and family, including his sister, Geraldine (Geri), reflected on his death. Geri commented, [...] "He was a very opinionated person." [...] Friend John Garrity added, [...] "The mountain and the lake were his life. If he'd left and then saw what the mountain did to his lake, it would have killed him anyway. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to die at Spirit Lake. He went {{the way he wanted}} to go." [...] Another friend, John Andersen, said, [...] "Harry's name and Harry's presence will always {{be a part of that}} (Spirit Lake).

2500|$|Internationally, France [...] "believed {{the war to}} be finished". Thus, by July 1940, Vichy was eagerly {{negotiating}} with the German authorities {{in an attempt to}} gain a place for France in the Third Reich's [...] "New Order". But [...] "Hitler never forgot the 1918 defeat. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> no." [...] Vichy's ambition was doomed from the start.|$|E
2500|$|The {{artist had}} {{demonstrated}} {{his ability to}} transfer his attraction to Parisian architecture to American urban and rural architecture. According to Boston Museum of Fine Arts curator Carol Troyen, [...] "Hopper really liked the way these houses, with their turrets and towers and porches and mansard roofs and ornament cast wonderful shadows. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that his favorite thing was painting sunlight {{on the side of}} a house." ...|$|E
2500|$|Green apologised post-fight {{and said}} [...] "I couldn't {{do a thing}} right". He also {{acknowledged}} Tarver by stating [...] "I'm not taking anything away from Antonio. <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> 42 (years of age) was just a number and he showed it tonight." [...] Tarver revealed that Green had hurt him twice during the fight, and stated that a rematch was a possibility. Tarver went on to thank Sydney [...] "for hosting this beautiful fight", and to Green he said [...] "You treated me with dignity and respect." ...|$|E

2500|$|One report quotes {{his widow}} saying {{soon after his}} death — [...] "only with slight exaggeration" [...] — that [...] "Harry was {{supporting}} 17 relatives, 14 associations, seven foundations, and 82 charities. Harry wasn't interested in saving money. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>said,</b> 'Money is for people,' so he gave it away." [...] Despite his success as a musician, he left little money and {{it was difficult to}} maintain the causes for which he raised more than $3 million {{in the last six years}} of his life. The Harry Chapin Foundation was the result.|$|E
2500|$|Elder's father {{moved to}} California and worked several jobs {{at once to}} support his family. He also {{attended}} night school to earn his GED. By his early forties he had saved enough to open his own café, which he successfully owned and operated near downtown Los Angeles for 30 years. On his radio show, Elder said about his father: [...] "A tougher life I have rarely come across. Yet he never hated, he was never bitter, he never condemned his circumstances, and <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> {{there are very few}} problems that cannot be solved through hard work." [...] Elder told a Reason interviewer in 1996 that his father was his role model: [...] "He was the hardest working man I've ever known.... He had a work ethic that was beyond belief." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Le Sage {{acknowledged}} {{that he was not}} the first one to propose such a theory, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that he was the first one who ever drew all consequences from the theory, even after coming into possession of Cramer's, Fatio's and Redeker's papers. For example, in his [...] "Lucrece Newtonien" [...] (1782) Le Sage did not mention any of his predecessors by name. He merely stated that it was [...] "likely" [...] such a simple idea had occurred to others previously, but if so, they had [...] "presented it in a vague and ill-assured fashion". He went on to ask rhetorically why none of these supposed predecessors (of whom he professes to have no definite knowledge) [...] "pushed these consequences to their conclusion and communicated their research". He suggested that the answer was that they had no clear view of the subject, had not firmly grasped the principles of the theory, had allowed themselves to be seduced by specious sophisms, had bowed to the authority of great names, or had [...] "lacked sufficient love of truth or courage of their convictions to abandon easy pleasures and exterior advantages in order to devote themselves to researches at the time difficult and little welcome.".|$|E

"Not," [...] she added, [...] "that {{it would}} make any difference, if I {{was sure of it}} myself. <b>He</b> has <b>always</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> would not try to control me in such a matter, and I think he would like you. I do like you very much myself, Mr. Hewson, but I don't think it would be right to say I loved you unless I could prove it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ribbentrop became Hitler's {{favourite}} foreign-policy adviser, {{partly by}} dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany, but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled that [...] "Ribbentrop didn't understand anything about foreign policy. His sole wish was to please Hitler". In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas, and then later presenting Hitler's ideas as his own – a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal National Socialist diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:When Hitler said 'Grey', Ribbentrop said 'Black, black, black'. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> it three times more, {{and he was always}} more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn't present: 'With Ribbentrop it is so easy, he is always so radical. Meanwhile, all the other people I have, they come here, they have problems, they are afraid, they think we should take care and then I have to blow them up, to get strong. And Ribbentrop was blowing up the whole day and I had to do nothing. I had to break – much better!' ...|$|E
2500|$|Cappon {{was known}} for his {{conservatism}} as a coach. [...] In 23 years at Princeton, the uniforms never changed, having small sewn-on numbers and no player names. [...] He considered a fast break as a lack of discipline and would not allow his players to shoot before five or ten passes had been completed. [...] In 1995, former Princeton player Selden Edwards wrote an article on Cappon's influence at Princeton. [...] Edwards, a junior varsity player in the Cappon era, wrote that [...] "Cappy was Princeton basketball to anyone even vaguely familiar with the teams of that era." [...] Edwards described Cappon's physical appearance this way: [...] "In 1959, the fall I arrived at Princeton, Cappy was in peak form, a character who knew he was a character. He was in his early sixties, and his body {{looked as if it had}} been sculpted in ice cream and left in the sun. He was bald, the skin on his face drooped, he had deep shadows under his eyes. His voice was gravelly, and he enunciated as if he had wads of Kleenex in his mouth. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>said</b> exactly what he meant, and his language was delightfully salty. Legend had it that he had been a great athlete at Michigan, but by the 1960s no one could imagine that. He was grumpily personable and totally without pretension." ...|$|E

If Jacob would show him such a plough as that, then he might marry Gretchen and welcome. That was what the Herr Mayor said.|$|R

Buijs {{had been a member}} of Het Legioen himself for 10 years and has an intense {{relationship}} with the fans at the club. His first season since his return was no success as Feyenoord finished on the seventh position in the Eredivisie and missed out on European football for the first time in many years. Buijs was often criticised in the media, but for the fans he is still one of the most popular players at the club.|$|R

Welsh tradition attributes to him a daughter named Morfydd. Thomas Malory sometimes spells his name Urience, which has led some (e.g. Alfred Tennyson) to identify him with King Rience.|$|R
