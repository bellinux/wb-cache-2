5|$|Along its path, Japhet dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused widespread river flooding. The rains occurred after an extended drought, although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage, notably around where the storm moved ashore. In two provinces <b>in</b> <b>Mozambique,</b> the cyclone {{damaged or destroyed}} 25,000houses, leaving at least 23,000people homeless. Flooding in Zambia caused rivers to rise <b>in</b> <b>Mozambique</b> several days after the storm's passage. There were 17deaths <b>in</b> <b>Mozambique.</b> Further inland, remnant rainfall destroyed a bridge and several houses in Zimbabwe, killing eight people.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Mozambique,</b> Domoina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} {{in the capital}} Maputo that accounted for 40% of the annual total. Floods in the country destroyed over 50small dams and left widespread crop damage just before the summer harvest. Later, the rains caused the worst flooding in over 20years in Swaziland, which damaged or destroyed more than 100bridges. Disrupted transport left areas isolated for several days. In South Africa, rainfall peaked at 950mm (37in), which flooded 29river basins, notably the Pongola River which altered its course after the storm. Flooding caused the Pongolapoort Dam to reach 87% of its capacity; when waters were released to maintain the structural integrity, additional flooding occurred <b>in</b> <b>Mozambique,</b> forcing thousands to evacuate. Throughout the region, Domoina caused widespread flooding that damaged houses, roads, and crops, leaving about $199million in damage. There were 242deaths in southeastern Africa.|$|E

5|$|After Delfina {{moved through}} Mozambique, the local Red Cross chapter {{provided}} shelter, water, and relief items to the affected residents. Residual flooding in northern Mozambique, compounded with lack of drinking water, caused a cholera outbreak that affected at least 400people. By January27, 12people {{had died from}} the disease. Flooding also caused a malaria outbreak that killed 45people in the country. Government officials deployed food to the affected areas by airplane and by road, after workers repaired damaged bridges.

5|$|Although {{helicopters}} {{were not}} used <b>in</b> <b>Mozambique</b> {{to the same extent}} as they were in Vietnam, the Alouette III was the most widely used, although the Puma was also used with great success.

In the transport role, the Portuguese Air Force used mainly the Nord Noratlas and the C-47. The Portuguese Navy also made extensive use of patrol boats, landing crafts, and inflatable Zodiacs.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, European {{colonialism}} in Africa {{had reached}} its height. Having {{lost control of}} the vast territory of Brazil in South America, the Portuguese began to focus on expanding their African outposts. This brought them into direct conflict with the British. Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest <b>in</b> <b>Mozambique</b> had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} <b>in</b> <b>Mozambique,</b> {{estimated at}} about $20million (1994USD). Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. There, 85% {{of the houses}} were destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5million people homeless. High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas without water, and significantly damaged crops, notably the cashew crop. The storm struck before the harvest, and lack of food resulted in 300deaths {{in the months after}} the storm. Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240deaths and injured thousands.

5|$|In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief {{efforts in the}} aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops {{in the midst of}} an ongoing food shortage. Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria <b>in</b> <b>Mozambique,</b> and 47people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600houses and killed eight people.

5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} <b>in</b> <b>Mozambique.</b> While most European communities in Africa {{at the time}} - {{with the possible exception}} of Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status and fears of FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages saw their Portuguese names changed after independence - Lourenço Marques to Maputo, Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E
