5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> used as a translation template. Differently from siRNA, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking the access of ribosomes for translation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2015, Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council {{purchased}} the stadium {{in order to prevent}} <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> demolished and redeveloped. After a plea from fans to safeguard the stadium, an emergency council meeting was held and the stadium was purchased for £2 million. It is currently leased back to the football club.|$|E
5|$|Juno was {{originally}} considered a planet, along with 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, and 4 Vesta. In 1811, Schröter estimated Juno {{to be as}} large as 2290km in diameter. All four were reclassified as asteroids as additional asteroids were discovered. Juno's small size and irregular shape preclude <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> designated a dwarf planet.|$|E

5|$|On 26 February, three {{military}} veteran congressmen (Duncan D. Hunter, Tom Rooney, and Tim Murphy) {{introduced legislation}} in the House of Representatives to reduce the precedence of the medal, by banning <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> rated equal to, or above, the Purple Heart. At {{the time of the}} medal's cancellation, that bill had gained 124 cosponsors, while a corresponding bill introduced in the Senate on 6 March had gained 31 cosponsors.|$|E
5|$|Surface level {{humidity}} is {{less than}} 0.1%. Venus's sulfuric acid rain never reaches the ground, but is evaporated by the heat before reaching the surface in a phenomenon known as virga. It is theorized that early volcanic activity released sulfur into the atmosphere and the high temperatures prevented <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> trapped into solid compounds on the surface as {{it was on the}} Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment {{consisted}} of nine companies—four from Maryland and five from Virginia. The two-state {{composition of the}} new unit precluded <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> managed through a single state government, and it was therefore directly responsible to national authority as an Extra Continental regiment.|$|E

5|$|The pub {{also has}} a lawned pub garden {{to the north and}} a car park to the south. The car park has a {{covenant}} that prevents <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> built upon, with underground channels, cables and pipes, and an adjacent substation. A well is also located in the rear yard of the pub, one of a number in the immediate area.|$|E
5|$|When France {{surrendered}} on 22 June, {{two ships}} were in French Algeria, one was refitting in Toulon {{and the last}} ship was in England. During Operation Catapult in July, {{an attack on the}} Vichy Fleet intended to prevent <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> turned over to the Germans, the British seized the ship in England, but failed to prevent the two in Mers-el-Kébir from escaping to Toulon when they attacked the port.|$|E

5|$|Buck makes a {{rough landing}} after the drop and fights through Covenant forces to find Dare. He finds Romeo instead, {{and the two}} resolve to find the others {{and get out of}} the city. Dutch drops near a nature {{preserve}} and helps Marines fighting there. Mickey commandeers a tank and fights his way along a Mombasa boulevard. Meeting up with Dutch, the two defend an ONI base from the Covenant, destroying the facility to keep <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> captured. They are evacuated by a transport and make contact with Buck, arranging a rendezvous at police headquarters, but are shot down. Buck and Romeo rescue Dutch and Mickey, but Romeo is seriously wounded. The squad hijacks a Covenant dropship, but instead of leaving the city, Buck decides to have them turn back and find Dare.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Howard Hughes hired Hawks {{to direct}} Scarface, a gangster film {{loosely based on}} the life of Chicago mobster Al Capone. The film starred Paul Muni in the title role, with memorable {{supporting}} performances from George Raft, Boris Karloff, and Osgood Perkins. The film was completed in September 1931, but the censorship of the Hays Code prevented <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> released as Hawks and Hughes had originally intended. The two men fought, negotiated and made compromises with the Hays Office for over a year, until the film was eventually released in 1932, after such other pivotal early gangster films as The Public Enemy and Little Caesar. Scarface was the first film in which Hawks worked with screenwriter Ben Hecht, who became a close friend and collaborator for 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Kids Can Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E
50|$|The {{school was}} built in {{response}} to increasing demands on the educational system, and changes in educational theory. During the 77 years it was open, <b>it</b> went <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a junior high school to a magnet school.|$|R

50|$|Dinosaur! {{was shown}} {{again on the}} Disney Channel during the 1990s before <b>it</b> went <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a premium pay channel on cable to a {{standard}} channel. It had a VHS release on May 5, 1993, by Family Home Entertainment.|$|R
5|$|Neon is {{abundant}} on a universal scale; {{it is the}} fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon (see chemical element). Its relative rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to its relative lightness, high vapor pressure at very low temperatures, and chemical inertness, all properties which tend to keep <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> trapped in the condensing gas and dust clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 1639, Covenanters {{captured}} Dumbarton Castle {{to prevent}} <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> {{used as a}} Royalist base {{in the event of}} an invasion from Ireland. Once secured, the Earl of Argyll placed Walter MacAulay, Laird of Ardincaple, as keeper of the castle with a garrison of forty men. In 1648, the parish of Row (modern Rhu) was created at the instigation of Aulay MacAulay, Laird of Ardincaple, who wanted to separate from the parish of Rosneath on the opposite side of the Gare Loch. He built the first parish kirk a year later and provided land for the kirk, minster's manse, and garden.|$|E
5|$|The first {{discussion}} {{of improving the}} intersection and grade crossing was a study in 1898, since which there have been about three dozen more. The most recent, a 2009 study of the downtown area, examined the possibility of depressing Route 126 under the grade crossing and intersection {{as well as several}} other alternatives including bypasses. The Route 126 depression was deemed to create barriers to walkability downtown, and the recommended alternative was to depress Route 135 under the intersection to prevent <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> affected by trains passing through the grade crossing. Funds have not yet become available for final design and construction.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} staff in the kitchen has {{increased}} from four when it first opened to 42, resulting in a ratio of one kitchen staff member per customer. The restaurant gained its first Michelin star in 1999, its second in 2002 and its third in 2004, making it the fastest in the United Kingdom to earn three Michelin stars. It lost {{its status as a}} three-starred restaurant in the 2016 guide due to renovation preventing <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> open for assessment. The restaurant regained three stars in the following year's Michelin guide.|$|E
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{was absent}} from screens in 1946, {{the first year}} since his motion picture debut {{that there was no}} Spencer Tracy release. His next film was The Sea of Grass (1947) a drama set in the American Old West with Hepburn. Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm {{response}} from critics did not stop <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a financial success both at home and abroad. He followed it later that year with Cass Timberlane, in which he played a judge. It was a commercial success, but Curtis notes that co-star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews.|$|E
