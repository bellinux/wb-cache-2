25|$|Tensions {{between the}} two governments peaked again during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The United States had a much larger arsenal of {{long-range}} nuclear weapons than the Soviet Union, as well as medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) in Turkey, whereas the Soviet Union had a large stockpile of medium-range nuclear weapons which were primarily located in Europe. Cuba agreed to let the Soviets secretly place SS-4 Sandal and SS-5 Skean MRBMs on their territory. Reports from inside Cuba to exile sources questioned the need for large amounts of ice going to rural areas, {{which led to the}} discovery of the missiles, confirmed by Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance photos. The United States responded by establishing a cordon in international waters to stop Soviet ships from bringing in more missiles (designated a quarantine rather than a blockade to avoid issues with international law). At the same time, Castro was <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too extreme for the liking of Moscow, so at the last moment the Soviets called back their ships. In addition, they agreed to remove the missiles already there in exchange for an agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba. Only {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union was it revealed that another part of the agreement was the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. It also turned out that some submarines that the U.S. Navy blocked were carrying nuclear missiles and that communication with Moscow was tenuous, effectively leaving the decision of firing the missiles at the discretion of the captains of those submarines. In addition, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian government revealed that nuclear-armed FROGs (Free Rocket Over Ground) and Ilyushin Il-28 Beagle bombers had also been deployed in Cuba.|$|E

Documentary director D. A. Pennebaker, who filmed Dylan on his acoustic UK tour in May 1965, has said: [...] "I didn't know {{that he was going to}} leave acoustic. I did know that he was <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dragged by it." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones also evinced an {{interest}} in unidentified flying objects, having first encountered unexplained aerial phenomena at Warrnambool, Victoria, in 1930. He reported witnessing another UFO in October 1957, but admitted that he was [...] "loath {{to talk about it}} publicly lest people should think I was either an incompetent witness or <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> screwy in the head". In the mid-1960s he patronised the Commonwealth Aerial Phenomena Investigation Organisation and joined the Victorian UFO Research Society. Jones published his autobiography, From Private to Air Marshal, in 1988. He was Australia's last surviving World WarI ace when he died in Melbourne on 24August 1992, at the age of 95.|$|E

[...] Slezak, however, issued the performance an [...] "A–" [...] grade, and wrote, [...] "The Troubletones beat New Directions in this particular battle, but I loved the frothy, silly spirit of this number, with the guys dressed like Miami Vice extras, Puck and Blaine rocking Oatestaches, and Tina <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> moment on lead vocals."

500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 {{out of a}} {{possible}} 4 stars and called the film good, despite noting the almost-typical superhero background. Of the actors, he stated that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were suitable for their roles, while Michael Clarke Duncan's presence alone was menacing. He said, [...] "I am <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> worn out describing the origin stories and powers of superheroes [...] Some of their movies, like this one, are better than others." [...] The Houston Chronicles Bruce Westbrook considered it [...] "the best Marvel movie to date, it's as well-written and character-driven as some of today's Oscar contenders, and its story doesn't stall with hollow flamboyance." [...] The Austin Chronicles Kimberly Jones praised the film, the actors, and felt that though an unproven director, [...] "Johnson has just signed his meal ticket with this marriage of big brains, big brawn, and–most happily–big heart." ...|$|E

500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more of a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and {{when it came to the}} small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E
500|$|They had {{problems}} during sequencing {{and had to}} repair the songs, taking some time. Pettibone had to keep things moving {{as fast as possible}} as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. At this point, as far as the music went, it was <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> melancholy. However, as Pettibone explained, Madonna's stories directed the creative direction of the songs into deeply personal territory as they were more serious and intense. Madonna left the album's production to work on her next film Body of Evidence in Oregon. Shortly after, Pettibone started on a song called [...] "Goodbye to Innocence", which was not working. He further commented that he made a new bass line for the track. When Madonna went to record her vocals for [...] "Goodbye to Innocence", she started singing Little Willie John's song [...] "Fever" [...] instead of singing the original words. They decided to record it, as they felt it sounded good. As they did not know the words, Madonna called Seymour Stein from Sire Records, and within an hour, they had the Peggy Lee version, and the original version of the song. This song was the last to be recorded for the album, in August 1992, and it was finished within a month later.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Robert Canning of IGN said the episode was great {{and gave it}} an 8.8 out 10 rating, {{saying that he was}} [...] "impressed" [...] with how the ending handled Jack and Nancy's [...] "not-quite romance." [...] Canning enjoyed the [...] "platonic romance" [...] between them saying, [...] "A lesser series could have simply had the pair hook up, break up and move on, but 30 Rock has drawn out the relationship with flirtation, what-ifs and possible future ex-husbands." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, found the episode [...] "perfectly" [...] and [...] "well-timed". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club said that the episode started [...] "out wicked strong, with everyone in the cast getting great lines". In regards to the two plots, Pierce said that the Liz, TGS, and Dale Snitterman story was [...] "stuffed with great comedic moments", while the Jack and Nancy angle just sat there and flopped [...] "around like a dying fish." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed the Boston theme in [...] "Winter Madness"; his only complaint was that the episode {{had nothing to do with}} TGS, the fictional show on 30 Rock. [...] "I'm <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tired of that. I want more sketches and NBC network shenanigans." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, all was {{not well}} within the group.

In truth the joke is played out, but he won't face the fact. This manuscript consists of a bunch of marginal articles, written during the past six years and slung together with the minimum of care." [...] Some critics agreed. The New Yorker commented, [...] "his methods and the point of view behind them don't seem as funny or as sharp as they once did, possibly because they are no longer surprising, or possibly because he is <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tired of his own joke." [...] But Edmund Wilson remained a fan of Potter, praising [...] "the brevity and compactness of the presentation. As in any practical manual, the principles are stated and concisely illustrated. Nothing goes on too long." ...|$|E

To obtain a certificate that he was a free bachelor, Burns agreed on 25 June to stand for rebuke in the Mauchline kirk for three Sundays.
