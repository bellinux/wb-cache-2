5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E

The inquiry is expected to hand over testimony to a concurrent Royal Commission. The inquiry <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> victim who reported an incident of corporal punishment to the head was threatened with a strap to the face, although {{it should be noted}} that this allegation related to corporal punishment and not sexual abuse.

It was never cleaned, had no drain, no sunlight, no fresh air—the smell was {{described}} as [...] "noisome"—and was full of rats and sometimes [...] "several barrow fulls of dung". Several prisoners told the court that it contained no bed, so that prisoners had to lie on the damp floor, possibly next to corpses awaiting burial. But a group of favoured prisoners Acton had paid to police the jail told the hearing there was indeed a bed. One of them said he often chose to lie in there himself, because the strong room was so clean; the [...] "best room on the Common side of the jail", said another.

500|$|Public {{health policy}} {{at this time}} was shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that {{airborne}} particles released by decaying flesh were the primary factor in the spread of contagious illness), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded {{that it was impossible}} to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. Commissioner and sanitation campaigner Edwin Chadwick testified that each year, 20,000 adults and 30,000 children were being buried in less than [...] of already full burial grounds; the Commission <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> cemetery, Spa Fields in Clerkenwell, designed to hold 1,000 bodies, contained 80,000 graves, and that gravediggers throughout London were obliged to shred bodies in order to cram the remains into available grave space. In 1848–49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely. Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials.|$|E

2500|$|Once, when Jiang Qin was {{stationed}} in Xuancheng County (宣城縣) and was out fighting rebels in Yuzhang Commandery, Xu Sheng, {{who was then the}} Prefect (令) of Wuhu, arrested an officer under Jiang Qin and requested for permission from Sun Quan to have the officer executed. As Jiang Qin was away at that time, Sun Quan denied the request. Xu Sheng had since estranged himself from Jiang Qin. Later, during the Battle of Ruxu in 217, Jiang Qin and Lü Meng were put in charge of military discipline. Xu Sheng was constantly worried that Jiang Qin would find fault with him, but, much to his surprise, Jiang praised him instead, and Xu was very impressed by Jiang's virtuous behaviour. Jiang Qin became more highly regarded after this incident. Sun Quan later asked Jiang Qin, [...] "Xu Sheng offended you earlier on, but yet now you praise him. You wish to emulate Qi Xi, don't you?" [...] Jiang Qin replied, [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> should not let his personal feuds affect his official duties. Xu Sheng is loyal and hardworking, possesses both courage and talent, and is capable of leading thousands of troops. Now, we've yet to accomplish our great task, so I should help to scout for and recommend talents to serve the state instead of letting my private problems cloud my judgment." [...] Sun Quan was very pleased.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{fish that}} is still unmentioned, which it is {{scarcely}} advisable to speak about on account of its size, because it will seem to most people incredible. There are only a very few who can speak upon it clearly, because it is seldom near land nor appears where it may be seen by fishermen, and I suppose {{there are not many}} of this sort of fish in the sea. Most often in our tongue we call it hafgufa ("kraken" [...] in e.g. Laurence M. Larson's translation). Nor can I conclusively speak about its length in ells, because the times he has shown before men, he has appeared more like land than like a fish. Neither have I <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> had been caught or found dead; {{and it seems to me}} as though there must be no more than two in the oceans, and I deem that each is unable to reproduce itself, for I believe that they are always the same ones. Then too, neither would it do for other fish if the hafgufa were of such a number as other whales, on account of their vastness, and how much subsistence that they need. It is said to be the nature of these fish that when one shall desire to eat, then it stretches up its neck with a great belching, and following this belching comes forth much food, so that all kinds of fish that are near to hand will come to present location, then will gather together, both small and large, believing they shall obtain their food and good eating; but this great fish lets its mouth stand open the while, and the gap is no less wide than that of a great sound or bight, And nor the fish avoid running together there in their great numbers. But as soon as its stomach and mouth is full, then it locks together its jaws and has the fish all caught and enclosed, that before greedily came there looking for food.|$|E

Rami bar Hama objected that the thread of the Red Cow required a certain weight (to be cast into the flames, as described in [...] ). Rava said that the matter of this weight was disputed by Tannaim (as explained below). Abaye objected (based on [...] ) that they wrapped the red thread together with the cedar wood and hyssop. Rav Hanin said in the name of Rav that if the cedar wood and the red thread were merely caught by the flame, they were used validly. They objected to Rav Hanin based on a Baraita which taught that if the thread caught fire in midair, they brought another thread to prepare the water of lustration. Abaye reconciled the two opinions by interpreting the Baraita to speak of a flame that blazed high above the cow, and interpreting Rav Hanin to speak of a subdued flame that consumed the thread near the burning cow. Rava explained the dispute among Tannaim about the weight of the red thread {{in connection with}} the Red Cow. [...] Rabbi taught that they wrapped the cedar wood and hyssop together with the red thread so that they formed one bunch. Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Simeon said that they wrapped them together so that they had sufficient weight to fall into the midst of the burning cow.|$|E
