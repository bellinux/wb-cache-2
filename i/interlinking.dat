5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity. A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or <b>interlinking</b> with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power. According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|E

40|$|A hybrid {{alternate}} current/direct current (AC/DC) microgrid {{consists of}} an AC subgrid and a DC subgrid, and the subgrids are connected through the <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter. In the stand-alone operation mode, it is desirable that the <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter manages proportional power sharing between the subgrids by transferring power from the under-loaded subgrid to the over-loaded one. In terms of system security, the <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter takes an important role, so proper control strategies need to be established. In addition, {{it is assumed that}} a battery energy storage system is installed in one subgrid, and the coordinated control of <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter and battery energy storage system converter is required so that the power sharing scheme between subgrids becomes more efficient. For the purpose of designing a tracking controller for the power sharing by <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid, a droop control method generates a power reference for <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter based on the deviation of the system frequency and voltages first and then <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter needs to transfer the power reference to the over-loaded subgrid. For efficiency of this power transferring, a linear quadratic regulator with exponential weighting for the current regulation of <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter is designed {{in such a way that}} the resulting microgrid can operate robustly against various uncertainties and the power sharing is carried out quickly. Simulation results show that the proposed <b>interlink</b> bidirectional AC/DC converter control strategy provides robust and efficient power sharing scheme between the subgrids without deteriorating the secure system operation...|$|R

25|$|This {{picture of}} Spinoza's {{determinism}} is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in Ethics: ″the infant {{believes that it}} is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion.

25|$|The most {{significant}} immediate {{threat to the}} existence of wild tiger populations is the illegal trade in poached skins and body parts between India, Nepal and China. The governments of these countries have failed to implement adequate enforcement response, and wildlife crime remained a low priority in terms of political commitment and investment for years. There are well-organised gangs of professional poachers, who move from place to place and set up camp in vulnerable areas. Skins are rough-cured in the field and handed over to dealers, who send them for further treatment to Indian tanning centres. Buyers choose the skins from dealers or tanneries and smuggle them through a complex <b>interlinking</b> network to markets outside India, mainly in China. Other factors contributing to their loss are urbanization and revenge killing. Farmers blame tigers for killing cattle and shoot them. Their skins and body parts may however {{become a part of the}} illegal trade. In Bangladesh, tigers are killed by professional poachers, local hunters, trappers, pirates and villagers. Each group of people has different motives for killing tigers, ranging from profit, excitement to safety concerns. All groups have access to the commercial trade in body parts.|$|E

They had similar precepts to combat, wanting to make this style's rules and rewards clear to players. Interactive hacking was one of the earliest things the team had decided upon, alongside not including quick time events. The Hacking mechanics were inspired by the tabletop role-playing game Shadowrun. They were designed to invoke tension, and require a survey of both the surroundings and the security system {{while at the same time}} providing rewards. Social interactions followed similar patterns, becoming an extension to the general gameplay, with a similar risk-reward system.|$|E
500|$|In 1869, the Illinois state {{legislature}} established the West Park Commission, which {{was responsible for}} three large parks and <b>interlinking</b> boulevards. Later that year, on November 4, 1869 the commissioners named the southernmost park in honor of Stephen A. Douglas (1813–1861). Best remembered for his pre-Civil War presidential defeat by Abraham Lincoln despite superb oratorical skills, Douglas was a United States Senator who helped bring the Illinois Central Railroad to Chicago. In 1871, designer William Le Baron Jenney completed plans for the entire West Park System which included Douglas, Garfield, and Humboldt parks. Jenney's engineering expertise was especially helpful for transforming Douglas Park's poor natural site into parkland. He had manure from the Union Stock Yards and sand added to the marshy site. [...] This process brought the [...] of land to grade level. In {{the center of the}} landscape, Jenney created a picturesque lake, and a small section of the park was formally opened in 1879. Inflated construction costs and post Great Chicago Fire tax collection difficulties resulted in phased projects. The first improvements were made to the park by Oscar DuBuis in the 1880s. [...] Between 1886 and 1888 Douglas Park, like the other West Park System parks, replaced its greenhouse with a conservatory. In 1895, members of several German turners' clubs petitioned for an outdoor gymnasium, and the following year one of Chicago's first public facilities was constructed with an outdoor gymnasium (pictured right), swimming pool, and natatorium.|$|E

500|$|In principle, sprang may be {{regarded}} as a practical application of the fiber manipulation techniques used in the children's game known as cat's cradle. [...] Sprang is made by preparing a set of warp threads either on a rectangular frame or between a pair of beams. [...] The craftsperson then generates a fabric by <b>interlinking</b> the warp threads. [...] Unlike most textile production techniques that add new rows at the end of completed rows, sprang works upon the center of a group of fibers and the material grows inward from both ends with symmetrical top and bottom halves. [...] The craftsperson must maintain control of the center area or the structure unravels: most sprang worked upon has too many fibers to keep in hand, so rods or sticks maintain the appropriate fiber positions. [...] The fiber manipulation itself is done by the craftsperson's fingers. [...] Decorative patterns may be generated by regular variations in the fiber crossings. [...] As crossings accumulate the craftsperson beats the material flat with a stick. [...] Work continues with the material growing from both edges toward the middle until the center band becomes too tight to continue work. [...] The completed fabric is either separated into two identical items or permanently secured at the middle to stabilize the contrary twists. [...] In traditions where two halves of sprang are not severed by cutting, this center seam is a telltale sign of sprang manufacture.|$|E
