In the present study, CIGS thin films were deposited on bare {{soda lime glass}} substrate by RF magnetron sputtering at various oblique angles. The structural, surface morphological, film surface roughness, optical, and electrical properties of CIGS thin films were studied at various oblique angles. Films were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer and four probe method. XRD revealed that all the deposited thin films were polycrystalline with preferred peak intensity along (112) plane. The film deposited at 0 ° (target- substrate parallel) exhibited larger crystallite size (28 nm) with low dislocation density (1. 2 × 1015 lines m- 2). The film surface at this angle was more compact and uniform {{in comparison to the}} films deposited at other deposition angles.

Weirs with oblique angle in the horizontal plan will affect the scour profile downstream the structure and may reduce it. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of oblique weir angle on the scour profile. Furthermore, the effect of V-notch angle on the scour profile will be studied. In order to achieve that, laboratory experiments were carried out to test four weirs models of different V-notch angle 30 °, 60 °, 90 ° and 120 °. Experiments were conducted at three different Froude numbers and four different oblique angles of the weir (0 (normal to the flow), 5, 10 and 15 °). The results showed that scour parameters (maximum scour depth and volume of scour) can be decreased by placing the V-notch weir with small oblique angle. The changes in scour parameters for V-notch angles 30, 60 and 90 were not significant while it decreased significantly by using 120 ° weir.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{impact on}} nourishments of conditions with <b>high</b> <b>oblique</b> wave incidence {{has been investigated}} in literature using either a one-line approach or quasy- 2 D models. These models predict downdrift nourishment migration and the generation of alongshore sand waves for persistent conditions with <b>high</b> <b>oblique</b> wave incidence. However, these models exclude either the effect of wave chronology or use unrealistic nourishment properties. In this research the reshaping mechanisms of beach nourishments of realistic proportions (i. e. 2 km long and a cross-shore extent of 250 m or 1000 m) which are exposed to high angle waves are explored using Delft 3 D. This analysis distinguishes two phases: (1) static sediment transport for time invariant wave climate and (2) evolving nourishment morphology under time varying wave conditions. Model results show that: - A proper quantification {{of the degree of}} downdrift migration could be obtained from the skewness in the initial alongshore sediment transport distribution. Large nourishments under high angle waves result in high skewness and subsequent translation of the feature, while normally incident waves result in symmetric sediment transport distribution with skewness equal to zero and a more classical diffusive response. - The morphological response of the considered nourishments depends on (1) the moment in time at which a high angle wave event took place and (2) the persistence of the high angle waves within the wave climate. Simulations showed that a period with low-angle waves can rapidly wipe out the instabilities of high-angle wave situations and thus result in a diffusive pattern.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether cloud inhomogeneity influences the view angle dependence of MODIS cloud optical thickness (tau) retrieval results. The degree of cloud inhomogeneity is characterized through the local gradient in 11 microns brightness temperature. The analysis of liquid phase clouds in a one year long global dataset of Collection 4 MODIS data reveals that while optical thickness retrievals give remarkably consistent results for all view directions if clouds are homogeneous, they give much <b>higher</b> tau-values for <b>oblique</b> views than for overhead views if clouds are inhomogeneous {{and the sun}} is fairly oblique. For solar zenith angles larger than 55 deg, the mean optical thickness retrieved for the most inhomogeneous third of cloudy pixels is more than 30 % <b>higher</b> for <b>oblique</b> views than for overhead views. After considering a variety of possible scenarios, the paper concludes that the most likely reason for the increase lies in three-dimensional radiative interactions that are not considered in current, one-dimensional retrieval algorithms. Namely, the radiative effect of cloud sides viewed at oblique angles seems to contribute most to the enhanced tau-values. The results presented here will help understand cloud retrieval uncertainties related to cloud inhomogeneity. They complement the uncertainty estimates that will start accompanying MODIS cloud products in Collection 5 and may eventually help correct for the observed view angle dependent biases...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of nucleation and island growth in oblique angle deposition with substrate rotation have recently attracted interest {{due to the}} formation of novel 3 D nanostructures by a physical self-assembly process. In this study, we present the results of a solid-on-solid growth simulation by a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm that explores the layer coverage evolution of thin films during oblique angle deposition. The simulations accounted for oblique incidence flux, shadowing effect, surface diffusion, and substrate rotation. The layer coverage, the ratio of average island volume to average island size, and root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are reported for the initial stages of island growth from submonolayer thicknesses up to a few monolayers. RMS roughness was also investigated for later stages of the growth. Our results show that, for small deposition angles and with limited or no surface diffusion included, the average growth rate of islands is faster in lateral directions that results in enhanced layer coverages and smoother films. This is due to that the sides of the islands can be exposed to the incident flux more effectively at small deposition angles.

At present digital cameras of different geometric qualities are being routinely used for this purposes. The Canon D 30 digital camera is a professional camera with a CMOS sensor of 3. 2 Mp. Although camera resolution is relatively low, compared with more recent amateur cameras, the sensor is slightly smaller in size than conventional 35 mm film format. The focal length/angle of view conversion factor is approximately 1. 6 x compared to full frame 35 mm film format.

Moreover, the appearance of landscapes can vary drastically depending on the season and the weather conditions. For these two reasons, matching the input images with registered images in a reliable way remains a challenging task. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we show how to estimate the camera orientation for images with GPS data using a novel algorithm for horizon matching based on Dynamic Time Warping. The proposed algorithm exploits an elevation model. Each image is processed independently from the others, there is therefore no need neither for image matching or for a large set of images. This step provides a set of reliable, fully registered images. Second, and in odrer to register new images with no GPS data available, we first ask the user to provide an approximate image localization on a 2 D map.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare stresses induced in dentin by three structurally different posts using photoelasticity method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine blocks of PSM- 5 Photoelastic material with 45 × 45 × 10 mm dimension were prepared. In each block, a canal 9 mm in length and 0. 8 mm in width was drilled. Blocks were divided into 3 groups of three each. In the first group, the canals were prepared for insertion of Fiber Post with 1. 25 mm width. In the second group, the canals were prepared for insertion of ParaPost with 1. 25 mm width and the canals in the third group were prepared for casting post similar to the above samples. Casting Post pattern was made by Duralay resin and casted by Ni-Cr alloy. All posts were cemented in canals with Panavia cement. The stresses were evaluated in the polariscope under three different conditions: 1) without load, 2) with 135 N vertical load, and 3) with 90 N oblique load (26 ° inclination to post long axis). The fringe orders in the cervical, middle and apical regions of the posts were evaluated and compared with each other. RESULTS: Application of the vertical load induced a high stress concentration (FO= 4) in the apical region of the ParaPost, while lower stress was observed in the middle (FO= 2) and cervical region (FO= 2 +). Fiber Post and Casting Post showed even stress distribution (FO= 2 +). High stress concentration was detected with the application of oblique force in the cervical region of ParaPost (FO= 5) and Casting Post (FO= 3 +). Fiber Posts fractured before reaching 90 -N loading force. CONCLUSION: The stress distribution around Fiber Post and Casting Post were constant in comparison with ParaPost.

40|$|This work investigates an {{integrated}} aerial remote sensor design approach to address moving target detection and tracking problems within highly cluttered, dynamic ground-based scenes.

Complex modeling of novel micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS) devices, optical systems, and detector arrays {{has resulted in a}} proof of concept for a state-of-the-art imaging spectropolarimeter sensor model that does not suffer from typical multimodal image registration problems. Test methodology developed for this work provides the ability to quantify performance of a target tracking application with varying ground scenery, flight characteristics, or sensor specifications. The culmination of this research is an end-to-end simulated demonstration of multimodal aerial remote sensing and target tracking. Deeply hidden target recognition is shown to be enhanced through the fusing of panchromatic, hyperspectral, and polarimetric image modalities. The Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation model was leveraged to synthesize truth spectropolarimetric sensor-reaching radiance image cubes comprised of coregistered Stokes vector bands in the visible to near-infrared. An intricate synthetic urban scene containing numerous moving vehicular targets was imaged from a virtual sensor aboard an aerial platform encircling a stare point. An adaptive sensor model was designed with a superpixel array of MOEMS devices fabricated atop a division of focal plane detector. Degree of linear polarization (DoLP) imagery is acquired by combining three adjacent micropolarizer outputs within each 2 x 2 superpixel whose respective transmissions vary with wavelength, relative angle of polarization, and wire-grid spacing. A novel micromirror within each superpixel adaptively relays light between a panchromatic imaging channel and a hyperspectral spectrometer channel. All optical and detector sensor effects were radiometrically modeled using MATLAB and optical lens design software. Orthorectification of all sensor outputs yields multimodal pseudonadir observation video at a fixed ground sampled distance across an area of responsibility. A proprietary MATLAB-based target tracker accomplishes change detection between sequential panchromatic or DoLP observation frames, and queries the sensor for hyperspectral pixels to aid in track initialization and maintenance. Image quality, spectral quality, and tracking performance metrics are reported for varying scenario parameters including target occlusions within the scene, declination angle and jitter of the aerial platform, micropolarizer diattenuation, and spectral/spatial resolution of the adaptive sensor outputs. DoLP observations were found to track moving vehicles better than panchromatic observations at <b>high</b> <b>oblique</b> angles when facing the sensor generally toward the sun. Vehicular occlusions due to tree canopies and parallax effects of tall buildings significantly reduced tracking performance as expected. Smaller MOEMS pixel sizes drastically improved track performance, but also generated a significant number of false tracks. Atmospheric haze from urban aerosols eliminated the tracking utility of DoLP observations, while aerial platform jitter without image stabilization eliminated tracking utility in both modalities. Wire-grid micropolarizers with very low VNIR diattenuation were found to still extinguish enough cross-polarized light to successfully distinguish and track moving vehicles from their urban background. Thus, state-of-the-art lithographic techniques to create finer wire-grid spacings that exhibit high VNIR diattenuation may not be required...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of reflected ultrasonic waves induced by oblique insonification of composite materials {{is a powerful}} tool for providing information about defects and material properties. A device was developed to manipulate a pair of transmitting and receiving transducers at various angles of wave incidence and propagation with the fiber orientation. The device was designed as a C-scan attachment to allow inspection at specific locations as well as to obtain global information about the laminates by scanning them, Ultrasonic reflections from composite laminates are acquired and analyzed by a personal computer at high speed, in a transient or spectral form. Graphite/epoxy laminates were tested and the experimental results accurately corroborated the {{analysis of}} the wave behavior for tone-burst and pulse results. The inversion algorithm allows the determination of the material elastic constants as well as evaluation of various defects characteristics. The data repeatability and accuracy are very <b>high,</b> making <b>oblique</b> insonification methods easy to standardize for practical applications. This paper reviews the theoretical and experimental progress and examples of application to NDE of composites...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{amplitude}} and direction are two independently controlled parameters of aimed arm movements, and performance, therefore, suffers when they must be decomposed into Cartesian coordinates. We now compare decomposition into different coordinate systems. Subjects pointed at visual targets in 2 -D with a cursor, using a two-axis joystick or two single-axis joysticks. In the latter case, joystick axes were aligned with the subjects’ body axes, were rotated by – 45 °, or were oblique (i. e., one axis was in an egocentric frame {{and the other was}} rotated by – 45 °). Cursor direction always corresponded to joystick direction. We found that compared with the two-axis joystick, responses with single-axis joysticks were slower and less accurate when the axes were oriented egocentrically; the deficit was even more pronounced when the axes were rotated and was most pronounced when they were oblique. This confirms that decomposition of motor commands is computationally demanding and documents that this demand is lowest for egocentric, higher for rotated, and <b>highest</b> for <b>oblique</b> coordinates. We conclude that most current vehicles use computationally demanding man–machine interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{pulse welding}} is an electromagnetically {{assisted}} high strain rate impact welding technology. The physical principle {{is similar to}} explosive welding and it also belongs to solid state impact welding. This <b>high</b> velocity <b>oblique</b> impact welding {{has been applied to}} various lap joint configurations. Three different geometric configurations on plate-to-plate welding were studied in this paper. They are direct lap joint, pre-flange lap joint, and lap joint with embedded wires. All of the three welding configurations have been used to provide metallurgical bonds between both similar and dissimilar metal pairs. The welded materials include copper alloy, aluminium alloy, and steels. The plates are centimeter or more thick and often centimeter in extent. The critical welding process parameters were instrumentally investigated by Rogowski Coil and Photon Doppler Velocimetry. Metallographic analysis of the welded interface showed refined grain structure. The mechanical properties of the welded plates were studied by lap shearing, peeling and nano-indentation tests. The test results showed that the impact welded interface has a much greater micro-hardness and fracture toughness than the base metals...|$|R
