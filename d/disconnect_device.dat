Eyo allows a user to view and manage the entire collection of objects from any of their <b>devices,</b> even from <b>disconnected</b> <b>devices</b> and devices with too little storage to hold all the object content. Eyo separates metadata (application-specific attributes of objects) from the content of objects, allowing even storage-limited devices to store all metadata and thus provide device transparency. Fully replicated metadata allows any set of Eyo devices to efficiently synchronize updates. Applications can specify flexible placement rules to guide Eyo's partial replication of object contents across devices. Eyo's application interface provides first-class access to object version history. If multiple <b>disconnected</b> <b>devices</b> update an object concurrently, Eyo preserves each resulting divergent version of that object. Applications can then examine the history and either coalesce the conflicting versions without user direction, or incorporate these versions naturally into their existing user interfaces. Experiments using Eyo for storage in several example applications-media players, a photo editor, podcast manager, and an email interface-show that device transparency can be had with minor application changes, and within the storage and bandwidth capabilities of typical portable devices. by Jacob Alo Strauss.

5000|$|Due to the {{relatively}} high signal voltages used in SCART, [...] "hot plugging" [...] (connecting or <b>disconnecting</b> <b>devices</b> while they are on) is not recommended. Although there is no risk of personal injury, {{there is the possibility}} of damaging electronics within the devices if the connector is inserted improperly. Also, since many TVs are Class II (double-insulated) rather than earthed, the large exposed shield on the SCART connector will be held at approximately half mains voltage if it is plugged into a powered TV with the other end unplugged. If the cable is then plugged into an earthed device with a metal case, inadvertent contact with the SCART cable shield while the earthed device is touched with the other hand can cause a painful electric shock. For this reason the device end of the cable should always be plugged in first and the TV end plugged in last.|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{computers}} are often only intermittently {{connected to the}} network. Thus disconnected operation is {{an important aspect of}} wireless computing. Disconnected operation focuses on providing useful services to a mobile <b>device</b> even while <b>disconnected</b> from the network. Further, if shared data is in use, disconnected operation must deal with the management of operations on shared data. If the user of a <b>disconnected</b> <b>device</b> operates on shared data, the data must be cached before disconnection. Cached data must be reconciled with the original data once the device is reconnected to the network. Even worse, if two users have cached the same data and changed it while disconnected, this causes a conflict and some form of conflict resolution must be made in order to integrate these changes. In this thesis, the Thor object-oriented database system is extended to support disconnected operation. While many schemes have been devised to avoid conflict resolution or provide mechanisms to automatically resolve conflicts, the approach to conflict resolution taken here is to develop a framework to facilitate conflict resolution by the application. This study provides interesting information about how applications, such as a shared calendar, can be adapted to fit a disconnected transaction model of the system in order to achieve the proper semantics...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} studies how distributed <b>devices</b> {{that are}} <b>disconnected</b> for long and unknown periods can efficiently perform {{a set of}} tasks. Given n distributed devices that must perform t independent tasks, known to each device, {{the goal is to}} schedule work of the devices locally, in the absence of communication, so that when communication is established between some devices at some later point of time, the devices that connect have performed few tasks redundantly beyond necessity. The dissertation gives a lower bound on redundant work, and randomized and deterministic schedules, that allow devices to avoid doing redundant work provably well. The lower bound shows how the wasted work increases as the devices progress in their work. When each <b>disconnected</b> <b>device</b> randomly selects its next task, from among the tasks remaining to be done, then the amount of work duplicated by any devices that reconnect, is close to the lower bound in a precise sense. In order to derandomize the construction of schedules, techniques from design theory, linear algebra, and graph theory are used. The topics developed within the dissertation are related to the theory of latin squares and coding theory. For example the lower bound shown in the dissertation generalizes the Second Johnson Bound. The dissertation also studies scheduling problems for shared memory systems. It shows a method for creating near-optimal instances of an algorithm of Anderson and Woll. The dissertation also shows a work-optimal deterministic algorithm for the asynchronous Certified Write-All problem. ...|$|R

30|$|Boundary value {{problems}} of the form (1)-(2) arise in the mathematical modeling of thermophysical processes in high-current electric arc of the <b>disconnecting</b> <b>device.</b> Tool for describing the physics of the processes in the arc is the heat equation, in which {{the influence of the}} heat sources in the arc and the effect of the contraction of the axial section of the arc in the cathode region to a contact spot are taken into account. The diameter of the contact spot is several orders smaller than the diameter of the developed section of the arc column and this fact gives the chance to consider the contact spot as a mathematical point. The solution domain changes over time according to the law which is defined by the conditions of the bridging contact. At the fixed terminal time the contacts close and the solution domain of the problem degenerate. From a mathematical point of view, problematic nature of the problem consists {{in the presence of a}} moving boundary and degeneracy of the solution domain at the fixed terminal time. It should be emphasized that the boundary value problems for parabolic equations in a domain with a moving boundary are fundamentally different from the classical problems. Due to the size of the domain depending on the time for this type of problems methods of separating the variables and integral transformations not be applied, as remaining within the classical methods of mathematical physics you cannot conform the solution of the heat equation to the motion of the border line of the heat transport domain.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{distributed}} computing systems {{are no longer}} constrained to fixed, wired networks. Many computers have gained {{the ability to move}} within a network and operate across wireless links. Such mobile computing devices often suffer from limited, unreliable, or expensive network connectivity. These constraints make services dependent on other devices in the network difficult to maintain. Disconnected operation refers to the operation of a <b>device</b> while <b>disconnected</b> from the network. Typically, disconnected operation is achieved by caching a copy of data and/or functionality from remote machines locally on a device. When network connectivity is lost, the <b>disconnected</b> <b>device</b> can still function by using its cache. Upon reconnection, any modifications are reconciled with the original on the remote machine. This project focused on implementing a simple disconnected operation protocol and investigating automation of the reconciliation process. Reconciliation generally involves reintegrating disconnected data caches with original copies, while detecting and resolving conflicts that may have occurred during the disconnection period. Rather than relying on application specific routines to detect conflicts, this project attempted to simplify the process by developing a generic means of identifying data dependencies and monitoring data access. The approach chosen was to maintain metadata along with application data to define dependencies between application data and monitor access to the data. By using generic metadata to represent this information, generalised conflict detection algorithms can be implemented. A successful implementation of these concepts was developed and partially tested for this project. Disconnected operation and limited capabilities of automated conflict detection were proven to work. Significant improvement over similar work in the field was not achieved, but the generic, modular framework created has potential for future development of superior automated conflict detection...|$|R

CE devices are a problem for local ﬁle systems because they store user data outside the purview of the local ﬁle system on heterogeneous devices. This dissertation demonstrates techniques to connect CE devices to a distributed ﬁle system with the goal of bringing all of a user’s storage devices into a single distributed storage system to ease management. This work also demonstrates ensembles, groups of <b>disconnected</b> <b>devices</b> that can band together to provide each other with data and updates, improving data consistency and availability. 	New, higher level management techniques are also needed to help manage the growing multimedia data. This work introduces persistent queries, a reliable notiﬁcation mechanism for applications that allows them to provide type-speciﬁc behavior across the distributed ﬁle system. To allow the addition of type-aware features in the ﬁle system itself, we designed sprockets, a technique that allows code to be safely loaded and run in the address space of a distributed storage system. Finally, we built TrapperKeeper, a system that simpliﬁes the extraction of ﬁle metadata by reusing the ﬁle parsing and display behavior of existing applications instead of requiring the special-purpose ﬁle-parsing code be built.

40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} enable {{communications between}} clouds of mobile devices {{without the need}} for a preexisting infrastructure. One of their most interesting evolutions are opportunistic networks, whose goal is to also enable communication in disconnected environments, where the general absence of an end-to-end path between the sender and the receiver impairs communication when legacy MANET networking protocols are used. The key idea of OppNets is that the mobility of nodes helps the delivery of messages, because it may connect, asynchronously in time, otherwise disconnected subnetworks. This is especially true for networks whose nodes are mobile devices (e. g., smartphones and tablets) carried by human users, which is the typical OppNets scenario. In such a network where the movements of the communicating devices mirror those of their owners, finding a route between two <b>disconnected</b> <b>devices</b> implies uncovering habits in human movements and patterns in their connectivity (frequencies of meetings, average duration of a contact, etc.), and exploiting them to predict future encounters. Therefore, there is a challenge in studying human mobility, specifically in its application to OppNets research.

We start by reviewing the most considerable findings regarding the nature of human movements, which we classify along the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of mobility.
