5|$|There {{are several}} {{ancillary}} structures {{near the house}} at Valley View, including a smokehouse and a water well, and the foundations of an ice house and a summer kitchen. Although the smokehouse, the summer <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ice house {{are believed to have}} been built by the Collinses before Big Jim Parsons built Valley View, the dates of construction are uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{refectory}} (dining hall) {{range to}} the south of the cloister and the dorter range to the east, which contained the chapter house and dormitory, have yet to be excavated. Only the western end of the refectory range has been excavated; it presents a vaulted undercroft, three bays of which survive, above which the refectory was located on the first floor. A service passage survives between the <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> refectory. The western part of the undercroft was used as a buttery in the late Middle Ages but would have had severely restricted headroom due to its raised floor.|$|E
5|$|A detective named Havez (Dwight McFee) {{takes over}} as Bruckman's guard when Mulder and Scully {{are called to}} {{investigate}} yet another new murder victim: the tarot card reader. As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop is actually the killer, and when he enters the room (while Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop had it on his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush back to the hotel. Mulder chases the killer to the basement <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scene plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives {{in the nick of time}} and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E

50|$|From 1978 through 1999, Raphael House also {{operated}} Brother Juniper's Restaurant, {{an on-site}} breakfast café named for Saint Juniper. Although it brought Raphael House a small net profit for twenty years, {{the expense of}} renovating its <b>kitchens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> need for additional space for the children's afterschool tutorial center combined to impel its closure.|$|R
5|$|A further {{delay in}} {{construction}} {{was announced in}} 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> library tower, began in 1955 {{at a cost of}} £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.|$|E
5|$|When a Liu-family {{relative}} of an emperor—usually a princely son—was designated as his heir apparent, he was provided living quarters within the palace {{and a personal}} staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor. During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of the heir apparent, known as the Grand Tutor of the Heir Apparent (ranked 2000–dan) and Junior Tutor of the Heir Apparent (ranked 2000–dan), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan). During Eastern Han, the Grand Tutor of the Heir Apparent lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-dan; the Junior Tutor remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-dan. The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished. Other Western Han staff offices of the heir apparent were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of the <b>Kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Household Prison of the Heir Apparent. If he reached adulthood, the heir apparent could be married to a principal wife who led a harem of his concubines.|$|E

25|$|The {{excavators}} {{believe that}} the monastery had initially occupied the entire structure. In the 5th century, however, Jerusalem was granted patriarchal status and the following century saw the city develop and expand. As population density in Jerusalem grew, the needs of numerous pilgrims to the holy city led {{to a reduction in}} the Monastery's area in favour of public facilities. In the mid 6th century, two wings were detached from the monastery and sealed off, the northern wing to act as a public <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> southern converted into a row of shops. Food for the monastery was prepared in the public kitchen and delivered through two windows left open between the two sections of the building.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} then dry-docked for her fitting out (at {{the moment of}} the launching, the ship was merely an empty shell, without machines, installations, or funnels). At first, only three funnels were planned to be installed. However, in order for her not to appear weaker than the Cunard's four-funnels duo, a fourth funnel was added. Its {{function}} was the ventilation of the <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> storage of deck chairs. For her propulsion, Olympic was driven by three propellers. The two three-bladed side propellers were driven by two triple-expansion engines, while the four-bladed central propeller was driven by a turbine that utilised recovered steam escaping from the triple expansion engines. The utilisation of escaped steam was tested on the SS Laurentic two years before.|$|E

The superstructure is a pyramidal tower with pilastered storeys on each {{of which}} is artwork including erotic sculptures. The gopuram leads into a rectangular court that ends in another, smaller gopura dated to 1510 CE. To its south side is a 100-column hall with Hindu-related reliefs on all four sides of each pillar. Connected to this public hall is a community kitchen, a feature found in other major Hampi temples. A channel is cut into the rock to deliver water to the <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feeding hall. The courtyard after the small gopura has dipa-stambha (lamp pillar) and Nandi.|$|E

The windows are still the original double-hung, two-over-two or six-over-six panes, with dentil molding in each lintel.

25|$|In 1856 Bishop Hale, an {{independently}} wealthy clergyman, purchased five allotments on St George's Terrace {{in order}} to build a residence for himself and his family. Bishop Hale favoured this location because of the large grounds and natural spring that flowed all year round, and that there was a house and stables. The land was purchased from Edward Hamersley and Alfred Hillman Senior (Assistant Surveyor General). In 1858, Bishop Hale arranged for the construction of his residence by ticket-of-leave men. In December that year, Bishop Hale and his family travelled to England, not returning until April 1860. Bishop’s House was completed, at Bishop Hale's personal expense, for a cost £2,486, whilst the family was away overseas. The existing house on the site was utilised as a <b>kitchen,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stables as laundry and kitchen outhouses.|$|E
