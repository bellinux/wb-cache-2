Inspired in the probability density of the problem, we construct an ansatz for the solutions {{of the family of}} self-adjoint <b>Hamiltonians.</b> We use this ansatz to map the solutions of the time independent Schrodinger equations generated by the non self-adjoint <b>Hamiltonians</b> into the Hilbert space of the solutions of the respective dual self-adjoint <b>Hamiltonians.</b> This mapping depends on both the position-dependent mass and on a function of position satisfying a condition that assures the existence of a consistent continuity equation. We identify the non self-adjoint <b>Hamiltonians</b> here studied to a very general family of <b>Hamiltonians</b> proposed in a seminal article of Harrison [1] to describe varying band structures in different types of metals. Therefore, we have self-adjoint <b>Hamiltonians</b> that correspond to the non self-adjoint ones found in Harrison's article.
