40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>Dummy</b> /ED/ {{used for}} {{acoustical}} testing represents the average male torso from the Xiphoid process upward and includes an acoustic {{replica of the}} human head. This head simulates natural flesh, and has an artificial voice and artificial ears that measure sound pressures at the eardrum or {{the entrance to the}} ear canal...|$|E
50|$|In some {{competitions}} between bulls, with a purse {{amounting to}} tens of thousands of dollars per event, the bulls are ridden by <b>electronic</b> <b>dummies,</b> not rodeo bull riders. Good performing bulls attain a celebrity status and can be considered a star athlete in their own right, and a valiant competitor on the field against the human rider.|$|R
5000|$|After {{failing to}} sway the {{politicians}} of the galactic Duma (Russian Senate), {{the queen of}} Marabu develops a plan for operation [...] "Storm in a Glass" [...] (a play on [...] "Operation Storm in the Desert"; also the Russian idiomatic equivalent to [...] "Tempest in a Teapot"). Two divisions of underwater deer-herders, hidden in a fighter Anykey - everything sets up against the provisional government of bourgeois and their army of <b>electronic</b> <b>dummies.</b> During one of the fights, the jedi once again meet with the [...] "red unmannered man" [...] who attacks them once again (supposedly) for not wearing any hats. He is behalved and his {{lower half of the}} body (lower abdomen and legs) are identified, while it is a mystery to whom the other half belongs. Only in the [...] "God's Spark" [...] version of the film does it become clear who is Anykey's real father - it is Pogon, who admits to have [...] "known" [...] (commonly understood as [...] "have/d sex with") Anykey's mother, and later openly explains that Anykey is his only son.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the potential for using image gating techniques for accurate estimating random noise in clinical SPECT images. Phantom and patient bone SPECT scans were acquired in a gated mode using standard acquisition protocols with a <b>dummy</b> <b>electronic</b> trigger. The acquired projection data was divided into time slots and reconstructed using the same algorithm to produce independent sets of data. Our results showed that this method {{can be used for}} accurate estimation of the level of random noise in phantom and clinical SPECT studies, and it avoids the problem of pixel value correlation faced when using small ROI in estimating noise in SPECT image...|$|R
5000|$|Another program {{offered by}} Buckers, Inc., are bull futurities. Started in 2001 as the Buckers Gold Standard Futurity, two year old bulls have <b>electronic</b> riding <b>dummies</b> {{attached}} to their backs. Note that at this age they are not mature enough to have real riders on them. The dummy is programmed to release after 6 seconds. Accordingly, the bulls are all judged on their performance. The bulls all buck in two rounds, their scores averaged. Then the winning bull is chosen and [...] "crowned." [...] Bulls that complete in this program qualify {{to compete in the}} Buckers World Derby the next year. In the Derby, the bulls are ridden by human riders, which displays how much the animal has grown, improved and reacts to real competition. [...] "The futurity gives everybody a chance to play," [...] Andrews, who raises his own stock, cited. [...] "It's a lot more special when you raise them. It {{will be interesting to see}} how well Bo's calves buck," [...] he added. Andrews, who believes the bulls are [...] "pretty sharp athletes," [...] is passing on all of his stock contractor know-how to his son James. [...] "James has a good eye for animals," [...] Andrews said. James will take his own Andrews Rodeo Company to this year's rodeo at the Naples Watermelon Festival in East Texas. What does Andrews say is his own top bull pick within in his own string? [...] "Slim. He's real showy, not a true spinner, and going to do something different." [...] His son, James, however, prefers [...] "Little Weed. He's the only rank bull. Turns back to the left or right. Bucks. He's been rode twice." [...] About his decades in the bucking bull business, Andrews modestly said, [...] "I've been blessed." ...|$|R
