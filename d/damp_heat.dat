In 1973, the government provided assistance of DM 28 million for the modernisation of old dwellings. New rules were introduced regarding improvements in the law relating to rented property, and control of the rise in rents and protection against cancellation of leases also safeguarded the rights of migrant workers in the sphere of housing. A law of July 1973 fixed the fundamental and minimum requirements regarding workers' dwellings, mainly concerning space, ventilation and lighting, protection against <b>damp,</b> <b>heat</b> and noise, power and heating facilities and sanitary installations.|$|E

We will discuss the conditions under which these descriptions may be applied, and they will be illustrated using two very simple models of open systems: an open two-level system and an open harmonic oscillator.

40|$|Abstract:We {{present a}} {{calculation}} of two-point correlation {{functions of the}} stress-energy tensor in the strongly-coupled, confining gauge theory which is holographically dual to the AdS soliton geometry. The fact that the AdS soliton smoothly caps off {{at a certain point}} along the holographic direction, ensures that these correlators are dominated by quasinormal mode contributions and thus show an exponential decay in position space. In order to study such a field theory on a curved spacetime, we foliate the six-dimensional AdS soliton with a Schwarzschild black hole. Via gauge/gravity duality, this new geometry describes a confining field theory with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions on a non-dynamical Schwarzschild black hole background. We also calculate stress-energy correlators for this setting, thus demonstrating exponentially <b>damped</b> <b>heat</b> transport. This analysis is valid in the confined phase. We model a deconfinement transition by explicitly demonstrating a classical instability of Gregory-Laflamme-type of this bulk spacetime. ar X i...|$|R
60|$|The general {{aspect of}} the region is prepossessing. It is a rolling surface sinking towards the Atlantic, in parts broken by hills and dwarf chains, either {{detached}} or pushed out by the Ghats; a land of short and abnormally broad rivers, which cannot, like the Congo, break through the ridges flanking the Central African basin, and which therefore are mere surface drains of the main ranges. The soil is mostly sandy, but a thin coat of rich vegetable humus, quickened by heavy rains and fiery suns, produces a luxuriant vegetation; whilst the proportion of area actually cultivated is nothing compared with the expanse of bush. In the tall forests, which abound in wild fruits, there are beautiful tracts of clear grassy land, and the woods, clear of undergrowth, resemble an English grove more than a tropical jungle. Horses, which die of the tsetse (Glossina morsitans) {{in the interior of}} North Guinea, and of <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> at Fernando Po, thrive on its downs and savannahs. The Elais palm is rare, sufficing only for home use.

60|$|From its {{topographical}} {{as well as}} its geographical {{position the}} climate of Freetown is oppressively hot, damp, and muggy. The annual mean is 79.5° Fahr.; the usual temperature of the dwellings is from 78° to 86° Fahr. Its year is divided into two seasons, the Dries and the Rains. The wet season begins in May and ends with November; {{for the last five years}} the average downfall has been 155 inches, five times greater than in rainy England. These five months are times of extreme discomfort. The <b>damp</b> <b>heat,</b> despite charcoal fires in the houses and offices, mildews everything--clothes, weapons, books, man himself. It seems to exhaust all the positive electricity of the nervous system, and it makes the patient feel utterly miserable. It also fills the air with noxious vapours during the short bursts of sunshine perpendicularly rained down, and breeds a hateful brood of what the Portuguese call immundicies--a foul 'insect-youth.' Only the oldest residents prefer the wet to the dry months. The Rains end in the sickliest season of the year, when the sun, now getting the upper hand, sucks the miasmatic vapours from the soil and distributes them to mankind in the shape of ague and fever, dysentery, and a host of diseases. The Dries last from November to April, often beginning with tornadoes and ending with the Harmatan, smokes or scirocco. The climate is then not unlike Bombay, except that it lacks the mild East Indian attempt at a winter, and that barometric pressure hardly varies.|$|E

The air as well as the diet proved a tonic, and patients escaped the frequent cough, catarrh, influenza, and neuralgia which are so troublesome at Funchal. Here, too, the invalid must be accompanied by a 'prudent and watchful friend,' or friends, and the companions will surely suffer. I know few climates so bad and none worse for those fecund causes of suffering in Europe, liver-affections ('mucous fevers'), diarrhoeas, and dysenteries; for nervous complaints, tic douloureux, and neuralgia, or for rheumatism and lumbago. Asthma is one of the disorders which shows the most peculiar forms, and must be treated in the most various ways: here some sufferers are benefitted, others are not. Madeira is reputedly dangerous also for typhoid affections, for paralysis, and for apoplexy. There is still another change to come. The valley north of the beautiful and ever maligned 'Dead Sea' of Palestine, where the old Knights Templar had their sugar-mills and indigo-manufactories, has peculiar merits. Lying some 1,350 feet below the Mediterranean, it enables a man to live with a quarter of a lung: you may run till your legs fail with fatigue, but you can no more get out of breath than you can sink in the saline waters of Lake Asphaltites.

Alum directly influences the colour of the flowers of the Hydrangea. (23/25. 'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 1 page 160.) Dryness seems generally to favour the hairiness or villosity of plants. Gartner found that hybrid Verbascums became extremely woolly when grown in pots. Mr. Masters, on the other hand, states that the Opuntia leucotricha [...] "is well clothed with beautiful white hairs when grown in a <b>damp</b> <b>heat,</b> but in a dry heat exhibits none of this peculiarity." [...] (23/26. See Lecoq on the Villosity of Plants 'Geograph. Bot.' tome 3 pages 287, 291; Gartner 'Bastarderz.' s. 261; Mr. Masters on the Opuntia in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1846 page 444.) Slight variations of many kinds, not worth specifying in detail, are retained only as long as plants are grown in certain soils, of which Sageret (23/27. 'Pom. Phys.' page 136.) gives some instances from his own experience. Odart, who insists strongly on the permanence of the varieties of the grape, admits (23/28. 'Ampelographie' 1849 page 19.) that some varieties, when grown under a different climate or treated differently, vary in a slight degree, as in the tint of the fruit and in the period of ripening. Some authors have denied that grafting causes even the slightest difference in the scion; but there is sufficient evidence that the fruit is sometimes slightly affected in size and flavour, the leaves in duration, and the flowers in appearance. (23/29. Gartner 'Bastarderz.' s. 606, has collected nearly all recorded facts. Andrew Knight in 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 2 page 160, goes so far as to maintain that few varieties are absolutely permanent in character when propagated by buds or grafts.) ...|$|E
60|$|We left Nurtiung on the 4th of October, {{and walked}} to Pomrang, a very long and {{fatiguing}} day's work. The route descends north-west of the village, and turns due east along bare grassy hills of mica-schist and slate (strike east and west, and dip north). Near the village of Lernai oak woods are passed, in which Vanda coerulea grows in profusion, waving its panicles of azure flowers in the wind. As this beautiful orchid is at present attracting great attention, from its high price, beauty, and difficulty of culture, I shall point out how totally at variance with its native habits, is the cultivation thought necessary for it in England.* [We collected seven men's loads of this superb plant for the Royal Gardens at Kew; but owing to unavoidable accidents and difficulties, few specimens reached England alive. A gentleman who sent his gardener with us to be shown the locality, was more successful: he sent one man's load to England on commission, and though it arrived in a very poor state, it sold for 300 pounds, the individual plants fetching prices varying from 3 pounds to 10 pounds. Had all arrived alive, they would have cleared 1000 pounds. An active collector, with the facilities I possessed, might easily clear from 2000 pounds to 3000 pounds, in one season, by the sale of Khasia orchids.] The dry grassy hills which it inhabits are elevated 3000 to 4000 feet: the trees are small, gnarled, and very sparingly leafy, so that the Vanda which grows on their limbs is fully exposed to sun, rain, and wind. There is no moss or lichen on the branches with the Vanda, whose roots sprawl over the dry rough bark. The atmosphere is on the whole humid, and extremely so during the rains; {{but there is no}} <b>damp</b> <b>heat,</b> or stagnation of the air, and at the flowering season the temperature ranges between 60 degrees and 80 degrees, there is much sunshine, and both air and bark are dry during the day: in July and August, during the rains, the temperature is a little higher than above, but in winter it falls much lower, and hoar-frost forms on the ground. Now this winter's cold, summer's heat, and autumn's drought, and above all, this constant free exposure to fresh air and the winds of heaven, are what of all things we avoid exposing our orchids to in England. It is under these conditions, however, that all the finer Indian Orchideae, grow, of which we found Dendrobium Farmeri, Dalhousianum, Devonianum, etc., with Vanda coerulea; whilst the most beautiful species of Coelogyne, Cymbidium, Bolbophyllum, and Cypripedium, inhabit cool climates at elevations above 4000 feet in Khasia, and as high as 6000 to 7000 in Sikkim.|$|E

6000|$|The zobo, or {{cross between}} the yak and hill cow (much {{resembling}} the English cow), is but rarely seen in these mountains, though {{common in the}} North West Himalaya. The yak {{is used as a}} beast of burden; and much of the wealth of the people consists in its rich milk and curd, eaten either fresh or dried, or powdered into a kind of meal. The hair is spun into ropes, and woven into a covering for their tents, which is quite pervious to wind and rain;* [The latter is, however, of little consequence in the dry climate of Tibet.] from the same material are made the gauze shades for the eyes used in crossing snowy passes. The bushy tail forms the well-known [...] "chowry" [...] or fly-flapper of the plains of India; the bones and dung serve for fuel. The female drops one calf in April; and the young yaks are very full of gambols, tearing up and down the steep grassy and rocky slopes: their flesh is delicious, much richer and more juicy than common veal; that of the old yak is sliced and dried in the sun, forming jerked meat, which is eaten raw, the scanty proportion of fat preventing its becoming very rancid, so that I found it palatable food: it is called schat-tcheu (dried meat). I never observed the yak to be annoyed by any insects; indeed at the elevation it inhabits, there are no large diptera, bots, or gadflies to infest it. It loves steep places, delighting to scramble among rocks, and to sun its black hide perched on the glacial boulders which strew the Wallanchoon flat, and on which these beasts always sleep. Their average value is from two to three pounds, but the price varies with the season. In autumn, when her calf is killed for food, the mother will yield no milk, unless the herdsman gives it the calf's foot to lick, or lays a stuffed skin before it, to fondle, which it does with eagerness, expressing its satisfaction by short grunts, exactly like those of a pig, a sound which replaces the low uttered by ordinary cattle. The yak, though indifferent to ice and snow and to changes of temperature, cannot endure hunger so long as the sheep, nor pick its way so well upon stony ground. Neither can it bear <b>damp</b> <b>heat,</b> for which reason it will not live in summer below 7000 feet, where liver disease carries it off after a very few years.* [Nevertheless, the yak seems to have survived the voyage to England. I find in Turner's [...] "Tibet" [...] (p. 189), that a bull sent by that traveller to Mr. Hastings, reached England alive, and after suffering from languor, so far recovered its health and vigour as to become the father of many calves. Turner does not state by what mother these calves were born, an important omission, as he adds that all these died but one cow, which bore a calf by an Indian bull. A painting of the yak (copied into Turner's book) by Stubbs, the animal painter, may be seen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. The artist is probably a little indebted to description for the appearance of its hair in a native state, for it is represented much too even in length, and reaching to too uniform a depth from the flanks.] Lastly, the yak is ridden, especially by the fat Lamas, who find its shaggy coat warm, and its paces easy; under these circumstances it is always led. The wild yak or bison (D'hong) of central Asia, the superb progenitor of this animal, is the largest native animal of Tibet, in various parts of which country it is found; and the Tibetans say, in reference to its size, that the liver is a load for a tame yak. The Sikkim Dewan gave Dr. Campbell and myself an animated account of the chase of this animal, which is hunted by large dogs, and shot with a blunderbuss: it is untameable and horridly fierce, falling upon you with horns and chest, and if he rasps you with his tongue, it is so rough as to scrape the flesh from the bones. The horn is used as a drinking-cup in marriage feasts, and on other grand occasions. My readers are probably familiar with Messrs. Huc and Gabet's account of a herd of these animals being frozen fast in the head-waters of the Yangtsekiang river. There is a noble specimen in the British Museum not yet set up, and another is preparing for exhibition in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.|$|E

Reasoning by analogy with the physics of surface electrons in liquid helium, we demonstrate that the decay of Rabi oscillations observed in experiments on 9 Be+ {{can be attributed to}} the polarization phenomena investigated here. The measured sensitivity of the damping of Rabi oscillations with respect to the vibrational quantum number of a trapped ion is also predicted in our polarization model.

The damping mechanisms considered are linear Landau damping, ion-neutral collisional damping, nonlinear steepening of wave packets, a parametric decay instability, and nonlinear Landau <b>damping.</b> The <b>heat</b> input from all damping mechanisms can be accommodated by the 'fluctifer' region containing the irregularities, if it has features similar to the extended H II envelopes...|$|R

40|$|Results from a {{study to}} assess the {{accuracy}} of turbulent heating and skin friction prediction techniques for hypersonic applications are presented. The study uses the original and a modified Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model with a space marching code. Grid converged turbulent predictions using the wall damping formulation (original model) and local damping formulation (modified model) are compared with experimental data for several flat plates. The wall damping and local damping results are similar for hot wall conditions, but differ significantly for cold walls, i. e. T w /T t < 0. 3, with the wall <b>damping</b> <b>heating</b> and skin friction 10 - 30 % above the local damping results. Furthermore, the local damping predictions have reasonable or good agreement with the experimental heating data for all cases. The impact of the two formulations on the van Driest damping function and the turbulent eddy viscosity distribution for a cold wall case indicate the importance of including temperature gradient effects. Grid requirements for accurate turbulent heating predictions are also studied. These results indicate that a cell Reynolds number of 1 is required for grid converged heating predictions, but coarser grids with a y + less than 2 are adequate for design of hypersonic vehicles. Based {{on the results of}} this study, it is recommended that the local damping formulation be used with the Baldwin-Lomax and Cebeci-Smith turbulence models in design and analysis of Hyper-X and future hypersonic vehicles. 1...|$|R

40|$|For a {{perfectly}} conducting, cylindrical plasma equilibrium (“screw-pinch”), the spectrum contains four distinct continua, {{three of which}} can extend to the origin. This implies the existence of irreversible <b>damping</b> and <b>heating</b> in the nondissipative model. The continuum becomes (Suydam) unstable by instantly shedding {{an infinite number of}} point eigenvalues. More generally, any local instability implies an infinity of unstable eigenvalues. Spectral analysis of a new class of low shear, semilocal unstable modes provides a connection between Suydam modes, found only in sheared systems, and interchanges, found only in closed line (shearless) systems, and gives rise to the concept of an effective marginal stability threshold. Study of the spectrum should also provide a unified picture of many other plasma phenomena...|$|R
