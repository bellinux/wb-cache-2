5|$|The first Glastonbury Festivals were {{a series}} of {{cultural}} events held in summer, from 1914 to 1926. The festivals were founded by English socialist composer Rutland Boughton and his librettist Lawrence Buckley. Apart from the founding of a national theatre, they envisaged a summer school and music festival based on utopian principles. With strong Arthurian connections and <b>historic</b> <b>and</b> prehistoric associations, Glastonbury was chosen to host the festivals.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian <b>Historic</b> <b>and</b> Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E

5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many <b>historic</b> <b>and</b> current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E
5|$|Czech {{units were}} held up near Skoczów and a ceasefire was signed on 3 February. The new Czechoslovakia claimed the area partly on <b>historic</b> <b>and</b> ethnic grounds, but {{especially}} on economic grounds. The area {{was important for}} the Czechs as the crucial railway line connecting Czech Silesia with Slovakia crossed the area (the Košice-Bohumín Railway, {{which was one of}} only two railroads that linked the Czech provinces to Slovakia at that time). The area is also very rich in black coal. Many important coal mines, facilities and metallurgy factories are located there. The Polish side based its claim to the area on ethnic criteria: a majority (69.2%) of the area's population was Polish according to the last (1910) Austrian census.|$|E

5|$|It {{was only}} {{following}} PedroII's majority in 1840, however, that the Academy became a powerhouse, {{part of the}} Emperor's greater scheme of fomenting a national culture and consequently uniting all Brazilians in a common sense of nationhood. PedroII would sponsor the Brazilian culture through several public institutions funded by the government (not restricted to the Academy of Fine Arts), such as Brazilian <b>Historic</b> <b>and</b> Geographic Institute and Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera. That sponsorship would pave the way {{not only for the}} careers of artists, but also for those engaged in other fields, including historians such as Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen and musicians such as the operatic composer Antônio Carlos Gomes.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania was {{incorporated}} into the Russian Empire in 1795. It was occupied by Germany during World War I, and declared itself independent on 16 February 1918. The next two years were marked by the turbulence of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, delaying international recognition {{and the establishment of}} political institutions. The newly formed army fought the Bolsheviks, the Bermontians, and Poland. In October 1920, Poland annexed Vilnius, the <b>historic</b> <b>and</b> modern-day capital of Lithuania, and the surrounding area; this controversial action was the source of ongoing tension between the two powers during the interwar period. Lithuania's second-largest city, Kaunas, was designated the interim capital of the state.|$|E

5|$|On 19 February 1860, {{he founded}} {{and became the}} first and only {{president}} of the <b>Historic</b> <b>and</b> Geographic Institute of the Province of São Pedro (as Rio Grande do Sul was also known). The institute was short-lived, lasting from 1860 until 1864. In 1862, Porto Alegre was among the Liberals who, along with dissident Conservatives, founded the Liga Progressista (Progressive League), which replaced the Liberal Party. He became Minister of War on 24 May {{as a member of the}} first Progressive cabinet, headed by Zacarias de Góis e Vasconcelos. However, the cabinet fell after a vote of no confidence six days later. When the Chamber of Deputies was dissolved in 1863 and new elections were called, he was elected and served until 1866.|$|E
5|$|Separately, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government {{announced}} on St. George's Day 2013 in a symbolic move that England's <b>historic</b> <b>and</b> traditional counties still exist. They are now recognised by the government, who will now encourage the marking and {{continued use of}} such traditional county names by the existing tiers of local government and residents. A follow up announcement in April 2014 put forward an initiative in changing planning regulations, stating that 'traditional county' names can be placed on roadsigns. The same Government department also published an online map comparing the current and historic counties. The {{main body of the}} pre-1889 boundaries appear to be acknowledged, but Worcestershire's islands including Dudley and Shipston-on-Stour are omitted.|$|E

5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates.

However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E
