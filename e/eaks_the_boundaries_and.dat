40|$|We {{investigate}} the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime {{in the presence}} of a <b>boundary</b> parallel to <b>the</b> AdS horizon.

We also consider external vector operators and obtain the relation between OPE coefficients for the exchange of single trace scalar operators in the OPE.

Our results match with the known examples from the case of AdS_ 3 /CFT_ 2.
