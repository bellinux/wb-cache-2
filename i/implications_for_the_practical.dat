3000|$|The result derived in {{this section}} has an {{important}} <b>implication</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>practical</b> relevant WACC approach. It {{is well known that}} cost of capital needs to be known with certainty at the timepoint of valuation t. 16 Random future cost of capital cannot be used as discount rates to obtain present values of future expected cash flows. 17 Given a refinancing policy with a fixed interval of k periods, the capital structure of the firm (in market values) is known with certainty every k periods, i.e., when the firm readjusts the debt level according to the target leverage ratio l. Thus, the firm’s WACC, defined as wacc_t+nk=r_L (1 -l) [...] + [...] r_D (1 -τ [...]) l, at any arbitrary refinancing point t+nk is also non-random. However, this is not true for any intermediate timepoint s between two arbitrary adjustment dates, with t+nk<s<t+(n+ 1)k. Between two refinancing dates, the financing policy described fixes the debt level to D_t+nk and the leverage ratio l_s=D_t+nk/V^L_s turns into a random variable. As a consequence, wacc_s is a random variable for any intermediate point in time s and thus does no longer meet the requirement from above to serve as cost of capital, implying that a WACC-based valuation for discontinuous financing is not possible. Only in one special case, WACC may be used as discount rate for every future period’s cash flow: if k= 1, i.e., the ME policy applies, the firm’s debt level will be adjusted every period and l is known with certainty at any future point in time.|$|R

40|$|During one millennium, {{from the}} {{inception}} of the Han Statutes (漢律) in the 3 rd century BC until the establishment of the Tang Criminal Code (唐律) in the 8 th century AD, Chinese codified law changed and developed towards a combination of criminal code (律) and administrative statutes (令). Judged by any criteria within the period in question, this was a considerable achievement. Yet despite being a precocious feat, what sort of resource did the Tang code effectively offer in actual cases of legal judgment? The Code's article on 'judgments and prison sentences' stipulates : "All criminal sentences must cite a formal provision from the Code, Statutes, Regulations, or Ordinances. " However, scholars have hitherto found no evidence to verify this requirement in the historical sources of the Tang period. On the other hand, a mass of historical and archeological data from the Han period is available to prove that the demand to cite relevant Han statutes was regularly observed. I argue that these divergent Han and Tang practices arose out of extremely different character and conceptions of law in the two periods. My analysis considers four factors : 1). the changing relationship between the Confucian canon and legal codifications; 2). the enduring consideration of individual mitigating factors in the application of code articles; 3). the historical ascent of new social conditions through which to constitute crimes; 4). the appearance of new ordinances 格 to guide actual practices concerning judgement. I conclude that during this period the concepts underlying the various processes of legal codification developed from what I have called Han norms of adjudication into Tang norms of conduct. This conceptual shift had important <b>implication</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>practical</b> business of interpreting and applying the law during the formative period of Chinese imperial government...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a version}} of ‘Live Sociology’ that enacts and engages with the openness and processuality of events. This is initially explored through a focus on everyday objects that, in their relationality, ‘misbehave’, potentially challenging standard sociological framings. Drawing {{on the work of}} Isabelle Stengers, it is suggested that such objects can be understood as ‘idiotic’ - possessed of an incommensurability that enables social scientists to ‘slow down’ and reflect upon ‘what is busily being done’ (not least by the social scientists themselves). This responsiveness to the idiot object is then contrasted to the proactive idiocy of Speculative Design. Here, artefacts - probes and prototypes – are designed to have oblique and ambiguous functions that allow both their users and designers to open up what is at stake in particular events. Examples taken from past and current research are used to illustrate how speculative designs can open up what ‘the neighbourhood’ and ‘energy demand reduction’ can be.

40|$|In {{designing}} {{inventories of}} wildland vegetation, {{two of the}} many basic methodological choices are: 1) whether data are collected, reduced, and stored in discrete classes or as continuous variables, and 2) whether data are gathered as general purpose variables to bear upon many questions, or as specific purpose variables optimized for only one type of prediction. The effects of these two choices on accuracy of vegetation inventories to predict plant community production were examined by comparing regression models built upon differing sets of independent variables 2 ̆ 2 inventoried 2 ̆ 2 from a common data base. Contrary to expectations, discrete variables of classified community types were better predictors of plant community production than the same vegetation data reduced as continuous variables by three ordination techniques. Substitution of specific purpose soil and vegetation variables thought to be especially relevant to production did not improve correlations from those of analogous general purpose variables. These results do not show the anticipated accuracy loss of general purpose inventory variables, but such findings cannot yet be generalized to other situations. <b>Implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> design of <b>practical,</b> extensive survey methods for wildland vegetation are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} to reduce clinical {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) scan time by varying acquisition parameters and sharing k-space data between images, is proposed. To improve data utilization, acquisition of multiple images of different contrast is combined into a single scan, with variable acquisition parameters including repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and echo train length (ETL). This approach is thus {{referred to as a}} "combo acquisition. " As a proof of concept, simulations of MRI experiments using spin echo (SE) and fast SE (FSE) sequences were performed based on Bloch equations. Predicted scan time reductions of 25 %- 50 % were achieved for 2 -contrast and 3 -contrast combo acquisitions. Artifacts caused by nonuniform k-space data weighting were suppressed through semi-empirical optimization of parameter variation schemes and the phase encoding order. Optimization was assessed by minimizing three quantitative criteria: energy of the "residue point spread function (PSF)," energy of "residue profiles" across sharp tissue boundaries, and energy of "residue images. " In addition, results were further evaluated by quantitatively analyzing the preservation of contrast, the PSF, and the signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|This thesis explores Llandilofawr Poor Law union’s first half-century. A small {{union with}} 17, 000 {{inhabitants}} scattered across 12 parishes {{in the remote}} Carmarthenshire countryside, its economy was predominantly agricultural. The board’s 27 elected guardians, who repeatedly sought re-election, were thus drawn almost exclusively from the farming community. Poor Law Commissioners sensed that implementing the New Poor Law in this environment would be difficult, and frequently referred to the ‘peculiarity’ of Wales and the Welsh. Against this background, this is a detailed study of the union’s elected guardians and officials, and shows how a vibrant local culture determined their approach to the task. Because their sense of belonging remained at parish level the union never became an entity with which local people identified. It did, however, function as an effective administrative unit despite intense inter-parish rivalry. A particular ‘peculiarity’ emerges in that local gentry and magistrates remained almost wholly outside the process, playing almost no role in union affairs. Their absence, and the Commissioners’ clumsy handling of an early key event allowed elected guardians {{to take control of}} the union by 1839, one dominant individual, a board member for 47 years, leading an élite group which ran union affairs ‘their’ way. Key to this was to exploit local ‘connections’ and pay particular attention to appointing the ‘right’ officials, especially the union clerk. The outcome was that pauper care was generally benign, and considerable intra-parish differences flourished. Over 95 % of relief was provided outside the workhouse, and doles in Llandilofawr were relatively generous compared to other areas of both Wales and England. The historiography of the Welsh poor law is shown to be thin, and this study’s findings have general <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> interpreting <b>the</b> <b>practical</b> operation of poor law unions in both England and Wales, lending support to the idea of considerable regional variation in the application of the New Poor Law.
