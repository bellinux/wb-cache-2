5|$|Sultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General Lloyd Mathews, {{a former}} Lieutenant of the Royal Navy, {{to restore order}} in Tanganyika. The {{operation}} was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong. Further conflicts erupted at Bagamoyo, where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at Ketwa, where German officials and their servants were murdered. Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade. Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 Ali bin Said ascended to the sultanate. Sultan Ali banned the <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as First Minister to lead his cabinet. The British were also guaranteed a veto over the future appointment of sultans.|$|E
5|$|Slaves {{were also}} {{employed}} in the home. The domestic's main role was to stand in for his master at his trade and to accompany him on trips. In time of war he was batman to the hoplite. The female slave carried out domestic tasks, in particular bread baking and textile making. Only the poorest citizens did not possess a <b>domestic</b> <b>slave.</b>|$|E
5|$|During Davis's youth, {{his family}} moved twice: in 1811 to St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, and {{less than a year}} later to Wilkinson County, Mississippi. The {{international}} slave trade was prohibited in 1808, and planters used the <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade to procure laborers for developing cotton culture in the Deep South. Three of Davis's older brothers served in the War of 1812. In 1813, Davis began his education at the Wilkinson Academy in the small town of Woodville, near the family cotton plantation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} place of <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> in British {{families}} resident in India, c. 1780 – 1830, {{and the ways in}} which the presence of slaves within these Anglo-Indian households challenged British understandings of slavery as a practice. Drawing upon probate data, private correspondence and the Parliamentary Papers, it suggests that the history of slavery in the British empire must be situated within wider histories of family, household and kin. Located within the family and often conflated with servants, <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> in Anglo-India came to be seen as dependent female subordinates whose gender and status placed them outside the emerging politics of emancipation...|$|R
50|$|The Petigrus had various {{attitudes towards}} and {{relationships}} with their <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves,</b> {{some of which were}} sexual in nature. <b>Domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> were common gifts among family members as both wedding presents to young couples, and as baptismal gifts to young children. Petigru women participated in sending slaves' communications between plantations, typically through letters, yet they also relied on the communication networks between slaves to obtain news and gossip about family and friends. As domestic overseers, these women were put in the position of deciding which slaves were allowed to marry - generally the decision was based on who owned the female slave and, by law, her future offspring.|$|R
5|$|Benjamin {{became a}} {{specialist}} in commercial law, of which {{there was a great}} deal in New Orleans' busy river port—a center of international commerce and the <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade. By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. Many of the best lawyers in the country practiced commercial law there, and Benjamin successfully competed with them. In one case, he successfully represented the seller of a slave against allegations that the seller knew the slave had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1826, Honório Hermeto {{married his}} 17-year-old first cousin Maria Henriqueta Neto, the {{daughter}} of his father's brother João Neto Carneiro Leme. Unlike his brother, João Neto was a rich and influential man. Honório Hermeto and Maria Henriqueta had five children: Honório, Henrique (later Baron of Paraná), Maria Emília, Maria Henriqueta and Pedro. The advantageous marriage allowed Honório Hermeto to become a slave owner, assume his uncle's business, which included <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trading, and later, in the 1830s, purchase a coffee farm {{in the province of}} Rio de Janeiro. Coffee was quickly becoming Brazil's most important export commodity and was a highly lucrative crop.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} frustration, Honório Hermeto (or Paraná as he became known) had largely recouped the {{prestige}} he had formerly possessed among his peers. He had liquidated his uncle's <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trading business {{and used the}} proceeds to become a coffee plantation owner in 1836. The land he acquired was located in the hills between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Although Paraná staunchly opposed {{the abolition of the}} transatlantic African slave trade, the importation of slaves was abolished in 1850 by the Eusébio de Queirós Law. The ban on slave imports seems to have had no impact over Paraná's private affairs; by 1852, he had become a very wealthy man. He also married his son Honório to a niece of Rodrigues Torres, thus establishing a link between his family and the province of Rio de Janeiro's planter aristocracy.|$|E
50|$|Highland was a {{thriving}} plantation employing {{the labor of}} 30-40 slaves. Their housing no longer exists. Quarters for field hands were at {{some distance from the}} main house, while the <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> lived closer to their master.|$|R
50|$|Brownies {{appear as}} small, leather-skinned humans and enjoy helping out with {{domestic}} chores around the home. They were particularly abused {{during the reign}} of King Magnus, whose prejudice towards them led to them being treated as little more than <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Those enslaved in Senufo lands {{worked the}} land, herds and served within the home. Their owner and his dependents {{also had the}} right to have sexual {{intercourse}} with female <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves.</b> The children of a female slave inherited her slave status.|$|R
25|$|As {{part of the}} Compromise of 1850, Congress {{abolished}} the <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade (though not the legality of slavery) in the District of Columbia. After 1854, Republicans argued that the Slave Power, especially the pro-slavery Democratic Party, controlled {{two of the three}} branches of the Federal government.|$|E
25|$|In the US as a whole, by 1810 {{the number}} of free blacks reached 186,446, or 13.5 percent of all blacks. After that period, few slaves were freed, as the {{development}} of cotton plantations featuring short-staple cotton in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for slaves in the <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade and high prices were paid.|$|E
25|$|About 1853, Johnson {{and her two}} {{children}} had been sold to John Hill Wheeler (1806-1882), a planter from North Carolina and politician then working in Washington, DC. She worked as a <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> in his household. Her oldest son had been sold by a previous master to someone in Richmond, Virginia, and she never expected to see him again.|$|E
50|$|Many slave {{relationships}} in Africa revolved around <b>domestic</b> slavery, where <b>slaves</b> would work {{primarily in the}} house of the master but retain some freedoms. <b>Domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> could be considered part of the master's household and would not be sold to others without extreme cause. The slaves could own the profits from their labor (whether in land or in products), and could marry and pass the land on to their children in many cases.|$|R
2500|$|At Monticello, {{an outdoor}} exhibit was {{installed}} to represent slave life. The Landscape of Slavery: Mulberry Row at Monticello {{makes use of}} archeological and other research to establish the outlines of cabins for <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> and other outbuildings near the mansion. Field slaves were held elsewhere. (See each online at http://www.slaveryatmonticello.org) ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{four cases}} of runaway <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> in Venice, spanning the period 1573 to 1649, {{to explore the}} varying assumptions about subjecthood, religious conversion, and transgression {{that went into the}} making and unmaking of bondage. Although rare, the archival traces left by early modern runaway slaves suggest that in their quest for freedom, <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> had not only to sever one set of ties, but to cultivate another. The multiple narrations of slaves' trajectories before and after enslavement that form part of various official genres further allow us to explore the differing conceptions of subjection articulated by runaway slaves and their interlocutors. Moving beyond juridical definitions of freedom and slavery, this study emphasizes the myriad social mechanisms that cultivated a sense of membership and marginality among subaltern subjects. In particular, it underscores the complex trans-imperial nexus that both sustained early modern Mediterranean slavery and at times disrupted it...|$|R
25|$|Although Europeans {{were the}} market for slaves, Europeans rarely entered the {{interior}} of Africa, due to fear of disease and fierce African resistance. In Africa, convicted criminals could be punished by enslavement, a punishment which became more prevalent as slavery became more lucrative. Since most of these nations {{did not have a}} prison system, convicts were often sold or used in the scattered local <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> market.|$|E
25|$|In 1817, he {{supported}} Senate action {{to abolish the}} <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade and, in 1819, spoke strongly for the antislavery amendment to the Missouri statehood bill. In 1819, his arguments were political, economic, and humanitarian; the extension of slavery would adversely affect {{the security of the}} principles of freedom and liberty. After the Missouri Compromise, he continued to support gradual emancipation in various ways.|$|E
25|$|Mary {{is forced}} {{to work as a}} <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> for her father Horatio Green and his white wife. She {{arranges}} to trade places in prison with her lover, the slave George. He escapes to Canada. Sold to a slave trader, Mary is purchased by a French man who takes her to Europe. Ten years later, after the Frenchman's death, George and Mary reunite by chance in Dunkirk, France. The novel ends with their marriage.|$|E
5000|$|In 1909, Popp {{published}} Die Jugendgeschichte einer Arbeiterin (English: The Autobiography of a Working Woman), which explored how {{class and}} gender shaped her life choices. [...] The book {{focused on her}} [...] "miserable proletarian childhood and youth," [...] which {{was used as the}} focus for her argument demanding social and political change. Following her autobiography, was Haussklavinnen (English: <b>Domestic</b> <b>Slaves),</b> in 1912, which was her study on domestic servants.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} {{completed}} in 1776 for Fielding and Betty Washington Lewis, the sister of George Washington. He was a planter and successful merchant in town. Their plantation grew tobacco, wheat, and corn by the labor of slaves. [...] More than 80 slaves worked on the 1300-acre plantation, including a number of <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves.</b> The mansion's rear frontage was oriented to the Rapahannock River for easy transportation access.|$|R
50|$|Maison des Esclaves, or the Slave House, {{was built}} in 1780-1784 by Nicolas Pépin. Although it {{is the home of}} the infamous “Door of No Return”, which {{is said to be the}} last place {{exported}} slaves touched African soil for the rest of their lives, there is little evidence at Maison des Esclaves to suggest a “large-scale trans-Atlantic slave trade” economy. According to census records obtained from the 18th century, the majority of enslaved population fell under the category of <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves,</b> rather than slaves to be exported. Pépin and his heiress may have had <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves,</b> but again there is little archaeological evidence that they were involved in any slave exportation business. Despite this lack of evidence, Maison des Esclaves has become a pilgrimage site to commemorate forcible removal of Africans from their homeland, also known as the African diaspora. This contrasts with the role of the site of Rue des Dungeons on Gorée. At Rue des Dungeons, as the name suggests, there is a presence of dungeons, which can clearly be associated with the confinement of the slaves to be exported.|$|R
25|$|Since the capital's {{formation}} in 1790, slavery was legal and prominent. The District of Columbia {{was the center}} of the <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade during the eighteenth century due to its ports on the Potomac River. However, the number of slaves declined over the next five decades from approximately 6,400 slaves in 1820 to 3,100 by 1860. The population of free blacks grew, and by 1860, free blacks out-numbered slaves by four to one. It was a center of culture and politics for free blacks.|$|E
25|$|At the United States Constitutional Convention of 1787, delegates debated over slavery, finally {{agreeing to}} allow states {{to permit the}} {{international}} trade for at least 20 years. By that time, all the states had passed individual laws abolishing or severely limiting the international buying or selling of slaves. Through the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the Congress of the Confederation prohibited slavery in the territories northwest of the Ohio River. The importation of slaves into the United States was officially banned on January 1, 1808. No action was taken on the nation's internal <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade.|$|E
25|$|By 1815, the <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade {{had become}} a major {{economic}} activity in the United States; it lasted until the 1860s. Between 1830 and 1840 nearly 250,000 slaves were taken across state lines. In the 1850s more than 193,000 were transported, and historians estimate nearly one million in total {{took part in the}} forced migration of this new Middle Passage. By 1860 the slave population in the United States had reached 4 million. Of all 1,515,605 free families in the fifteen slave states in 1860, nearly 400,000 held slaves (roughly one in four, or 25%), amounting to 8% of all American families.|$|E
50|$|Both the President and the Delmonico and {{subsequent}} Pullman sleeping cars offered first-rate service. The company hired African-American freedmen as Pullman porters. Many {{of the men}} had been former <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> in the South. Their new roles required them to act as porters, waiters, valets, and entertainers, all rolled into one person. As they were paid relatively well and got to travel the country, the position became considered prestigious, and Pullman porters were respected in the black communities.|$|R
50|$|In October 2013, the {{organisation}} was contacted by three women in London {{saying they had}} been held as <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> for thirty years. A television documentary on forced marriages, followed by an interview with Prem describing the work of Freedom Charity, had prompted {{one of the victims}} to call the helpline. Freedom contacted the Metropolitan Police who managed the women's rescue {{with the assistance of the}} charity which held secret telephone calls with the captives. Two suspects were arrested.|$|R
50|$|Servile groups came in two forms: <b>{{domestic}}</b> <b>slaves</b> {{lived near}} their owners as domestic servants and herders, and functioned {{as part of}} the family, with close social interactions. Additionally, entire communities became servile to aristocratic tribes, conquered in situ, formed by migration of Ikelan families or even other ethnic groups moving into Tuareg controlled communities seeking protection. Sometimes members of rival Kels, defeated in war, were subsumed as lower castes, but usually of higher level than the Ikelan.|$|R
25|$|By January 1, 1808, when Congress banned further imports, South Carolina was {{the only}} state that still allowed {{importation}} of slaves. Congress allowed continued trade only in slaves who were descendants of those currently in the United States. In addition, US citizens could participate financially in the international slave trade and the outfitting of ships for that trade. The <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trade became extremely profitable as demand rose with the expansion of cultivation in the Deep South for cotton and sugar cane crops. Slavery in the United States became, more or less, self-sustaining by natural increase among the current slaves and their descendants.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{during the}} Jefferson {{administration}} prohibited {{the importation of}} slaves, effective 1808, although smuggling (illegal importing) was not unusual. <b>Domestic</b> <b>slave</b> trading, however, continued at a rapid pace, driven by labor demands from the development of cotton plantations in the Deep South. More than one million slaves were sold from the Upper South, which had a surplus of labor, and taken to the Deep South in a forced migration, splitting up many families. New communities of African-American culture were developed in the Deep South, and the total slave population in the South eventually reached 4 million before liberation.|$|E
25|$|By 1808, {{every state}} but South Carolina had {{followed}} Virginia's {{lead from the}} 1780s in banning importation of slaves. By 1808, {{with the growth of}} the <b>domestic</b> <b>slave</b> population enabling development of a large internal slave trade, slaveholders did not mount much resistance to the new law, presumably because the authority of Congress to enact such legislation was expressly authorized by the Constitution, and was fully anticipated during the Constitutional Convention in 1787. Jefferson did not lead the campaign to prohibit the importation of slaves. Historian John Chester Miller rated Jefferson's two major presidential achievements as the Louisiana Purchase and the abolition of the slave trade.|$|E
50|$|When French colonial {{governments were}} established, they stopped {{acquisition}} of new slaves and slave trading in markets, {{but they did}} not remove or free <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> from the Tuareg owners who had acquired their slaves before the French rule started. In the Tuareg society, like with many other ethnic groups in West Africa, slave status was inherited, and the upper strata used <b>slave</b> children for <b>domestic</b> work, at camps and as a dowry gift of servants to the newlyweds.|$|R
25|$|The jury {{ruled against}} Dupuy, {{deciding}} that any agreement with her previous master Condon did not bear on Clay. Because Dupuy refused to return voluntarily to Kentucky, Clay had his agent arrest her. She was imprisoned in Alexandria, Virginia, before Clay arranged for her transport to New Orleans, where he placed {{her with his}} daughter and son-in-law Martin Duralde. Mary Ann Dupuy was sent to join her mother, and they worked as <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves</b> for the Duraldes for another decade.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently, {{they moved}} to Northern Sichuan in the 7th century, and {{subsequently}} to northwest Yunnan in the 14th century. Many of them settled down to become farmers, and local landlords dominated the Pumi economy in Lanping and Lijiang counties. Except for {{a small number of}} common areas, the landlords held large areas of lands and collected rental fees from the peasants. This accounted for at least 50 per cent of the harvest. Pumi landlords and Nakhi chiefs also traded <b>domestic</b> <b>slaves.</b>|$|R
