40|$|Aim: Clinical {{data are}} scarce on flapless guided {{surgery in the}} {{mandible}} using the all-on-four concept. In addition, limited documentation exists on the latter under immediate loading conditions with a pre-fabricated <b>implant</b> <b>bridge.</b> The aim was to provide detailed documentation focusing on clinical and radiographic outcome and complications. Material and methods: Sixteen systemically-healthy non-smoking patients (10 females, 6 males, average age 59 years) with sufficient bone volume in the mandible were operated via flapless guided surgery using the all-on-four concept. Clinical and radiographic data and complications were registered at 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: The overall implant survival rate was 90 % with a trend for higher failure of short implants (p= 0. 098). The mean bone level after 12 months of function was 0. 83 mm with a maximum of 1. 07 mm. Technical complications were common (15 / 16 patients). These mainly related to a misfit between the pre-fabricated prosthesis and abutment(s) (13 / 16 patients). Conclusion: If immediate loading of implants is pursued fabrication of the <b>implant</b> <b>bridge</b> {{should be based on}} actual impression of the implants at the time of surgery and not on their virtual position...|$|E

The same surgical drilling protocol, according to Branemark's procedure, was applied to all the patients. Except for one patient who lost three implants, 18 patients received a fixed Procera® <b>implant</b> <b>bridge</b> and another an overdenture retained by a screwed bar fixed on the four zygomatic implants. The cumulative survival rate after 40 months is 96 %. Although bone augmenting procedures such as onlay grafts and sinus grafts are popular and well-documented, the four zygomatic implants procedure results in less morbidity, shorter delays between anatomical reconstruction and functional rehabilitation and can provide immediate or early loading with immediate function.

A 17 -year-old male with Class III malocclusion with partial anodontia sought dental implant treatment. His expectation was that of Class I occlusion. The challenge in the case was to match the expectation, reality, and the clinical possibilities. Ridge augmentation was performed with a combination of rib graft and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2. Simultaneously, 6 implants (Nobel Biocare™ - Tapered Groovy) were placed in maxillary arch and 10 in the mandible. Simultaneous placement ensured faster and better osseointegration though a mild compromise of the primary stability was observed initially. After adequate healing, Customized Zirconia Procera™ system was used to build the framework. Zirconia crown was cemented to the framework. Radiological and clinical evidence of osseointegration was observed in all 16 dental implants. Successful conversion of Class III to Class I occlusion was achieved with the combination of preprosthetic alveolar ridge augmentation, Procera™ <b>Implant</b> <b>Bridge</b> system. Abnormal angulations and or placement of dental implants would result in failure of the implant. Hence conversion of Class III to Class I occlusion needs complete and complex treatment planning so that the entire masticatory apparatus is sufficiently remodeled.

Twenty-eight implants were inserted following the immediate loading protocol and 26 according a two-stage procedure, depending on the torque value. The cumulative survival rate of short implants was 87 % (n= 54) after a mean time of 47. 72 months (range 33 - 62 months), showing statistically significant differences related to loading protocol (p = 0. 047). Short implants immediately loaded had a higher long-term survival rate (96. 4 %) compared to the other study group (76. 9 %).

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{prevalence}} of unilateral posterior cross-bite in the early to mixed dentition varies between 8 % and 23 % 1 - 5. Unilateral crossbite is characterized by an arch deficiency, and possible asymmetries in the upper or lower arch 6. Early treatment has been recommended because spontaneous correction is unusual and management in the adult dentition can be more complex particularly where the anomaly is severe. 7, 8 Treatment may be made even more complicated in adults due to tooth loss and the presence of a heavily restored dentition. Management in such circumstances invariably involves surgery and protracted orthodontics since satisfactory anchorage for tooth movement cannot be adequately achieved. To overcome anchorage problems the use of both temporary and definitive implants in the area where tooth movement needs to be achieved has been described. 9 This poster describes a case of an adult patient with a marked posterior cross bite on the right and free end saddle in the maxillary left quadrant. Since surgery was declined anchorage to correct the cross bite was achieved by utilising an implant retained bridge in the contra lateral side.

This {{investigation}} aims {{to evaluate}} the changes in stress magnitudes and distributions on Partially Stabilized Zirconia (PS-ZrO(2)) dental <b>implants</b> and <b>bridges</b> and on the mandible caused by fibrous encapsulations during clenching. Materials and methods. Four 3. 26 mm diameter PS-ZrO(2) dental implants with lengths of 12 mm were modelled {{and placed in the}} second premolar and first molar region {{on both sides of the}} mandible model. A rigid zirconia bridge with a thickness of 0. 5 mm connects the PS-ZrO(2) dental implants placed in the second premolar and first molar. Four periodontal ligament (PDL) case studies were examined: PDL in the second premolars; PDL in the first molars; PDL in both the second premolars and first molars; and no PDL present. Results. The results reveal the magnitudes and distributions of stresses on the dental <b>implants</b> and connecting <b>bridges</b> were governed by the PDLs. A significant drop in stress levels were recorded when the PDL encapsulates the roots of the dental implants. Of the four PDL case studies, it was found that when the PDLs are present in both the second premolars and first molars the lowest stress magnitudes are generated. The analysis also revealed that, during the healing process after implant insertion and the result of fibrous encapsulation, the dental implant system will experience a varying amount of stress levels. Conclusion. This study was intended to produce more insight into the influence of the PDL on the changes in stress distribution on the dental implant system during clenching. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The tissue reactions around 509 implants in 97 upper and 71 lower jaws of 146 consecutive patients, rehabilitated by means of partial bridges [...] supported by implants only (60 %) or by the combination of teeth and implants (40 %) [...] were observed longitudinally. The mean number of <b>implants</b> per <b>bridge</b> was 2. 40 (range 1 - 5) for the upper jaw and 2. 06 (range 1 - 5) for the lower jaw respectively. Before loading, a total of 23 fixtures were lost, 15 in the upper and 8 in the lower jaw. This loss could partially be correlated to per- and post-operative complications and to fixture characteristics (length, self-tapping or not). After a loading time of 30 months (range 2 to 77 months), 6 implants, 2 in the upper and 4 in the lower jaw, showed symptoms of non-integration. The cumulative failure rate for the individual fixtures after a 6 -year period reached 5. 7 and 6. 5 % for the upper and lower jaw, respectively. The mean annual marginal bone loss, scored on standardized radiographs, was 0. 9 mm during the 1 st year and 0. 1 mm the following years. This loss in marginal bone height was equal in the upper and lower jaws and not related to the type of occlusal material of the bridges.
