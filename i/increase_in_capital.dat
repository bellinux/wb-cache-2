Joseph White, the third {{shareholder}} in the fledgling steamboat company, {{would remain in}} Philadelphia where his hardware business was located. The basic business plan was this: Elisha Hunt would promote the use of Daniel French's steam engines and then French would build them. The nucleus of a steamboat company had been formed. But before a steamboat could be built the company needed a large <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{statistics}} of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was {{catching up to}} the West. However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> was only surpassed by Japan).|$|E

A generalized model is developed to measure the incremental costs of <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> asset utilization.

40|$|The {{international}} development community has encouraged investment in physical and human capital as {{a precursor to}} economic progress. Recent evidence shows, however, that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> do not always lead to <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> output. We develop a growth model where the allocation and productivity of capital depends on a country's institutions. We find that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> physical and human capital lead to output growth only in countries with good institutions. In countries with bad institutions, <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> lead to negative growth rates because additions to the capital stock tend to be employed in rent-seeking and other socially unproductive activities.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} research about cross section and time series correlations between {{economic growth and}} various economic, social, demographic and political variables. After analyzing these correlations, the paper makes the following conclusions. Exogenous increases {{do not seem to}} cause <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> the rate of technological change, but instead seem to be associated with lower rates of return to capital. Increased openness to international trade speeds up growth and technological change as do an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> scientists and engineers. Countries more open to trade have a higher level of investment and capital growth - which is not associated with a fall in the marginal product of capital. Countries that become more integrated with world markets seem to have a higher marginal product of <b>capital.</b> <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> investment associated with a higher per capita GDP are associated with a fall in the marginal product of <b>capital.</b> <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> investment associated with <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> trade are not. This suggests thatpolicies to encourage more open trading may be as important to growth as additional foreign lending - especially in their cumulative effects - {{and at the same time}} enhance the efficient use of foreign loans.

30|$|Our {{hypothesis}} is that the root of these imbalances {{is related to the}} specificities of the growth model in the periphery and core European countries.
