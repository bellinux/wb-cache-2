(ii) The two extremes: the decision maker <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> an ordering and chooses the maximal and the minimal alternatives. (iii) The top and the top: the decision maker <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> two orderings and he chooses the maximal element from each...|$|R

In a letter to Wellington he accused the Duke to <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> [...] "insidious designs for the infringement of our liberty {{and the introduction of}} Popery into every department of the State". The letter provoked a furious exchange of correspondence and Wellington accused Winchilsea of imputing him with [...] "disgraceful and criminal motives" [...] in setting up King's College London. When Winchilsea refused to retract the remarks, Wellington – by his own admission, [...] "no advocate of duelling" [...] and a virgin duellist – demanded satisfaction in a contest of arms: [...] "I now call upon your lordship to give me that satisfaction for your conduct which a gentleman has a right to require, and which a gentleman never refuses to give." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even medieval Jews {{understood}} {{very well}} that Christianity is avodah zarah of a special type.

Some later authorities took the continuation of that Tosafot to mean that this special type of avodah zarah is forbidden to Jews but permissible to gentiles, so that a non-Jew who engages in Christian worship commits no sin.|$|E
2500|$|In the Gospel of Mark, {{generally}} {{agreed to be}} the earliest Gospel, written around the year 70, Jesus predicts his death three times. Walter Schmithals, noting that this Gospel also contains verses in which Jesus appears to predict his Passion, suggests that these represent the earlier traditions available to the author, and the three death predictions are redactional creations of the author. The setting for the first prediction is somewhere near Caesarea Philippi, immediately after Peter proclaims Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus tells his followers that [...] "the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and {{that he must be}} killed and after three days rise again". When Peter objects, Jesus tells him: [...] "Get behind me, Satan! You do not <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the things of God, but the things of men". (...) ...|$|E

2500|$|Krugman {{has also}} been {{critical}} {{of some of the}} Obama administration's economic policies. He has criticized the Obama stimulus plan as being too small and inadequate given the size of the economy and the banking rescue plan as misdirected; Krugman wrote in The New York Times: [...] "an overwhelming majority [...] believes that the government is spending too much to help large financial institutions. This suggests that the administration's money-for-nothing financial policy will eventually deplete its political capital." [...] In particular, he considered the Obama administration's actions to prop up the US financial system in 2009 to be impractical and unduly favorable to Wall Street bankers. In anticipation of President Obama's Job Summit in December 2009, Krugman said in a Fresh Dialogues interview, [...] "This jobs summit can't be an empty exercise...he can't come out with a proposal for $10 or $20Billion of stuff because people will view that as a joke. There has to be a significant job proposal...I <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> something like $300Billion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{past and}} present are {{constantly}} intertwined in The House in Paris, and the middle section, [...] "The Past," [...] is an imagined history. Characters in the past already <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> future characters and events. For example, hours after conceiving Leopold, Karen thinks about her son as if he already exists: [...] "the idea of you, Leopold, began to be present with her." [...] This thought of Karen's is, in the end, Leopold's, since he imagines these events; the reader learns Leopold's past while he does, [...] "simultaneously gaining information from disconnected fragments derived {{from a combination of}} hints and opinions filtered through all he experiences in the house in Paris." [...] Bowen herself discussed the [...] "bendability" [...] of time in an essay published in 1951, in which she discusses [...] "factitious memory": [...] "one route to the past (or the idea of the past) is factitious memory. That is to say, by art we are made to seem to remember that which we have not actually known." ...|$|E
2500|$|Section 50 {{allows a}} police officer to {{apprehend}} any person who (i) he reasonably believes will be charged with or who (ii) he reasonably suspects of being guilty of any offence for which the sentence is fixed by law or for which a person may be sentenced to imprisonment or if {{the service of a}} summons is impracticable. The constitutionality of this provision was reviewed in Yeung May-wan and Others v. HKSAR. The Court held that, in order to be compatible with Article 28 of the Basic Law, the first limb must be read as encompassing the second and did not eliminate the requirement for reasonable suspicion of guilt. The suspicion of guilt must be objectively reasonable, and the facts known by the police officer must be such that, if true, they would constitute all the elements of the offence in question. On the facts of that case, it was held that the arrests were not lawful and constituted false imprisonment as the police officers did not <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the element of [...] "without lawful excuse" [...] when arresting the Falun Gong protestors for obstruction of public place.|$|E

2500|$|The Belgian philosopher of law Frank van Dun is {{one among}} those who are elaborating a secular {{conception}} of natural law in the liberal tradition. Libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard argues that [...] "the very existence of a natural law discoverable by reason is a potentially powerful threat to the status quo and a standing reproach to the reign of blindly traditional custom or the arbitrary will of the State apparatus." [...] Ludwig von Mises states that he relaid the general sociological and economic foundations of the liberal doctrine upon utilitarianism, rather than natural law, but R.A. Gonce argues that [...] "the reality of the argument constituting his system overwhelms his denial." [...] Murray Rothbard, however, says that Gonce makes a lot of errors and distortions in the analysis of Mises's works, including making confusions about the term which Mises uses to refer to scientific laws, [...] "laws of nature", saying it characterizes Mises as a natural law philosopher. David Gordon notes, [...] "When most people speak of natural law, what they <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> is the contention that morality can be derived from human nature. If human beings are rational animals of such-and-such a sort, then the moral virtues are...(filling in the blanks is the difficult part)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The House of Lords (Lord Porter, Lord Normand, Lord Oaksey, Lord Reid and Lord Radcliffe) {{unanimously}} {{found that}} there was no negligence, although most considered it a close call based on whether the reasonable person would foresee this as anything more than an extremely remote risk. [...] Most of the Lords agreed that the key issue was that of making the key question one of determining the fact of what the reasonable person would <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> regarding assumption of this risk. [...] Facts may be determined by judges, but may also be determined by lesser mortals in juries. [...] This was not considered to be a point of law, which is the province of judges. [...] In this case the risk was considered (just) too remote for the reasonable person, in spite of the observation by Lord Porter that hitting a ball out of the ground was an objective of the game, [...] "and indeed, one which the batsman would wish to bring about". The Lords believed there were policy implications in terms of the message of what liability would have meant in creating restrictions in what we can do in our everyday lives in an urbanised modern society.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
