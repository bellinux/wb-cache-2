5|$|Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, {{diamagnetic}} metal, {{though most}} common commercial grades {{of the metal}} have a <b>dull</b> <b>finish.</b> It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150°C. Above 210°C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5°C) and boiling points (907°C). The melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often {{not considered to be}} transition metals {{like the rest of the}} d-block metals are.|$|E
500|$|Group 12 {{elements}} are all soft, diamagnetic, divalent metals. They {{have the lowest}} melting points among all transition metals. Zinc is bluish-white and lustrous, though most common commercial grades of the metal have a <b>dull</b> <b>finish.</b> Zinc is also referred to in nonscientific contexts as spelter. Cadmium is soft, malleable, ductile, and with a bluish-white color. [...] Mercury is a liquid, heavy, silvery-white metal. It is the only common liquid metal at ordinary temperatures, and as compared to other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity.|$|E
2500|$|Architectural {{elements}} {{outlined by}} Conrad {{to achieve this}} goal included: brick construction over timber, with bare treatments to interior walls; large windows {{at the rear of the}} church and side windows on the chancel (rather than behind the altar); low-toned cathedral glass in simple leaded design where stained glass was not affordable, naves that were long rather than wide, and internal roofing wholly of wood, with heavy timber for open trussed roofs, stained with a <b>dull</b> <b>finish</b> to create [...] "an interesting and dignified treatment". Such elements are readily apparent at St Paul's and other churches of the 1920s designed by Atkinson and Conrad. In particular, the use of substantial timber roof trussing in the nave (a word derived from the Latin word navis for ship), resembling the interior of a ship's hull, expressed the longstanding symbolism of the church as a ship, guiding its members to safe harbour.|$|E
50|$|Dull {{was called}} up to the majors {{for the first time}} on September 1, 2015, and made his major league debut that night, {{pitching}} one inning of relief against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. <b>Dull</b> <b>finished</b> the 2015 season with 13 appearances. The following season, Dull began the season in the bullpen and was a mainstay, appearing in 70 games while going 5-5 with a 2.42 ERA. In 2017, Dull was placed on the disabled list at the end of May due to a right knee strain.|$|R

50|$|The {{finish of}} the rolled product is {{controlled}} by using rolls having a variety of surface finishes designed to impart the desired finish to the product. Roll finishes range from ground and polished rolls to impart a bright finish, to shot-blasted or electric-discharged textured rolls that produce a <b>dull,</b> velvety <b>finish</b> on the steel surface.|$|R

50|$|The 10030 {{subseries}} {{featured a}} new lightweight {{stainless steel body}} design, with a reduced number of bodyside corrugations and <b>dull</b> <b>finish.</b> A new bolsterless bogie was used. Internally, seat width was increased from 425 mm to 450 mm.|$|E
50|$|The secrete {{was usually}} a small {{skull-cap}} of iron or steel pierced around its rim. The piercing {{allowed it to}} be sewn into {{the inside of a}} hat. The secrete was then undetectable to any observer, but offered considerably more protection from edged weapons than could a felt hat alone. Many different designs were used, some had solid domes, others were ring-shaped with a scalloped lower edge, presumably to save weight. A few exceptional examples had a folding cage of bars, which could be drawn down to afford protection to the face when in action. A further type of head protection which could be considered to fall under the same category, as it was intended to deceive the observer and mimic civilian headgear, was an entire broad-brimmed hat made of iron or steel. Such hat-helmets were either covered in cloth, or blackened and given a <b>dulled</b> <b>finish</b> so as to resemble felt. King Charles I of England is recorded as possessing such a helmet.|$|R
50|$|Juice dust - An {{advanced}} type of daub, {{it may be}} used to make an ad hoc juiced deck. Like daub, it {{also allows}} a player to mark someone else's deck, on the fly, while being watched. The main advantages of juice dust are that it will not <b>dull</b> the <b>finish</b> of the cards and that it works on both paper and 100% plastic playing cards.|$|R
50|$|Translites {{are created}} by {{printing}} photographic images or computer-rendered images onto the material using large-format printers. Many existing translites have been created in a photographic darkroom by a mural enlarger projecting onto a strip of film up to 32 ft wide. These pieces are assembled into the final size by seaming. A matte lacquer is often added to <b>dull</b> the <b>finish,</b> to mitigate stage lighting reflections.|$|R

50|$|Matte polish is like regular polish, {{but has a}} {{purposely}} <b>dull</b> <b>finish</b> {{rather than}} a shine. It can be purchased as a regular base coat in ranges of different colors. Matte nail polish {{can also be found}} in a top coat. Matte top coat is most useful for painting over any dry base color, giving it a different appearance. The matte top coat polish will dull the shine from a regular base coat polish. Matte polish has become very popular through the years, particularly since it can be used in nail art applications, where designs can be created on the nail using the contrast of both shiny and matte surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Charmeuse (...) is a {{lightweight}} fabric woven with a satin weave, {{in which the}} warp threads cross over four {{or more of the}} backing (weft) threads. These float threads give the front of the fabric a smooth finish—lustrous and reflective—whereas the back has a <b>dull</b> <b>finish.</b> It can be made of silk or a synthetic lookalike such as polyester. Silk charmeuse is more expensive and delicate but is softer and a better insulator. [...] Polyester charmeuse is cheaper and can often withstand machine washing, but it does not breathe as well as silk. Charmeuse differs from plain satin in that charmeuse has a different ratio of float (face) threads.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 1959, Topps began {{permitting}} the printing of cards by a printer (Benco) in Venezuela {{on account of}} it being a viable baseball market. The most significant difference from the U.S. issue was the card stock quality used for the Venezuelan cards. Two distinctly different card stocks were used (one with gray backs, the other with cream backs), and both were of much lower grade. Cards from this set have a <b>duller</b> <b>finish</b> on the front due to no gloss being applied. Approximately half of the set has a copyright designation which states the card was printed in the US, while the other half state 'Impreso en Venezuela por Benco CA'. The 1959 Venezuelan set features cards 1-198 [...] from their U.S. counterpart. (It has been long believed that the set consisted of only 196 cards, however, {{it has been found}} to have been incorrectly documented for years with card #198 having been validated by independent third-party agency PSA as being from the set). Size: 2.5 × 3.5 inches.|$|R
50|$|Reflected {{light off}} the back of the card will reveal cut-out work (scratches or white ink), as well as many inks or {{solutions}} that tend to <b>dull</b> the <b>finish</b> on playing cards because they are alcohol-based. Only the highest quality solutions will not burn the finish of cards. Placing a drop of alcohol on a card and then looking at the finish by reflecting light {{off the back}} reveals the dulling effect that these cheap solutions can cause.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the finish}} {{of choice for}} most briar tobacco or smoking pipes. It {{produces}} a high gloss finish when buffed on to wood. This <b>finish</b> <b>dulls</b> with time rather than flaking off (as {{is the case with}} most other finishes used).|$|R

5000|$|The {{interior}} {{features a}} single nave that is capped with an oak ceiling that rises 65 ft above the floor. [...] The ceiling {{is supported by}} six hammer beam trusses. The base of each truss is decorated with a quatrefoil circular infill. The Carrara marble high altar features a statue of St. Patrick in its central tower. The side altar on the left features a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the side altar on the left a statue of St. Joseph. The altars and the reredoses behind them have a polished finish that contrasts with the rather <b>dull</b> <b>finish</b> of the statues. [...] Across {{the front of the}} altar platform is an altar rail that is also executed in marble. The bronze gates in the center are a later addition. Stained glass windows line the nave walls. Love of God, country and family is visibly displayed in the stained glass windows that adorn the church. The craftsmanship of the church windows was the creation of Italian glass masters which had been commissioned on behalf of families residing in Imogene. The Stations of the Cross are composed of mosaic and marble and are imported from Venice. The Pietà statue from the old church that was donated by Father Hayes in 1910 remains in the church.|$|E
50|$|Though {{described}} in the Office of Strategic Services catalogue as {{a cross between a}} machete and a bolo, it was actually based on the Royal Welsh Fusiliers Trench Knife of World War I, and was designed as a pure combat knife. It has a broad, leaf-shaped blade sharpened the full length on one side, and from the tip to half of the other side. The entire blade is coated with a <b>dull</b> matte <b>finish</b> to prevent detection at night from stray reflections.|$|R
50|$|Acrylic paints with gloss or matte {{finishes}} are common, {{although a}} satin (semi-matte) sheen is most common.

5000|$|When the U.S. became {{involved}} in World War II, the U.S. government requested contracts to supply [...]38 revolvers required for arming security personnel charged with the security of government buildings, shipyards, and defense plant installations against sabotage or theft. Commencing in 1941, small quantities of the [...]38 Colt Official Police were procured directly from the Defense Supplies Corporation (DSC). When government purchasing officials objected to production delays of the OP, {{as well as the}} unit cost, Colt responded by simplifying the gun. Savings were achieved by eliminating all unnecessary exterior polishing operations, substituting a smooth-face trigger and hammer, and fitting the gun with simplified checkered wood grips with the Colt medallion; the latter was soon replaced by 'Coltwood' molded plastic grips. Instead of the normal bluing, the revolver was given a <b>dull</b> parkerized <b>finish.</b> Dubbed the Colt Commando, the weapon was primarily used to arm units of Military police, security guards at U.S. defense plant installations and shipyards, as well as limited clandestine issue to agencies involved in overseas espionage and military intelligence.|$|R

50|$|Polished {{concrete}} {{floors are}} considered low-maintenance, {{as they are}} more durable and easier to clean than many flooring options. Its high coefficient of friction can make it non-slippery. Polished concrete reduces dust mite and allergen problems, and does not support mold growth. Anecdotal evidence suggests highly reflective polished concrete reduces lighting needs and can improve natural lighting. Polished concrete flooring is hard wearing and will not chip or dent like softer surfaces such as timber and tiles. Polished concrete is easily maintained {{with the use of}} clean water or a neutral balance PH cleaner. There are also many cleaners designed for the proper maintenance of polished concrete available. There is never a need for wax to be added as it will only <b>dull</b> the <b>finish.</b> A concrete floor that has been hardened and polished will have an extremely long life expectancy compared to other flooring. For example, Epoxy has a short life span of 1 to 5 years and easily peels,some tile floors may only last 10-20 years, but a polished concrete floor that has been properly maintained may give 100+ years of service.|$|R
