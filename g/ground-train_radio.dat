In Europe, the ground-train communications are currently carried out by the GSM-R communication system, but the next generation of <b>ground-train</b> <b>radio</b> which could be based on OFDM solutions is already discussed. Then, we worked on the susceptibility of OFDM communication signals to the EM transient interferences which are systematically present in the railway EM environment. To achieve this susceptibility analysis, we select an IEEE 802. 11 n communication network and we analyzed its performances in the presence of transient EM interferences. The transient interferences present in the railway environment, were characterized in the literature as signals of short duration, variable period and broadband. Accordingly, the time interval between the successive transient signals and their time duration were used as main characteristics in order to study their impact on the achieved bit rate of the communications. A set of measurements was performed within a controlled environment to evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802. 11 n communication network in presence of such interference signals...|$|E
