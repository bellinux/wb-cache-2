The addition of the <b>gold</b> <b>compound,</b> in vitro, resulted in the inhibition ofhepatic S-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and ethylmorphine N-demethylase activities. There was also a slight decrease in cyto-chrome P- 4 S 0 content. Gold was a moncompetitive inhibitor of both 6 -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ethylmorphime N-demethylase activities. Gold sodium thiomalate, administered acutely, altered heme biosynthetic pathway enzymes in erythrocytes, liver, and kidney. Erythrocyte -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity was decreased with a concomitant increase in protoporphyrin content. In the liver 5 -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase activities were significantly inhibited and the microsomal heme content was significantly decreased. In the kidney, the major site of gold deposition, the activities of 5 -aminolevulinic acid synthase, -amimolevulinic acid dehydratase, and ferrochelatase were markedly inhibited and total porphyrin content was markedly decreased...|$|R

40|$|A {{hallmark}} of cancer cells is {{their ability to}} evade apoptosis and mitochondria {{play a critical role}} in this process. Delineating mitochondrial differences between normal and cancer cells has proven challenging due to the lack of matched cell lines. Here, we compare two matched liver progenitor cell (LPC) lines, one non-tumorigenic [p 53 -immortalized liver (PIL) 4] and the other tumorigenic (PIL 2). Analysis of these cell lines and a p 53 wild-type non-tumorigenic cell line [bipotential murine oval liver (BMOL) ] revealed an increase in expression of genes encoding the antiapoptotic proteins cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP) 1 and yes associate protein in the PIL 2 cells, which resulted in an increase in the protein encoded by these genes. PIL 2 cells have higher mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) compared with PIL 4 and BMOL and had greater levels of reactive oxygen species, despite the fact that the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, manganese superoxide disumutase, was elevated at transcript and protein levels. Taken together, these results may account for the observed resistance of PIL 2 cells to apoptotic stimuli compared with PIL 4. We tested a new <b>gold</b> <b>compound</b> to show that hyperpolarized ??m led to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of PIL 2 cells. This compound selectively induces apoptosis in PIL 2 cells but not in PIL 4 or BMOL. The <b>gold</b> <b>compound</b> depolarized the ??m, depleted the adenosine triphosphate pool and activated caspase- 3 and caspase- 9, suggesting that apoptosis was mediated via mitochondria. This investigation shows that the non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic LPCs are useful models to delineate the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in tumorigenesis and for the future development of mitochondria-targeted chemotherapeutics that selectively target tumor cells.
