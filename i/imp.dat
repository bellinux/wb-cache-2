5|$|Power: A New Social Analysis by Bertrand Russell (1st <b>imp.</b> London 1938, Allen & Unwin, 328 pp.) {{is a work}} {{in social}} {{philosophy}} written by Bertrand Russell. Power, for Russell, is one's ability to achieve goals. In particular, Russell has in mind social power, that is, power over people.|$|E
5|$|Spells {{are cast}} using mana, not gold {{as in the}} first game. Spells include healing creatures, {{creating}} Imps, and summoning all creatures to a particular location. There are two grades of each spell, upgraded in the Library, the higher grade version being more powerful. For example, an upgraded Create <b>Imp</b> spell summons a level four <b>Imp,</b> whereas the normal version summons a level one <b>Imp.</b> As with the first game, the player can possess a creature and interact with the world from its perspective using its abilities. A special spell {{is the ability to}} summon Horny to assist the player for a short period. In the Campaign mode, it requires the assembling of the talisman, pieces of which are obtained through the discovery of bonus levels. Mana vaults may be scattered across certain levels; these may be claimed to increase mana generation. Other magical items are special items that provide a specific benefit to the player. These include healing all creatures, revealing the map, and locating a hidden level. There are five hidden levels based on mini games such as golf, bowling, and duck shooting.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 <b>Imp.</b> gal.) internally and 800 l (176 <b>Imp.</b> gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the election, Dato' Onn Ja'afar {{had changed}} his approach, forming the Parti Negara after <b>IMP</b> {{suffered}} crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the Parti Negara failed to shake the Alliance's grip on power. However, some believe Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E

5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six <b>Imp</b> rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} de Saulles in 1903 {{had led to}} the {{abolition}} of the post of Engraver, and coins for George V, who took the throne on Edward's death in 1910, were subject to a design competition won by Bertram Mackennal, who also prepared the medal for the Coronation. The King apparently liked his work, as he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1911 and knighted in 1921. The inscription around the left-facing bust reads GEORGIVS V DEI GRA BRITT OMN REX FID DEF IND <b>IMP,</b> while no significant change was made to the reverse design. The new bronze coins were made current by proclamation dated 28 November 1910, effective 1 January 1911.|$|E
40|$|Innovation {{management}} practices (<b>IMPs)</b> represent the codiﬁcation of innovation research and management experience, and offer {{the potential to}} improve innovation performance. Studies suggest limited awareness of <b>IMPs</b> amongst practitioners, and even lower rates of application, and we know little of their perceived importance or effectiveness in different industries. Our paper assesses the use of eight functional groups of <b>IMPs</b> within and across sectors, drawing on a sample of 292 valid responses, based on survey data and associated and validated case studies. Overall, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant variation in usage patterns across sectors and {{a positive relationship between}} the use of <b>IMPs</b> and innovation outcomes. However, only {{a very small number of}} innovation {{management practices}} can be considered to be universally positive, including external technology intelligence gathering, and technology and product portfolio management. We ﬁnd that the use and effectiveness of most <b>IMPs</b> varies by industry. This suggests there is signiﬁcant potential for the more widespread application of some <b>IMPs,</b> but that managers must be highly selective...|$|R
40|$|Though {{there is}} much work on how {{inconsistency}} in databases should be managed, {{there is good reason}} to believe that end users will want to bring their domain expertise and needs to bear in how to deal with inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose the concept of inconsistency management policies (<b>IMPs).</b> We show that <b>IMPs</b> are rich enough to specify many types of inconsistency management methods proposed previously, but provide end users with tools that allow them to use the policies that they want. Our policies are also capable of allowing inconsistency to persist in the database or of eliminating more than a minimal subset of tuples involved in the inconsistency. We present a formal axiomatic definition of <b>IMPs</b> and present appropriate complexity results, together with results linking different <b>IMPs</b> together. We extend the relational algebra (RA) to incorporate <b>IMPs</b> and present theoretical results showing how <b>IMPs</b> and classical RA operators interact...|$|R

5|$|Three Biograph titles, The Usurer (August 15, 1910), The Affair of an Egg (September 1, 1910), and Examination Day at School (September 2, 1910), and two <b>IMP</b> titles, At the Duke's Command (February 6, 1911) and From the Bottom of the Sea (October 20, 1911), {{have been}} erroneously listed in Mary Pickford filmographies. Pickford {{historian}} Christel Schmidt has {{confirmed that the}} actress {{does not appear in}} these films. The Internet Movie Database lists Pickford as appearing in the Biograph shorts entitled Mrs. Jones Entertains (January 9, 1909), The Fascinating Mrs. Francis (January 21, 1909) and The Deception (March 22, 1909). However, Pickford did not begin with Biograph until the end of April 1909.|$|E
5|$|Pickford {{was born}} Gladys Louise Smith in Toronto and began acting {{on stage in}} 1900. She started her film career in the United States in 1909. Initially with the Biograph film company, {{she moved to the}} Independent Motion Picture Company (<b>IMP)</b> in 1911, then briefly to the Majestic Film Company later that same year, {{followed}} by a return to Biograph in 1912. After appearing in over 150 short films during her years with these studios she began working in features with Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, a studio which eventually became part of Paramount Pictures. By 1916 Pickford's popularity had climbed to the point that she was awarded a contract that made her a partner with Zukor and allowed her to produce her own films. In 1919 Pickford teamed with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks to create United Artists, an organization designed to distribute their own films. Following the release of Secrets (1933) Pickford retired from acting in motion pictures. However, she remained active as a producer for several years afterwards. She sold her stock in United Artists in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Rootes {{had always}} been insufficiently capitalised, and losses {{resulting}} from a damaging thirteen-week strike at one of its subsidiaries, British & Light Steel Pressings, coupled with the expense of launching the Hillman <b>Imp,</b> meant that by 1964 the company was in serious financial difficulties. At the same time, Chrysler was looking to boost its presence in Europe, and so a deal was struck in June 1964 in which Chrysler paid £12.3 million ($34.44 million) for a large stake in Rootes, although not a controlling one. As part of the agreement Chrysler committed not to acquire a majority of Rootes voting shares without {{the approval of the}} UK government, which was keen not to see any further American ownership of the UK motor industry. In 1967 Minister of Technology Anthony Wedgewood Benn approached BMH and Leyland to see if they would buy out Chrysler and Rootes and keep the company British, but neither had the resources to do so. Later that year Chrysler was allowed to acquire a controlling interest in Rootes for a further investment of £20 million.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{large number}} of oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved {{structural}} motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit <b>IMP</b> dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms.|$|E
5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, they truly care about one another, saying that had they met before they died, they would have fallen in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and shackle bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an <b>imp</b> or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair on her back. After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them along on missions, though she does not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not being able to do anything with her body. Otonashi helps fulfill most of her wishes that include many things she saw on TV when she was alive, although it is Hinata who fulfills her last desire to be married by proposing to her.|$|E

40|$|Transmission of a {{nerve impulse}} at neuromuscular and other synapses is an {{extremely}} brief event. By using rapid-freezing and cryofracture techniques in the electric organ of Torpedo, synaptic transmission {{was found to be}} accompanied by significant changes affecting the postsynaptic membrane for a few milliseconds. In the replicas, the protoplasmic leaflet of this membrane was seen to contain intramembrane particles (<b>IMPs)</b> of two different forms, globular and elongated. Globular <b>IMPs</b> had a mean diameter of 8. 8 nm; they were the most frequently found (80 % in unstimulated specimens). Elongated <b>IMPs</b> had a major diameter of 17. 9 nm, about twice that of globular <b>IMPs.</b> Transmission of a single nerve impulse was accompanied by a marked {{decrease in the number of}} globular <b>IMPs</b> and by an increase in the number of elongated <b>IMPs,</b> as if there were a coalescence of two adjacent round particles to form an elongated one. These changes started soon after the electrical stimulus and lasted for approximately 3 ms. <b>IMPs</b> in the postsynaptic protoplasmic face are thought to correspond to a certain proportion of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that were extracted with this leaflet during the fracture process. The phenomenon described here reflects an abrupt change in the membrane, probably linked to activation of the acetylcholine nicotinic receptors...|$|R
