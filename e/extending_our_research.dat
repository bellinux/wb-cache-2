40|$|Background: Social {{functioning}} is {{an important}} treatment outcome for psychosis, and yet, we know little about its relationship to trauma despite high rates of trauma in people with psychosis. Childhood trauma is likely to disrupt the acquisition of interpersonal relatedness skills including the desire for affiliation and thus lead to impaired social functioning in adulthood. Aims: We hypothesized that childhood trauma would be a predictor of poor social functioning for adults with psychosis and that further trauma in adulthood would moderate this relationship. Method: A first-episode psychosis sample aged 15 – 65 years (N = 233) completed measures of social functioning (Lehman’s Quality of Life Interview and Strauss Carpenter Functioning Scale) and trauma (Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey), as well as clinical assessments. Results: Childhood trauma (any type) was associated with poorer premorbid functioning and was experienced by 61 % of our sample. There were no associations with clinical symptoms. Interpersonal trauma in childhood {{was a significant predictor}} of social functioning satisfaction in adulthood, but this was not the case for interpersonal trauma in adulthood. However, 45 % of adults who reported childhood interpersonal trauma also experienced adulthood interpersonal trauma. Conclusion: Our results emphasize the importance of early relationship experience such as interpersonal trauma, on the social functioning of adults with psychosis. We recommend <b>extending</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> by examining the impact of interpersonal childhood trauma on occupational functioning in psychosis...|$|E

This perspective echoes the conception upon which the study of regime of knowledge production has to be considered in its social and political composition (Pestre, 2003). Crossing a perspective in terms of projects ecology (Grabher, 2004) and a sociological survey of researchers’ involvement in innovation regime, it seems particularly interesting to shed light on the research dynamics on biofuels and bioenergies since the promise of bioenergy has been considered by many and until today as the concretisation of a green future, but has also generated controversies and debates on the sustainability of this techno-economic promise.

We can subdivide the results presented here into two categories: {{the first one}} focusing on electronic fine structure and effect of the chemical bonds on molecular core-levels {{and the other one}} dealing with nuclear dynamics induced by creation of a core hole. In our research we have mostly used synchrotron radiation based techniques such as X-ray Photoelectron (XPS), X-ray Absorption (XAS), normal and Resonant Auger (AES and RAS, respectively) and Energy-Selected Auger Electron PhotoIon COincidence (ES-AEPICO) spectroscopies. We have demonstrated that resonant Auger spectroscopy can be used to aid interpretation of the features observed in XAS for Rydberg structures in the case of Cl 2 and C 1 s− 1 π* 1 states of allene molecules. The combined use of high-resolution spectroscopy with ab initio calculations can help the interpretation of strongly overlapped spectral features and disentangle their complex profiles. This approach enabled us to determine the differences in the lifetimes for core-hole 2 p sublevels of Cl 2 which are caused by the presence of the chemical bond. We have shown that contribution in terms of the Mulliken population of valence molecular orbitals is a determining factor for resonant enhancement of different final states and fragmentation patterns reached after resonant Auger decays in N 2 O. We have also performed a systematic study of the dependence of the C 1 s resonant Auger kinetic energies on the presence of different substituents in CH 3 X compounds. For the first time we have studied possible isomerization reaction induced by core excitation of acetylacetone. We could observe a new spectral feature in the resonant Auger decay spectra which we interpreted as a signature of core-excitation-induced keto-enol tautomerism...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of phenomenological {{consequences}} of theoretical models of Quantum Gravity. In particular, this work is focused on the study of possible violations of Lorentz invariance, which may arise if, owing to quantum gravity effects, the high-energy structure of the spacetime is different from the smooth, continuous one we are used to in our low-energy world. After {{a brief description of the}} most widely known models accounting for Lorentz invariance violations, particular focus will be given to astrophysical tests of Lorentz invariance. These are motivated by the fact that some astrophysical objects are able to accelerate particles to extremely high energies, unreachable to terrestrial experiments. This consideration naturally leads us to look at the radiation of the Crab Nebula, one of the most powerful objects in our Galaxy. We first understand how the violation of Lorentz invariance affects the physical processes at the basis of the production of electromagnetic radiation by this object. Then, we compare our prediction for the Lorentz violating spectrum to observational data, exploiting the vast multi-wavelength information on the Crab Nebula radiation. Furthermore, we take advantage of the recent development of new technology to improve on our analysis of the Crab Nebula radiation by <b>extending</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> to the effects of Lorentz violation onto hard X-ray polarization. After this investigation we shall move to study the physics of cosmic rays, the most energetic particles ever experienced on Earth. Our interest in this physics is twofold: on the one hand, we want to understand more about their properties and their propagation. To this aim, we develop a new model of propagation for cosmic rays in our Galaxy, exploiting as much as possible of the multi-channel information available at present. On the other hand, according to the multi-channel perspective, we try to understand the consequences of Lorentz symmetry violation on the properties of ultra-highenergy cosmic rays...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{exploited}} approaches in scientific methodology is studying concepts by using a case study. In chemistry, a case study appears in finding a specific molecular and/or reaction system by which the investigated problem can be observed directly "on substance". Thus, the stu- died problem becomes a concrete system, rather than an abstract concept. Most case-study models are designed specifically to deepen one or another chemical problem. However, there exist (although rarely) models, which afford their universality, i. e. could serve for modeling of qui- te different, and even epistemologically independent concepts. Systematic investigations of the chemistry of C-nitroso compounds performed in our Laboratory in last few years, {{have resulted in the}} discovery that such molecular system may be used as a model for studying a series of basic chemical concepts; selectivity, self-assembly, solid-state reaction mechanisms, photochromism and molecular logics. Since it is known that C-nitroso compounds under specific conditions dime- rize by forming new N=N bond (Scheme 1), the reaction can be used for studying selectivity in the formation of dimers between different nitroso monomers (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The system is very convenient for investigation of the structure-selectivity relations. 6 It has already been established, especially in the work of Brian Gowenlock, that nitroso compounds in crystal form appear as di- mers. These discoveries inspired us to investigate the kinetics and mechanism of dimerization of nitroso monomers in solid state, because the freshly sublimed nitrosoaromatic compounds appear as crystals of monomers. Consequently, this molecular system is a perfect case-study model for concepts of solid-state reactions, self-organizations in the crystalline forms (Fig. 3), {{as well as for the}} 8, 13 <b>Extending</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> of self-organization of nitroso compounds to two-dimensional systems (Fig. 4), we have also de- monstrated the ability of such molecules to be models for formation of self-assembly bilayers (Fig. 5), and for direct observations of 2 D crystallizations. 12 The discovery of photodissociation of crystallized dimers observed by the change in color, also demonstrated that this molecular system could be one of the basic models for molecular logic gates (Fig. 7). 16 From the presented examples it follows that this molecular model of dimerizations of aromatic nitroso compounds affords its epistemic universality. <br...|$|E

During ICALT, I had many discussions, some leading to concrete ideas for collaborations. Besides presenting a paper, I was also organizing the Doctoral Consortium and a workshop on “Design Centered and Personalized Learning in Liquid and Ubiquitous Learning Places – Future Visions and Practical Implementations”. Both events were very well received, with lot of discussion during and after the events (for the workshop, we received an award for “Outstanding Performance” as workshop organizers from the general co-chairs of ICALT). While today’s learning management systems (LMSs) provide lot of support for teachers to assist them in holding online courses, they typically do not consider students’ individual differences in the composition and structure of courses. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism for extending LMSs’ functionality to provide learners with courses that fit their individual learning styles, using adaptive sorting and adaptive annotation in order to highlight the learning objects (LOs) that support students’ learning process the best. The mechanism enables teachers to add adaptivity to their already existing courses, using a flexible course structure in order to avoid limiting the richness of the learning resources and materials. Besides being flexible to teachers’ needs, the adaptive mechanism aims at asking teachers for as little as possible additional effort when using it, requiring teachers only to choose the corresponding type of LO when creating an LO in the authoring tool of the LMS...|$|E

40|$|Bacteria of the genus Rhizobium play a very {{important}} role in agriculture by inducing nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of legumes. Root nodule symbiosis enables nitrogen‐fixing bacteria (Rhizobium) to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that is directly available for plant growth. This symbiosis can relieve the requirements for added nitrogenous fertilizer during the growth of leguminous crops. Research on legume-rhizobium symbioses has emphasized fitness benefits to plants but in our research, we take a different vantage point, focusing on the Parasponia-rhizobium symbiosis. Parasponia is the only non-legume plant capable of establishing mutualistic relation with rhizobia. This study will provide background knowledge for use in applied objectives as well as yielding a wealth of fundamental knowledge with wide implications from rhizobium symbiosis evolution. This thesis describes my research on genetic constrains that determine rhizobium-root nodule formation. To identify these constraints we used Parasponia anadersnii as only non-legume capable to establish nitrogen fixing rhizobium symbiosis. Our main attempt in this thesis was to find the genetic constraints using Parasponia as a key and reconstruct an auto active symbiotic signaling cascade in the non- legume plants. In line with this, a simple and efficient hairy root transformation method was established in this thesis. To determine the genetic elements that underlie the rhizobium symbiosis, we aimed to compare Parasponia with closest non nodulating specious, Trema tomentosa. To do so, we also developed an efficient genetic transformation method for Trema mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In different attempt we implemented in a physiological study on symbiotic response of Parasponia to nitrate. This research opened a novel view on the Parasponia-rhizobium symbiosis by discovering a different mechanism that control root nodule formation in Parasponia in compare with legumes. We discovered that Parasponai-rhizbium symbiosis is not evolved to regulate the nodule number in presence of the nitrate. According to the fact that Parasponia and legumes are remotely related, it was hypothesized that, Parasponia-rhizobium symbiosis evolved independently. Therefore we put forward our attempt to determine the genes required for nodule formation in Parasponia, by <b>extending</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> on symbiotic genes which are available in non nodulating plants with different function, namely NSP 1 and NSP 2. We showed that NSP 1 and NSP 2 are involved in both nodulation and mycorrhization. This result highlight the idea that RN and AM symbiosis are conserved in part of the pathway and probably bifurcates into two branches by NSP transcription factor allowing specific activation of nodulation or mycorrhization. Aiming to know the role of hormones in symbiotic behavior, we focused on ethylene as a negative regulator of nodule formation in legumes. We found the negative effect of ethylene on root nodulation of Parasponia. For the first time we reported a hyper nodulation (20 fold nodule number in compare with control plants) phenotype in Parasponia by performing knocked down mutant of EIN 2 gene. Finally, the results obtained in this study provide new insight into the fact that rhizobium symbiosis are under tight genetic constraints that guide endosymbiosis in remotely evolved host plants, legumes and Parasponia...|$|E

40|$|Conflict {{mediation}} is {{a structured}} intervention by an impartial mediator, which aims at the conflict resolution by facilitating communication between {{two or more}} conflict parties (e. g., Kressel, 2006; Moore, 2003). Impartiality of the mediator means that she or he is not involved and does not take sides in the conflict. The general aim of mediation usually encompasses a mutually satisfactory solution of the conflict, an improvement (or satisfactory termination) of the relation of conflict parties, and an empowering and satisfactory mediation process (e. g., Bush & Folger, 2004; Herrman, 2006; Wall & Dunne, 2012). Mediation is applied in various fields of intergroup conflict. The fields of labor conflict, environmental conflict, or international conflict {{are among the most}} prominent ones (e. g., Bercovitch & Fretter, 2007; Bingham et al., 2002; DeRouen et al., 2011; Hiltrop, 1989; LaPlant Turkiewicz & Allen, 2014). With three experiments in three different contexts, we confirmed the hypothesis that mediation increases positive attitudes between groups in conflict. While most of the prior research on mediation effectiveness lacked either internal or external validity, we evaluated mediation with strong concerns for both. Applying experimental designs under controlled conditions supported the internal validity of our results. Having professional mediators conduct semi-structured mediations in real conflicts supported the external validity of our results (cf. Shadish et al., 2002). By applying other success measures than the common agreement rate, we furthermore increased the construct validity (cf. McGillis, 1997). While in our studies the agreement rate did not differentiate between experimental and control condition, we could detect differences in intergroup relations. Finally, by conducting structural equation modeling, we increased the reliability of our results (cf. Brown, 2006). With the three studies, we used an experimental causal chain design (cf. Spencer et al., 2005), which applies the most rigorous test for causality – the experimental design (cf. Shadish et al., 2002) – in the test of statistical mediation hypotheses. Therewith, we provided strong evidence for the psychological process we assumed: Mediation increases mutual empathy between conflict parties and therewith supports more positive intergroup attitudes and liking. With our third study, we furthermore suggested that not only empathy for the other, but also feeling heard by her or him supports conflict resolution. This finding added to the severely understudied field of perspective giving (cf. Goldstein et al., 2014). Generally, our results shed valuable first light on the psychological processes of effective mediation in intergroup conflict (cf., Pruitt, 2011; Wall et al., 2001). Our research points toward several directions how to further investigate mediation in intergroup conflict: We discussed various possibilities to evaluate mediation with internally valid designs without losing concern for the external validity of results. Moreover, we strongly recommend <b>extending</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> by for instance investigating the effects of specific mediation styles or comparing the psychological processes and needs for minority and majority groups in mediation. Considering the divide of researchers investigating mediation in the field and in the laboratory, as well as the divide of mediation research and practice, we hope for a more cooperative and dialogical, shortly, a more mediation-like, approach to mediation in the future. Experience has shows that both sides can learn from each other and that cooperation is a profitable endeavor for all involved...|$|E

We give a linear-time algorithm in case both π and σ avoid the two size- 3 permutations 213 and 231. For the special case where only σ avoids 213 and 231, we present a O(max(kn 2, n 2 log log n) -time algorithm. We <b>extend</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> to bivincular patterns that avoid 213 and 231 and present a O(kn 4) -time algorithm. Finally {{we look at the}} related problem of the longest subsequence which avoids 213 and 231...|$|R

This article {{deals with}} issue of virtual sound source {{positioning}} {{for the purposes}} of acoustic navigation in unknown spaces and <b>extends</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> published last year. Navigation experiment was based on using PERSEUS assistive device. No appropriate standards in the field of performing subjective localization a navigation tests can be found. Our methods of design and evaluation of the listening and navigation tests are proposed and discussed. The following text is considered as an overview with references to our previous articles, which contain more detailed info...|$|R

In this paper, we {{introduce}} a cerebral cortex inspired archi-tecture for robots {{in which we}} have mapped hierarchical cortical rep-resentation of human brain to logic flow and decision making process. Our work focuses on the two major features of human cognitive process, viz. the perception-action cycle and its hierarchical organization, and the decision making process. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed method, we incorporated this architecture in our robot which we named as Cognitive Insect Robot inspired by Brain Architecture (CIRBA). We have <b>extended</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> to the implementation of this cognitive ar-chitecture of CIRBA in multiple robots and have analyzed the level of cognition attained by them...|$|R

40|$|Frequent pattern mining {{has become}} one of the most popular data mining {{approaches}} for the analysis of purchasing patterns. There are techniques such as Apriori and FP-Growth, which were typically restricted to a single concept level. We <b>extend</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> to discover cross- level frequent patterns in multi-level environments. Unfortunately, little research has been paid to this research area. Mining cross- level frequent pattern may lead to the discovery of mining patterns at different levels of hierarchy. In this study a transaction reduction technique with FP-tree based bottom up approach is used for mining cross-level pattern. This method is using the concept of reduced support...|$|R

30|$|Another {{fruitful}} {{avenue for}} future research would be to continue investigating the contingency view of strategic human resource management. In this paper, we incorporate servant leadership and directive leadership into our model to investigate the moderating factors that affect the interpretation of HPWS. There might be other leadership styles that interplay with human resource practices in different ways and even play different roles because of the outcomes of interest. For example, Han et al. (2015) theorize that team managers’ contingent reward leadership positively moderates the relationship of pay-for-performance practice and employees’ performance-reward expectancy, which then contributes to job performance. Hence, future studies are recommended to <b>extend</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> via examining how other leadership styles shape the effects of HPWS.|$|R
