5|$|Outline {{planning}} permission was {{granted by the}} London Borough of Hillingdon in January 2009 despite local opposition to some buildings having flat roofs. Up to 50% of the new <b>homes</b> <b>will</b> be social housing. The plan included 415 homes, with an 80-bed care home; the largest buildings will be six storeys high.|$|E
25|$|In the December 2006 Pre-Budget Report, the Government {{announced}} their 'ambition' that all new <b>homes</b> <b>will</b> be 'zero-carbon' by 2016 (i.e. built to zero-carbon building standards). To encourage this, an exemption from Stamp duty land tax {{is to be}} granted, lasting until 2012, for all new zero-carbon homes up to £500,000 in value.|$|E

25|$|In May 2007, after {{claiming}} for the flat's {{service and}} council tax, he switched his designated second {{home to his}} constituency office and bought furniture. The report into the Parliamentary expenses scandal by Sir Thomas Legg showed that 343 MPs {{had been asked to}} repay some money and Vaz was asked to repay £1514 due to furnishing items exceeding allowable cost. New expenses rules published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority which came into force after the 2010 general election limit the second home allowance to £1,450 a month, i.e. the Westminster cost of renting a one bedroomed flat. Profits made on existing second <b>homes</b> <b>will</b> be recouped.|$|E
25|$|The American middle class, {{at least}} those living the lifestyle, has become known {{around the world for}} {{conspicuous}} consumption. To this day, the professional middle class in the United States holds the world record for having the largest homes, most appliances, and most automobiles. In 2005, the average new home had a square footage of 2,434 square feet (roughly 226 square meters) with 58% of these homes having ceilings with heights in excess of nine feet on the first floor. As new homes only represent {{a small portion of the}} housing stock in the US, with most suburban homes having been built in the 1970s when the average square footage was 1,600, it is fair to assume that these large new suburban <b>homes</b> <b>will</b> be inhabited by members of the professional middle class.|$|E

25|$|Data {{communications}} {{are provided}} by several companies. Telstra was the first company to provide dial-up Internet access via the Ballarat exchange, however the first network for broadband Internet access available in the city was a hybrid optical fiber cable and coaxial cable built by Neighbourhood Cable in 2001. Since then, Telstra and Optus have entered the Ballarat market, providing Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) services for residential Internet access from four main exchanges—Ballarat, Wendouree (Howitt Street), Sebastopol (Skipton Street) and Alfredton (Cuthberts Road). These companies also provide mobile data access Evolved HSPA and since late 2011 3GPP Long Term Evolution (4G). Ballarat's rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) is seen as vital for the city's growing IT industry. During Ballarat's first stage NBN rollout in 2012, 17,800 <b>homes</b> <b>will</b> be directly connected to the network via optical fibre cable.|$|E
25|$|A draft risk {{assessment}} released by Health Canada in July 2016 {{has found that}} overexposure to boric acid {{has the potential to}} cause developmental and reproductive health effects. Since people are already exposed to boric acid naturally through their diets and water, Health Canada advised that exposure from other sources should be reduced as much as possible, especially for children and pregnant women. The concern is not with any one product, but rather multiple exposures from a variety of sources. With this in mind, the department also announced that registrations for certain pesticides that contain boric acid, which are commonly used in <b>homes,</b> <b>will</b> have their registrations cancelled and be phased out of the marketplace. As well, new, more protective label directions are being introduced for other boric acid pesticides that continue to be registered in Canada (for example, enclosed bait stations and spot treatments using gel formulations).|$|E
25|$|The 1950s {{area will}} feature both an urban {{development}} and an upland farm. The urban development will feature social housing, a cinema, NHS clinic, shops and a park. The development will include Aged Miner's Homes, for uses as a Homes For Memory dementia relief facility. For transport, the 1950s area could feature trams, trolleybuses and motorbuses. The upland farm {{will be based}} around Spainsfield Farm, relocated from Eastgate. The aged miners <b>homes</b> <b>will</b> be replicas of Marsden Road, South Shelds. The cinema will be the former Grand Electric Cinema from Ryhope, Sunderland, which will be demolished and re-erected at Beamish. The social housing will feature a block of four relocated Airey homes, prefabricated houses which were originally designed by Sir Edwin Airey, which originally stood in Kibblesworth. Recently vacated and due for demolition, they were instead offered to the museum by The Gateshead Housing Company, who accepted them in 2012.|$|E

500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} criticisms to joint physical custody. A {{criticism of the}} joint physical custody arrangement is that {{due to the nature}} of the arrangement, the parents are in frequent contact with each other than in other situations, leading to conflict which has the potential to negatively impact all parties involved, including the children. Research does not support this concern. Numerous studies found that parents with joint physical custody had lower levels of conflict. There are numerous opinions that the constant moving back and forth between two <b>homes</b> <b>will</b> have a negative impact on children emotionally.

2500|$|Although {{domestic}} kittens {{are commonly}} sent to new homes at {{six to eight}} weeks of age, {{it has been suggested that}} being with their mother and litter-mates from six to twelve weeks is important for a kitten's social and behavioural development. Usually, breeders and foster/rescue <b>homes</b> <b>will</b> not sell or adopt out a kitten that is younger than twelve weeks. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to give away kittens younger than eight weeks of age. Kittens generally reach sexual maturity at around seven months old.
