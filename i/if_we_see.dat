25|$|Why {{is it that}} we {{are sure}} a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — is a game while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E

500|$|... 1: Nenokkadine {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics. According to The New Indian Express, its audience was [...] "gripped {{through the whole}} film, {{but not for the}} right reasons": [...] "Ending with a heralding of a second 'Green Revolution' and carrying on a legacy that aims at a food Utopia, you wish the movie continued with the schizophrenia and ended in an asylum". Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India gave the film three out of five stars: [...] "The [...] format of six songs, five fights and loads of entertainment and melodrama makes it impossible to respectably adapt racy Hollywood styled suspense thrillers". Radhika Rajamani of Rediff called the film [...] "inordinately long, with repetitive scenes and slow and sluggish narration", and a [...] "sense of ennui set in after a point"; however, Rajamani praised the lead actors' performances. Sify gave the film 2.75 out of five stars: [...] "In 1 Nenokkadine, individual sequences are cool but the same cannot be said <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> it in totality. Apart from Mahesh Babu`s stunning performance, the drive of the film is completely off the track. It disappoints." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 2.5 out of five stars: [...] "To say it in a line, the film falls short of expectations and disappoints film goers, especially the fans of Mahesh Babu". Kavirayani called Rathnavelu's cinematography its [...] "saving grace", praising the lead pair's performances. IndiaGlitz also gave 1 Nenokkadine 2.5 out of five stars, saying that the film had the capacity to [...] "tank without a trace if Mahesh Babu's character did not come with a difference"; the actor [...] "looks that pained man every bit", expressing [...] "intense emotions without much effort".|$|E

If we rephrase sexual transgression in school and work as a civil-rights and civil-society issue, everything becomes less emotional, less personal. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> this as a systemic corruption issue, then when people bring allegations, the focus will be on whether the institution has been damaged in its larger mission." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peirce {{explains}} that an index {{is a sign}} that compels attention through a connection of fact, often through cause and effect. For example, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> smoke we conclude that it is the effect of a cause – fire. It is an index if the connection is factual regardless of resemblance or interpretation. Peirce usually considered personal names and demonstratives such as the word [...] "this" [...] to be indices, for although as words they depend on interpretation, they are indices in depending on the requisite factual relation to their individual objects. A personal name has an actual historical connection, often recorded on a birth certificate, to its named object; the word [...] "this" [...] is like the pointing of a finger.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 May 1734 {{this was}} {{followed}} by another letter dictated by several Shawnee chiefs to a trader, probably Jonah Davenport, listing the names of some fifteen traders who either had no license or had exhibited undesirable behavior such as frequent disputes or violence. Another seven, including Chartier, were named as being in good standing, and these would be permitted to bring up to 60 gallons of rum a year, as long as they could show a license. Chartier was described as [...] "one of us, and he is welcome to come as long as he pleases... to bring what quantity [...] he pleases..." [...] The letter concludes, [...] "And for our parts, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> any other traders than those we desire amongst us, we will stave their [...] and seize their goods."

2500|$|Mohamed ElBaradei, former {{director}} general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote that [...] "the only way to resolve the Iranian issue is to build trust. Moving 1200, half, or at least {{more than half of the}} Iranian nuclear material out of Iran is a confidence-building measure would defuse the crisis and enable the US and the West [...] the space to negotiate.

2500|$|Similarly, Indigenous {{feminism}} is set {{apart from other}} Indigenous rights movements, such as Indigenous liberation theory, because those theories have [...] "not been attentive to the gendered ways in which colonial oppression and racism function for men and women, or to the inherent and adopted sexisms that some communities manifest." [...] There are some within Indigenous communities who choose not to identify as feminist and therefore {{distance themselves from the}} mainstream feminism. There are many reasons for this choice, however, Kim Anderson argues that ifWestern {{feminism is}} unpalatable because it is about rights rather than responsibilities, then we should all take responsibility seriously and ask if we are being responsible to all members of our societies. If we are to reject equality in favour of difference, then {{we need to make sure}} those differences are embedded in systems that empower all members. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> feminism as being too invested in Western liberalism and individual autonomy, then we need to ensure that our collectivist approaches serve everyone in the collective. And if we want to embrace essential elements of womanhood that have been problematic for Western feminists [...] then we have to ensure that these concepts don't get stuck in literal or patriarchal interpretations.|$|E
