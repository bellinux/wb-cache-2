40|$|A general {{understanding}} of grazing effects on plant diversity in drylands is still missing, despite an extensive theoretical background. Cross-biome syntheses are hindered {{by the fact}} that the outcomes of disturbance studies are strongly affected by the choice of diversity measures, and the spatial and temporal scales of measurements. The aim of this study is to overcome these weaknesses by applying a wide range of diversity measures to a data set derived from identical sampling in three distinct ecosystems. We analyzed three fence-line contrasts (<b>heavier</b> vs. lighter <b>grazing</b> intensity), representing different degrees of aridity (from arid to semiarid) and precipitation regimes (summer rain vs. winter rain) in southern Africa. We tested the impact of grazing intensity on multiple aspects of plant diversity (species and functional group level, richness and evenness components, alpha and beta diversity, and composition) at two spatial scales, and for both 5 -yr means and interannual variability. <b>Heavier</b> <b>grazing</b> reduced total plant cover and substantially altered the species and functional composition at all sites. However, a significant decrease in species alpha diversity was detected at only one of the three sites. By contrast, alpha diversity of plant functional groups responded consistently across ecosystems and scales, with a significant decrease at <b>heavier</b> <b>grazing</b> intensity. The cover-based measures of functional group diversity responded more sensitively and more consistently than functional group richness. Beta diversity of species and functional types increased under <b>heavier</b> <b>grazing,</b> showing that at larger scales, the heterogeneity of the community composition and the functional structure were increased. <b>Heavier</b> <b>grazing</b> mostly increased interannual variability of alpha diversity, while effects on beta diversity and cover were inconsistent. Our results suggest that species diversity alone may not adequately reflect the shifts in vegetation structure that occur in response to increased grazing intensity in the dryland biomes of southern Africa. Compositional and structural changes of the vegetation are better reflected by trait-based diversity measures. In particular, measures of plant functional diversity that include evenness represent a promising tool to detect and quantify disturbance effects on ecosystems...|$|R

30|$|It was {{not unusual}} for the {{respondents}} to associate perceived existence of good soils with forage availability. This is because pastoralists have robust knowledge of soils and soil quality; their soil classification is often based on the productivity of such soils on a given landscape. In {{a study conducted among}} the Maasai, Oba and Kaitira (2006) documented classification of degradation based on soils as one of the indicators, and a perceived variation of forage availability and grazing patterns depending on soils in a given landscape. Similarly, among the Orma, the Afar and the Karamojong (Turkana and Karamojong of Uganda), forage availability and quality has been documented to be consonant with the soils and soil moisture of a given landscape (Oba 1998; Notenbaert et al. 2007; Oba 2012). Similarly to a study by Oba (2012), we found, through informal interviews and focus group discussions, associative existence of landscape grazing potentials to perceived soil productivity and forage availability patterns. For example, the sandy landscapes (eketela) were perceived to experience <b>heavier</b> <b>grazing</b> than the black soil (arro) landscapes. This is because the arro is grazed during the dry season, thus associated with better forage availability compared to the eketela.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{seven years}} of light cattle grazing of dune valleys (Frisian island of Vlieland) as to management objectives and effects on vegetation, flora and fauna. We compared vegetation, flora and fauna from 1993 and 2000 in a BACI-design of 14 grazed and 14 ungrazed plots, of which 20 {{were randomly selected from}} the stratum `grass overgrown moist dune valleys', and 8 from `intact Empetrum vegetations. Development towards shrubland and woodland is tempered as a consequence of cattle browsing of twigs and leaves of Prunus avium, and Betula pubescens, which reduces height and the growth form of these species. Browsing of P. avium is surprising as this is expected to occur only under shortage of other food plants. The number of seedlings under 0. 5 mheight, however, increased, even in the grazed plots. Cattle form bare patches and trails in the dense and high field layers of Calamagrostis epigejos, and Carex arenaria. Vegetation height of the `overgrown valleys' increases significantly in the ungrazed plots, whereas it increases (very) lightly in the grazed plots. Numbers of plant and invertebrate species increase, which could be related to a general change to moist conditions.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of land abandonment and marginalization, open areas and traditionally managed wood pastures are disappearing from many alpine valleys. Landscape and stand scale dynamics were analyzed in two neighboring inner valleys of central Italian Alps (Valmalenco, SO) dominated by larch (Larix decidua Mill.) forests and experiencing different historical land use intensities. Land cover mapping obtained from object-oriented analysis of aerial photographs was used to quantify land cover changes between 1961 and 2003. Spatial statistics were used to quantify landscape patterns, and intensive sampling in permanent plots was employed to perform point pattern analysis at the stand scale. Expansion of forested area {{at the expense of}} wood pastures was the main land cover transition observed. Differences in land use intensities were responsible for different patterns at the landscape scale: (1) <b>heavier</b> <b>grazing</b> and human pressure created a more diverse and fragmented mosaic of meadows, open woodlands, forests and wood pastures, (2) lower human impact favored a more homogeneous and stable system. A decline in grazing pressure in the late 1970 s favored the establishment of larch and spruce in a clustered pattern, typical of the subalpine belt. Subalpine wood pastures, likewise many other semi-natural environments, are in danger of disappearing and lose their productive and cultural characteristics, because they are developing into more closed and dense stands...|$|R

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, Europe was {{impacted}} by an extreme heatwave that altered ecosystem productivity and increased plant mortality in natural areas. We analyse {{the effect of this}} extreme climatic event on the demography of the protected alpine plant Eryngium alpinum in relation to local ecological conditions and management regimes (mowing, grazing and unmanaged). Spatiotemporal variation in the vital rates of different plant life-stages (seedlings, juveniles, vegetative and reproductive adults) was estimated in seven sites of E. alpinum in the French Alps between 2001 and 2010. The effects on population dynamics (deterministic and stochastic population growth rates, Î» and a) were studied using matrix population models and life table response experiments. Reductions in survival rates were observed following the extreme 2003 summer. Î» was smaller during the heatwave and a decreased in simulations where the occurrence probability of a 2003 -like event was increased. Adult survival rates and fecundity were negatively affected by <b>heavy</b> spring <b>grazing,</b> leading to lower Î» and a. There were few differences in population dynamics between mowed and unmanaged sites. While greater rates of heatwave occurrence did increase extinction probability, only heavily grazed sites showed considerable extinction risk.

40|$|Ecologists {{commonly}} separate Great Plains grasslands communities into types {{based on}} grass height: shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, and tallgrass prairie. Grass height correlates directly with precipitation and thus lessens with distance westward and with drought. Grass height correlates inversely with grazing intensity and thus shortgrasses expand eastward when grazing pressures are great and shrink westward when grazing pressures relax. Evidence about past distributions of shortgrasses, {{coupled with the}} prehistoric and historic abundances of large grazers and the black-tailed prairie dog (a shortgrass indicator), suggest a far-eastward occurrence of shortgrass prairie in the late Pleistocene (despite a relatively wet climate), a shrinkage westward by late prehistoric and early historic times, and a farther shift westward {{in response to the}} bison 2 Ì† 7 s demise in the 19 th century. After cattle arrived in the late 1800 s, shortgrass prairie expanded and contracted depending on the prevailing grazing philosophies, resulting grazing intensities, and periodic drought. Currently, taller grasses have prevailed for over a half century, and shortgrass prairie may be more restricted than it has been for millennia, because of a grazing philosophy that promotes moderate grazing. An emerging change in grazing philosophy may presage a gradual return of <b>heavier</b> <b>grazing</b> and another expansion eastward of the shortgrass prairie.

Several bird species occur in these grazed habitats and are now experiencing a near continuous decline. We investigated the impact of livestock grazing on the threatened little bustard (Tetrax tetrax L.). The study was conducted at the NATURA 2000 Site/Important Bird Area of Cabrela, Portugal. Our main goals were to investigate responses of little bustard territorial males and breeding females to different livestock management practices, namely pasture types, stocking rates and sward structure. Bird distribution was surveyed using car and foot surveys. Data on grazing was supplied by land managers every 10 days from February to June through field interviews. Generalised additive models and model averaging were used to compute predictive models. Results indicate that higher probabilities of occurrence were found in long-term pastures and under light-moderate grazing conditions (stocking rates around 0. 4 LU/ha). Conversely, lower probabilities of occurrence were found in ungrazed or <b>heavy</b> <b>grazed</b> fields. Males occurred mostly in large fields, but this variable seemed to be less important for females. On the other hand, green plant cover and the vegetation height were good predictors for the occurrence of females but not for males. Females used mostly pastures with vegetation height around 20 â€“ 25 cm.
