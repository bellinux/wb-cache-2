30|$|The {{recurrence}} of spontaneous abortion by pregnant heifers within 3  weeks of {{arrival at the}} feedlots has been noted by some farmers as a rationale for presenting their pregnant <b>heifers</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> The disruptive bulling behaviour being recognised was implicated by other farmers for slaughtering pregnant cows by Gregory and Grandlin (2007). The occurrence of bulling amounting to 11 % during the peak period in autumn and winter has always left the victimized in-calf cows ill {{as a result of}} unwanted mounting by the buller steers. The exhibition of buller syndrome by the bulling steers usually influences some cattle farmers in the USA to cull their injured pregnant cows. The depressions in the beef market in the United State of America have sometimes compelled farmers as well to offer 1 – 3 % of their pregnant <b>heifers</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> and retain fewer heifers on their farms as breeding replacements (Gregory and Grandin 2007). It was reported that a total of 28.29 % of cows in their third trimester of pregnancy were culled because of infertility, 21.8 % for mastitis and 15.8 % as a result of old age (Singleton 1996; Ernst 2009).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} two atypical {{cases of}} granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) in Belgian Blue heifers. In the first case, an 18 -month-old heifer died after ovariectomy, and a granulosatheca cell tumour was diagnosed post-mortem. The second heifer (31 months of age) was near term and was successfully treated surgically for a malignant granulosa cell tumour. Unfortunately, no further reproductive data are available, as the <b>heifer</b> was sold <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> This {{is the first}} report describing GCTs in Belgian Blue beef cattle...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in rate of gain from feeding stilbestrol to heifers {{is not so}} good as that obtained with steers. Implanting heifers with levels of stilbestrol recommended for steers results in undesirable side effects such as udder and teat development, high tailheads, and prolapse of the vagina in many instances. This is the second test designed to study the effect of low-level stilbestrol implanting (12 mgs.) and Synovex heifer implants (SH- 7 contains 100 mgs. testosterone and 20 mgs. estradiol benzoate) on <b>heifers</b> being fattened <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Sixty <b>heifers,</b> six lots of 10 animals each, in Projects 536 and 537 were used in this test. Three animals from each lot were randomly selected to receive either the stilbestrol or Synovex implant, thus giving 18 animals per treatment. The remaining 4 animals per lot, total of 24, served as controls...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen {{samples of}} L. dorsi muscles {{were taken from}} western Baggara cattle, one sample from each of seven bulls and seven <b>heifers</b> {{randomly}} selected <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> {{at the end of}} an experimental feedlot feeding which lasted for 16 weeks at Kuku Research Station, Khartoum North, Sudan, to study sex effects on meat chemical composition and quality attributes. Moisture content of beef was higher in bulls meat than in heifers meat. Protein and ash content were significantly (P< 0. 001) higher in bulls meat, whereas fat content was significantly (P< 0. 001) higher in heifers meat than in bulls meat. Cooking loss of bulls meat was significantly (P< 0. 001) lower and water-holding capacity was also significantly (P< 0. 01) lower in the bulls meat than in heifers meat. Bull’s meat colour had low lightness (L) and high redness (a) and yellowness (b), as determined by Hunter Lab. Tristimulus colorimeter, as compared with heifers meat.

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that the frequently observed zero or negative supply elasticity for beef is {{not the result of}} poor data or faulty statistical analysis. Theoretical specification of supply functions for the separate components of beef slaughter-steers, cows, and heifers-leads to an expected positive sign for the supply elasticity of steer slaughter, and an expected negative sign for the supply elasticity of cow <b>slaughter.</b> <b>For</b> <b>heifer</b> <b>slaughter</b> the sign cannot be ascertained from a priori considerations. The empirical evidence from statistical analyses of time-series data is consistent with and confirms the theoretical expectations. Total beef slaughter was disaggre-gated into three major components-steers, heifers, and cows. The esti-mated parameters in the regressions imply positive elasticity for steers and negative elasticity for cows. Only the heifer equation seems unsatisfactory. The parameter estimates fluctuate widely with slight changes in the esti-mating equation. Also the high autocorrelation of the errors implies inade-quate specification of the heifer model...|$|R
