The considered comparisons of dynamic responses included the distribution of dynamic stress in railway subgrade, and the elastic deformation, dynamic stiffness, and cumulative plastic deformation on subgrade surface. Gathered data showed that when fill sections were relatively high (more than 6. 0 m in this study), the ground stiffness showed insignificant influence on the dynamic responses of railway subgrade. For the comparisons of fill and cut sections, the dynamic stiffness on subgrade surface for a cut section was approximately a half of the one for a <b>fill</b> <b>section,</b> but the cumulative plastic deformation was essentially {{the same for the}} fill and cut sections. These results provide references for the optimization design of railway subgrade...|$|E

This paper aims to solve the defects of the conventional construction method by introducing a newly-developed construction technology of embankment widening of waterside cantilever high retaining wall, which can effectively solve the anti-floating problem of the light-weight embankment, prevent the differential deformation at the joint of the wall bottom plate and the reinforced concrete continuous slab of the cantilever retaining wall, and improve the bearing capacity of the embankment...|$|E

MSE/Soil Nail hybrid {{earth retaining}} walls use a soil nailed wall in the cut section and an MSE wall in the <b>fill</b> <b>section.</b> The paper demonstrates the results of instrumentation and monitoring an MSE/Soil Nail hybrid retaining wall system. Innovative 2 D finite element models were used to simulate {{the behavior of the}} hybrid retaining wall system. The paper describes the philosophy of design of hybrid MSE/Soil Nail walls and the outline of circumstances which are favorable for such walls. In order to evaluate the global Factor of Safety (FOS) of the soil nail wall portion using the conventional limit-equilibrium design methods (LEM), two different methodologies to simulate the effect of the upper MSE walls were proposed. The obtained results of numerical and limit equilibrium approaches as a design methodology are presented for such type of walls, in this paper. The design of hybrid MSE/SN walls is complicated as it is a composite of two different reinforcement techniques, traditional limit equilibrium approaches cannot be used alone for design of such walls, it shall be supported by numerical methods for estimation of the global factor of safety and failure surface. The limit equilibrium approaches can be used for the estimation of internal stability and facing connection for both soil nails and mechanically stabilized walls...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{persistent}} {{evidence of}} health impacts of roadway aerosols requires extensive information for urban planning to avoid putting populations at risk, especially in-fill projects. The required information must cover both highway aerosol sources {{as well as}} transport into residential areas {{under a variety of}} roadway configurations, traffic conditions, downwind vegetation, and meteorology. Such studies are difficult and expensive to do, but were easier in the past when there was a robust fine aerosol tracer uniquely tied to traffic – lead. In this report we propose and test a modern alternative, highway safety flare aerosols. Roadway safety flares on vehicles in traffic can provide very fine and ultra-fine aerosols of unique composition that can be detected quantitatively far downwind of roadways {{due to a lack of}} upwind interferences. The collection method uses inexpensive portable aerosol collection hardware and x-ray analysis protocols. The time required for each transect is typically 1  h. Side by side tests showed precision at ± 4 %. We have evaluated this technique both by aerosol removal in vegetation in a wind tunnel and by tracking aerosols downwind of freeways as a function of season, highway configuration and vegetation coverage. The results show that sound walls for at-grade freeways cause freeway pollution to extend much farther downwind than standard models predict. The elevated or <b>fill</b> <b>section</b> freeway on a berm projected essentially undiluted roadway aerosols at distances well beyond 325  m, deep into residential neighborhoods.

40|$|Earthwork {{allocations}} {{are needed}} in excavation work to determine the quantities of material to be moved from each cut section to each <b>fill</b> <b>section.</b> Two basic methods of earthwork allocations are available: mass diagram and linear programming. The mass diagram {{can be used to}} determine the most economic distribution of cut and fill. However, the usefulness of mass diagram diminishes for situations in which haul costs are not directly proportional to the haul distance; swell and shrinkage vary along the roadway; and additional quantities of soil are available at borrow pit or may be disposed of at disposal sites. This study presents an integrated system for estimating earthmoving production, selecting fleet and optimizing earthmoving operations. Geographic information system (GIS) is employed to acquire and analyze spatial data. Fleet Production and Cost Analysis (FPC) is used as software tool to select the best Fleet. The methodology used in the development of optimization model is based on the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming which determines optimum quantity of materials to be moved between different cut and fill sections, borrow pits and disposal sites. The standard Microsoft Excel Solver has been used to run the presented MILP model. This study also proposes an algorithm for determining longitudinal interval for a part of road segment. The study concludes that the presented integrated system can assist engineers, contractors and clients of earthmoving projects in quantity take-off determination work, for selecting best equipment fleet and in determining the optimum quantity of earthwork materials to be moved between different sections so as to finish the project in minimum time and within budget with optimum use of available resource...|$|E

30|$|This ideal {{splitting}} method is introduced in our proposed reservoir design {{as shown in}} Fig.  1 d. First a column L 1 is filled by liquid pulled from the <b>filling</b> <b>section</b> of the reservoir. Next, liquid is further transported across arc section A and placed on second linear section L 2. Both L 1, L 2 are divided into slender (instead of square) electrode segments. Arc A is also composed of four sectors. All of these segments can be individually addressed. Note that, A is not filled with liquid and only used to carry liquid to L 2. Since L 1 and L 2 create a right angle, liquid on those two sections touch each other diagonally just before pinch-off, {{which is similar to}} that in Fig.  1 c. Later, liquid column L 1 is held in place by activating all of the electrodes while pulling force is applied on the liquid on L 2 from left. Without generating any elongated tail, pinch-off happens very close to the junction point of L 1 and L 2. Like the ideal splitting scheme already discussed and shown in Fig.  1 c, the tail formed after pinch-off is expected to be very tiny in this case and therefore dispensed volume should be very accurate. Also, because the liquid column L 1 is fixed, the volume in the <b>filling</b> <b>section</b> is not likely to affect the meniscus formation in the neck and thus will not affect location of the pinch-off point. The use of the slender electrodes in L 1 and L 2 serves two additional purposes: first, it controls the deformation thus making sure that the necking will happen very close to the L 1 –L 2 junction and second, it speeds up the process by enhancing the transport velocity of liquid [35]. Due to the latter advantage, this reservoir design would also give higher droplet generating rate as well.|$|R

40|$|The need {{to provide}} {{mechanical}} connection from one side for the Hollow section connection has arisen {{in a number of}} fields and has resulted in the development of several types of so-called blind fasteners. An experimental blind bolt called the Extended Hollobolt is giving a good behaviour performance in terms of stiffness, strength and ductility. The strength performance of this system has been investigated under both monotonic and cyclic loading. However, the performance of such connections under fatigue loading is still unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the behaviour of blind bolt connection to concrete <b>filled</b> hollow <b>section</b> under repeated load. Further aim was to determine the reliability of the Extended Hollobolt to concrete <b>filled</b> hollow <b>section.</b> The study involved conducting an experimental programme and carrying out fatigue life and reliability analysis. The experiment programme tested 52 specimens of bolts connected to concrete <b>filled</b> hollow <b>sections</b> where 36 tests involved Extended Hollobolt, 10 standard Hollobolt and 6 standard bolts (M 16). The test specimens were subjected to tensile fatigue load characteristics with varying stress ranges. Mathematical methods are used to analyse the fatigue test data using the normal, lognormal and Weibull distributions. Normal and lognormal distributions are more suitable. Therefore, statistical analysis procedure proposed by Eurocode for the statistical analysis is valid for fatigue test data. Statistical analysis was conducted to establish S-N curves and to predict the fatigue life of the proposed blind bolt. This was then compared to the normative regulation in Eurocode 3. The failure mode of the Extended Hollobolt under repeated loading was found to be similar with standard bolt, which is a very positive outcome. Statistical analysis of fatigue test data showed that the fatigue life of Extended Hollobolt is higher than the theoretical design S-N curve which is recommended by Eurocode 3 part 1 - 9 for the standard bolt. However, the actual fatigue life for the standard bolt appears to be higher than the proposed blind bolt. A design model for predicting the fatigue life using S-N curve for the Extended Hollobolt is proposed.
