Karst offers a good amount of limestone and there are several limestone quarries in the area. They blast the limestone first then <b>haul</b> <b>it</b> off with heavy machinery. The roads that are built to mine the limestone can break up habitat for miles. All of this destroys caves and surrounding land where the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle and other karst fauna live.|$|E

The boom pivot is mounted on the front axle assembly and a small winch is mounted on an extension to the smokebox {{in front of the}} chimney, the cable passing over a sheave {{at the top of the}} boom arm. The winch is powered by bevel gears on a shaft driven directly from the engine, with some form of clutch providing raise/lower control. These road locomotives can be used to load a trailer as well as to <b>haul</b> <b>it</b> to a new location. They are often referred to as 'crane engines'.|$|E
25|$|In Western Australia's {{home match}} against Queensland that season, Price {{had a large}} role in a tense 19 runs win, despite coming into the side due to an injury. He took 5 for 68 in the first innings, with the fifth wicket coming from a hit wicket. Earlier in the innings, off his first three overs of the match, Price had three catches dropped off his bowling. Chasing 229 for victory, Queensland were well placed at 5-154, albeit with only 80 minutes {{remaining}} on the final day. After taking the new ball, Price dismissed all-rounder Colin McCool and wicket-keeper Ernest Toovey off successive deliveries. Queensland batsman Lawrence Chapman survived the hattrick but was trapped leg before wicket the very next ball to give Price a third wicket in the space of four balls. Price would secure the win soon after, dismissing Mick Raymer with just 16 minutes to spare, giving him a 10 wicket <b>haul.</b> <b>It</b> had been just his third first-class match for Western Australia and was the performance that secured a spot his spot in the team.|$|E

25|$|Pittsburgh then marched 67 {{yards to}} score the winning {{touchdown}}. Running back Byron Bam Morris scored the game-winning 1-yard touchdown run with 1:34 {{remaining in the}} game to pull Pittsburgh ahead for good. The drive was aided by O'Donnell's 9-yard completion to Hastings on fourth down and 3 from the 47-yard line, {{as well as an}} earlier dropped potential interception that went {{in and out of the}} arms of linebacker Quentin Coryatt. On the next play after Hastings' fourth down conversion catch, O'Donnell completed a 37-yard pass to Ernie Mills on the Indianapolis 1-yard line, setting up Morris' 1-yard scoring run. The Colts got the ball back and advanced to the Steelers' 29 with 5 seconds left, narrowly avoiding a turnover when defensive back Chris Oldham dropped a wide open interception. On the game's final play, Harbaugh attempted a hail mary pass which he lofted high and came down into a crowd of players in the end zone; the ball momentarily was against the Colts' WR Aaron Bailey's chest but it hit the turf before he could <b>haul</b> <b>it</b> in.|$|E

Christmas Day we spent at Trier, the second Christmas in Europe for the squadron, and not by any means a bad day. No one had home comforts as Christmas stockings, but the atmosphere at the dinner given in the hangar by the men at two o'clock, to which all the officers originally in the squadron were invited, was cheerful if not warm. The menu was excellent, and the tree in the center of the hangar was decorated as they were at home, made everyone happy (or homesick, as the case may be), just to look at if.|$|E

Layers without uranium were alternated with two layers containing uranium, so the uranium was enclosed in graphite. Unlike later reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system, as it was only intended to be operated at very low power.|$|E
500|$|Having learnt of {{the ongoing}} Cold War and the {{doctrine}} of mutually assured destruction from Stepashin, Skaldak {{plans to use the}} submarine's nuclear missiles to provoke a global thermonuclear war and destroy humanity as revenge for the humans attacking him - under the Martian code humanity as a whole has declared war on the Ice Warrior race by assaulting him. Reaching the bridge, he is able to connect himself to the sub's missile guidance systems and activate the missiles. The Doctor and Clara are attempting to persuade Skaldak to show mercy when the sub is rocked by a tractor beam from above: the Ice Warriors have arrived over the site of the submarine's undersea grounding, and they <b>haul</b> <b>it</b> to the surface. Skaldak is beamed aboard the Ice Warriors' spaceship, though the missile launch system is still active. Showing mercy, Skaldak deactivates the missiles remotely.

2500|$|The initial {{yields of}} Borlaug's crops {{were higher than}} any ever {{harvested}} in South Asia. The countries subsequently committed to importing large quantities of both the Lerma Rojo 64 and Sonora 64 varieties. In 1966, India imported 18,000tons‚Äîthe largest purchase and import of any seed {{in the world at}} that time. In 1967, Pakistan imported 42,000tons, and Turkey 21,000tons. Pakistan's import, planted on 1.5 million acres (6,100km¬≤), produced enough wheat to seed the entire nation's wheatland the following year. By 1968, when Ehrlich's book was released, William Gaud of the United States Agency for International Development was calling Borlaug's work a [...] "Green Revolution". High yields led to a shortage of various utilities‚Äîlabor to harvest the crops, bullock carts to <b>haul</b> <b>it</b> to the threshing floor, jute bags, trucks, rail cars, and grain storage facilities. Some local governments were forced to close school buildings temporarily to use them for grain storage.|$|E
2500|$|Tales {{from other}} parts of Germany make mine kobolds {{beneficial}} creatures, at least if they are treated respectfully. Nineteenth-century miners in Bohemia and Hungary reported hearing knocking in the mines. They interpreted such noises as warnings from the kobolds to not go in that direction. Other miners claimed that the knocks indicated where veins of metal could be found: the more knocks, the richer the vein. In 1884, spiritualist Emma Hardinge Britten reported a story from a Madame Kalodzy, who claimed to have heard mine kobolds while visiting a peasant named Michael Engelbrecht: [...] "On the three first days after our arrival, we only heard a few dull knocks, sounding in and about the mouth of the mine, as if produced by some vibrations or very distant blows..." [...] Kobolds are sometimes portrayed as being indifferent to human miners, so long as they are left alone.

2500|$|Non-essential {{items were}} often {{abandoned}} {{to lighten the}} load, or in case of emergency. Many travelers would salvage discarded items, picking up essentials or leaving behind their lower quality item when a better one was found abandoned along the road. Some profited by collecting discarded items, hauling them back to jumping off places, and reselling them. In the early years, Mormons sent scavenging parties back along the trail to salvage as much iron and other supplies as possible and <b>haul</b> <b>it</b> to Salt Lake City, where supplies of all kinds were needed. Others would use discarded furniture, wagons, and wheels as firewood. During the 1849 gold rush, Fort Laramie was known as [...] "Camp Sacrifice" [...] {{because of the large}} amounts merchandise discarded nearby. Travelers had pushed along the relatively easy path to Fort Laramie with their luxury items but discarded them before the difficult mountain crossing ahead, and after discovering that many items could be purchased at the forts or located for free along the way. Some travelers carried their excess goods to Salt Lake City to be sold.|$|E
2500|$|Norsk Transport {{had four}} ferries that transported the wagons [...] down Lake Tinn from M√¶l to Tinnoset.

Until 1936 Norsk Transport had to compete with a passenger steamship service, but after their closing the railway ferries were responsible for all passenger traffic on the lake, which also helped boost passenger traffic on the trains. The increased transport after World War II was a heavy burden on the two steamships, and in 1953 Norsk Transport ordered MF Storegut, a diesel powered ship of 1,119 gross tonnes. She was launched on 25 May 1956, and the two older ferries were put to reserve duty in the meantime.|$|E
2500|$|Hills or ridges {{in front}} of the {{railroad}} road bed would have to have a flat-bottomed, V shaped [...] "cut" [...] made to get the railroad through the ridge or hill. The type of material determined the slope of the V and how much material would have to be removed. Ideally, these cuts would be matched with valley fills that could use the dug out material to bring the road bed up to grade--cut and fill construction. In the 1860s there was no heavy equipment {{that could be used to}} make these cuts or <b>haul</b> <b>it</b> away to make the fills. The options were to dig it out by pick and shovel, haul the hillside material by wheelbarrow and/or horse or mule cart or blast it loose. To blast a V shaped cut out, they had to drill several holes up to [...] deep in the material, fill them with black powder, and blast the material away. Since the Central Pacific was in a hurry, they were profligate users of black powder to blast their way though the hills. The only disadvantage came when a nearby valley needed fill to get across it. The explosive technique often blew most of the potential fill material down the hillside, making it unavailable for fill. Initially, many valleys were bridged by [...] "temporary" [...] trestles that could be rapidly built and were later replaced by much lower maintenance and permanent solid fill. The existing railroad made transporting and putting material in valleys much easier‚Äîload it on railway dump cars, haul where needed and dump it over the side of the trestle.|$|E
