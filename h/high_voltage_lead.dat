40|$|Abstract: The {{electromagnetic}} pulse simulator designed {{in this paper}} consists of an adjustable direct current high voltage source, a capacitor for energy-storage, an air spark gap switch, a resistive divider for measurement and a GHz transversal electromagnetic wave (GTEM) cell. The analysis model is constructed based on the theory of transmission line. Influencing factors, such as self-load and impedance mismatch of the transmission line (as well as the cell), were analyzed using Pspice. The self-load {{has the effect of}} parallel connection with the load of GTEM cell. It may increase the rise-time, decrease the fall time and reduce the voltage peak. The sudden change of the transmission line impedance will make the waveform of pulse contain reflected oscillation. Four types of resistance divider link were also simulated using Pspice.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{collecting}} radon progeny was investigated that reduces particle concentration including radon progeny in indoor air without air movement. The LECA (for bge Electrostatically Charged-) system uses a high voltage source {{to charge the}} collector surfaces (e. g., furniture pieces were used) once they have been electrically isolated from ground by teflon film. When a piece was touched by the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>lead</b> its entire surface immediately become charged to about 60 % of the line voltage regardless of its material makeup. By limiting the current to 250 ua no sparking or shock sensation was experienced when touching the charged wire or collector surfaces.

The optimum LECA configuration tested reduced all particulate in the test-room including both the attached and unattached progeny by about 92 %. BACKGROUND Lung cancer, the priiciple radon health effect, is not caused by the radon gas itself but by its progeny, especially by the smaller unattached progeny particles that can penetrate into the deep respiratory tract.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{cryogenic liquid}} oxygen, liquid methane (LOX/LCH 4) reaction control system (RCS) was tested at NASA Glenn Research Center's Plum Brook Station in the Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility (B- 2) under vacuum and thermal vacuum conditions. The RCS is a subsystem of the Integrated Cryogenic Propulsion Test Article (ICPTA), a pressure-fed LOX/LCH 4 propulsion system {{composed of a}} single 2, 800 lbf main engine, two 28 lbf RCS engines, and two 7 lbf RCS engines. Propellants are stored in four 48 inch diameter 5083 aluminum tanks that feed both the main engine and RCS engines in parallel. Helium stored cryogenically in a composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) flows through a heat exchanger on the main engine before being used to pressurize the propellant tanks to a design operating pressure of 325 psi. The ICPTA is capable of simultaneous main engine and RCS operation. The RCS engines utilize a coil-on-plug (COP) ignition system designed for operation in a vacuum environment, eliminating corona discharge issues associated with a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>lead.</b> There are two RCS pods on the ICPTA, with two engines on each pod. One of these two engines is a heritage flight engine from Project Morpheus. Its sea level nozzle was removed and replaced by an 85 : 1 nozzle machined using Inconel 718, resulting in a maximum thrust of 28 lbf under altitude conditions. The other engine is a scaled down version of the 28 lbf engine, designed to match the core and overall mixture ratios {{as well as other}} injector characteristics. This engine can produce a maximum thrust of 7 lbf with an 85 : 1 nozzle that was additively manufactured using Inconel 718. Both engines are film-cooled and capable of limited duration gas-gas and gas-liquid operation, as well as steady-state liquid-liquid operation. Each pod contains one of each version, such that two engines of the same thrust level can be fired as a couple on opposite pods. The RCS feed system is composed of symmetrical 3 / 8 inch lines that tap off of the main propellant manifold to send LOX and LCH 4 outboard to the RCS pods. A Thermodynamic Vent System (TVS) is used to condition propellants at each pod by venting through an orifice and then routing the cold expansion products back through tubing that is welded along {{a large portion of the}} main RCS feed lines. Prior to final installation on the ICPTA, the RCS engines were tested in a small vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Energy Systems Test Area (ESTA) to verify functionality of the new COP ignition system and check out operation of the vacuum nozzles. After engine-level testing, the RCS engines were installed on the vehicle and a series of integrated hot-fire tests were performed at JSC consisting of various pulsing and steady-state firings as well as integrated main engine/RCS operation. The ICPTA was then integrated into the Plum Brook B- 2 facility for vacuum and thermal/vacuum testing. Testing in the B- 2 facility was composed of multiple thermal and pressure environments. The first set of tests were performed under ambient temperature and altitude pressure conditions. These tests consisted of a range of minimum impulse bit (MIB) pulsing sequences with low duty cycle, analogous to a coast phase in which the RCS is primarily used for station keeping. The primary goal of this sequence is to understand how propellant conditions were effected without an active TVS. In this scenario, consistent gas-gas operation is desirable since it results in a smaller MIB and more efficient propellant consumption. Multiple skin thermocouples are mounted on the feedlines, in addition to a submerged thermocouple on each commodity, in order to gather thermal data on the system. Higher duty cycle pulsing tests were then performed, analogous to an ascent or landing mission phase. The primary goal of this sequence was to examine how well the engines self-conditioned without active TVS when starting from a quiescent state. The TVS was then activated during some tests to demonstrate the capability to quickly condition the engines for higher pulsing demand scenarios. A thermocouple at the TVS outlet allows for the calculation of energy absorbed by the vented propellant. Lastly, tests with longer pulses and multiple engines firing either in sequence or simultaneously were run in order to gather transient system response data on waterhammer. Six total high-speed pressure transducers are installed on the RCS system, one sensor at the end of each propellant manifold line on the pods, and one at the tap-off location for each commodity. This will allow for the accurate characterization of waterhammer in the system under various propellant conditions and firing sequences. Other instrumentation for this test series includes nozzle throat thermocouples, chamber pressure measurement, heat soakback measurement, and tank wall plume impingement temperature measurement. The next set of tests were performed to demonstrate simultaneous main engine and RCS operation. Data from this test will be used to examine if there is any change to nominal operation of the RCS as a result of feed system interaction or other phenomenon. Some of these tests began under high vacuum conditions (target ambient pressure less than 1 x 10 (exp - 3) torr) and others began at altitude conditions. The last set of tests were performed with the B- 2 cold wall active. Under these tests, many of the same low duty cycle MIB tests were repeated in order to characterize how propellant conditions changed with the lower heat leak. In this scenario the RCS manifold experiences much less heat leak, resulting in a change to how well the engines self-condition. As a result, an increase in maximum waterhammer pressures and a change in natural frequency of the system was expected due to higher density propellants. The lower heat leak should also result in a change to the MIB pulse profile, and data will be examined to understand how MIB repeatability is affected in the different operating environments. Parallel to the test efforts, a set of transient model development efforts were made to predict RCS performance. The primary effort was aimed at producing a SINDA/FLUINT model to predict propellant conditioning up to the engine inlet as a function of different environmental and operating parameters, with the goal of predicting chamber pressure, TVS performance, and propellant consumption over time. Preliminary results for this effort will be presented in comparison with test data. Additional modeling efforts were made using SINDA/FLUINT to predict waterhammer in the system since the software is capable of handling multiphase transient fluid dynamics. These results will be compared with the high-speed pressure transducer test data for validation purposes...|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Under {{the effect of a}} sufficiently strong electric field, all materials suffer from a form of breakdown, which involves the flow of current through them. Although wood is sometimes utilized as an electrical insulator, it is also subject to breakdown when exposed to high electric fields. In general, dielectric breakdown is considered a negative effect for electrically insulating materials since it implies the loss of insulating properties of the material. However, the high temperatures generated inside the material can be used as an efficient way to induce the thermo-chemical decomposition of biomass with the purpose of sustainable energy generation. A mathematical model of the dynamics of temperature and electric field inside a small piece of biomass is developed to study temperature distribution and thermal instability growth under thermal dielectric breakdown conditions. A two-dimensional model is implemented for different electric field strengths with biomass dielectric properties obtained from the literature. Temperature, current and electric potential distributions have been analyzed and reported for several cases. The temperature development over time has also been analyzed and reported. The results show that <b>higher</b> <b>voltages</b> <b>lead</b> to almost instantaneous thermal breakdown. Similar results are obtained for AC voltage when the frequency is decreased.

Taken together, they can both educate the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> array designer in the engineering and science of spacecraft charging {{in the presence of}} dense plasmas and provide techniques for designing and testing <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> solar arrays to prevent electrical discharges and power drains...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the current state}} and trends of bipolar and BIMOS high power devices and their packages. At the <b>highest</b> power and <b>voltage</b> levels the GCT/IGCT is consolidating its position and is gradually substituting the GTO. The maximum GCT ratings in terms of current and voltage are more deter-mined by market forces than by device physics. Improved plasma engineering in <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> IGBTs will <b>lead</b> to further reduction of losses. The ma-jor tools for plasma engineering are discussed. Modern simulation tools allow to determine the performance limits of a Si diode at a given voltage. Today's best diodes are not very far from this limit. The diode is a performance limiting element in many <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> circuits. Recent progress in SiC technology makes hybrid solutions consisting of Si switches and SiC diodes feasible. Module packages for traction applications still need some derating due to extreme power cycling reli-ability requirements. Better thermo-mechanical matching has lead to major improvements. The an-tagonism between standardization and integration is hotly debated...|$|R
40|$|Research work of polymer nanocomposites in <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> {{insulator}} becomes interest nowadays. Polymer based and nanofillers are {{the core}} components in polymer nanocomposites. In previous works, by adding {{such a big}} amount of nanofiller it will enhance the electrical and mechanical properties of polymers. However as for today, a little percentage of nanofiller concentration could dramatically enhanced {{the properties of the}} polymeric material. Partial discharge in insulator material is one of a big issue in <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> system that <b>leads</b> to electrical degradation and thermal losses. Recent research of graphene oxide (GO) nanofiller has brought to this project interest. Hence, this work focused into the development and simulation of PMMA (poly methyl methacrylate) /GO nanocomposites followed by PD test according to CIGRE METHOD II. The PMMA/GO and pure PMMA was synthesized by using radical polymerization and solvent dissolution method meanwhile simulation process was conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics software. From this work it could be noticed that the PMMA/GO has better performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} heat-assisted {{magnetic}} recording (HAMR) potentially suitable for probe-based storage systems is characterized. In this work, field emission current from a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} (STM) tip is used as the heating source. Pulse voltages of 2 - 7 V {{with a duration of}} 500 ns were applied to a CoNi/Pt multilayered film. Different types of Ir/Pt and W STM tips were used in the experiment. The results show that thermally recorded magnetic marks are formed with a nearly uniform mark size of 170 nm when the pulse voltage is above a threshold voltage. The threshold voltage depends on the material work function of the tip, with W having a threshold voltage about 1 V lower than Pt. The emission area of our tip-sample system derived from an analytic expression for field emission current is approximately equal to the mark size, and is largely independent of pulse voltage. This emission area is large compared to lateral heat diffusion in the film. Thus <b>higher</b> applied <b>voltages</b> <b>lead</b> to <b>higher</b> peak temperatures in the model of the write process, but the mark diameter remains relatively unchanged...|$|R
40|$|The {{solder joint}} {{reliability}} of ceramic chip resistors assembled to laminate substrates {{has been a}} long time concern for systems exposed to hush environments such as those found in automotive and aerospace applications. This is due to a combination of the extreme t emperam excursions experienced by the assemblies along with the large coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches between the alumina bodies of the chip resistors and the glass-epoxy composites of the printed circuit boards (PCBs). These reliability challenges are exacerbated for components with larger physical size (distance to neutral point) such as the 2512 resistors used in situations where <b>higher</b> <b>voltages</b> and/or currents <b>lead</b> to power dissipations up to 1 Wan. In this work the thermal cycling reliability of several 2512 chip resistor lead free solder join...|$|R
30|$|In RRAM, many {{theoretical}} works concerning calculation and simulation were reported. Several {{models have}} been proposed to describe and calculate the ballistic transportation and conductance quantization phenomenon in RRAM devices. As mentioned above, two conditions, i.e., small conductor dimension and <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> bias, <b>lead</b> to ballistic transportation and conductance quantization, so in all proposed models, either the CF in resistive layer has been considered an atomic-sized conductor in insulator or the most constrictive part in CF is treated as being of atomic size. In this section, we will summarize four models. In the first one, the CF formed in the resistive layer {{is regarded as a}} one-dimensional linear atomic chain [175]. The second model treated the narrowest part of a CF as an atomic contact and calculated the electrical transport based on Landauer theory [179, 186, 212]. The third model focuses on CFs consisted of oxygen vacancies and calculated the quantized conductance of the filament with different space of oxygen vacancies through first principle calculation [69]. The fourth model is a circuit model, which ascribes the quantized conductance of the atom point contact in the ECM device to the discharge of the thermal emf voltage [195, 213].|$|R
