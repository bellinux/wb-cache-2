The Mets-Willets Point subway stop would be rebuilt, and $50 million has been allocated toward planning and designing this work in the 2015-2019 MTA Capital Program. The LIRR stop, {{as part of that}} Capital Program, would be rebuilt for $75 million. The subway station and the LIRR station would be integrated with nearby buses as part of the overhaul for greater <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity.</b> The station could also possibly hold ancillary airport functions, employee parking, and a Consolidated Rent-a-Car facility.|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of port performance is relevant for port users, policy makers, port developers and other stakeholders. This paper describes {{the development of}} one port performance indicator: <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity.</b> <b>Intermodal</b> <b>connectivity</b> is relevant, as many port authorities as well as policymakers have the ambition to handle {{a larger share of}} the volumes with intermodal transport. A higher share of intermodal transport requires a better connectivity between ports and intermodal terminals in the hinterland. This paper presents two <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity</b> indicators, one for a specific port and one for as group of ports. At least in Europe, reliable data on intermodal services is not publicly available. Thus, we developed an <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity</b> indicator based on data provided by individual ports. 26 ports provided data, these ports handle roughly 70 % of all container volumes. The data for 2010 and 2011 suggest that the <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity</b> of the EU has increased in 2011. We finalize the paper with conclusions and future research options to further advance this indicator...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{employment}} has continuously {{declined in}} developed economies {{for more than}} decade time, but service sector in turn has significantly grown. Services also include warehousing, which connects customers and globally concentrated manufacturing units together. In this manuscript we examine location criteria for warehouses in Northern European companies (Finland and Sweden) as well as location of their warehouse network in larger Europe. Our research shows based on multiyear survey that primarily warehouses are established to have: (1) low distribution costs, (2) road transportation connection, and (3) assembly/manufacturing units are near-by. Currently in different contexts is being emphasized <b>intermodal</b> transports, railway <b>connectivity,</b> future potential of location as well as low labour cost are considered to have secondary up to quinary importance. In country level differences we show based on completed surveys that Finnish companies are more active in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC), while Swedish companies have been extremely cautious with this regard. </p...|$|R

40|$|A Direct Ridership Model (DRM) for {{predicting}} Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) patronage in Southern California is estimated. Attributes of bus stops and their surroundings constitute the data {{observations of the}} DRM, enabling a fairly fine-resolution of analysis {{to be carried out}} on factors that influence ridership. The best-fitting DRM revealed that service frequency strongly influences BRT patronage in Los Angeles County. High <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity,</b> with both feeder bus routes and rail-transit services, also significantly induces BRT travel. Population densities also contribute to BRT patronage {{and in the case of}} exclusive-lane BRT services, higher employment densities further increase higher daily boardings. The strong statistical fit of the model bodes well for DRM as a platform for estimating BRT patronage in coming years. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite of Commuters {{often use}} {{more than one}} mode of {{transport}} even in a single journey an Intermodal coordination and organizational facilities of public transport service in Sri Lanka {{is yet to be}} developed. Transport Integration means coordination of two or more modes with a combine time table. Developing of integration between transport modes is difficult in Sri Lanka as several authorities separately involve in a decentralized sector fragmented transport service. In this context implementing of <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity</b> in the public transport system is a paramount requirement {{to improve the quality of}} the service. Most of the passengers use to visit Colombo city when they travel other main cities of the country, since the Central, Gunasinghepura and Bastian Mawata bus stands and Fort rail way station of Colombo city function as primary hubs for bus and rail transport respectively though no proper integration in between above two modes. Aftermath is unnecessary traffic congestion in the city which leads environmental pollution as well as disadvantages of passengers such as long trip length and travel time etc. Proper railway system can prevent the congestion of roads in substantial extent. Passengers who use rail are not facilitated with an intermodal connection up to their destinations and hence they often use to walk more than 100 m distance for the bus. This may discourage passengers’ use of rail. The rail transport carries only a 10 % of its total demand in Sri Lanka. In this study the necessity of rail & bus integration in Colombo metropolitan region to reduce the difficulties of public transport passengers is explained comprehensively. Dematagoda rail station and surrounding bus stop towards Borella was taken to explain the current situation and the need of the connectivity in between Dematagoda station and bus stop towards Borella. An Origin/Destination and boarding counting survey was conducted to find the current situation. The study identified travel characteristics, demand for <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity</b> of the rail & bus passengers and their travel requirements to minimize the difficulties of their journeys. 63 % and 66 % of bus and rail passengers respectively use rail and bus as access mode. Majority of bus and rail passengers have home based work trips. It is 50 % and 53 % while the percentage of home based other trips are 42 % and 41 % respectively. There is no significant difference in trip purposes between rail and bus passengers. The railway can therefore, be expected to attract all types of trips. Therefore it is necessary to improve the quality of the public transport service for commuter satisfaction. In this context participation of support of responsible authorities to implement an efficient <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity</b> of public transport system, giving special emphasis to Rail/Bus integration in Colombo metropolitan region...|$|E
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} {{as the final}} deliverable for Phase II of a project for the California Department of Transportation to develop a combined quantitative and qualitative approach for planning for improved <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity</b> at California airports.

40|$|The Marine Agency-Roads and Transport Authority (MA-RTA) of Dubai-UAE {{recently}} {{undertook a}} study {{to develop a new}} transport policy for service delivery. The goal of the new policy is to increase rider share and use of MA-RTA services. The existing service policy guidelines of the water transit services were barely supported by the loading patterns, existing market coverage, adequate intermodal planning tools, economic feasibility, and capital return of services. Based on user and operators surveys of the water transit services, aiming at assessing the baseline conditions, methodologies are suggested to estimate important service attributes, including service coverage, <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity,</b> and market demand estimation. The estimated service attributes were used as measures to develop the service policy standards to increase water transit ridership and enhance service efficiency. It is recommended to incorporate some of the service standard/guideline measures under a framework discussed in this study for developing service plans, monitoring performance, and providing short or long term alteration to the services...|$|E
40|$|The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) is {{undertaking}} {{efforts to}} assess the potential economic development benefits associated with highway corridor improvements at the middle-stage planning level. The primary objective {{of this research is}} to demonstrate and document the use of the EconWorks W. E. B. (wider economic benefits) tools for assessing the wider economic benefits (reliability, accessibility, and <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity)</b> of transportation projects in the State of Indiana. A parallel analysis of selected projects using TREDIS was also conducted in order to compare the relative merit or synergies between the tools. In the short term, the implementation of this study will consist of a set of training sessions for INDOT and MPOs. These sessions will cover the theoretical background as well as demonstrate the use of the EconWorks W. E. B. tools.

40|$|Performance of <b>Intermodal</b> <b>Connectivity</b> (EPIC) to Improve Public Transportation ” under Contract 65 A 0194 with Caltrans. Our primary {{objective}} {{in this project}} is to develop an evaluation tool that transit agencies can use to assess the quality of service at transit transfer facilities and use the findings of such evaluations to improve travel connectivity. Such improvements, can, in turn, help the overall transportation system operate more smoothly and can make transit a more attractive travel option and thus can eventually contribute to increases in ridership. In this report we evaluate the performance of transit transfer facilities by identifying factors from the literature most relevant to transit connectivity. We classify these factors from three perspectives: 1) passengers/users, 2) transit operators, and 3) neighboring communities. While {{all three of these}} perspectives are important we argue that passengers/users ’ factors should be given priority over other considerations in designing or renovating transfer facilities because users are the raison d’etre of public transit. Transit users’ main requirements for transfer facilities are related to the ease in use of facilities for making transfers, including: 1) minimal transfer time and distance, 2) convenience, 3) comfort, and 4) safety and security. But while customers may be the priority, transit operators can have separat...|$|E

Many factors affect travel choices, including time, labor, cost, security, convenience, and comfort of the entire trip. As such, privately-owned automobiles have many advantages over traditional fixed-route public transit in providing higher levels of accessibility, flexibility, convenience, comfort, and safety against crime. The relative burdens of public transit service vis-à-vis private automobiles help to explain why the majority of personal travel in metropolita...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to provide {{proof-of-concept}} research for the development of a Pittsburgh Aerotropolis, focused on the Pittsburgh International Airport, including developable properties within thirty minutes driving time of the airport. An ‘”aerotropolis” is a planned and coordinated multi-modal freight and transportation complex that provides efficient, cost-effective, sustainable, and <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity</b> to a defined region of economic significance centered around a major airport. Speed and agility are its hallmarks. The ideal aerotropolis has close access to the four fundamental R’s of transportation: runways, roads, rail, and river. Pittsburgh is uniquely suited for the development of an aerotropolis in the eastern United States because the airport has excess landing capacity and is not landlocked. The goal of the Pittsburgh aerotropolis is to attract new development and jobs to the airport area from outside the region rather than to relocate existing development and jobs from within the region. MGB 2 ̆ 6 Associates (MGB) was engaged by the Department of Economic Development (DED) of the County of Allegheny with participation of the Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County and the Allegheny County Airport Authority.

40|$|High-speed rail (HSR) {{has emerged}} as one of the most revolutionary and {{transformative}} transportation technologies, having a profound impact on urban-regional accessibility and inter-city travel across Europe, Japan, and more recently China and other Asian countries. One of HSR’s biggest advantages over air travel is that it offers passengers a one-seat ride into the center of major cities, eliminating time-consuming airport transfers and wait times, and providing ample opportunities for intermodal transfers at these locales. Thus, HSR passengers are typically able to arrive at stations that are only a short walk away from central business districts and major tourist attractions, without experiencing any of the stress that car drivers often experience in negotiating such highly congested environments. Such an approach requires a high level of coordination and planning of the infrastructural and spatial aspects of the HSR service, and a high degree of <b>intermodal</b> <b>connectivity.</b> But what key elements can help the US high-speed rail system blend successfully with other existing rail and transit services? That question is critically important now that high-speed rail is under construction in California. The study seeks to understand the requirements for high levels of connectivity and spatial and operational integration of HSR stations and offer recommendations for seamless, and convenient integrated service in California intercity rail/HSR stations. The study draws data from a review of the literature on the connectivity, intermodality, and spatial and operational integration of transit systems; a survey of 26 high-speed rail experts from six different European countries; and an in-depth look of the German and Spanish HSR systems and some of their stations, which are deemed as exemplary models of station connectivity. The study offers recommendations on how to enhance both the spatial and the operational connectivity of high-speed rail systems giving emphasis on four spatial zones: the station, the station neighborhood, the municipality at large, and the region...|$|E
