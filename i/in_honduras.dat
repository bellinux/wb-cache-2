5|$|After 1530, it was {{the colonists}} {{themselves}} who held the keys to power, installing new governors and removing them from office. By 1534, the Spanish colony <b>in</b> <b>Honduras</b> was close to collapse. Trujillo had a population of less than two hundred; {{it was the}} only Spanish settlement <b>in</b> <b>Honduras,</b> and very little territory beyond the town itself had been conquered. The Spanish were beset by infighting, and had provoked widespread indigenous uprisings. Simultaneously, the native population had collapsed as a result of disease, mistreatment, and the export of large numbers to work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands.|$|E
5|$|Honduras was a {{relatively}} poor province and did not attract the most distinguished conquistadors. Most conquistadors and colonists who ventured to Honduras desired to return quickly to Spain with newly acquired wealth and improved social status, and were therefore looking for immediate enrichment. The progress of conquest {{was based on the}} distribution of encomienda rights and land concessions. Encomienda gave the encomendero (holder of the encomienda) the right to receive tribute and labour from the indigenous inhabitants of a defined area. Up until the middle of the 16th century, the encomendero could assign his own level of tribute and labour to be provided by the natives within his encomienda, which gave rise to much abuse. The encomiendas established <b>in</b> <b>Honduras</b> were small, and did not generate rapid income. Social advancement was gained by overlordship of natives within the encomienda system. <b>In</b> <b>Honduras,</b> the conquistadors gained immediate income by selling natives into slavery on the Caribbean islands and in Panama, and by mining activities. This in turn resulted in a reduction of indigenous population levels <b>in</b> <b>Honduras,</b> with a rapid drop in economic production {{during the first half of}} the 16th century. On the whole, the Spanish colonists were unwilling to invest time and resources into the long-term development of the agricultural production of their encomiendas <b>in</b> <b>Honduras.</b>|$|E
