5|$|Further, the Court {{disapproved of}} the judge's having asked the jury for the {{proportions}} of their deadlock (<b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not ask how many were for conviction and how many were for acquittal). In Brasfield v. United States (1926), citing Burton, the Court held that such was reversible error, {{regardless of whether the}} defendant objected in the trial court.|$|E
5|$|Edler was {{responsible}} for a knee-on-knee hit to Carolina Hurricanes captain Eric Staal in {{the quarterfinals of the}} 2013 IIHF World Championship, and was suspended for the final two games of the championship. Sweden {{went on to win the}} gold medal, and Edler was awarded a medal <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not play in the gold medal game. On 29 July 2013, the IIHF extended the suspension to cover Sweden's first two games of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Edler later joined team Sweden during the Olympics after his two-game suspension. He recorded a goal and two assists in the tournament, helping Sweden earn the silver medal.|$|E

5000|$|In March 1843 Heinrich Heine {{wrote about}} Thalberg: His {{performance}} is so gentlemanly, so entirely without any forced acting the genius, so entirely without that well-known brashness {{that makes a}} poor cover for inner insecurity. Healthy women love him. So <b>do</b> sickly women, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not engage their sympathy by epileptic seizures at the piano, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not play at their overstrung, delicate nerves, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> neither electrifies them nor galvanizes them.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} duel with Chambers, Rowan moved to Frankfort, Kentucky, the state capital. In 1802, {{he was one}} of 32 men who signed a pledge to bring James Madison to Transylvania University as superintendent. This action began a long {{relationship}} between Rowan and Transylvania, and the university presented him with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1823. Governor Christopher Greenup appointed Rowan Secretary of State in 1804. He served until 1806, when {{he was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. He represented Kentucky's Third District (which included Bardstown) during the Tenth Congress from March 4, 1807 to March 3, 1809, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not reside in that district at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} was then {{appealed to the}} Court of Appeal and argued on 23 and 24 April. The Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court's decision. The court decided that the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 had been implicitly repealed when the Irish Free State, an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they {{had no control over}} what happened to them. It was completely appropriate to issue a writ of habeas corpus against the Home Secretary because, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him. The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.|$|E
5|$|Disagreements {{between the}} barons {{and the king}} intensified. The barons, under Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, {{captured}} most of southeast England in the Second Barons' War. At the Battle of Lewes in 1264, Henry and Prince Edward were defeated and taken prisoner. De Montfort assembled the Great Parliament, recognized as the first Parliament {{because it was the}} first time the cities and boroughs had sent representatives. Edward escaped, raised an army and defeated and killed de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Savage retribution was inflicted upon the rebels, and authority restored to Henry. With the realm now peaceful, Edward left England to join Louis IX on the Ninth Crusade; he was one of the last crusaders. Louis died before Edward's arrival, but Edward decided to continue. The result was disappointing; Edward's small force only enabled him to capture Acre and launch a handful of raids. After surviving an assassination attempt, Edward left for Sicily later in the year, never to participate in a crusade again. When Henry III died, Edward acceded to the throne; the barons swore allegiance to him <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not return for two years.|$|E

5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not pursue}} or seek out elected office, Sprigg was {{repeatedly}} {{called upon to}} run for office by the West Virginia Democratic Party. After his term as attorney general, he was elected to several terms as mayor of Moorefield. In 1888, despite his protest before the Democratic Party state convention, he was nominated to run for a seat in West Virginia House of Delegates representing the Second Delegate District, which consisted of Grant and Hardy counties. He was elected following a highly contested campaign and served for the 1889 legislative session. During his tenure, Sprigg served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and was initially a candidate for Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. Also in 1888, Sprigg was selected as part of West Virginia's attending delegation to the inauguration of President Benjamin Harrison. To resolve the disputed results of the 1888 gubernatorial election between Aretas B. Fleming and Nathan Goff, Jr., Sprigg was appointed in April 1889 as secretary of a joint committee of the West Virginia Legislature charged with investigating and deciding the results of the election. While serving on the committee, he was a dominant spokesman for the Democratic side in support of Fleming, who was ultimately chosen as the winner of the election.|$|E
25|$|In {{case the}} problem {{could not be}} solved, any other {{important}} contribution to classical mechanics would then {{be considered to be}} prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincaré, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not solve the original problem.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{maintained}} a solid lead over all other contenders by securing {{more than half}} of the delegates allocated or elected in the month of March.

50|$|Commetators {{have noted}} a {{parallel}} between the underlying Japanese fairy tale of Urashima Tarō and the Irish legend around Oisín and the fairy princess of the sea, and Hearn might have recalled this legend in writing the piece, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not explicitly state this.|$|R
25|$|The next tour game, against Barbados, was a draw. Ogilvie was {{selected}} to play <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not arrive in Barbados until {{the second day of}} the match, in order to give him a chance to make the test eleven. Australia batted well, with both Serjeant and Simpson scoring centuries, with half centuries to Wood, Darling and Ogilvie.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Hofname was {{the first}} type of commoners' family name to become heritable. This process began still in the Late Middle Ages (14th to 15th century); e.g. Ulrich Zwingli (b. 1484) {{inherited}} his father's surname, in origin a Hofname (from the term Twing, denoting a type of walled-in estate) <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not inherit his estate.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Congress {{passed the}} Former Presidents Act, {{offering}} a $25,000 yearly pension to each former president. Hoover, {{who was the}} only other living former president, took the pension <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing former President Truman whose precarious financial status {{played a role in the}} law's enactment.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Herzog is {{featured}} on the Nazi Zombies website dedicated to the Call of Duty: World at War, Zombies map, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not appear in the}} game and there is no relationship between the map and the film, apart from the concept of Nazi zombies.|$|R
50|$|It {{is clear}} from this that Snorri was {{familiar}} with the role of Váli as Höðr's slayer, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not relate that myth in the Gylfaginning prose. Some scholars have speculated that he found it distasteful since Höðr is essentially innocent in his version of the story.|$|R
50|$|Sieg never tells Arcia the {{intentions}} why <b>he</b> pursues Victor, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> say the two {{knew each other}} from before. Because of this lack of trust, Arcia briefly loses her faith in Sieg and sets off to find Victor alone. Sieg eventually catches up and subsequently teams up with her once more after he consoles her.|$|R
25|$|Ellis had exaggerated {{fears of}} {{speaking}} {{in public and}} during his adolescence, he was extremely shy around women. At age 19, already showing signs of thinking like a cognitive-behavioral therapist, {{he forced himself to}} talk to 100 women in the Bronx Botanical Gardens over a period of a month. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not get a date, he reported that he desensitized himself to his fear of rejection by women.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017 it was {{announced}} that Breslow would be on the roster for Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic main tournament. He pulled out of being on the team in round one after the Twins offered him an invite to spring training, and was placed in Team Israel's designated pitcher pool, meaning he could be added in later rounds <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not play for the team in rounds one or two.|$|E
25|$|Unable to find {{employment}} upon return, Rocker {{decided to}} move to Liverpool. A former Whitechapel comrade of his persuaded him to become the editor of a recently founded Yiddish weekly newspaper called Dos Fraye Vort (The Free Word), <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not speak the language at the time. The newspaper only appeared for eight issues, but it led the Arbeter Fraint group to re-launch its eponymous newspaper and invite Rocker to return to the capital and take over as its editor.|$|E
5000|$|Dennett {{believes}} {{there is little or}} no principled difference between the naturally generated products of evolution and the man-made artifacts of human creativity and culture.

50|$|Prince Ronald: Ronald is {{revealed}} to be a narcissistic and selfish prince. He has picked Elizabeth for his queen, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not really love her.

25|$|A Biblical commandment {{states a}} shochet must give the foreleg, cheeks and maw to a Kohen <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not own the meat.

25|$|A {{survivor}} of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, Joseph Weismann, was awarded the Escapees' Medal in 2014 <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not meet the criteria {{set out in the}} 1959 decree. At the age of 11, Weismann had escaped from Beaune-la-Rolande transit camp, where the French authorities interned Jews who were to be sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. Weismann had been applying for the Escapees' Medal over a period of about 15 years before the French government finally awarded it to him.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Tabuse {{signed with}} the Los Angeles Clippers, but was waived {{before the start of}} the regular season. That fall, Tabuse {{appeared}} on a limited edition cover of NBA Live video game in Japan, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not play a single NBA regular season game. That year, he was drafted by the Albuquerque Thunderbirds of the NBA Development League (D-League) and averaged 6.5 points and 4.0 assists in 34 games before he was waived on March 16, 2006.|$|E
25|$|After his recuperation, Welsh {{moved back}} to Washington, D.C. While working as a {{bookkeeper}} at a local gas company, Welsh {{wrote a letter to}} the Wright brothers after seeing a flight demonstration in Virginia, but did not receive a job offer with the company.

2500|$|Moorcock is {{somewhat}} dismissive {{of the works}} of J. R. R. Tolkien. He met both Tolkien and C. S.

Moorcock criticised works like The Lord of the Rings for their [...] "Merry England" [...] point of view, famously equating Tolkien's novel to Winnie-the-Pooh in his essay Epic Pooh.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{formally}} not {{heading the}} PiS candidature for either, Kaczyński {{is widely considered}} the mastermind behind the PiS victories in both the 2015 presidential and 2015 parliamentary elections. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not serve as either prime minister or president, and is formally {{just one of the}} 460 MPs in the Polish parliament, he is seen by some as de facto leader and {{the most powerful man in}} Poland.|$|R
