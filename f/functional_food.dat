However, when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light even after harvesting, natural ergosterols in mushrooms produce vitamin D2, a process now used to supply fresh vitamin D mushrooms for the <b>functional</b> <b>food</b> grocery market. In a comprehensive safety assessment of producing vitamin D in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light technologies were equally effective for vitamin D production as in mushrooms exposed to natural sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production of vitamin D in food.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} attitudes to <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> (here defined as foods with health claims) among Swedish consumers and health-care professionals. The aim is also to survey demographics and health interests associated with the consumption of <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> among Swedish consumers. Finally, {{the aim is to}} investigate health-care professionals’ knowledge of and willingness to recommend <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> to patients. Examples of <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> used in the studies are probiotic fruit-drinks, probiotic milk-products, cholesterol-lowering spreads and fibre-rich bread with omega- 3 fatty acids. Ten focus groups of consumers and three of health-care professionals were conducted. Two questionnaires were also used, one for consumers aged 17 - 75 years (n= 2000) and one for health-care professionals (dieticians, n= 100; registered nurses, n= 200; physicians, n= 200). Almost half of the consumers (48 %) and exactly half (50 %) of the health-care professionals responded. The consumers wondered whether the <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> were normal foods or medicines. They considered <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> unnecessary, unless you suffer from incurable diet-related problems. The consumers were worried that the foods {{could be used as a}} compensation for an unhealthy lifestyle. While the consumers in the focus groups were mainly sceptical towards <b>functional</b> <b>foods,</b> these foods are being consumed by those who perceive them as necessary, the health-conscious, the well-educated and people who have noticed effect of the foods. The registered nurses and physicians, in contrast to the dieticians, expressed doubts regarding the claimed effects of the <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> The dieticians rated higher knowledge and were more willing to recommend <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> to patients than were the physicians and, to some extent, the registered nurses. The interviews with the health-care professionals revealed that the dieticians were more positive towards <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> than the registered nurses and, primarily, the physicians.

However, {{little is known about}} the association of sociodemographic and health factors with the use of health-promoting <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> Objective: The study examined the use of <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> in Finland. Four widely used product types were examined in detail with respect to sociodemographic factors and personal efforts to promote health. Design: Data were obtained by computer-assisted telephone interviews of 1210 respondents representing the Finnish population above 15 years of age. Logistic regression analysis was applied to analyse the predictors of use of <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> Results: Sociodemographic variables were associated with the use of <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> The role of gender and age varied. In most cases, high education or high occupational position predicted use. Use was also associated with viewing healthy eating as important and consuming other <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> Efforts to lower cholesterol levels predicted the use of cholesterol-lowering spreads. Conclusions: Both sociodemographic factors and personal health efforts play a role in the adoption of <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> High socioeconomic position predicts use, whereas age and gender remain product specific. An important aspect is the connection of <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> with efforts to lead a healthy life.

40|$|Recently, the {{interest}} in <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> is increased dramatically thanks to some scientific evidences demonstrating that, regardless of their nutritional value, some foods components beneficially influence several functions of the body, making them “functional” for the prevention and treatment of degenerative diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In particular, the marketplace offers conventional and modified <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> which acting on intestine, glucose and lipid metabolism are potentially useful for diabetic patients. The field of <b>functional</b> <b>foods,</b> however, presents some criticalities. Up to now, only few <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> have obtained the statement of a “Health Claim”, either because there are not sufficient scientific evidences based on human intervention studies, that justify a “Health Claim”, or because data are {{not consistent with the}} proposed claims. In addition, some <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> show a low palatability and a lack of variety. Both these issues limit their ordinary intake. This critical aspect also involves the lack of a possible synergistic effect deriving from the contemporary consumption in the diet of different <b>functional</b> <b>foods,</b> as observed with some healthy dietary pattern. <b>Functional</b> <b>foods</b> represent, then, a challenge for the food industry, which needs to implement and/or develop innovative technologies able to create new foods with improved healthy properties, but also with better organoleptic properties suitable for a daily consumption. </p...|$|R

This review aims at exploring how metabolic profiling {{can be applied to}} the development of <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> Recent findings One of the biggest challenges of modern nutrition is to propose a healthy diet to populations worldwide that must suit high inter-individual variability driven by complex gene-nutrient-environment interactions. Although a number of <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> are now proposed in support of a healthy diet, a one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition is inappropriate and new personalised <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> are necessary.

40|$|This study extends extant {{research}} {{by examining the}} impetus behind the consumption of both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> It uses diaries and in-depth interviews and demonstrates that nutritionism theory, that is, where focus shifts from base food products to their constituent nutrients, is central to consumers' perception and consumption of <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> An unfortunate consequence is that consumers are unable to distinguish between nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor <b>functional</b> <b>foods,</b> believing instead the health claims of both. Nutritionally poor foods are often as unhealthy and calorific as nonfortified alternatives, and thus this consumption behaviour can {{have a negative impact}} on consumer well-being. This is exacerbated by <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> being used to boost unhealthy diets as an alternative to more substantial dietary overhaul and being habitually used as substitutes for healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables. Finally, this article reveals that theories of guilt and justification can and should be applied to the consumption of <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> because many consumers often use <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> and the nutrients therein to assuage any guilt resultant from unhealthy eating patterns. This study has important implications for nutrition policies. It illustrates the necessity of educating consumers about (i) what constitutes a healthy diet and (ii) the role of nutrients as building blocks in healthy diets, highlighting the importance of choosing appropriate sources for these nutrients. This should enable them to make healthier dietary choices and reduce their propensity to use <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> as a quick fix to unhealthy eating patterns...|$|R

40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>foods</b> have a {{major role}} in health {{enhancement}} and therefore there has been an increase in research aimed at identifying new <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> and nutraceuticals. The frontier between <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> and nutraceuticals is tenuous. <b>Functional</b> <b>foods</b> are foods, or dietary components, that may provide a health benefit beyond basic nutrition. Nutraceuticals are, in an abbreviated way, also foods or parts of food that provide health benefits, including the prevention or treatment of disease. Presently many academic, scientific and regulatory organizations are working in an integrated way to establish the scientific basis to support and validate the benefits of foods or food components. It seems that people who consume a wide variety of foods containing these bioactive molecules (like carotenoids, fibers, flavonoids, fatty acids, phytoestrogens, vitamins and minerals, among others) show a reduced risk of developing some diseases and tend to have a better health. For example, the use of antioxidants provides protection against harmful free radicals, usually associated with cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and age-related functional decline.
