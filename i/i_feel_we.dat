25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Growing Again", which {{describe}} Violent J growing into a giant, {{were inspired by}} Bruce's weight gain; Bruce also says that the song reflects {{the feeling of being}} able to [...] "rap about anything we want [...] <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> have the right for some songs to be softer and not about killing or Dark Carnival." [...] "The Tower" [...] describes a war veteran and expert marksman climbing a college tower and shooting people with an arsenal of weapons, a reference to Charles Whitman's 1966 murder spree.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} Knowles singing: [...] "I feel weak / We've {{been here before}} / 'Cause <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> keep {{going back and forth}} / Maybe it's over, maybe we're through / But I {{honestly}} can say I still love you." [...] The introduction is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but I honestly can say I still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / and maybe we lost a magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I called you selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|E

5000|$|Schwantz {{on winning}} the championship: “Everybody’s {{thinking}} about Wayne, {{and we all}} wish Wayne and Shae and Rex the best, {{but at the same}} time, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>we</b> raced all season ... to put ourselves in a position to be there to take advantage of any opportunities, any doors that were open. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>we</b> still earned it — we weren’t given it.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite many {{rumors and}} {{reports that the}} Rays would make a deal before the July 31 Trade deadline, the Rays made no trades. Andrew Friedman, Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations for the Rays, would comment {{on the lack of}} trade {{activity}} saying, [...] "At {{the end of the day}} we didn't find something that lined up for us. We're in first place on July 31 and we control our own destiny. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> have the talent on hand to continue to do what we did the first two-thirds of the season." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Keith Olbermann's claims in a March 2007 Rolling Stone interview {{in which he}} was quoted as saying, [...] "Anybody who would embellish the story of their own fiancé's murder should spend that hour a day not on television but in a psychiatrist's chair," [...] Grace stated, [...] "I did not put myself through law school and fight for all those years for victims of crime to waste one minute of my time, my energy, and my education in a war of words with Keith Olbermann, whom I've never met nor had any disagreement. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> have X amount of time on Earth, and that when we give in to our detractors or spend needless time on silly fights, I think that's abusing the chance {{we have to do something}} good." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Crosby {{recorded}} {{bundles of}} tracks that were titled Turquoise 3.x and Crimson 3.x; {{they were released}} through an online electronic delivery outlet. Crosby solidified his band's line-up during this time, and from then on, VAST became a four-person band. With the unusual method of distribution of these tracks by a band with a relatively large fanbase formerly signed to a major label, many record companies were outraged with the releases. As a result from pressure from his former label, Elektra, Crosby was forced to sign a short-term deal with Carson Daly-owned independent label 456 Entertainment to release {{the best of both}} bundles as one album, titled Nude. This release also had the most high-quality versions of the songs, as the online releases were only available via mp3. In later years, Crosby said the idea of releasing Nude on an indie label was a [...] "nightmare" [...] because [...] "There were so many problems dealing with them (456 Entertainment) on every level. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> made a big mistake not believing in ourselves enough and doing it on our own." ...|$|E

5000|$|He said {{in victory}} lane that he {{certainly}} {{thought he had}} a chance of winning on Sunday and that if he [...] "didn't feel that way...I'd stay home. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>we</b> have a shot on Sunday. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>we</b> had a shot before we got down here. Tonight's result hasn't changed my opinion on that. I'm looking forward to it, obviously. You love to get that qualifying spot on Sunday, but we really earned it tonight, to start on the front row, which is even better. It was definitely a great way to start the season." ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{continued}} to look at him, and with an irritation, which he saw grow in her, from the truth itself. [...] "So I did say.

2500|$|Anderson played guitar for the {{experimental}} rock project Amps for Christ until the early 2000s. In 2006, she shaped the noise-folk band Gowns with The Mae Shi member and then-boyfriend Ezra Buchla. On February 5, 2010, Anderson announced the official disbandment of Gowns, which coincided with the ending of her personal relationship with Buchla. In the announcement, Anderson wrote [...] "We were tapping into some very raw emotions, and I'm ultimately proud of the risks we took. In spite of anything else, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>we</b> were honest, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>we</b> were brave." [...] She further commented that the band members [...] "haven't ruled {{out the possibility of}} future collaborations." ...|$|R
