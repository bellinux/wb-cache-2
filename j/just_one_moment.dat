60|$|There was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> of {{dead silence}} before Laura {{addressed}} him.|$|E
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN [imploringly] No: stop: let me explain: {{hold the}} line <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment.</b> Oh, please.|$|E
60|$|For <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> {{the young}} hunters were badly frightened and {{inclined}} to run. Then they gazed {{at each other}} questioningly and stood their ground.|$|E
60|$|He stared {{again into}} the fire. Its red light picked out a {{stubborn}} strength in his face for <b>just</b> <b>one</b> flickering <b>moment,</b> and then it vanished again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Henry, you're an idiot!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "It was my fault, Everard. I'm so sorry. <b>Just</b> for <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> I had forgotten. I {{ought to}} have stopped Henry at once. The poor man has no memory." ...|$|R
60|$|Her weight seemed nothing. When I get a {{girl like}} that in my arms I simply don't feel it. <b>Just</b> for <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> as I clasped her thus in my arms, a fierce thrill ran through me. But I let it run.|$|R
60|$|Deep {{disappointment}} clouded {{her face}} for <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> and no more--it passed, {{and with it}} the homesick girl, and she was Joan of Arc, Commander-in-Chief again, and ready for duty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Twenty-five {{minutes to}} three! Nearly two hours, and I didn't {{believe it was}} two minutes! Is it {{possible}} that this clock is humbugging again? Miss Ethelton! <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment,</b> please. Are you there yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So am I," [...] was {{the cheerful}} answer. [...] "Hullo, Lutchester, how are you? <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment.</b> I must get a wash, I motored {{straight}} through, and I'm choked with dust. Where do I go?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ira Glass, host of This American Life, {{said it was}} [...] "the {{most amazing}} {{reporting}} on a high school that I had ever seen. It's called 'Seventeen' and it was directed by a couple, a woman named Joel DeMott and a man named Jeff Kreines. It was made in 1983, filmed at Southside High School in Muncie, Indiana. It's just this incredible document. It's so real and <b>just</b> <b>one</b> amazing <b>moment</b> after another." ...|$|R
60|$|And he, {{still under}} the spell of those magic moments when he had knelt at her feet, {{understood}} her prayer, and closing his eyes <b>just</b> for <b>one</b> brief <b>moment</b> in order to shut out for ever that radiant vision of a pure angel whom he had worshipped, turned quietly to Anne Mie.|$|R
50|$|For English Dominican mystics, {{the mystical}} {{experience}} was not expressed <b>just</b> in <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> {{of the full}} knowledge of God, but in the journey of, or process of, faith. This then led to an understanding that was directed toward an experiential knowledge of divinity. It is important to understand, however, that for these mystics {{it was possible to}} pursue mystical life without the visions and voices that are usually associated with such a relationship with God. They experienced a mystical process that allowed them, in the end, to experience what they had already gained knowledge of through their faith only.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{beginning}} to depress me," [...] he announced. [...] "I {{think that you can}} go away. No, stop for <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment.</b> Stand there in the light. Dear me, how unfortunate! Who would have thought that so beautiful a mother could have so plain a daughter!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Lorison, trembling, [...] "say {{what you}} please of me. Doubt {{it as you}} must, I will yet prove my {{gratitude}} to you, and my devotion to her. But let me speak to her once now, let me kneel for <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> at her feet, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> I wished I {{was back}} in the old Vallambrosa, {{starving}} and hoping. And then I got numb, and didn't care. And then I felt that somebody else was in the water close by me, holding me up. He had followed me, and jumped in to save me.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> for <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> as Wessex {{entered the}} room {{the events of the}} last {{fortnight}} suddenly vanished from his memory. She was there before him, in that same soft gown of white, as she had stood that day, with a sheaf of roses in her arms--or were they marguerites?--and once more, as he had done then, he vaguely wondered what colour were her eyes. On his lips he seemed to feel again the savour of her passionate kiss, and once again to smell the perfume of her golden hair as for that one brief, heavenly minute she had lain next to his heart.|$|R
60|$|The news flew everywhere, {{and shouts}} of welcome were raised, and in <b>just</b> <b>one</b> little <b>moment</b> those two despised and unknown plebeians were become famous and popular and envied, and {{everybody}} was in a fever to get sight of them {{and be able to}} say, all their lives long, that they had seen the father of Joan of Arc and the brother of her mother. How easy it was for her to do miracles like to this! She was like the sun; on whatsoever dim and humble object her rays fell, that thing was straightway drowned in glory.|$|R
50|$|Ignoring Zamara's shrill protests, Zarl takes Helena's {{outstretched hand}} and presses {{it to his}} lips. The {{intensity}} of emotion {{is too much for}} him; rapture gives way to agonising torment and he crumples to the floor. With a wail of defeat, Zamara and the other androids wind down, immobilised. Having watched from the shrubbery, the Numbers gather and peel off their masks, rejoicing in their new-found freedom. Zarl manages to briefly cling to existence; he declares he did feel love at the end. Comforted by a teary-eyed Helena, he tells her it is worth oblivion to have experienced <b>just</b> that <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> of humanity, then expires.|$|R
60|$|She {{opened the}} gate {{for him and}} stood aside. She was sorry for him, for her elder sister was a cripple. He bowed to her, {{as he would have}} done to any woman, and for <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> looked into her face. She looked back at him and {{something}} leapt within her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Captain Griffiths," [...] she began, [...] "do {{listen to}} me. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> of common sense, if you please. What {{do you suppose}} there could {{possibly}} be in our harmless seaside village to induce any one to risk his life by coming here {{on behalf of the}} Secret Service of Germany?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{all for the}} glad rags," [...] she insisted. [...] "I {{bought a}} heap of clothes in Bond Street this afternoon, and I don't know how many chances I shall have of wearing them. I am a quick dresser, and I shan't keep you {{more than a quarter}} of an hour. But <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{wishes of}} the King?" [...] she cried, with sudden vehemence. [...] "Surely, surely, my dear, dear father, you cannot mean what you suggest! Think! oh, think <b>just</b> for <b>one</b> <b>moment!</b> That poor young man, who was our guest, whom we all liked--he broke bread {{with us in our}} own house, our {{beautiful}} ch√¢teau de la Tour d'Aumont, which has never yet been defiled by treachery. And you talk of leaving him there in that far-off land which has proved so inhospitable to him? Of leaving him there either to perish miserably of want and starvation or to {{fall into the hands of}} that Hanoverian butcher whose name has become a by-word for unparalleled atrocities?" ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{pounds of}} nerve tissue {{underneath}} the skull {{are capable of}} perceiving, thinking and acting with a finesse that cannot be matched by any computer. The brain achieves this feat of cognition, in part, by carefully timing the signals that flash across the trillions of connections that link billions of brain cells. Seeing a flower pot causes groups of neurons to fire in a brief time interval to activate {{a part of the}} brain that registers that particular object at <b>just</b> that <b>one</b> <b>moment.</b> Understanding how this timing system works will both lead to better understanding of our behavior and enable the building of new computing and electronic equipment that, like the brain, functions more efficiently than conventional digital machines...|$|R
6000|$|Bertram {{rose and}} confronted him. His own face, too, flushed {{slightly}} with righteous indignation; but he answered {{for all that}} in the same calm and measured tones as ever: [...] "I am NOT a scoundrel, and I will not submit to be called so even by an angry savage. I ask you in return, how dare you follow us? You must have known your presence would be very unwelcome. I should have thought this was <b>just</b> the <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> {{in your life and}} the one place on earth where even YOU would have seen that to stop away was your imperative duty. Mere self-respect would dictate such conduct. This lady has given you clear proof indeed that your society and converse are highly distasteful to her." ...|$|R
60|$|There was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment,</b> {{the moment}} in which, on {{going down to the}} junior day room of his house to quell an unseemly disturbance, he was boisterously greeted by a {{vermilion}} bull terrier, when Mr. Downing was seized with a hideous fear lest he had lost his senses. Glaring down at the crimson animal that was pawing at his knees, he clutched at his reason for one second as a drowning man clutches at a life belt.|$|E
60|$|For <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> {{we have a}} seeming {{flash of}} {{comprehension}} of, the Kanaka's reason for exiling himself: he goes away to acquire civilization. Yes, he was naked and not ashamed, now he is clothed and knows how to be ashamed; he was unenlightened; now he has a Waterbury watch; he was unrefined, now he has jewelry, and something to make him smell good; he was a nobody, a provincial, now he has been to far countries and can show off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment,</b> Mr. Homos," [...] said Mrs. Makely. This perverse {{woman was}} as anxious {{to hear about}} Altruria as any of us, {{but she was a}} woman who would rather hear the sound of her own voice than any other, even if she were dying, as she would call it, to hear the other. The Altrurian stopped politely, and Mrs. Makely went on: [...] "I have been {{thinking}} of what Mr. Camp was saying about the blacklisted men, and their all turning into tramps--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I love thee," [...] she murmured, [...] "canst {{leave me}} now, dear lord.... If thou goest now 'tis for ever ... think, oh think! <b>just</b> for <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> ... the C√¶sar {{restored}} to power will part me from thee ... even if anon in his madness he doth not kill thee. If thou goest 'tis for ever.... Think on it ... think on it ere thou goest.... My love ... my love, go not from me, {{and leave me}} desolate.... Dear lord, but think on it--of the kisses thou wilt taste from my lips--the ecstasies thou wilt find in my arms!... Thine am I--thine my heart that loves thee--my body that worships thee--my every thought is thine.... Go not from me ... not just now till thou hast felt once more the full savour of my love." ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter was {{not quite}} like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremor ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are {{hundreds}} of them, and Peter felt <b>just</b> the <b>one.</b> Next <b>moment</b> he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was saying, 'To die will be an awfully big adventure.' ...|$|R
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy ‚Äî there‚Äôs some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it‚Äôs <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of those <b>moments</b> that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|R
60|$|He {{had another}} burst--a burst of unholy rapture this time. He drew her nearer and nearer to him till her face touched his; and then--No! I really cannot prevail upon myself {{to carry this}} {{shocking}} disclosure any farther. Let me only say, that I tried to close my eyes before it happened, and that I was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> too late. I had calculated, you see, on her resisting. She submitted. To every right-feeling person of my own sex, volumes could say no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{get out of}} {{that all}} right," [...] he {{asserted}} confidently. [...] "The only trouble is that while I am dodging about like this I cannot devote myself properly to the task of running down this fiend of the Hands. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment,</b> Professor, while I send off a message," [...] he continued, opening the little instrument. [...] "Where are you, Lenora?" [...] he signalled. [...] "Send me word and I will fetch you. I am in my own house for the present. Let me know that you are safe." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{rumbling}} of a drum broke {{upon the}} stillness, and for <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> {{she thought of}} the glorious deliverance promised by her Voices--I read it in the rapture that lit her face; then she saw what it was--her prison escort--and that light faded, never to revive again. And now her head began a piteous rocking motion, swaying slowly, this way and that, as is the way when one is suffering unwordable pain, or when one's heart is broken; then drearily she went from us, with her face in her hands, and sobbing bitterly.|$|E
5|$|Marge and Lisa {{discover}} Bart's {{deception and}} inform the passengers {{that the virus}} is a hoax. As punishment, the furious passengers maroon the Simpsons in Antarctica and head home. While hiking toward a research station for help, they notice a group of penguins; Lisa is fascinated by {{the chance to see}} them up close, but Bart thinks that their lives are boring and says that the ice slide they are riding down is <b>just</b> <b>one</b> isolated <b>moment</b> of fun. Lisa tells him that capturing and enjoying the best moments in life can make it fun, and Bart realizes she is right after Homer pushes him down the ice slide, with the whole family joining in. The final scene is a flash-forward to an elderly Bart in a retirement home, commenting on how much fun his life has been.|$|R
5000|$|The Times Of India gave a {{three stars}} out of five. Rediff cited [...] "Some films attempt to {{showcase}} {{a series of}} wonderful moments and tend to go overboard. Raincoat captures <b>just</b> <b>one</b> poignant <b>moment</b> and tells it as simply it can, leaving you with a wow. For someone heralded as {{the most beautiful woman}} in the world, Aishwarya Rai looks terrifyingly depressing in the film. Her Neeru looks cynical to the point of suicide. And that's a compliment. Her body language is a strange mix of a passive housewife and a passionate girlfriend. Though the effort to sound rustic shows, the restraint in her dialogue delivery and performance is commendable. Hesitation, desperation, humiliation -- Ajay Devgan conveys them eloquently. He particularly stands out in the scenes where he cries in the bathroom, or begs Neeru not to marry someone else".|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't pluck--it was sheer obstinacy--I'm rather {{ashamed of}} it," [...] said Rilla, kicking joyously. [...] "I {{wanted to show}} mother. It's mean to want to show your own mother--most unfilial conduct! But I have shown her. And I've shown myself a few things! Oh, Miss Oliver, <b>just</b> for <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> I'm really feeling quite young again--young and {{frivolous}} and silly. Did I ever say November was an ugly month? Why it's the most beautiful month in the whole year. Listen to the bells ringing in Rainbow Valley! I never heard them so clearly. They're ringing for peace--and new happiness--and all the dear, sweet, sane, homey {{things that we can}} have again now, Miss Oliver. Not that I am sane just now--I don't pretend to be. The whole world is having a little crazy spell today. Soon we'll sober down--and 'keep faith'--and begin to build up our new world. But just for today let's be mad and glad." ...|$|R
