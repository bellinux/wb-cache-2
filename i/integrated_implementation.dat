40|$|Abstract. There exist many {{available}} service ranking implementations, {{each one}} providing ad hoc preference models that offer {{different levels of}} expres-siveness. Consequently, applying a single implementation to a particular sce-nario constrains the user to define preferences based on the underlying for-malisms. Furthermore, preferences from different ranking implementation’s model cannot be combined in general, due to interoperability issues. In this article we present an <b>integrated</b> ranking <b>implementation</b> that enables the combination of three different ranking implementations developed within the EU FP 7 SOA 4 All project. Our solution has been developed using PURI, a Preference-based Universal Ranking Integration framework {{that is based on}} a common, holistic preference model that allows to exploit synergies from the <b>integrated</b> ranking <b>implementations,</b> offering a single user interface to define preferences that acts as a façade to the <b>integrated</b> ranking <b>implementation...</b>|$|R

However, there are also risk associated with <b>implementation</b> of <b>integrated</b> HIS but the actual <b>implementation</b> of <b>integrated</b> health information systems (HIS) is a challenging issue. Implementing integrated HIS are increasingly seen as the way to achieve quality and continuity in treatment, reducing clinical errors, and supporting health care professional in providing care. With the hurried growth in popularity of integrated HIS package, {{an increasing number of}} health care sectors are making the decision to implement an integrated HIS. The critical success factors for <b>integrated</b> HIS <b>implementation</b> include top management support, a clear business vision and issues specific to HIS such as implementation strategy and software configuration. However, some of the more important factors are the issues related to re-engineering business processes and the integration of various core processes to the HIS.

5000|$|IIAA's {{operational}} approach set {{the pattern}} for subsequent USG technical assistance in developing countries, including ultimately USAID. [...] In each country, a program comprising a group of projects in a given sector -- health, food supply, or schools -- was planned and implemented jointly by U.S. and local staff working in an office located in the developing country itself. In IIAA's case the offices were called, not [...] "missions" [...] as today, but [...] "servicios." [...] After {{the end of the}} war in 1945, IIAA was transferred to the State Department. On the basis of positive evaluations from the U.S. Ambassadors in Latin America, the State Department succeeded in getting Congressional authorization to extend it, initially through 1950 and then through 1955. Some existing technical-assistance agencies continued work in parallel with IIAA. In particular, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations (OFAR) continued to operate separately until 1954. In January 1949, President Truman, responding to advice from staff who had worked with IIAA, proposed a globalized version of the program as the fourth element of his overall foreign policy—"Point Four." [...] The purpose of the program was to provide technical knowledge to aid the growth of underdeveloped countries around the world. After a lengthy debate, Congress approved Point Four in 1950 and the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) was established within the Department of State in October 1950 to administer it. After an initial attempt to operate in the mode of the old Interdepartmental Committee and to merely coordinate programs of other agencies (such as IIAA), TCA adopted an <b>integrated</b> <b>implementation</b> mechanism in November 1951.|$|E

40|$|There {{is little}} {{understanding}} of how long-term care settings implement and adopt technology. The study purpose was to set forth a model that <b>integrates</b> <b>implementation</b> science and technology adoption frameworks and to explore the process of EHR technology implementation leading to adoption. Research questions investigated key stakeholders’ experiences with the implementation, if adoption occurred, and what themes mapped to the new model. There were three components of the dissertation. Based on a critical analysis of the literature, a model was set forth that <b>integrates</b> <b>implementation</b> science and technology adoption frameworks. Next, the experiences of 30 key stakeholders in three nursing homes were explored to understand implementation strategies. The third was one in-depth case study to explore EHR implementation and adoption. The first study was an exploratory qualitative study using grounded theory methods with focus groups (nurses and certified nurse aides) and individual interviews (Directors of Nursing) conducted at three Midwestern nursing homes with various numbers of beds (99 - 200), locations, and stages of implementation. A stratified random sample was used for focus groups (nurses and certified nurse aides). Data analysis included constant comparison of data. The second study an in-depth case study at a 124 bed, inner-city nursing home. Data sources were interviews of nurses and nurse aides (15), observation sessions of key care events (15), and leadership meetings. Data analysis included using constant comparison of themes and descriptive statistics (activity frequencies and percentages). Integration of data occurred to illustrate the dynamics of implementing and adopting the EHR. Five major themes emerged which included: motivation and EHR adoption, factors that influence the implementation, audit and bi-directional feedback, benefits, and opportunities to improve the EHR. The studies supported the new model with the workflow concept broadened to work processes. The importance of this dissertation is that it added to the knowledge of individual’s and system’s perspectives about implementation and adoption of an EHR in LTC facilities. The study supported the new <b>Integrated</b> Technology <b>Implementation</b> model concepts. Future research that is designed prospectively using this new model is needed.
