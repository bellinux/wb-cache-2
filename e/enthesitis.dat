5000|$|In 1984, a {{joint effort}} led to the {{definition}} of specific classification criteria for ankylosing spondylitis, called the “Modified New York Criteria”. One of the central New York criteria was the existence of radiographically visible changes in the sacroiliac joints and/or spine, which have formed due to bone fusion, erosion and/or formation caused by the disease. Even though these criteria helped to improve uniformly define ankylosing spondylitis, such radiologic changes often only manifested several years after the first disease symptoms appeared. In {{order to be able to}} study also patients with early and less typical forms, new criteria were needed that could identify the disease already at an early stage. In 2009 the Modified New York criteria were extended by a broad set of new classification criteria that aimed to classify patients based on the presence of typical spondyloarthritis disease features. These included inflammatory back pain, family history for axial spondyloarthritis, response to treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), past history of or current inflammation in the joints (arthritis), tendon-bone attachment of the heel (<b>enthesitis),</b> or eyes (uveitis), bowel (inflammatory bowel disease), skin (psoriasis) or signs of elevated inflammation (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. [...] Important parts of the ASAS axSpA criteria is the biomarker HLA-B27 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The criteria can only be applied in people that have chronic back pain (at least 3 months duration) started before the age of 45 years and only in those patients that already have a diagnosis of axial SpA. Since the disease ankylosing spondylitis was still defined by the Modified New York criteria of 1984, there was the need to find a new disease term that would also include the less severe forms or early onset of ankylosing spondylitis. This expression was found in the umbrella term axial spondyloarthritis. The 2009 classification criteria are called the ASAS (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society) axial spondayloarthritis criteria.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} the prevalence and diagnostic value of pelvic <b>enthesitis</b> on MRI of the sacroiliac (SI) joints in <b>enthesitis</b> related arthritis (ERA). Methods: We retrospectively studied 143 patients aged 6 - 18 years old who underwent MRI of the SI joints for clinically suspected sacroiliitis between 2006 - 2014. Patients {{were diagnosed with}} ERA according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria. All MRI studies were reassessed {{for the presence of}} pelvic <b>enthesitis,</b> which was correlated to the presence of sacroiliitis on MRI and to the final clinical diagnosis. The added value for detection of pelvic <b>enthesitis</b> and fulfilment of criteria for the diagnosis of ERA was studied. Results: Pelvic <b>enthesitis</b> was seen in 23 of 143 (16 %) patients. The most commonly affected sites were the entheses around the hip (35 % of affected entheses) and the retroarticular interosseous ligaments (32 % of affected entheses). MRI showed pelvic <b>enthesitis</b> in 21 % of patients with ERA and in 13 % of patients without ERA. Pelvic <b>enthesitis</b> was seen on MRI in 7 / 51 (14 %) patients with clinically evident <b>enthesitis,</b> and 16 / 92 (17 %) patients without clinically evident <b>enthesitis.</b> In 7 of 11 ERA-negative patients without clinical <b>enthesitis</b> but with pelvic <b>enthesitis</b> on MRI, the ILAR criteria could have been fulfilled, if pelvic <b>enthesitis</b> on MRI was included in the criteria.

Methods: We searched Pubmed with the search terms psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis in combination with <b>enthesitis,</b> enthesopathy, and treatment, or <b>enthesitis</b> in combination with imaging. Results: One hundred fifty-seven papers were selected. <b>Enthesitis</b> occurs frequently in PsA and may be asymptomatic or painful. It can also affect patient's function and quality of life. New imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, have revealed that <b>enthesitis</b> may be the initial osteoarticular inflammatory site in patients with PsA. <b>Enthesitis</b> indices have been developed and should be incorporated in clinical trials. Dactylitis, a characteristic and frequent manifestation of PsA can be tender or not tender and is prognostic of disease progression. Treatment of <b>enthesitis</b> includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, classical DMARDs, and adjunctive local steroid injections. In inadequate response, TNF alpha inhibitors are used.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: <b>Enthesitis</b> is a {{major feature}} of {{juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (JIA) but is difficult to diagnose clinically. Our objective was to compare the accuracy of ultrasonography with power Doppler (US-PD) versus clinical examination for diagnosing <b>enthesitis</b> in patients with JIA and healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients with JIA and 41 healthy volunteers underwent standardized clinical and US-PD examinations of 5 entheseal sites (proximal and distal quadricepital tendon insertions, Achilles tendon, and plantar fascia). US-PD reproducibility was evaluated. US-PD <b>enthesitis</b> {{was defined as a}} PD signal at the enthesis insertion. Bursitis, erosions, and cartilage vascularization were recorded. RESULTS: In the JIA group, 27 (12. 5 %) of the entheseal sites exhibited clinical <b>enthesitis</b> (distal patellar ligament in 45 % of cases) and 20 (9. 4 %) exhibited US-PD <b>enthesitis</b> (distal patellar tendon in 30 %), including 10 clinically normal sites (50 %). US-PD <b>enthesitis</b> was found in several patients with oligoarthritis or polyarthritis. Clinical <b>enthesitis</b> (P < 0. 0001) and HLA-B 27 -positive (P = 0. 05) status were significantly associated with US-PD <b>enthesitis.</b> Erosion and bursitis, but not tendon thickening, were associated with US-PD <b>enthesitis.</b> US-PD <b>enthesitis</b> was not found at any of the 410 entheseal sites in controls; grade 1 cartilage vascularization was noted at 6 % of the control sites. CONCLUSION: <b>Enthesitis</b> is a rare phenomenon in JIA. Clinically silent <b>enthesitis</b> is detected by US-PD and can be found in JIA categories other than enthesitis-related arthritis.

40|$|Introduction: An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} applied ultrasound to the evaluation of entheses in spondyloarthritis patients. However, no clear agreement exists on the definition of <b>enthesitis,</b> on the number and choice of entheses to examine and on ultrasound technique, which may all affect the results of the examination. The objectives of this study were to first determine the level of homogeneity in the ultrasound definitions for the principal lesions of <b>enthesitis</b> in the published literature and second, to evaluate the metric properties of ultrasound for detecting <b>enthesitis</b> according to the OMERACT filter. Methods: Search was performed in PUBMED and EMBASE. Both grey-scale and Doppler definitions of <b>enthesitis,</b> including describing features of <b>enthesitis,</b> were collected and metrological qualities of studies were assessed. Results: After selection, 48 articles were analyzed. The definition of ultrasound <b>enthesitis</b> and elementary features varied among authors. Grey-scale <b>enthesitis</b> was characterized by increasing thickness (94 % of studies), hypoechogenicity (83 %), enthesophytes (69 %), erosions (67 %), calcifications (52 %), associated bursitis (46 %) and cortical irregularities (29 %). Only 46 % of studies reported the use of Doppler. High discrepancies were observed on frequency, type of probe and Doppler mode used.

In contrast, MRI is sensitive for detecting early signs of <b>enthesitis</b> and can evaluate both soft‐tissue changes and intraosseous abnormalities of active <b>enthesitis.</b> It is therefore useful for the early diagnosis of enthesitis‐related arthropathies and monitoring therapy. Current knowledge and typical MRI features {{of the most commonly}} involved entheses of the appendicular skeleton in patients with SpA are reviewed. The MRI appearances of inflammatory and degenerative enthesopathy are described. New options for imaging <b>enthesitis,</b> including whole‐body MRI and high‐resolution microscopy MRI, are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: HLA-B 27 has a {{modifier}} {{effect on}} the phenotype of multiple diseases, both associated and non-associated with it. Among these effects, an increased frequency of clinical <b>enthesitis</b> in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) has been reported but never explored again. We aimed to replicate this study with a sensitive and quantitative assessment of <b>enthesitis</b> by using standardized ultrasonography (US). Methods: The Madrid Sonography <b>Enthesitis</b> Index (MASEI) {{was applied to the}} US assessment of 41 HLA-B 27 positive and 4...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Enthesitis</b> is a {{prominent}} feature of spondyloarthropathy (SpA) and persisting <b>enthesitis</b> {{may be a}} presenting symptom either alone or in combination with peripheral synovitis and/or inflammatory back pain. OBJECTIVE: To describe a series of SpA patients with persistent <b>enthesitis</b> as first manifestation. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. All SpA patients visiting the rheumatology and rehabilitation clinic, of Chittagong Medical College Hospital, between May 2007 and December 2008, were studied and those with chronic <b>enthesitis</b> as presenting symptom were included. Patients were classified with European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) classification criteria for SpA. Demographic data were collected and routine lab tests performed, including HLA-B- 27 testing. In all patients X-ray of spinal segments, sacroiliac joints and pelvis were performed. Collected {{data were analyzed using}} SPSS package program (version 12. 0) and multivariate analysis was done. RESULTS: A total of 71 SpA patients could be included with initial presentation with chronic <b>enthesitis.</b> Of these patients 20 gave a history of disease onset before their 16 th birthday and in 51 cases it was after their sixteenth. The mean age at presentation was respectively 12. 5 ± 2. 5 and 23. 3 ± 6. 4 years in juvenile and adult cases. <b>Enthesitis</b> was defined by history, clinical examination, and radio-imaging at accessible sites (X-ray pelvis/foot). <b>Enthesitis</b> presenting in the heel was the most common site (n= 51), but it was also seen in other locations in another 20 patients. The mean duration between presenting <b>enthesitis</b> and other features of SpA was 7. 7 ± 3. 2 and 8. 5 ± 2. 2 months in juvenile and adult cases respectively. All patients had raised ESR at disease onset and HLA-B 27 was found to be positive in 58 cases. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) was diagnosed in 49 cases and GradeI-II, Grade-III, and Grade-IV sacroiliitis was documented in 31, 5, and 13 patients respectively. CONCLUSION: Persistent <b>enthesitis</b> {{is one of the most}} common clinical presentation of SpA usually associated with high ESR, HLA-B 27 positivity. Definition and classification of <b>enthesitis</b> is important in early diagnosis of this rheumatologic condition...|$|E
