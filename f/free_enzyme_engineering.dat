In this study chitosan nanoparticles were synthesized using the Ionic Gelation method and were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Alkaline phosphatase was successfully immobilized on the chitosan nanoparticles in optimum conditions. Chitosan nanoparticles were used because of their special properties for enzyme immobilization. This study indicated that the immobilized enzyme has improved function at high temperature and during storage. Immobilization resulted in an increased range of optimum pH and temperature, and reusability of enzyme. Furthermore, the binding efficiency calculation indicated that the immobilized alkaline phosphatase conserved 71 % of its native activity. Kinetic parameter studies indicated {{no significant difference between}} the immobilized and <b>free</b> <b>enzymes...</b>|$|R

The definitive publisher-authenticated version J. Exp. Bot. (2014) 65 (8) pp. 1947 - 1954 is available online at: [URL] has been proposed that enzymes can associate into complexes (metabolons) that increase the efficiency of metabolic pathways by channelling substrates between enzymes. Metabolons may increase flux by increasing the local concentration of intermediates, decreasing the concentration of enzymes needed to maintain a given flux, directing the products of a pathway to a specific subcellular location or minimizing the escape of reactive intermediates. Metabolons can be formed by relatively loose non-covalent protein-protein interaction, anchorage to membranes, and (in bacteria) by encapsulation of enzymes in protein-coated microcompartments. Evidence that non-coated metabolons are effective at channelling substrates is scarce and difficult to obtain. In plants there is strong evidence that small proportions of glycolytic enzymes {{are associated with the}} outside of mitochondria and are effective in substrate channelling. More recently, synthetic metabolons, in which enzymes are scaffolded to synthetic proteins or nucleic acids, have been expressed in microorganisms and these provide evidence that scaffolded enzymes are more effective than <b>free</b> <b>enzymes</b> for metabolic <b>engineering.</b> This provides experimental evidence that metabolons may have a general advantage and opens the way to improving the outcome of metabolic engineering in plants by including synthetic metabolons in the toolbox...|$|R

The SAXS data indicate that binding of UDP-GlcNAc to <b>free</b> <b>enzyme</b> results in substantial conformational changes, which can be interpreted as the transition from an open to a closed form. Fosfomycin did not affect the structure of <b>free</b> <b>enzyme</b> or sugar-nucleotide-bound MurA. Phosphoenolpyruvate (pyruvate-P) appeared to induce a structural change upon addition to <b>free</b> <b>enzyme,</b> which differed from that observed upon binding of UDP-GlcNAc. Fluorescence experiments were performed using the hydrophobic fluorescence probe 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalene sulfonate (ANS). The fluorescence quenching of MurA/ANS solutions upon addition of UDP-GlcNAc or pyruvate-P was concentration dependent in a saturating manner, yielding apparent dissociation constants of Kd(UDP-GlcNAc)  =  59  μM and Kd(pyruvate-P)  =  240  μM.

40|$|Mesoporous {{materials}} have recently gained much attention owing to their large surface area, narrow pore size distribution, and superior pore structure. These {{materials have}} been demonstrated as excellent solid supports for immobilization {{of a variety of}} proteins and enzymes for their potential applications as biocatalysts in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. However, the lack of efficient and reproducible methods for immobilization has limited the activity and recyclability of these biocatalysts. Furthermore, the biocatalysts are usually not robust owing to their rapid denaturation in bulk solvents. To solve these problems, we designed a novel hybrid material system, mesoporous silica immobilized with NiO nanoparticles (SBA-NiO), wherein enzyme immobilization is directed to specific sites on the pore surface of the material.

In this study we used the designer cellulosome approach to examine the interplay of prominent cellulosomal and noncellulosomal cellulases from C. thermocellum. Toward this end, we converted the cellulosomal enzymes to noncellulosomal chimeras by swapping the dockerin module of the cellulosomal enzymes with a carbohydrate-binding module from the <b>free</b> <b>enzyme</b> analogues and vice versa. This enabled us to study the importance of the targeting effect of the <b>free</b> <b>enzymes</b> due to their carbohydrate-binding module and the proximity effect for cellulases on the designer cellulosome.

FT-IR and SEM were employed to study the membrane morphology and structure after treatment at 70 °C. The pH profile of the immobilized and the <b>free</b> <b>enzyme</b> was found to be similar. A 2. 4 -fold increase in Km value was observed after immobilization whereas Vmax value was lower for the immobilized GOD. Immobilized glucose oxidase showed improved operational stability by maintaining 33 % of the initial activity after 35 cycles of repeated use and was found to retain 94 % of activity after 1 month storage period. Improved resistance against urea denaturation was achieved and the immobilized glucose oxidase retained 50 % of the activity without urea in the presence of 5 M urea whereas <b>free</b> <b>enzyme</b> retained only 8 % activity...|$|R
40|$|Crude laccase from Lentinus polychrous Lev. was {{entrapped}} in alginate beads for {{application in}} decolorization of synthetic dyes. The percentages of alginate, types and concentrations of bivalent cations (Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Ca 2 +) influenced on immobilized enzyme activity {{as well as}} immobilized yield. The sensitivity of the immobilized Cu-alginate enzyme towards pH change was lowest {{when compared to the}} immobilized enzymes of other bivalent cations including <b>free</b> <b>enzyme.</b> By using ABTS substrate, the optimum temperature of the Ca-, Cu- and Zn-alginate enzymes were 60, 55 and 55 °C, respectively while the optimum temperature of the <b>free</b> <b>enzyme</b> was 50 °C. The Cu- and Zn-alginate enzymes were well stabilized for a week in all tested pH values except for pH 8. 0 (0. 1 M Tris-HCl). The Cu- and Zn-alginate enzymes revealed better temperature stability than the Ca-alginate and the <b>free</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Decolorizations of four structurally different synthetic dyes by the immobilized Cu-alginate enzymes in a continuous pack-bed approach were reported. The Cu-alginate enzymes were being able to repeated use effectively more than two times in dye removal experiments...|$|R
