40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explain the impact on stock prices for {{publicly}} traded firms from certifying to the ISO 14001 standard. Through the event study methodology, we study 28 firms listed in Norway or Sweden who certified to the standard within the period 1999 - 2014. We conduct both a univariate and cross-sectional analysis, and find {{that there are no}} overall effects on stock prices from certifying to the standard. Further, we investigate if the issuance of <b>green</b> <b>bonds</b> acts as a signal of environmental commitment from the firms to the investors. Again we apply the event study methodology for 16 European firms who issued <b>green</b> <b>bonds</b> in the period 2013 - 2015, and find that issuance of <b>green</b> <b>bonds</b> does not affect the stock prices. According to our results, we propose two different explanations: 1) Investors do not see the certification nor the issuance of <b>green</b> <b>bonds</b> as an initiative that creates or destroys value for the firm. 2) Investors are not united in their evaluation of the initiatives, which leads to no overall effect...|$|R

5000|$|Green {{bonds are}} liquid {{investment}} vehicles that raise capital for conservation efforts and environmentally stable practices in general. Investors commit their capital to these bonds {{and the money}} is then allocated towards green initiatives. Investors range from private corporations and firms to municipalities and even state governments. [...] Conservation efforts include preserving endangered watersheds and rainforests. Over time, the investors would hypothetically receive a profitable return from these initial investments.

50|$|The 13th Five-Year Plan was {{released}} on December 5, 2016, where it outlines growth plans for the 2016-2020 interim. The plan is based on three core ideas, being strengthening management solutions, {{improving the quality of}} the environment and accelerating the repair of environmental damage. The plan puts an emphasis on improving the quality of water resources, through unit based management, basin-wide initiatives to address water pollution, protection of water bodies with good quality, creating strategies to tackle ground water pollution, and improving water quality in both urban and rural areas. Water quality is expected to reach grade III or equivalent for 70% of the countries surface water by 2020, according to the plan. There is also a focus on soil pollution, where {{there is going to be}} more implementation of comprehensive monitoring. The goal is to be able to use 90% of polluted soil, which is an increase from 70.6% in 2015. A new environmental protection tax and compensation framework is outlined in the plan, where it is aimed at promoting the <b>green</b> <b>bond</b> market in the country. Other key goals of the 13th Five-Year Plan include promoting circular production to establish a circular economy at all levels in society, creating a circular development system with new resource strategies, reducing waste and consumption, increasing resource efficiency, and supporting green initiatives. The plan also expects resources productivity to increase by 15% from 2015 levels, while the utilization rate of solid waste should reach 73%. Over 75% of national industrial parks and more than 50 provincial industrial parks should be practicing complete circular strategies by 2020.

40|$|Climate {{change will}} have a {{significant}} impact on modern society. The economic impacts from climate change require the involvement of both governments and companies. Green bonds have emerged as tool to earmark capital for green investments, but the question remains whether green bonds accelerate green investments. This study outlines the advantages and disadvantages of <b>green</b> <b>bond</b> issuances in order to identify why green bonds could result in accelerated green investments. The data is acquired through interviews with investors and issuers, a survey among European issuers as well as a case study at AkzoNobel. The study also asks the question how green bonds could reduce the environmental impacts from the chemical industry. The results indicate that there are significant benefits in terms of company reputation, access to capital and internal legitimacy linked to the issuance of a <b>green</b> <b>bond.</b> The case study also indicates that a <b>green</b> <b>bond</b> issuance can have implications on the internal hierarchy of decision making by the addition of an environmental dimension to evaluation of investments. A <b>green</b> <b>bond</b> may bridge the historic gap between financial and sustainability departments. The conclusion is that green bonds accelerate green investments, as green bonds provide issuers with access to capital, increased company reputation, increased internal legitimacy for sustainability issues and shift decision power within companies. The efficiency of green bonds could be enhanced by the development of industry specific criteria, to have an impact along the entire value-chain to ensure significant environmental benefits...|$|E
