5|$|There were {{continuing}} {{disputes with}} the Americans over deep-sea fishing rights, and in early 1871, an Anglo-American commission {{was appointed to}} settle outstanding matters between the British (and Canadians) and the Americans. Canada was hoping to secure compensation for damage done by Fenians raiding Canada from bases in the United States. Macdonald was appointed a British commissioner, a post {{he was reluctant to}} accept as he realised Canadian interests might be sacrificed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> country. This proved to be the case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada to open her waters to American fishermen. Macdonald returned home to defend the Treaty of Washington against a political firestorm.|$|E

Methods: This study was based on a qualitative content analysis. 12 mothers in Amir Kabir hospital of Arak city participated in the study and shared their experiences through semi-structured interviews.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{impact of}} {{attention}} deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) in the Netherlands {{on health care}} utilisation, costs {{and quality of life}} of these children, as well as of their parents is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the direct medical costs of patients suffering from ADHD and their quality of life as well as the direct medical costs of their mothers. STUDY DESIGN: We selected a group of 70 children who were being treated by a paediatrician for ADHD based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD. For comparison's sake, we also included a non-matched group of 35 children with behaviour problems and 60 children with no behaviour problem from a large school population-based study on the detection of ADHD. We collected information on the health care utilisation of the children applying the Trimbos and iMTA questionnaire on Costs associated with Psychiatric illness' (TiC-P). Their health related quality of life was collected by using the Dutch 50 -item parent version of the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ PF- 50). Measurements were at baseline and at 6 months. Subsequently, we collected data on the health utilisation of <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> and their production losses due to absence from work and reduced efficiency. RESULTS: The mean direct medical costs per ADHD patient per year were euro 2040 or euro 1173 when leaving out one patient with a long-term hospital admission, compared to euro 288 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group of children with behaviour problems and euro 177 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group of children with no behaviour problems. The direct medical costs for children who had psychiatric co-morbidities were significantly higher compared to children with ADHD alone. The mean medical costs per year <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of <b>the</b> ADHD patients were significantly higher than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of <b>the</b> children with behaviour problems and <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of children with no behaviour problems respectively euro 728, euro 202 and euro 154. The physical summary score showed no significant differences between the groups. However, the score on the Psychosocial Summary Score dimension was significantly lower for ADHD patients compared to the scores of the children in the two other samples. The mean annual indirect costs due to absence from work and reduced efficiency at work were euro 2243 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of <b>the</b> ADHD patients compared to euro 408 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of children with behaviour problems and euro 674 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of children with no behaviour problems. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the direct medical costs of ADHD patients were relatively high. Additionally, our study indicated that ADHD appears to be accompanied by higher (mental) health care costs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of ADHD patients and by increased indirect costs for this group...|$|R
40|$|Within Gothic Literature the {{identity}} of <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> causes women to lose their own identity. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> in Beloved, “Everything That Rises Must Converge”, and “Greenleaf” their identity of themselves is lost as they identity as being <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> of their children rather than their own individual person. Some gothic mothers are absent mothers without an identity so that the narrative and protagonist is free of an overprotective figure that will prevent chaos from occurring to <b>the</b> protagonist. <b>The</b> <b>mothers</b> in “The River” and “A Temple of the Holy Ghost” are absent mothers as their lack of presence in <b>the</b> text allows <b>for</b> chaos to take the narrative and the protagonist to a revelation. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> in “Clytie”, “The Ballad of the Sad Café”, and “A Rose <b>for</b> Emily” <b>the</b> absent <b>mother</b> is without an identity because <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> needs to remain absent in order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> narrative to take place. <b>The</b> <b>mothers</b> within these texts are all without an identity {{so that they can}} remain <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> who is either overprotective and needs to be killed off in order for a child’s revelation to take place or is already dead so that the revelation can come forth.
