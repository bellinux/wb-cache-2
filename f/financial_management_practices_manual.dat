40|$|This study {{examined}} how <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> {{decisions are made}} by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Buffalo City Metropolitan in Eastern Cape, South Africa. The study aimed at discovering SME awareness on <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> The <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> address issues on capital budgeting, working capital <b>management,</b> capital structure, <b>financial</b> reporting and analysis. The study, therefore, hypothesised that SMEs {{were not aware of}} the sound <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> It was also intended in this study {{to examine the relationship between}} employment of sound <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and firm <b>financial</b> performance. Subsequently, the study hypothesised that the employment of sound <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> by SMEs did not significantly affect their financial performance. The results obtained in this study revealed that SMEs were aware of the sound <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> that could be employed to yield high financial performance. However, the results also revealed that most SMEs were not employing qualified personnel and this in turn had an effect on the effectiveness of the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> that the SMEs utilised. The findings also indicated that the employment of sound <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> did significantly and positively affect the financial performance of SMEs. The study recommended that SMEs could increase their chances of financial survival if they employ sound <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> The study also gave recommendations to the South African Government to provide effective facilities and services to SMEs and help sustain them because they are important in the economy.

40|$|Although materialism has {{a robust}} {{relationship}} with compulsive buying, psychological theories {{also suggest that}} financial attitudes and <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> would significantly predict compulsive buying severity even after controlling for materialism. We also expected that financial attitudes and <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> would moderate the relationship between materialism and compulsive buying.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to analyze <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> in dairy production systems. More specifically, we sought to identify which milk producers adopt <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> We conducted 55 semi-structured questionnaires in the Western Region of Paraná. The data were processed through descriptive and multivariate statistical analysis. The analysis of hierarchical clusters defined, based on variables related to <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices,</b> two distinct groups. The first group included milk producers who do not adopt <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> (N = 49) and the second group described the milk producers who do adopt these practices (N = 6). We then used Common Factor Analysis, along with structural, technical, productive, and socioeconomic variables to define the three factors that best explained the variance between the clusters: factor 1 - structural; factor 2 - social; factor 3 - informational. Smaller dairy production systems, with lower production, managed by younger producers, and employing younger workers, are those adopting <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> Therefore, the scarcity of resources is not a limiting factor in the adoption of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that negative urgency impulsivity is associated with compulsive buying even after controlling for depression. The aim {{of the present study was}} to replicate this finding and to examine if <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> mediated this relationship. A community sample of 162 participants (34 male and 128 female), aged between 18 and 82 years, completed online self-report questionnaire measures. As expected, results revealed (1) significant positive associations between compulsive buying and both negative urgency impulsivity (NUI) and psychological distress; and (2) a significant negative association between compulsive buying and <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> We also found that after controlling for psychological distress (3) NUI was still significantly correlated with compulsive buying, and (4) <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> partially mediated the relationship between NUI and <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> Our findings are consistent with an extension of the theory that compulsive buying is motivated by relieving negative mood states, positing both negative affect-driven impulsivity and psychological distress as important factors in understanding compulsive buying. These findings also support current cognitive-behavioural interventions for the treatment of compulsive buying that target psychological distress, NUI, and <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R

40|$|After {{a decade}} of {{reforming}} policy, building and developing the multi-sector market economy, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam have developed strongly and contributed to creating employment, increasing GDP, and raising the nation’s volume of exports. However, SMEs have found difficulties {{on the way to}} development due to lack of <b>management</b> experience and <b>financial</b> resources, and due to uncertainty within the business environment. As a result, SMEs often faced obstacles during their operations. This thesis examines the relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> and profitability of SMEs to determine whether <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>financial</b> characteristics impact on SME profitability. Objectives of the thesis are (1) to investigate and describe features of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>financial</b> characteristics of SMEs in Vietnam, (2) to develop and test a model of SME profitability, and (3) to contribute knowledge of the relationships between <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> and characteristics to improve SME profitability by using tools of efficient <b>financial</b> <b>management.</b> In terms of structure, the thesis has six chapters. The thesis begins by defining the research problem and questions, and providing a justification for the research study. Chapter one also reviews the research background, and presents definitions of terms, significance and scope of the study. Chapter two examines the economic background, business structure and the development of SMEs in Vietnam. This chapter also reviews previous research related to <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> for SMEs in Vietnam to identify gaps between <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> for SMEs in Vietnam and <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> for SMEs worldwide. Chapter three reviews <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> including <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices,</b> <b>financial</b> characteristics and profitability of SMEs around the world, especially in the developed economies such as the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and Canada. This review emphasizes profitability and the impact of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>financial</b> characteristics on SME profitability. Objectives of this chapter are to review previous research related to the areas of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices,</b> <b>financial</b> characteristics, and profitability of SMEs and to build a model of the impact of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>financial</b> characteristics on SME profitability. Chapter four discusses aspects of the research methodology including research design, data collection and data analysis methods, and hypothesis testing to support the model. Objectives of this chapter are: (1) to justify the research methodology of this study, (2) to explain research methodology used in the study, and (3) to demonstrate how research design, and data collection and analysis can be utilized in this study to answer the research questions outlined in the chapter 1. Data analysis and findings are presented in chapter five. This chapter presents descriptive findings of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices,</b> <b>financial</b> characteristics and SME profitability and findings of the research study related to testing the model of SME profitability. Objectives of this chapter are (1) to systematically present the descriptive findings of the research study, (2) to interpret significance of these findings based on data analysis, (3) to present the results of testing the model of SME profitability, and (4) to explain how the model, developed from a literature review, was supported by data analysis. Finally, the thesis ends with chapter six where conclusions are summarized and applications of the research findings are indicated for the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> practitioners. The thesis provides descriptive findings of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>financial</b> characteristics and demonstrates the simultaneous impact of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>financial</b> characteristics on SME profitability. In addition, the research study provides a model of SME profitability, in which profitability was found to be related to <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>financial</b> characteristics. With the exception of debt ratios, all other variables including current ratio, total asset turnover, working capital management and short-term planning <b>practices,</b> fixed asset <b>management</b> and long-term planning practices, and financial and accounting information systems were found to be significantly related to SME profitability. With the findings as presented above, this research study provides many implications for <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and contributes to knowledge of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> of SMEs. The model of SME profitability can be used as guidance for actions to improve the profitability of SMEs in Vietnam...|$|R

Associations of time horizon with risk preference, and risk preference with <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices,</b> differences in <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> among the main ethnicities in Malaysia and among families residing in {{urban and rural areas}} were also determined. The moderating roles of self-worth between <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>financial</b> well-being of families, and between <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and risky investment by families were explored. Quota sampling was employed to gather data from 800 samples who were the family financial managers using questionnaire forms through their work-place. Pearson correlation test revealed that time horizon of financial managers, measured by future time orientation was significantly associated with their risk preferences. Furthermore, the results from correlation tests showed that families having financially risk averse family financial managers were {{more likely to engage in}} financial planning, cash-flow activities, good credit practice, savings, and risk management. However, families having financially risk tolerance family financial managers were more likely to participate in diversified investment. Test of significant difference result indicated that Chinese families were more involved in diversified investment as compared to the Malay or Indian families. Moreover, the t-test resulted in the Chinese families to be more likely purchasing various types of insurance policies as compared to the Indian families. As for the differences in residential areas, the urban residents were more involved in record-keeping, diversified investment, and tend to purchase various types of insurance as compared to the rural residents. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed factors predicting financial well-being and participation in risky assets. Income, working experience, budgeting, and investment were found to be predictors for good financial well-being. A family that was financially stable tends to earn high household income with longer working experience, participated in diversified investment, and did budgeting for the family expenses. The tendency to participate in risky investment was positively influenced by their risk tolerant, savings, record-keeping, and risk practices. However good credit practices was inversely predicting participation in risky assets. These findings provided evidence that specific <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> did have impact on financial well-being and participation in risky assets. The socioeconomic characteristics identified for financially stable family and the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> carried out by them would assist interested parties to help families who are at most risk of financial instability. Self-worth of family financial manager was found to moderate the relationships of financial planning and cash-flow with financial well-being of families. It also acts as a moderator for the relationship between risk practices and risky assets investing. The support found for the moderating roles of self-worth contributed to the family <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> and investment decision fields.

Research has shown that the lack of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> skills and application of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> are some of the biggest factors contributing to SME failure. However, it is not clear from the literature which of these skills and practices are more important than others.

A survey was done on a sample of owner-managers of successful SMEs who had been asked, firstly, whether they performed different <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and, secondly, how frequently they performed these in their companies.

Similarly, financial practices related to cash flow and decision making are more relevant than those related to planning or analysing. It may be true, due to the high risk and volatile environment of SMEs, as well as the challenges that are often underestimated, that financial practices which academics regard as important are not always implemented by these companies.

40|$|Abstract : Due {{to their}} {{significant}} role in creation of new jobs, rise in GDP, entrepreneurship and innovation, {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) are recognized as the the drivers of socio-economic growth, both in developed and developing economies. In Turkey, 99. 9 % of all enterprises fall into SME category. Therefore, the significance of SMEs for Turkish economy and society is much higher in Turkey, compared to other emerging and developed countries. Small and medium-sized companies are faced with a number of challenges whereas the problems arising from “poor financial management” are reported as the major causes of business failures in SMEs. Strategic <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> (SFM) which is a research area that has attracted the interest of researchers after 2010, {{is one of the key}} managerial areas of SMEs, due to its vital role on the survival, growth and performance of SMEs. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the central role of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> and identify the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> challenges and <b>practices</b> that influence the organizational performance in Turkish SMEs, from a strategic management perspective. Within the course of this paper, the importance and challenges of SMEs in Turkey are presented in the first section, while the literature on strategic and <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> in SMEs are reviewed in the second part. In the third section, the recent strategic <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> concept, the implications of strategic <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> for SMEs in Turkey and the relationships between strategic <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and SME performance, are discussed. Small and medium sized enterprise finance in Turkey is a developing research area, therefore this paper aims to make a significant contribution to the existing literature by analyzing the major challenges at the conduct of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> in Turkish SMEs and the influence of strategic <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> on the performances of small and medium sized companies in Turkey. Additionally, the conceptual framework developed is expected to be useful to academics in developing an agenda for future empirical research. </span...|$|R
40|$|Governments in {{different}} parts of the world are increasingly promoting and supporting the growth of Micro and Small enterprises as part of their overall national development strategy. The sector plays an important role in economic development and act as vehicle for low-income people to escape poverty through market-driven, productive activities for growth of the economy. Consequently because of their role and significance to the economic development they have become a major research area in developing countries. Studies have been conducted highlighting the constraints which affect the growth of micro-enterprises with a view to bring to the solutions but with no in-depth. Most the enterprises growth still stagnate and eventually fail. Their failure rates are always attributed to lack of management skills by most owner managers. As a result, there is need to carry out studies on the <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> of micro enterprises in regard to financial practices. The objective of this study was to appraise the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> on growth of Jua Kali enterprises in Kenya. The study adopted the descriptive research design to assess the growth in regards to financial practices. The target population was 150 owner managers of micro enterprises registered under Jua Kali enterprises. Considering the population was not a homogeneous, stratified random sampling technique was used as the most appropriate to determine the study sample of 50 respondents.

In {{spite of their}} generally-acknowledged {{significant contribution to the}} society, researches on the management of their finance are not much. This research therefore advances the frontiers of knowledge by comparatively analysing the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> of two non-profit organisations; a faith-based and a community-interest organisation. The research adopted a field-based approach by evaluating the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> of study organisations using methods such as interviews, study of documents, artefacts and published annual reports. The research found out that though the two organisations are fully aware of the risks involved in the management of finance, different strategies are adopted to mitigate the risks. Though not established for commercial purposes, Non-Profit organisations are encouraged to embark on cost control and reduction to justify their funding by financier...|$|R

In Ethiopian economy, this sector contributes to the national objective of creating employment opportunities, generating income, and providing a source of livelihood for low income households. However, the small firms {{have not been able to}} contribute considerably as needed to the economic development mainly because of inadequate <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> Given that, the issues of <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> are one of the key aspects of the well being and survival of a business. The study aims to explore the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> of small business enterprises in Sokoru District to those variables namely, working capital <b>management,</b> financing, investment, <b>financial</b> reporting, financial planning, analysis, and control, and accounting information systems. For the purpose of this study the sample of 70 small firms were taken from the total population of 115. To achieve the stated objectives of the study the primary data were obtained from owners' of small firms and trade and industry office of Sokoru District. Both stratified and simple random sampling methods were used to select sample used for the study.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} {{research on the}} factors that lead to small business success, growth, and failure. These factors can generally be described as relating to the ability and competence of the business owner/ manager, the opportunity presented, and {{the willingness of the}} owner to pursue the opportunity. Differences are likely to arise in these factors in different regional areas. This study examines the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and perceptions of tradespeople in the building industry in Queensland and compares findings from a relatively regional centre with businesses from Brisbane, the State capital of Queensland. This comparison seeks to determine if there are differences in attitudes and <b>practices</b> in the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> of firms and individuals in these two areas. This study is based on data collected using a self-administered questionnaire completed by participants in a <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> training workshop before they had undertaken the training. This paper analyses responses to questions on <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> as well as firm and individual factors. Results of the analysis indicate that there are significant differences in both attitudes and practices of business owners and employees in the industry.

40|$|When rugby became {{professional}} in 1995, both {{the game and}} the social and financial position of the players changed (Basson, 2003). Players started to train full-time and earned annual salaries (Goldman& Johns, 2009). Due to the transition from amateur to professional status, rugby players needed to make adequate personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> decisions. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> attitudes and <b>practices</b> of South African rugby players. Previous research about personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> largely focussed on the general public, and did not focus on South African rugby players. Rugby is a professional sport where players earn money from a young age. It is expected of rugby players to make adequate personal financial decisions from as early as 19 years old. The literature review provided an overview of personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> and a discussion on the various components that should be included in personal <b>financial</b> <b>management.</b> A framework for this study was developed. The framework used these components as the base for the personal financial attitudes and practices and how it relates to the demographics of the respondents. Three hypotheses were also formulated based on the literature overview and framework. The objectives of this study were achieved by adopting a quantitative research methodology. A convenience sample of 132 rugby players was drawn for this study. Rugby players from NMMU Madibaz, Eastern Province Rugby Union (EP), South Western Districts Rugby Union (SWD) and Sharks Rugby Union participated in this study. The results of the empirical survey showed that respondents have positive attitudes towards the importance of budgeting, retirement planning, risk management, debt management and investment and the importance of employing a financial planner. On the other hand the personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> of the respondents in this study can be described as weak. From the results of the empirical survey it is clear that the respondents have weak practices towards the majority of the personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> Only one of the three hypotheses was accepted namely that there is a relationship between the demographics of rugby players and their personal financial practices. There is no relationship between personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> attitudes and personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> of South African rugby players and that there is also no relationship between demographic variables and personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> attitudes of South African rugby players. This study has provided insight into the personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> attitudes and <b>practices</b> of South African rugby players. Valuable information was obtained that could help to address the personal <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> needs of rugby players...|$|R

Higher income and positive attitudes about finances, but not the amount of financial knowledge, predicted use of recommended <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> <b>Financial</b> knowledge did not moderate the relationship between attitudes and practices, i. e., the relationship was not stronger when financial knowledge was high.
