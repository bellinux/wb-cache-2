However, the atomic structure of the inner rod protein is currently unknown. Based on computational methods, others have suggested that the Salmonella inner rod protein PrgJ is highly <b>helical,</b> <b>forming</b> a folded 3 helix structure. Here we show by CD and NMR spectroscopy that the monomeric form of PrgJ lacks a tertiary structure, and the only well-structured part of PrgJ is a short α-helix at the C-terminal region from residues 65 - 82. Disruption of this helix by glycine or proline mutation resulted in defective assembly of the needle complex, rendering bacteria incapable of secreting effector proteins. Likewise, CD and NMR data for the Shigella inner rod protein MxiI indicate this protein lacks a tertiary structure as well. Our results reveal that the monomeric forms of the T 3 SS inner rod proteins are partially folded...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-light {{materials}} with open, periodic cell structures are studied by many scientists, {{because of their}} potential multi-functionality. Our research group invented the new cellular metal named WBK, fabricated with <b>helical</b> <b>forming</b> wires, and has investigated {{the performance of the}} WBK. It has been found that WBK fails by buckling of struts composing WBK. Therefore, for enhancing the resistance against buckling, this work suggests a new idea, that is WBK comprising metal hollow spheres (MHSs) in the inner space, which is named WBK-MHS hybrids. The reason of selecting MHS is that, it also had ultra light weight and high energy absorption. The compressive properties of WBK-MHS hybrid have been investigated and compared to other competitive structures. From the result, the maximum stress and energy absorption are much enhanced in comparison with simple addition of those of the corresponding stand-alone WBK and MHS. The result is attributed to suppression of buckling of struts composing WBK and uniforms deformation over the entire components. The WBK-MHS hybrids out performs competitors in the mechanical performance. Its means Hybrid WBK can widely apply to industry just like car impact bar, bumper and so on...|$|E
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} strain capacity of spiral welded pipelines displays to some extents unexplained behaviour. Therefore, {{they are not}} (yet) used extensively in offshore applications and harsh conditions, demanding a strain based design. An important factor that influences the tensile strain capacity is the quantity of anisotropy {{in terms of strength}} and toughness. Starting from an anisotropic hot rolled highstrength steel skelp, the process of <b>helical</b> <b>forming</b> and post-treating of the pipe adds heterogeneity and changes the level of anisotropy of the product. A parameter that should be examined with respect to anisotropy is the crack driving force, a measure for the toughness of the pipeline steel. Additional to the mode I loading (opening of the crack), the mode III component drives the in-plane shear motion of a crack in the spiral weld when the pipe is subjected to longitudinal deformation. This action, not present in longitudinal welded pipes, shows a decreasing contribution with increasing plasticity. FE simulations have demonstrated a rise of crack driving force in anisotropic cases with respect to an isotropic reference. However, exact data and variation of various parameters, along with experimental testing need to be conducted. The outcome analysis of such simulations and tests can validate existing models, or help create a better understanding of anisotropic and heterogenic influences on the tensile strain capacity of spiral welded pipes...|$|E

40|$|We {{prepared}} several well-characterized syndiotactic polypropylene (sPP) polymorphs so as {{to correlate}} their thermal and dynamic-mechanical behaviors. A sample was crystallized in pure form I at 100 °C; a second sample containing only the trans-planar mesophase was prepared by directly drawing a quenched sample at 0 °C; a third sample, drawn at room temperature, contained both the trans-planar mesophase and {{a fraction of the}} <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> II. By annealing this sample at increasing temperatures, we obtained a series of samples containing either trans-planar mesophase, or form II and form I crystallinities. In the dynamic-mechanical analysis, the sample containing form I crystallinity showed only the amorphous glass transition, at 19 °C, before melting at a high temperature. The trans-planar mesophase transformed, at temperatures higher than 50 °C, into the <b>helical</b> <b>forms,</b> and this transition was completed at 80 °C. The dynamic mechanical curve of the sample containing only the mesophase showed a peak, centered at 50 °C, which could be clearly associated to this transition. The sample containing the trans-planar mesophase and the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> II, showed in the dynamic-mechanical curve a third peak that can be associated with the melting recrystallization of form II into the most stable form I. These results are important, because it was possible to directly correlate the structural transitions of the sPP polymorphs to the dynamic-mechanical behavior. Moreover, a dynamic-mechanical analysis could help recognize the presence of the tran-planar mesophase or of the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> II in more complex structural organizations...|$|R
40|$|Films of {{syndiotactic}} polypropylene (sPP) elongated at {{room temperature}} up to a draw ratio λ = 6 showed the trans-planar form III with some trans-planar mesophase. Upon releasing tension, we obtained fibers with a high content of trans-planar mesophase and {{a small fraction of}} <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> II crystals. Released fibers were annealed at increasing temperatures up to 130 °C, and the polymorphic behavior was investigated by X-ray and FTIR. Between 60 and 80 °C, an increase of the <b>helical</b> <b>forms</b> I and II, both of them highly oriented, occurs, while the trans-planar mesophase practically disappears. Successive annealing at higher temperature brings further increase of both helical modifications until, around 130 °C, significant percentages of form II melt and recrystallize in form I. The unrelaxed λ = 6 fiber was also annealed at 100 °C, developing significant form II fractions along with form III and some form I. Two more sets of fibers were obtained under conditions in which the trans-planar mesophase was not present. In both cases, upon annealing at constant strain, no formation of the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> II was observed and only a mixture of the trans-planar form III and the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> I developed. The described observations suggest that, in oriented sPP samples, upon relaxing or annealing at temperatures below 100 °C, the pseudohexagonal trans-planar mesophase plays a mayor role as precursor for crystallization of the chiral form II. This appears consistent with recently proposed analyses of chiral crystallization of helical polymers...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} {{polymorphic}} transitions occurring during the stretching of samples of syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP) in the trans-planar mesomorphic form is presented. Samples in the pure transplanar mesomorphic form or in mixture with crystals of the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> I have been stretched {{at room temperature}} and at 4 °C. Both the stretching temperature and the crystalline modification of the starting material strongly influence the polymorphism of oriented s-PP fibers. Stretching procedures at room temperature induce the crystallization of the trans-planar form III, regardless of the crystalline modification of the starting unoriented sample. Both the trans-planar mesomorphic <b>form</b> and the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> I transform at high deformation into the crystalline trans-planar form III. When the stretching is instead performed at 4 °C the structural transitions occurring upon stretching depend on the crystalline modification of the starting unoriented material. Indeed, if s-PP samples in the pure trans-planar mesomorphic form are stretched at 4 °C, only an orientation of the mesomorphic crystals occurs, and the transition into the crystalline form III is never observed, also for high deformation. When the s-PP samples are, instead, in mixtures of crystals of the mesomorphic and <b>helical</b> <b>forms,</b> stretching at 4 °C induces the transition of the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> into the trans-planar form III at low deformations. At high deformations the mesomorphic form also transforms into the crystalline form III. In all the experiments, {{the removal of the}} tension in fibers stretched at room temperature and at 4 °C produces structural changes, which depend on the crystalline form of the starting unoriented samples and on the crystalline modifications formed during the stretching. The trans-planar form III transforms, indeed, into the crystalline forms present in the unoriented samples or formed during the stretching (<b>helical</b> <b>form</b> and/or mesomorphic form). These results indicate that the structural evolution of the trans-planar form III upon removing the tension in stretched fibers strongly depends on the memory of the crystalline forms present in the starting unoriented material and on the memory of the crystalline forms produced during the stretching...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the elastic properties of syndiotactic polypropylene at different temperatures is reported. Fibers stretched at low temperatures are in the trans-planar form III, which transforms into the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> II upon {{the release of the}} tension, whereas fibers stretched at high temperatures are in the stable <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> I. The mechanical {{analysis of}} these fibers has shown that only at room temperatures the specimens show good elastic properties. The elastic recovery of the samples is in part lost also at room temperature in annealed fibers, which are in the stable form I, in both the stretched and unstrained states. When the structural transition from the trans-planar form III into the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> occurs upon removing the tension, a nearly total elastic recovery is observed. Only a partial elastic recovery is instead observed when this transition is absent. The relative amount of crystalline phase in unoriented films and in stretched and stress-relaxed fibers is rather constant (approximate to 40 - 43 %) and does not depend on the stretching temperature in the range 25 - 80 degreesC. These data indicate that the elastic behavior of syndiotactic polypropylene is in part linked to the enthalpy gain achieved when the tension is removed, due to the metastability, in the unstrained state, of the trans-planar form, which transforms into the stable <b>helical</b> <b>form.</b> On the other hand, also an entropic factor must play a role, due to the entangled amorphous chains which experience a reversible conformational transition between the disordered (coil) and extended conformations during the stretching and relaxing process...|$|R

A “mechanical” model, in which the flagellin building block has the capacity to switch between two principal interfacial states, predicts that the filament can assemble into a “canonical” family of 12 distinct <b>helical</b> <b>forms,</b> each having unique curvature and twist: these include two “extreme” straight forms having left- and right-handed twists, respectively, and 10 intermediate <b>helical</b> <b>forms.</b> Measured shapes of the filaments correspond well with predictions of the model.

Disordered modifications of the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> I of syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP) are obtained, and small degrees of crystallinity (16 - 20 %) are achieved. The stretching of compression-molded films of sam-PP samples produces oriented crystalline fibers in the trans-planar mesomorphic form of s-PP. The low stereoregularity ([rrrr]) 40 - 55 %) prevents the formation of the ordered trans-planar form III of s-PP, which instead is obtained in stretched fibers of the highly stereoregular and crystalline s-PP. The trans-planar mesomorphic form, in turn, transforms into the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> I upon release of the tension in stretched fibers of sam-PP samples. The isochiral <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> II of s-PP, which is generally obtained in s-PP fibers initially in the trans-planar form III by removing the tension, has never been observed in the sam-PP fiber samples.

Samples kept at 0 degreesC for short time rapidly crystallize into the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> I at room temperature, whereas longer permanence times at 0 degreesC increase the stability of the trans-planar mesomorphic phase which remains stable and inhibits the normal crystallization of the sample into the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> at room temperature. The stereoregularity of the polymer sample strongly influences the rate of formation of the mesomorphic form at 0 degreesC, Higher the syndiotacticity, easier the formation of trans-planar mesomorphic form. Very short permanence times (few hours) at 0 degreesC are enough to form and stabilize the mesomorphic form for highly syndiotactic samples, whereas for stereo-irregular samples the amount of mesomorphic form observed when the sample is removed from the 0 degreesC bath and heated to room temperature, remains always very low, even for very long permanence times (months) at 0 degreesC and the crystallization into the normal <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> is not inhibited.

The major PBPs had apparent molecular masses of 47, 60, 63, and 66 kDa; an additional minor PBP of 95 to 100 kDa was also detected. The relative affinities of various β-lactams for these PBPs were tested by competitive-binding assays. Only PBP 63 appeared to be significantly bound {{to each of the}} competing antibiotics, whereas PBP 66 strongly bound mezlocillin, oxacillin, amoxicillin, and ceftriaxone. Whereas most of the β-lactams significantly bound two or more PBPs, aztreonam specifically targeted PBP 63. The influence of sub-MICs of these β-lactams on the morphologies of log-phase H. pylori was observed at both the phase-contrast and transmission electron microscopy levels. Each of the eight β-lactams examined induced blebbing and sphere formation, whereas aztreonam was the only antibiotic studied which induced pronounced filamentation in H. pylori. Finally, studies comparing the PBPs of helical (log-phase) cultures with those of coccoid (7 -, 14 -, and 21 -day-old) cultures of H. pylori revealed that the major PBPs at 60 and 63 kDa seen in the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> were almost undetectable in the coccoid forms, whereas PBP 66 remained the major PBP in the coccoid forms, although somewhat reduced in level compared to the <b>helical</b> <b>form.</b> PBP 47 was present in both forms at approximately equal concentrations.

40|$|To {{examine the}} role of the peptide main-chain length on the {{conformation}} and membrane activity of the lipopeptaibol antibiotic trichogin GA IV we have synthesized by solution methods the Leu 11 -OMe analogue and all its short, N-octanoylated C-terminal sequences. By FTIR absorption, 1 H NMR and CD we have shown that largely folded, but not <b>helical,</b> <b>forms</b> characterize the short peptides, while the longest peptides predominantly adopt regular helical structures. Membrane activity is found in main-chain lengths as short as the tetrapeptide and progressively increases up to the undecapeptide...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of syndiotactic propylene-butene copolymers (sPPBu), prepared with a metallocene catalyst, {{have been studied}} in {{the whole range of}} comonomer composition. Meltcrystallized unoriented films and oriented fibers of sPPBu copolymers show good elastic properties even though the samples present non-negligible level of crystallinity at any comonomer composition. These materials behave as thermoplastic elastomers with remarkable rigidity and mechanical strength that can be tuned by changing the comonomer composition. In samples with low butene concentration the elastic properties are associated with the reversible transformation between the trans-planar form III of syndiotactic polypropylene, obtained by stretching, and the <b>helical</b> <b>form</b> II, formed by releasing the tension. The occurrence of reversible phase transitions assists the elasticity of these materials through a non-negligible free energy contribution that is added to the conventional entropic contribution...|$|R
