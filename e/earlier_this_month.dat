Since things came to an unexpected and screeching halt after the Massachusetts election, which cost the Democrats their super-majority in the Senate, the daily news on spiralling health costs has helped to drive the recognition that reform is imperative.

A recent survey by the Center for American Progress shows double-digit hikes in insurance premiums implemented or pending in at least ten other states.
