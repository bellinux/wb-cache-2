I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if I could make a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E
500|$|At 766 {{pages in}} the British edition and 870 in the American edition, Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the Harry Potter series. Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg {{described}} his task to cut down the novel as searching for [...] "the best equivalent way to tell the story. My job was to stay true {{to the spirit of}} the book, rather than to the letter". Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that [...] "she <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a great movie, and gave [...] permission to take whatever liberties [...] felt [...] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love". Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film, Goldenberg explained, became [...] "clearer when [...] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry's emotional journey". He and Yates [...] "looked for every opportunity to get everything [...] could in there. And where [...] couldn't, to sort of pay homage to it, to have it somewhere in the background or to feel like it could be taking place off-screen".|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero: On Tour {{received}} somewhat positive reviews. In general, critics {{felt the}} game captured {{the majority of}} the elements of the Guitar Hero series, and IGN commented that the note tracks were well done as to provide [...] "a great challenge with a solid difficulty curve". However, the primary concern of reviewers was the Guitar Grip, as it was both difficult to hold and caused hand cramps in some players. The Grip was also reported to seat poorly in the GBA slot and came out of the unit at times, which caused the game to stop unexpectedly. Reviews reported difficulty in keeping the DS unit steady while playing with the Grip, making it difficult to follow the note patterns on the screen. Reviewers found the set list to be both short and somewhat skewed towards recent music, and some commented that the sound quality of the tracks was poor. The multiplayer aspects of the game were well received. While some reviewers considered the game as an [...] "absolute Guitar Hero experience", others noted that the social aspect of the series was not present, and that the game felt [...] "more like an experiment than a full-fledged game, as if Activision <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if it could be pulled off." ...|$|E
