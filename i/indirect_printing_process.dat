5000|$|Pad {{printing}} (also called tampography) is a <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> {{that can}} transfer a 2-D image onto a 3-D object. This is accomplished using an <b>indirect</b> offset (gravure) <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> that involves an image being {{transferred from the}} cliché via a silicone pad onto a substrate. Pad printing is used for printing on otherwise difficult to print on products in many industries including medical, automotive, promotional, apparel, and electronic objects, as well as appliances, sports equipment and toys. It {{can also be used}} to deposit functional materials such as conductive inks, adhesives, dyes and lubricants.|$|R
40|$|Mass-customization is a {{megatrend}} {{that also}} affects the wood industry. To obtain individually designed laminates in batch size one efficient printing and processing technologies are required. Digital printing was envisaged {{as it does}} not depend on highly costly printing cylinders (as used in rotogravure printing) and allows rapid exchange of the printing designs. In the present work, two wellestablished digital printing approaches, the multi-pass and the single-pass technique, were investigated and evaluated for their applicability in decorating engineered wood and low-pressure melamine films. Three different possibilities of implementing digital printing in the decorative laminates manufacturing process were studied: (1) digital printing on coated chipboard and subsequently applying a lacquered top-coat or melamine overlay (designated as “direct printing”, since the LPM was the printing substrate), (2) digital printing on decorative paper which was subsequently impregnated before hot pressing (designated as “indirect printing, variant A”) and (3) digital printing on decorative paper with subsequent interlamination of the paper between impregnated under- and overlay paper layers during the pressing process (designated as “indirect printing, variant B”). Due to various advantages of the resulting cured melamine resin surfaces including a much better technological performance and flexibility in surface texture design, it was decided to industrially further pursue only the <b>indirect</b> digital <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> comprising interlamination and the direct <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> with a melamine overlay-finishing. Basis for the successful trials on production and laboratory scales were the identification of applicable inks (in terms of compatibility with melamine resin) and of appropriate printing paper quality (in terms of impregnation and imprinting ability). After selection and fine tuning of suitable materials, the next challenge to overcome was the initially insufficient bond strength between impregnated overlay and the ink layers which led to unsatisfactory quality of the print appearance and delamination effects. However, the optimization of the pressing program {{and the development of a}} modified impregnation procedure for the underlay and overlay papers allowed the successful implementation of digital printing in the production line of our industrial partner FunderMax...|$|R

To {{be more precise}} at a nanoscale, the 3D <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> uses a laser etching machine, which etches into each plate the details needed for the segment of nanorobot.

The 3D <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> is repeated until the nanorobot is built from the bottom up. This 3D <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> has many benefits.

The behavior of the process in the device-independent CIE-XYZ and CIE-L*u*v* colorimetric spaces is explored using the compound Neugebauer model developped for this purpose.

A defect feature {{extraction}} algorithm which {{depends on the}} separation and subtraction of color image and mathematical morphology is proposed in this paper, based on the defects in trademark <b>printing</b> <b>processes,</b> such as smudges, pin holes, misprints, misting etc. The difference images of each monochrome are operated with morphology methods and then the defect information of high precision <b>printing</b> <b>processes</b> in colorful trademark, such as shape, boundary contour, quantity, size and location etc, are extracted and recognized with suitable structure elements.
