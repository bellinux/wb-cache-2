5|$|Several White Stripes {{recordings}} {{were completed}} rapidly. For example, Elephant {{was recorded in}} about two weeks in London's Toe Rag Studio. Their 2005 follow-up, <b>Get</b> <b>Behind</b> Me Satan, was likewise recorded in just two weeks.|$|E
5|$|As a {{means of}} {{rallying}} supporters to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> their cause, awareness campaigns against the takeover were launched. Red Issue issued pamphlets to fans and demonstrations in and around Old Trafford took place before the match against Charlton Athletic on 9 September. Football fans across the United Kingdom also lent support by lobbying their local MPs into passing a legislation, preventing further sport takeovers in the future.|$|E
5|$|Because I {{always try}} {{so hard to}} win and had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E

5|$|Dusk was at 19:00 and the Turkish attack had now reached Malone's Gulley and The Nek. The New Zealanders {{waited until}} the Turks came close, then opened fire in the darkness, {{stopping}} their advance. Seriously outnumbered, they asked for reinforcements. Instead, the supporting troops to their rear were withdrawn and the Turks managed to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> them. So, taking the machine-guns with them, they withdrew off Russell's Top into Rest Gully. This left the defenders at Walker's Ridge isolated {{from the rest of}} the force.|$|E
5|$|Following the well-received <b>Get</b> <b>Behind</b> Me Satan, Icky Thump {{marked a}} return to the punk, garage rock and blues {{influences}} for which the band is known. It was recorded at Nashville's Blackbird Studio and took almost three weeks to record—the longest of any White Stripes album. It would also be their first album with a title track. The album's release came {{on the heels of a}} series of concerts in Europe and one in North America at Bonnaroo.|$|E
5|$|White Blood Cells was {{followed}} by Elephant (2003), which earned the band four Grammy Award nominations, and won them the Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song awards. Elephant produced four singles and went double platinum in the United Kingdom. The White Stripes' later albums, <b>Get</b> <b>Behind</b> Me Satan (2005) and Icky Thump (2007), both won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and charted {{in the top five}} of the Billboard 200. Overall, The White Stripes have won 17 awards from 54 nominations.|$|E

5|$|At 15:30 the two battalions of the Turkish 77th Infantry Regiment were in position, {{and with}} the 27th Infantry they counter-attacked again. At 15:30 and at 16:45 McCay, now under severe pressure, {{requested}} reinforcements. The second time he was informed {{there was only one}} uninvolved battalion left, the 4th, and Bridges was keeping them in reserve until more troops from the New Zealand and Australian Division had been landed. McCay then spoke to Bridges direct and informed him the situation was desperate and if not reinforced the Turks would <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> him. At 17:00 Bridges released the 4th Battalion to McCay who sent them to the south forming on the left of the 8th Battalion along Bolton's Ridge. They arrived just in time to help counter Turkish probing attacks, by the 27th Infantry Regiment, from the south.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Aleksandr III and {{the other}} ships of the {{division}} briefly followed Knyaz Suvorov until {{it became clear that}} the latter ship was out of control and then turned north in an effort to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> Tōgō's ships. Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea by charging straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage in the mist and fog.|$|E
5|$|When {{they entered}} service, the IK-3s {{suffered}} from minor equipment and instrument faults, largely caused by {{deficiencies in the}} Yugoslav aeronautical industry which had resulted {{in a mixture of}} foreign and Yugoslav-made instruments being fitted to the aircraft. The Yugoslav Minister of War approved the acquisition of a further 48 IK-3s to be delivered in 1941–42. The operational aircraft were allocated to the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun, six each to the 161st Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Savo Poljanec) and the 162nd Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Todor Gogić). The IK-3 was then tested against Yugoslav Messerschmitt Bf 109Es in mock dogfights. The evaluation concluded that the IK-3 had several advantages over the Bf 109E; the Yugoslav aircraft was more manoeuvrable in level flight, enabling it to quickly <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> a pursuing Bf 109E by making tight horizontal turns.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the town, as the {{remainder}} of the 5th Division was rested, the 15th Battalion, which had seen less action due to being held in reserve, was committed to pursuing the withdrawing Japanese. The battalion advanced north towards the Markham River, and on 14 September two companies were transported by barge in an effort to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> the fugitives and cut them off, but they arrived about an hour too late. On 17 September, the battalion established a large ambush site along the coast south of the river to prevent the fleeing Japanese from evacuating by the sea. The following day, the ambush was sprung as a platoon-sized group attempted to get away. After being beaten back into the jungle, they launched an attack on one of the Australian positions that was blocking their escape. In the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting, 13 Japanese were killed and one prisoner taken. Further minor clashes followed as the 15th patrolled north and, by late October, it entered Lae. The battalion subsequently took up defensive duties around the town as the 29th Brigade was assigned the task of holding Lae to free up troops from the 7th Division for operations in the Finisterre Range further to the west.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E

The crowd, sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, erupted. This left Australia struggling at 3/68, but a rapid counterattack by the middle and lower order took them to 9/457 at stumps and eventually 458 on the fourth morning.|$|E

5|$|The F-4's biggest weakness, {{as it was}} {{initially}} designed, was its lack of an internal cannon. For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little {{effort was made to}} teach pilots air combat maneuvering. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down in an effort to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to use multiple shots (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, rules of engagement in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying SUU-16 external gunpods containing a 20mm (.79in) M61A1 Vulcan Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the SUU-23, virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to drag, combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently boresighted, yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20mm (.79in) M61A1 Vulcan on the F-4E.|$|E

25|$|He {{improved}} the training regime, introducing ballwork to training sessions, a practice rare in England at the time; the youth and scouting systems begun by his predecessor were extended and he abandoned the club's old recruiting policy of signing often unreliable stars, opting instead for lesser known but more reliable {{players from the}} lower divisions. He also urged the club's fans to be more partisan and to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> the team.
