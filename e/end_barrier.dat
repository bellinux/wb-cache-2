40|$|To {{effectively}} control complex dynamical systems, accurate nonlinear {{models are}} typically needed. However, these models {{are not always}} known. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach based on Gaussian processes that learns models of quadrotors operating in partially unknown environments. What makes this challenging {{is that if the}} learning process is not carefully controlled, the system will go unstable, i. e., the quadcopter will crash. To this <b>end,</b> <b>barrier</b> certificates are employed for safe learning. The barrier certificates establish a non-conservative forward invariant safe region, in which high probability safety guarantees are provided based on the statistics of the Gaussian Process. A learning controller is designed to efficiently explore those uncertain states and expand the barrier certified safe region based on an adaptive sampling scheme. In addition, a recursive Gaussian Process prediction method is developed to learn the complex quadrotor dynamics in real-time. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Comment: Submitted to ICRA 2018, 8 page...|$|E
40|$|Several {{procedures}} have been recommended to induce the root <b>end</b> <b>barrier</b> formation in teeth with open apices. Conventional treatment for such cases will require many appointments {{with an average}} duration of 12. 9 months. During this period, the root canal is susceptible to reinfection from around the provisional restoration, which may promote apical periodontitis and arrest of apical repair. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has been successfully used for one visit apexification wherein the root canal can be obturated within 24 hours after placement of MTA. Using a matrix prior to the placement of MTA avoids its extrusion, reduces leakage in the sealing material, and allows favorable response of the periapical tissues. This report presents a case of apexification where an absorbable suture {{was used as an}} apical matrix. Use of an absorbable suture circumvents all the problems associated with other conventional materials. Conclusion. Placement of the matrix made from the suture material is predictable and is easily positioned at the apex and the length can be adjusted as required. 10 -month follow-up of the case shows resorbed matrix and bone healing in the periapical region. The patient was asymptomatic during the whole follow-up period and tooth exhibited mobility within physiologic limits and was functioning normally...|$|E
40|$|The atom laser {{has long}} been a holy grail within atom physics and with the {{creation}} of an atom laser we hope to bring a similar revolution in to the field of atom optics. With the creation of the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) in 1995 the path to an atom laser was initiated. An atom laser is continues source of BEC. In a Bose condensate all the atoms occupy the same quantum state and can be described by the same wave function and phase. With an atom laser the De Broglie wavelength of atoms can be much smaller than the wavelength of light. Due to the ultimate control over the atoms the atom laser is very interesting for atom optics, lithography, metrology, etching and deposition of atoms on a surface. All previous atom lasers have been created from atoms coupled out from an existing Bose-Einstein Condensate. There are different approaches but common to them all is that the duration of the output of the atom laser is limited {{by the size of the}} initial BEC and they all have a low flux. This leaves the quest to build a continuous high flux atom laser. An alternative approach to a continuous BEC beam is to channel a continuous ultra cold atomic beam into a magnetic guide and then cool this beam down to degeneracy. Cooling down a continuous beam of atoms faces three large problems: The collision rate has to be large enough for effective rethermalization, since evaporative cooling in 2 D is not as effective as in 3 D and a large thermal conductivity due to atoms with a high angular momentum causes heating downstream in the guide. We have built a 4 meter magnetic guide that is placed on a downward slope with a magnetic barrier in the end. In the guide we load packets of ultra cold rubidium atoms with a frequency rate large enough for the packets to merge together to form a continuous atomic beam. The atomic beam is supersonic and when the beam reaches the <b>end</b> <b>barrier</b> it will return and collide with itself. The collisions lowers the velocity of the beam into subsonic velocities and a shock wave is created between the two velocity regions. In order to conserve number of particle, momentum and enthalpy the density of the atomic beam passing through the shock wave must increase. We have build such a shock wave in an atomic beam and observed the density increase due to this. As an extra feature having a subsonic beam on a downward slope adds an extra density increase due to gravitational compression. Loading ultra cold atoms into a 3 D trap from the dense subsonic beam overcomes the problem with 2 D cooling and thermal conductivity. This was done and evaporative cooling was applied creating an unprecedented large number rubidium BEC...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{interest}} in the synchronous reluctance machines is growing up due to their several merits in comparison to other machine types. These machines offer high torque density {{with respect to the}} induction machines. Their torque density is slightly lower than permanent magnet synchronous machines even though the lower performance is compensated by a much cheaper rotor. Since synchronous reluctance machines do not induce voltage when the stator is not supplied, there are not short circuit currents and braking torques due to the electrical faults, e. g. they have high fault tolerant capability. In addition, synchronous reluctance machine has a robust structure, and a wide constant power speed range. For these aforementioned reasons, these machines are employed in several applications. However, there is a prominent defect of this kind of machines which is the low power factor. This defect is addressed by assisting the motor by permanent magnets within the flux barriers of the rotor leading to the permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor. In addition, these kinds of machines has high torque ripple. This is due to the high harmonic content in the magneto motive force which interacts with the rotor anisotropy. Several approaches are proposed to reduce the torque ripple, such as: (a) using skewed rotor, (b) adopting two different flux-barrier geometries in the same lamination, i. e., asymmetric rotor, (c) using equally spaced the flux-barrier ends along the rotor periphery, and (d) optimization approaches were applied to smooth the torque. The synchronous reluctance machine is becoming of great interest in the last years, due to two key reasons: (i) the increase of rare earth permanent magnet cost and (ii) the increasing request of high-efficiency machines. Therefore, the reluctance motor and the ferrite permanent assisted reluctance motor are becoming competitors of both surface-mounted permanent magnet machines and induction machines in many applications. Such motors are also becoming particularly interesting when the control is based on the sensor-less rotor position detection. Even if there is a great interest in this kind of machines, there is a few work about the analytical design of their rotor, e. g. about how to select the <b>end</b> <b>barrier</b> angles, designing the iron ribs, and designing the permanent magnet robust towards the demagnetization. In the majority of the cases the reluctance machine is analyzed by using finite element analysis. The results are precise and useful for achieving a specific geometry to be prototyped, but they refer to that particular solution and they lose generality. In other words, it is difficult to find general rules to design reluctance machines, since the analysis approach is focused on a single objective. During the manufacturing process, there are some manufacturing imprecision, such as mass unbalance, bearing tolerance, shaft bow, and etc., cause eccentricity fault. Eccentricity may cause magnetic and dynamic problems with additional vibrations, noises, and torque pulsations. Although the eccentricity faults in induction and permanent magnet motors are extensively investigated, there are a few publications on synchronous reluctance machines with eccentricity. It is important to study the effect of rotor eccentricity on these machines because of their high anisotropy and critical iron parts in the rotor (iron ribs). For the aim of designing the iron ribs thicknesses, the unbalanced magnetic force acting on theses ribs should be accurately estimated. Main contribution of the thesis This thesis aims to give an useful analytical approach for reaching a preliminary geometry of both synchronous reluctance and permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motors, as starting point for a successive optimization. For more accurate design of the rotor iron ribs, the electro-magnetic force acting on the rotor, in different rotor eccentricity cases, are analytically computed. In addition, a comparative studies (analytically and FE) between the synchronous reluctance, permanent magnet assisted, and surface mounted permanent magnet machines, in different eccentricity cases, is carried out. Therefore, this thesis is divided into four main parts. At the first part, an analytical model based on the magnetic equivalent lumped network of the reluctance motor is discussed. This model studies the magnetic performance of the concentric synchronous reluctance motor. Then, this analytical model is adopted in order to study the impact of different eccentricity scenarios (static and dynamic eccentricity) on the reluctance motor. Different stator windings configurations (distributed and concentrated windings) and different rotor geometries (symmetric and asymmetric rotor) are considered. After that, the eccentric synchronous reluctance machine is compared with the eccentric permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machine. The impact of the barrier dimensions, the rotor geometry, and the permanent magnet type is highlighted in this comparison. Furthermore, an analytical comparison between the reluctance motor and the surface mounted permanent magnet motor is carried out in different cases of eccentricity. The axial non uniform displacement of the rotor axis from the stator axis, at one end and both ends of the axis, are involved in this analytical comparison. The second part aims to achieve more realistic estimation of the electromagnetic forces acting on the rotor by considering the effect of stator slots and the magnetic voltage drop due to the actual B-H curve of the motor iron. The analytical model is developed for both eccentric and concentric synchronous reluctance motor. Then, an experimental validation of the analytical and FE analysis is carried out. At the third part, an analytical approach for designing the permanent magnet of the permanent magnet assisted reluctance motor is proposed. The width and the thickness are selected so as to achieve the desired no-load air-gap flux density and resist the demagnetization under the desired loading conditions, respectively. Both complete and simplified analytical analyses are discussed. In addition, the analytical approach is presented in both cases of neglecting and considering the rotor iron ribs. Then, from the previously mentioned three parts of this thesis, a rapid multi-objectives analytical approach is proposed to achieve the initial design of the synchronous reluctance and permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motors. Finally, at the fourth part, a graphical user interface application for concentric and eccentric synchronous reluctance motor is developed. This application estimates stator and rotor scalar magnetic potential, air-gap flux density, electromagnetic torque, magnetic force acting on the rotor. The input parameters of this application are - the geometrical data of the stator and rotor, - the electric loading (kA/m), the electric load angle in (electric degree), - the rotor geometry type, e. g., symmetric or asymmetric rotor geometry, - number of flux-barriers per rotor pole, - eccentricity type or no eccentricity, e. g., healthy case, - the eccentricity value. Then, the user can run the application to estimate the magnetic performance of both concentric and eccentric synchronous reluctance motor. ...|$|E
