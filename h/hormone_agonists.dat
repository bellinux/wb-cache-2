50|$|While most {{hormonal}} {{therapy strategies}} seek to block hormone signalling to cancer cells, {{there are some}} instances in which supplementation with specific <b>hormone</b> <b>agonists</b> may have a growth-inhibiting, or even cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. Because many hormones can produce antagonism and feedback inhibition of the synthesis of other hormones, there is significant overlap between this concept and those discussed above.|$|E
50|$|Angiogenesis inhibitors lack {{clinical}} evidence of efficacy in endometriosis therapy. Under experimental in vitro and in vivo conditions, compounds {{that have been}} shown to exert inhibitory effects on endometriotic lesions include growth factor inhibitors, endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, fumagillin analogues, statins, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, phytochemical compounds, immunomodulators, dopamine agonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, progestins, danazol and gonadotropin-releasing <b>hormone</b> <b>agonists.</b> However, many of these agents are associated with undesirable side effects and more research is necessary. An ideal therapy would diminish inflammation and underlying symptoms without being contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|Antiandrogens {{are used}} in more severe cases. Similar to {{physical}} castration, they work by reducing androgen levels, and have thus been described as chemical castration. The antiandrogen cyproterone acetate {{has been shown to}} substantially reduce sexual fantasies and offending behaviors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and gonadotropin-releasing <b>hormone</b> <b>agonists</b> (such as leuprolide acetate) have also been used to lower sex drive. Due to the side effects, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry recommends that hormonal treatments only be used when there is a serious risk of sexual violence, or when other methods have failed. Surgical castration has largely been abandoned because these pharmacological alternatives are similarly effective and less invasive.|$|E

50|$|This was {{followed}} by a total of 14 pregnancies resulting in nine births in 1981 with the Monash University team. Howard W. Jones and Georgeanna Seegar Jones at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Virginia, further improved stimulated cycles by incorporating the use of a follicle-stimulating hormone (uHMG). This then became known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Another step forward was the use of gonadotrophin-releasing <b>hormone</b> <b>agonists</b> (GnRHA), thus decreasing the need for monitoring by preventing premature ovulation, and more recently gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Ant), which have a similar function. The additional use of the oral contraceptive pill has allowed the scheduling of IVF cycles, which has made the treatment far more convenient for both staff and patients.|$|E
50|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are frequently}} used first {{in patients with}} pelvic pain, particularly if the diagnosis of endometriosis has not been definitively (excision and biopsy) established. The goal of directed medical treatment is to achieve an anovulatory state. Typically, this is achieved initially using hormonal contraception. This can also be accomplished with progestational agents (i.e., medroxyprogesterone acetate), danazol, gestrinone, or gonadotropin-releasing <b>hormone</b> <b>agonists</b> (GnRH), {{as well as other}} less well-known agents. These agents are generally used if oral contraceptives and NSAIDs are ineffective. GnRH can be combined with estrogen and progestogen (add-back therapy) without loss of efficacy but with fewer hypoestrogenic symptoms. These medications are often ineffective in treating endometriomas and any relief is short lived while taking the medications. Hormonal treatment has a large number of sometimes permanent side effects, such as hot flushes, loss of bone mass, deepening of voice, weight gain, and facial hair growth.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Intravenous/intravascular leiomyomatosis is {{characterized}} by intravenous proliferation of a histologically benign smooth muscle cell tumor mass that is non-tissue-invasive.

This study aims to show the impact of GnRHa treatment on insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF-I) and IGF binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3) secretion, growth, and on other parameters that may help estimate the height velocity. Methods: Data from 60 girls (mean age, 8. 8 ± 0. 7 years) treated with GnRHa were analyzed. Their height, bone age (BA), serum IGF-I, and IGFBP- 3 concentrations were measured at the start and after a year of GnRHa treatment.

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing <b>hormone</b> <b>agonists</b> and antagonists provide androgen-deprivation {{therapy for}} {{prostate}} cancer. Unlike agonists, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists {{have a direct}} mode of action to block pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors. There are two licensed gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, degarelix and abarelix. Of these, degarelix is the more extensively studied and has been documented {{to be more effective}} than the well-established, first-line agonist, leuprolide, in terms of substantially faster onset of castration, faster suppression of prostate-specific antigen, no risk for testosterone surge or clinical flare, and improved prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival, suggesting a delay in castration resistance. Other than minor injection-site reactions, degarelix is generally well tolerated, without systemic allergic reactions and with most adverse events consistent with androgen suppression or the underlying condition. In conclusion, degarelix provides a rational, first-line androgen-deprivation therapy suitable for the treatment of prostate cancer, with faster onset of castration than with agonists, and no testosterone surge. Furthermore, data suggest that degarelix improves disease control compared with leuprolide, and might delay the onset of castration-resistant disease. In view of these clinical benefits and the lack of need for concomitant anti-androgen treatment, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists might replace gonadotropin-releasing <b>hormone</b> <b>agonists</b> as first-line androgen-deprivation therapy in the future. status: publishe...|$|E
