50|$|From {{nationalisation}} in 1948, the Barry Railway {{network was}} under state ownership, in British Railways. In 1962 the British Transport Docks Board was established {{and took over}} all the major <b>docks</b> <b>installations</b> within the British Transport Commission.|$|R
50|$|At Cardiff {{the volume}} of {{minerals}} transported increased beyond expectation, and quickly overwhelmed {{the capacity of the}} <b>dock</b> <b>installations</b> to handle them. Moreover the railway connections to them also were soon heavily congested, and this led to dissatisfaction among the coalowners and other industrialists who used them.|$|R
50|$|Many shiplifts use a {{transfer}} system for ships {{so that the}} vessels can be transported from the water to a parking {{place where they can}} be painted or repaired. One shiplift can serve many parking places, while a dry <b>docking</b> <b>installation</b> can only <b>dock</b> one ship.|$|R
5000|$|Occasional bombing raids by Ju 88s {{flying from}} Greece against Suez began in July and became almost nightly in August and September. The targets were the Port Tewfik <b>dock</b> <b>installations,</b> the oil refinery, railway {{marshalling}} yards, Shallufa Airfield and shipping at the anchorage {{in the bay}} ...|$|R
50|$|The Military Engineer Services, or the MES, are {{responsible}} for the design, construction and maintenance of all works, buildings, airfields, <b>dock</b> <b>installations,</b> etc., together with accessory services such as military roads, water and electricity supply, drainage, refrigeration, furniture, required by the Army, Navy, Air Force & Coast Guard in India.|$|R
5|$|Commandos {{on board}} would then {{disembark}} and use demolition charges to destroy nearby <b>dock</b> <b>installations,</b> searchlights and gun emplacements. The destroyer {{would then be}} blown up. At {{the same time the}} RAF would carry out a number of diversionary air raids in the area. Most of them failed because of heavy clouds and fog and very few bombers.|$|R
5|$|The 57 raids {{were all}} between 1940 and 1944 and were mostly against targets in France, which had 36 raids. There were 12 raids in Norway, seven raids in the Channel Islands and one each in Belgium and the Netherlands. The raids {{met with a}} mixture of fortunes. Operation Chariot—the raid against <b>dock</b> <b>installations</b> at Saint-Nazaire—has since been called the {{greatest}} raid of all. Others, like Operation Aquatint and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of all the commandos involved.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps Wapping's {{greatest}} {{attraction is}} the Thames foreshore itself, and the venerable public houses that face onto it. A {{number of the}} 'watermen's stairs', such as Wapping Old Stairs and Pelican Stairs (by the Prospect of Whitby) give public access to a littoral zone (for the Thames is tidal at this point) littered with flotsam, jetsam and fragments of old <b>dock</b> <b>installations.</b> Understandably it is popular with amateur archaeologists and treasure hunters - it is surprisingly easy for even a casual visitor {{to pick up a}} centuries-old shard of pottery here.|$|R
25|$|On 5 November 1997, Atlantis again {{arrived at}} Palmdale for OMDP-2 which was {{completed}} on 24 September 1998. The 130 {{modifications carried out}} during OMDP-2 included glass cockpit displays, replacement of TACAN navigation with GPS and ISS airlock and <b>docking</b> <b>installation.</b> Several weight reduction modifications were also performed on the orbiter including replacement of Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) insulation blankets on upper surfaces with FRSI. Lightweight crew seats were installed and the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) package installed on OMDP-1 was removed to lighten Atlantis to better serve its prime mission of servicing the ISS.|$|R
5|$|The mating was {{confirmed}} at 1:17am CST, with Atlantis over eastern Europe on its 30th orbit. Shortly after the capture, Commander Ken Cameron expressed the crew's {{appreciation for the}} training that prepared them for the <b>docking</b> module <b>installation.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1979, the Soviet Union started leasing {{the base}} rent-free from Vietnam under a 25-year leasing treaty. The base, aside from {{serving as a}} {{communications}} and signal-intelligence collection centre, eased Soviet logistical support of its naval forces that were deployed in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. The base was especially important {{given the nature of}} the Soviets' Pacific bases, which, unlike the warm-water Cam Ranh Base, were restricted to various degrees due to ice. The first Soviet naval ships arrived at the base in March 1979. In addition to the two piers, the Soviets added five more, as well as building two dry <b>docks,</b> <b>installations</b> to admit nuclear submarines, fuel- and weapons-storage facilities, and barracks. Under Soviet administration, Cam Ranh became its largest naval base for forward deployment outside the Warsaw Pact. Some 20 ships were berthed daily at the base, along with six attack submarines.|$|R
5|$|The {{size of the}} raiding force {{depended}} on the objective. The smallest raid was conducted by two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest was the 10,500 man Operation Jubilee. Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight although some, like Operation Gauntlet, were conducted {{over a number of}} days. In north west Europe there were 57 raids made between 1940 and 1944. Of these 36 were against targets in France. There were 12 raids against Norway, seven raids in the Channel Islands, and single raids were made in Belgium and the Netherlands. The success of the raids varied; Operation Chariot, the raid against <b>dock</b> <b>installations</b> at St Nazaire, has been hailed as the greatest raid of all time, but others, like Operation Aquatint and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of all involved. The smaller raids ended in mid-1944 on the orders of Major General Robert Laycock, who suggested that they were no longer as effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, something that could be extremely detrimental to Allied plans.|$|R
5|$|On 27 May, {{the first}} full day of the evacuation, one cruiser, eight destroyers, and 26 other craft were active. Admiralty {{officers}} combed nearby boatyards for small craft that could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically {{taking part in the}} effort. The same day, the Luftwaffe heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the <b>dock</b> <b>installations.</b> As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished. An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town. The Luftwaffe was met by 16 squadrons of the Royal Air Force, who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft. Altogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo. The RAF continued to take a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and strafed while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.|$|R
40|$|Seagrasses {{have high}} {{conservation}} and human-use values, {{but around the}} world they are being damaged by human activities. Compared to the larger spatial scale at which some human activities affect estuaries and their seagrasses (e. g. catchment disturbance, dredging, pollution, trawling), recreational boating and infrastructure of moorings and docks act at smaller scales. However, the cumulative effects contribute to stresses acting on seagrass beds. This study assessed the effects of docks on the native seagrass Zostera muelleri subsp. capricorni in an estuary in south-east Australia and of current management practices designed to reduce dock impacts on this seagrass. A field survey found that seagrass biomass was significantly reduced below docks, and the effects were not influenced by dock orientation. Management practices requiring {{the use of a}} mesh decking to provide greater light penetration reduced, but did not eliminate, the reduction in seagrass biomass caused by docks. A modified beyond BACI experiment provided evidence for a causal link between the installation of wooden or mesh docks and reductions in biomass of seagrass. The reduction in biomass was apparent 6 mo after <b>dock</b> <b>installation,</b> and by 26 mo seagrass biomass had declined by at least 90 %. Faced with increasing coastal populations, increases in recreational use, and continued pressures from other human activities, alternative management practices that further minimize the effects of docks are needed...|$|R

50|$|At the Admiralty Whitaker {{focussed}} on {{the construction}} and maintenance of harbours, <b>docks,</b> air defence <b>installations</b> and fuel oil facilities. Two of his earlier projects were the construction of Rosyth Naval Base and Port Edgar destroyer base. In 1919 he began a two-year project to erect oil tanks in Jamaica and was later instructed to design and build a pier and moorings for cruisers. In the same year Whitaker was elected a corporate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE).|$|R

500|$|Throughout most of 1942–43, the Atlantic Wall {{remained}} a relaxed {{front for the}} Axis troops manning it, with only two large-scale British attacks. Operation Chariot, launched near St Nazaire in March 1942, successfully destroyed German pumping machinery for, and severely damaged, the Normandie dry <b>dock</b> and <b>installations.</b> The second attack was the Dieppe Raid, launched near the French port of Dieppe in August 1942 to test the German defences and provide combat experience for Canadian troops. The Germans were defeated at St. Nazaire, but had little difficulty in repulsing the attack at Dieppe, where they inflicted heavy casualties. [...] Although the Dieppe raid was {{a disaster for the}} Allies, it alarmed Hitler, who was sure an Allied invasion in the West would shortly follow. Following Dieppe, Hitler gave Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the overall German Commander-in-Chief in the West, 15 further divisions to shore up the German positions.|$|R
50|$|The {{whole area}} was savagely bombed during the Second Siege of Malta during World War II, as the <b>docks</b> and {{military}} <b>installations</b> around the port were legitimate targets for Axis bombers. However collateral damage wrecked much of Valletta and The Three Cities, and caused {{large numbers of}} civilian casualties. Malta Dockyard is still active but with {{the departure of the}} British Military the harbour lost much of its military significance. A considerable part of Malta's commercial shipping is now handled by the new free port at Kalafrana, so the harbour is much quieter {{than it was in the}} first half of the 20th century.|$|R
25|$|Initially, the {{seaplane}} service only operated {{and carried}} out maintenance from a specially adapted floating dock known as HMS Flat Iron. This floating dock was able to submerge and allow two seaplanes to navigate onto it and then raise itself back up to allow for complex maintenance. During the 1930s the Royal Air Force improved RAF Pembroke <b>Dock</b> by the <b>installation</b> of two 'B' and one 'T' hangar and in 1938, the floating dock was towed to Invergordon as it was redundant. In 1935, the first spillway was constructed which allowed aircraft {{to be removed from}} the water whatever the tide. During this period, Sir Arthur Travers Harris (Bomber Harris) was the Officer Commanding RAF Pembroke Dock and 210 Squadron as a Wing Commander.|$|R
50|$|Broadly speaking, floodwaters {{moved from}} the {{northern}} and central regions toward the Danube lowlands {{in the south and}} east. The Prahova, Târnava, Olt (threatening Râmnicu Vâlcea and Slatina) and Tisza rivers were among those affected, as well as the Danube (which rose up to 6½ ft above normal spring high-water levels, flooding <b>docks</b> and port <b>installations</b> in Turnu Severin), Prut and Siret. As crests rolled onward, downstream localities knew to fear the worst: for instance, Galaţi and Brăila knew by June 3 that floods from three weeks earlier would reach them on June 11, the question being if their dikes would hold. The neighbouring Soviet Union and Bulgaria were not nearly as threatened, as the Prut and Danube banks are steep and high on their shores. The floods also came in phases: for instance, the waters were just beginning to recede when on May 23-24 renewed heavy rain and snowfalls raised their level again.|$|R
40|$|In India {{the cost}} of {{corrosion}} prevention in marine industries may be {{of the order of}} Rs. 100 crores. The different areas of service are: (1) Immersed in seawater (2) 'Splash waterline (3) Super structure area near seawater. Painting is the principal means of protection; other methods such as cathodic protection, are used only in conjunction with paint coatings. Hence it is necessary to provide long term maintenance-free protection and to minimise the time out of service when maintenance of ship is essentially required. In this article the mechanism of corrosion prevention by paints, pretreatment, paint system, method of application of paint for &fferent types of structures and equipments used in marine environments are described. A comprehensive protective system consisting of primer + under coat + finishing paint + antifouling paints is included. Application of the organic coatings and details of type of fouling and the use of different types of antifouling compounds used in the paint formulation are given. The protective schemes for <b>dock</b> and harbour <b>installation,</b> offshore structure, super structures and deck areas are discussed. The causes of paint failure and the specification, requirements of paints are described...|$|R
50|$|When the {{capacity}} of the Binnenhafen (de) and Niederhafen (de) ports became full {{at the end of the}} 19th century, the city walls were demolished and the area of Grasbrook was used to extend the harbor area. In 1868, the first artificial dock was constructed at Sandtorhafen, and in 1881, the Grasbrookhafen was added. The Strandhafen was built directly on the Norderelbe, the Magdeburger Hafen, Brooktorhafen, and Ericusgraben were made to connect to the Oberhafen, and, finally, the Baakenhafen was built with a rail connection to the Hamburger Elbbrücken (de) bridges and the Kirchenpauerhafen with anchorage on the Elbe. Until 1886, the entire island was built up with <b>docks</b> and port <b>installations.</b> In 1872, the Hamburg Hanover railway station (de) was constructed on Lohseplatz east of the Magdeburger Hafen. The Kehrwieder and Wandrahm residential quarters were demolisehd in 1883 to allow construction of the customs and duty-free zone of the Port of Hamburg, displacing around 20,000 residents. In 1888, the Warehouse District (Speicherstadt) could then be built in this area. Kaispeicher B was built in 1878 and the administration building of the old port authority (Altes Hafenamt) was built in 1885 at the Magdeburger Hafen. Around the start of the 20th century, the first heated fruit storehouses were constructed, and in 1928, a refrigerated herring warehouse designed by Fritz Schumacher was built.|$|R
