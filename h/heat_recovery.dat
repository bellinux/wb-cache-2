40|$|International audienceThe {{heat shock}} {{response}} {{is a widely}} described defense mechanism during which the preferential expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) helps the cell to recover from thermal damages such as protein denaturation/aggregation. We have previously reported that NFkappaB transcription factor is activated during the <b>recovery</b> period after <b>heat</b> shock. In this study, we analyze the consequences of NFkappaB activation during <b>heat</b> shock <b>recovery,</b> by comparing the heat shock response of NFkappaB competent and incompetent (p 65 /RelA-depleted) cells. We demonstrate {{for the first time}} that NFkappaB plays a major and crucial role during the heat shock response by activating autophagy, which increases survival of heat-treated cells. Indeed, we observed that autophagy is not activated during <b>heat</b> shock <b>recovery</b> and cell death is strongly increased in NFkappaB incompetent cells. Moreover, if autophagy is artificially induced in these cells, the cytotoxicity of heat shock is turned back to normal. We show that despite a post-heat shock increase of Beclin 1 level in NFkappaB competent cells, neither Beclin 1 /class III PI 3 K complex, Bcl(2) /Bcl-X(L) nor mTOR kinase are NFkappaB targets whose modulation of expression could be responsible for NFkappaB activation of autophagy during <b>heat</b> shock <b>recovery.</b> In contrast, we demonstrate that aberrantly folded/aggregated proteins are prime events in the signaling pathway leading to NFkappaB mediated autophagy after heat shock. Hence, our findings demonstrate that NFkappaB-induced autophagy during <b>heat</b> shock <b>recovery</b> is an additional cell response to HS-induced protein denaturation/aggregation; this mechanism increases cell survival, probably through clearance of irreversibly damaged proteins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Grapes {{are a major}} {{fruit crop}} around the world. Heat stress can {{significantly}} reduce grape yield and quality. Changes {{at the molecular level}} in response to heat stress and subsequent recovery are poorly understood. To elucidate the effect of heat stress and subsequent recovery on expression of genes by grape leaves representing the classic heat stress response and thermotolerance mechanisms, transcript abundance of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaves was quantified using the Affymetrix Grape Genome oligonucleotide microarray (15, 700 transcripts), followed by quantitative Real-Time PCR validation for some transcript profiles. Results We found that about 8 % of the total probe sets were responsive to heat stress and/or to subsequent recovery in grape leaves. The <b>heat</b> stress and <b>recovery</b> responses were characterized by different transcriptional changes. The number of heat stress-regulated genes was almost twice the number of recovery-regulated genes. The responsive genes identified in this study belong to a large number of important traits and biological pathways, including cell rescue (i. e., antioxidant enzymes), protein fate (i. e., HSPs), primary and secondary metabolism, transcription factors, signal transduction, and development. We have identified some common genes and heat shock factors (HSFs) that were modulated differentially by <b>heat</b> stress and <b>recovery.</b> Most HSP genes were upregulated by heat stress but were downregulated by the recovery. On the other hand, some specific HSP genes or HSFs were uniquely responsive to <b>heat</b> stress or <b>recovery.</b> Conclusion The effect of <b>heat</b> stress and <b>recovery</b> on grape appears to be associated with multiple processes and mechanisms including stress-related genes, transcription factors, and metabolism. <b>Heat</b> stress and <b>recovery</b> elicited common up- or downregulated genes as well as unique sets of responsive genes. Moreover, some genes were regulated in opposite directions by <b>heat</b> stress and <b>recovery.</b> The results indicated HSPs, especially small HSPs, antioxidant enzymes (i. e., ascorbate peroxidase), and galactinol synthase may be important to thermotolerance of grape. HSF 30 may be a key regulator for <b>heat</b> stress and <b>recovery,</b> while HSF 7 and HSF 1 may only be specific to recovery. The identification of <b>heat</b> stress or <b>recovery</b> responsive genes in this study provides novel insights into the molecular basis for heat tolerance in grape leaves. </p...|$|R
