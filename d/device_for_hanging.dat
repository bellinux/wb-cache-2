The furca was a <b>device</b> <b>for</b> <b>hanging</b> slaves in ancient Rome and {{refers to the}} gallows for hanging men; the fossa was a ditch filled with water for the drowning of women. With the introduction to Scotland of the feudal system in the 12th-century, pre-feudal, or Celtic tenures, were transformed into holding from the Crown {{and a number of}} these were held directly or in chief of the Crown and were held in liberam baroniam, in free barony, with high justice (i.e., with pit and gallows). In Scotland trees were often used as gallows. These dule trees were also known as the 'Grief Tree', the 'Gallows Tree', the 'Justice Tree' and the 'Tree'. It is said that King Malcolm Canmore legislated in 1057 that every barony was to have a tree for hanging convicted men and a pit of water for the execution of convicted women.These baronies belonged to the same order as earls and these earls and barons together formed the order of the three estaits of the Scots Parliament known as the Baronage of Scotland. The barons sat in the Scots Parliament until 1587, when they were relieved from attendance, which was burdensome and costly. The right of pit and gallows was removed in 1747 by the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746, lesser powers continued to the twentieth century.|$|E
