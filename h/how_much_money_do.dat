5000|$|The {{cost-benefit}} relationship constraint is {{also called}} cost effectiveness constraints and is pervasive throughout the framework. [...] The companies {{need to spend}} money and time {{in the process of}} providing financial statements. [...] To be more specific, Costs can constraint the range of information when providing financial reporting {{on the grounds that the}} companies must [...] "collect, process, analyze and disseminate relevant information" [...] which need time and money. For investors, they want to know all financial information if possible in ideal condition, which may cause tremendous financial burden in the corporations. Moreover, some financial information may not valuable for external users to acquire a huge benefit, for example, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>do</b> a company spend for its greening of headquarters. Therefore, when deciding the components of financial reporting, companies need to measure the sense of particular financial information and the expenditure of providing particular information and the benefits they can acquire from this particular information. Properly speaking, If the costs in particular information exceed the benefit they can acquire, companies may choose to not disclose this particular information. For example, If there is $0.1 difference between checkbook register and bank statement, accountant should ignore the $0.1 rather than waste time and money to find the $0.1.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of EducationDepartment of Educational LeadershipDavid C. ThompsonThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what school leaders believe is a suitable funding level for Kansas school districts and to simulate the effect and cost of selected findings. More specifically, three questions were examined: <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>do</b> top leaders in each school district in Kansas believe is needed to provide a suitable education for all students in their school district? What would be a suitable per-pupil funding level for districts when examined by varying enrollment sizes if based on the perceived needs of school district leaders in Kansas? And, what would be the statewide cost to implement a suitable per-pupil funding level for districts of varying sizes based on the expressed needs of school district leaders in Kansas? To accomplish its purpose, the study was carried out in three phases. First, it examined research in the areas of school finance equity and adequacy, both of which influence how much money is distributed to schools. Second, this study surveyed top school district leaders in Kansas in search of their opinions regarding how much money is needed to provide an adequate and suitable education. Third, survey data provided the basis for selected simulations designed to estimate the effect and cost of proposed changes on individual school districts and the state of Kansas. The results of this study show that school district leaders widely believe more money is needed to meet performance mandates for regular education students, at-risk students, and bilingual students. When considering only regular education students, this study found that school leaders believe the state of Kansas is underfunding schools by $ 577 million. In addition, this study shows that at-risk students need an additional $ 246. 6 million to be provided an adequate education, while bilingual student show nearly another $ 18 million of need. Some school districts in Kansas have managed to offset the perceived under-funding by utilizing local tax options beyond base state funding. These local options, however, are subject to voter approval and lead to concern by some over equitable and adequate funding for all school districts in Kansas...|$|E
40|$|The {{individual}} consumer – although {{placed at}} the end of the production chain – plays an important role in establishing and developing the market for organic food. It is the final purchase in a supermarket, in a health-food shop or on a farmers’ market that creates the demand that eventually sustains organic agriculture. Purchasing food is by no means a simple decision. It can be split into a series of interlaced decisions such as: When do I do my food shopping (e. g., after work, on a Saturday, under time pressure or not) ? Where do I go (e. g., local supermarket, hypermarket, health-food store, farmers’ market) ? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>do</b> I want to or can I afford to spend? Which classes of products do I want to purchase? Within each class: what is the specific produce I purchase? Decisions made earlier in this chain impact the context of decisions made later. If for example a decision for shopping in a supermarket instead of a health-food store is made the variety of produces is different which impacts the produces that are taken into consideration. If food shopping is done under time pressure, time invested to make decisions is dramatically reduced and mental shortcuts or routines take control. Furthermore, the decision process might be nonlinear, jumping back and forth between some of the aforementioned levels. Psychological research has produced a large number of studies that allow insight into the complexities of this decision making process. It has been shown that consumers’ purchase decisions at a given point in time and in a specific context are determined by a variety of psychological and contextual factors and their interactions. Some of them will be reviewed in this chapter. Based on previous research the following aspects will be discussed: How do values, attitudes and concerns for health or the environment impact the purchase of organic food? How do visibility, availability and perception of prices contribute? What is the role of trust? How can environmental and health psychological models contribute to understanding organic food purchase? How are organic food labels perceived and used in decision making? Finally, an integrated framework model will be suggested in the last section before drawing conclusions for future researc...|$|E

40|$|<b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>does</b> a man {{need to be}} happy? “Just {{a little}} bit more” is how John Rockefeller 1 famously {{answered}} this eternal question. Over time, many studies focused on determining this undefined “a little bit more”, {{in terms of a}} little bit more money, thus increasing incomes, or in terms of a little bit more goods and services, thus increasing consumption. Individuals have the tendency to overestimate the utility of extrinsic goods and activities, like income and status, overestimation deepened by the contemporary consumerist philosophy. Around the world, a growing number of economists, social scientists, corporate leaders and bureaucrats are trying to develop measurements that take into account not just the flow of money but also access to health care, free time with family, conservation of natural resources and other noneconomic factors that have a intrinsic utility. The aim of our paper is to reframe this subject for the case of a developing country and to explore if and how consumption influences the happiness of Romanian individuals. The study is based on a survey of recent literature illustrated by descriptive statistics regarding the level of national incomes, consumption credits and the degree of self-perceived happiness and satisfaction with life. The conclusions that can be drawn reside within the larger framework of the hyperconsumption society and its characteristics...|$|R
40|$|František Ladislav Rieger was o ne of {{the most}} famous Czech {{politicians}} of {{the second half of the}} 19 th century. He was František Palacky's son-in-law and his successor in the leading of the Czech politics. He and his wife Marie Rieger bought the Maleč farm from Franz Xaver Auersperg in 1862. Rieger had already had experience with management of a farm in Suchdol between 1854 and 1857. The Suchdol farm, much smaller than Maleč, did not bring enough profit. Rieger sold the Suchdol farm and his saw mill in Semily and bought the Maleč domain for 300 000 guldens. It was a big investment and Rieger had to mortgage the farm as well as his wife's house in Prague. By the research I wanted to answer the following general questions: 1. How did the farm in Maleč work? 2. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> ofhis time and effort did F. L. Rieger invest in the management? 3. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>did</b> he need for his representative life of an important Czech politician? 4. Where and how did he get his money? As far as the theme "Farms in the second half of 19 th century" is concerned, analytic studies are very rare in the Czech historiography. Most studies about family farms do not go beyond the middle of the 19 th century. The available literature is more general in its focus- about the agriculture, industry, demography, Rieger and his family, or political [...] ...|$|R

He said: [...] "I rang them. I said come and have a listen to what we've done, come and have a listen to this track. And they came up and they freaked, and they said, 'This is a masterpiece. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>money,</b> what <b>do</b> you want? What sort of a contract do you want? We'll do anything.'

[...] Despite impressing their new label with the track, Phonogram felt that it was not suitable for release as a single due to its length, and released [...] "Life Is a Minestrone" [...] as the first single from The Original Soundtrack instead. However, many influential figures in the music industry were demanding that [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] be released as a single, and Mercury eventually bowed to the pressure and released it as the second single from the album. The band were forced to edit the track down to four minutes for radio play, but once it charted, pressure from the public and the media caused the radio stations to revert to playing the full version.|$|R

The Director of the Counsel Management Office said: “The judicial work must be listed in the major planning on economic development by the provincial government, because if you do not put it in, in the future where <b>does</b> your <b>money</b> come from? If you still can’t be put into the major economic and social development planning of the provincial government, the finance bureau will certainly not increase its budget in you. Then this is just like you’re talking to yourself; it doesn’t make much sense” (20130106). The Director of the Legal Aid Office said: “Of our provincial government tax income, the legal profession contributes approximately 700 million, but the government gives us very low budget. If I want to have legal aid services and funding, it is necessary to ask for support from the provincial government and the provincial financial bureau. Otherwise, how would you <b>do</b> it? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> a year <b>do</b> your Justice Bureau have? No matter how you cry, if {{there is a lack of}} money, you cannot solve this problem” (20130718). Obviously, all the bureaus want to gain the support from the provincial government. The documents of the provincial education bureau were supported and forwarded by the provincial government; the Bureau of Justice took it as a good example and tried very hard to get a support from the provincial government and have their documents forwarded by the general office of the provincial government.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to assists the engineers with the early phases of an engineering design by providing them with the necessary tools to analyze and optimize the design. For this purpose a Design Analysis Tool, DA Tool, with various features has being developed. This DA Tool has been programmed in Visual Basic for Applications, VBA, on a Microsoft Office Excel environment. Engineering deals with design of complex systems, thus analyses are so essential. With the analysis results this Tool provides, the designer {{will be able to}} shorten the lead-time for new products, lower the manufacturing cost, improve the reliability and quality of the products and efficiently satisfy the required functions. The DA Tool primary features are: Analysis and Optimization. The analysis follows the Sensitivity Analysis method, an excellent approach to study the relationship between design parameters and system characteristics. This low-fidelity method could complement high-fidelity ones, such as Simulink/Matlab software, or even replace them on early-design phases since they would save an enormous quantity of time, consequently money, and its results are accurate enough. An algorithm making use of the Solver function of Excel has been developed for the optimization process. This iterative mechanism seeks the optimum value for the major design parameters, with regard to the system requirements criteria, from a set of available alternatives. Two models have been analyzed with the DA Tool; an electric vehicle and a portable motion platform. The obtained results give a great overview of the design; showing the critical parts of the system, which need more attention as well as the range of magnitudes of the values for the different parameters. For further development, it would be interesting the implementation of these functionalities in a more advance design software to complement it. Additionally, the study of the performance of this DA Tool in the design process of a new product, in a real company, measuring <b>how</b> <b>much</b> time and <b>money</b> <b>does</b> it save when compared to other more complex methods, would be something worth considering...|$|R
