2500|$|The {{beginning}} of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets {{are subject to}} use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of felt, or a technique known as [...] "flat weaving". Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the warp and weft strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as loop weaving. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a <b>gauge</b> <b>rod,</b> creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug. Hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginning}} of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets {{are subject to}} use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. There is little archaeological evidence to support any theory {{about the origin of}} the pile-woven carpet. The earliest surviving carpet fragments are spread over a wide geographic area, and a long time span. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of felt, or a technique known as “extra-weft wrapping”. Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the warp and weft strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as extra-weft wrapping weaving, a technique which produces soumak, and loop woven textiles. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a <b>gauge</b> <b>rod,</b> creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug. Typically, hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot. The fabric is then further stabilized by weaving (“shooting”) in one or more strings of weft, and compacted by beating with a comb. It seems likely that knotted-pile carpets have been produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques.|$|E

5000|$|The {{accuracy}} of micrometers is checked by {{using them to}} measure <b>gauge</b> blocks, <b>rods,</b> or similar standards whose lengths are precisely and accurately known. If the gauge block {{is known to be}} 0.7500" [...] ± [...]00005" [...] ("seven-fifty plus or minus fifty millionths", that is, [...] "seven hundred fifty thou plus or minus half a tenth"), then the micrometer should measure it as 0.7500". If the micrometer measures 0.7503", then it is out of calibration. Cleanliness and low (but consistent) torque are especially important when calibrating—each tenth (that is, ten-thousandth of an inch), or hundredth of a millimeter, [...] "counts"; each is important. A mere spec of dirt, or a mere bit too much squeeze, obscure the truth of whether the instrument is able to read correctly. The solution is simply —cleaning, patience, due care and attention, and repeated measurements (good repeatability assures the calibrator that his/her technique is working correctly).|$|R
5000|$|In 1973 the Apache {{received}} a minor facelift, introducing proper CV joints, round Smiths <b>gauges</b> and a <b>rod</b> linkage for the gear shift. Originally, the ADO16 used rubber drive joints, a strip speedometer, and a remote extension gear lever. Also in 1973, the sporty TC model {{was added to}} the lineup. Power was up to [...] at 5,800 rpm, compared to [...] at 5,250 rpm for the 'cooking' versions. The TC also received Rostyle rims, vinyl roof, a rev counter, and a sporty steering wheel. All versions of the Apache and Victoria used the 1,275 cc version of BMC's venerable A-series four-cylinder, with a variety of outputs.|$|R
60|$|The latter {{refinement}} cost me {{a separate}} heap of troubles {{on its own}} separate account. What corkscrews did I see the military power bring out against that Bottle; what gimlets, spikes, divining <b>rods,</b> <b>gauges,</b> and unknown tests and instruments! At some places, they persisted in declaring that the wine must not be passed, without being opened and tasted; I, pleading to the contrary, used then to argue the question seated on the Bottle lest they should open it in spite of me. In the southern parts of Italy more violent shrieking, face-making, and gesticulating, greater vehemence of speech and countenance and action, went on about that Bottle than would attend fifty murders in a northern latitude. It raised important functionaries out of their beds, {{in the dead of}} night. I have known half-a-dozen military lanterns to disperse themselves at all points of a great sleeping Piazza, each lantern summoning some official creature to get up, put on his cocked-hat instantly, and come and stop the Bottle. It was characteristic that while this innocent Bottle had such immense difficulty in getting from little town to town, Signor Mazzini and the fiery cross were traversing Italy from end to end.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with an experimental investigation of the behaviour of lapped joints in reinforced concrete. A {{review of existing literature}} highlights the need to establish the longitudinal strain distribution along lap joints. This has been achieved experimentally, with detailed strain measurements being taken using a technique of internally <b>gauging</b> the reinforcing <b>rods.</b> In some specimens, strain concentration gauges were installed {{at the tip of the}} lap to permit the acquisition of particularly localised information. Computer programs were developed to process the substantial amounts of data generated during the course of each test. Two series of tests were undertaken, both using axially loaded specimens, and dealing with tension and compression lap joints respectively. The laps ranged in length from 125 to 750 mm, and comprised bars of either 12 or 20 mm diameter. Transverse reinforcement was provided in two of the tension specimens. Greater emphasis was placed on the first series, with fifteen tension specimens being tested. Thirteen of these tests were each completed within a single day but, additionally, two long-term tests were undertaken. In the latter, a constant load was sustained for up to 81 days. The measurements clearly showed the changing behaviour of the specimens, first as transverse cracks developed and subsequently as failure of the lap joint was approached. The comprehensive analysis of the test results includes a comparison of the ultimate behaviour of these joints with existing design proposals and regulations. The detailed information provided by the strain measurements enables the justification of design assumptions regarding lap joint behaviour, and thus lends greater confidence to existing design regulations. The results from five compression specimens were analysed and compared with the tension tests. The significant contribution to force transfer made by the bearing of the free end of the steel against the concrete was evident. The specimens were loaded to the rig capacity without failing. Additional strain measurements were taken in one tension and one compression specimen by casting embedment gauges within the concrete. These gauges were arranged to measure the circumferential strains in the specimen, and were complemented by strain gauges mounted on the surface of the concrete. The data thus obtained permitted a comparison of the bursting forces set up inside and outside the lap joints. The work showed that some aspects of lap joint behaviour require clarification. Suggestions for further work are included...|$|R
