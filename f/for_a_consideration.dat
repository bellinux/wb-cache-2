Members of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps were 'sealed' by a seal attached to their wrists for periods that appear to have started as quite short term but became quite extended as the importance of their service was recognised.|$|E
2500|$|All the {{language}} structure of both parcels clauses is similar {{and in some}} phrases identical. Most telling though is {{the inclusion of the}} consideration. The Path Grant provides <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> “of the sum of ten thousand pounds lawful money of Great Britton”. The consideration for the Great Grant is universally said to be ten thousand pounds and often clarified by the statement in money or goods. This provides something of a dilemma that [...] supports the identical nature of both indentures. History repeatedly records that the valuation of the Watauga Treaty land sales was ten thousand pounds. For that to be true and not twenty thousand pounds, the ten thousand pounds of the Great Grant and the ten thousand pounds of the Path Grant must be one and the same.|$|E
