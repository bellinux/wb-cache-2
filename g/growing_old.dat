5|$|Among the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden was {{the initial}} front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the contested {{election}} of 1876. After Tilden declined a nomination {{due to his}} poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders. Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa, and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings, along with various favorite sons. Each {{of the other candidates}} had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War; Thurman was generally well liked, but was <b>growing</b> <b>old</b> and infirm, and his views on the silver question were uncertain. Cleveland, too, had detractors—Tammany remained opposed to him—but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends. Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820. On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, {{but the rest of the}} delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won. Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate.|$|E
5|$|Caxias was <b>growing</b> <b>old,</b> and was ill and {{exhausted}} {{by the time he}} reached Asunción. As he did not feel up to the task of pursuing López into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Hancock is shot {{twice in}} the chest and wounded when he foils a liquor store robbery. After being hospitalized, Mary enters and {{explains}} that as each pair of immortals pair up, they begin to lose their powers and live out the remainder of their lives as ordinary humans, <b>growing</b> <b>old</b> and eventually dying. She then begins to point out various scars that Hancock has acquired over the centuries, the result of his normally heroic nature. She also explains that Hancock was savagely attacked in an alley 80 years prior, which caused his amnesia. In each instance, Mary chose to leave him in order for him to regain his powers and recover from his injuries. However, upon discovering he had no memory, Mary couldn't handle it and left. The conversation is interrupted when the hospital is raided by Red Parker, and two men that Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration. Mary is caught in the cross-fire and is mortally wounded. Hancock is able to stop and kill the two men but suffers additional injuries in the process. When Red attempts to finish Hancock off, Ray comes to the rescue and kills the bank robber with a fire axe. With Mary dying, Hancock flees the hospital so their parting will allow her to heal with her own powers. He makes several clumsy leaps away from the hospital, each of longer distance and duration as his powers slowly return, until he finally is able to fly off into the night. He later takes up residence in New York City. Ray is seen walking with Mary and their son discussing historical events such as the reign of Attila the Hun in a jovial manner. In gratitude to Ray, Hancock has painted Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson to look up to view the worldwide advertisement.|$|E

Although the theme is ageing, {{it was one of}} the first songs McCartney wrote, when he was 16. It was in the Beatles setlist in their early days as a song to perform when their amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off. Both George Martin and Mark Lewisohn speculated that McCartney may have thought of the song when recording began for Sgt. Pepper in December 1966 because his father turned 64 earlier that year.|$|E

The King decides that he will give {{the best part of}} the kingdom to the daughter who loves him most, and asks his three daughters to state how much they love him. Goneril and Regan make hypocritical, flattering speeches, and are rewarded with a third each; Cordelia, however, cannot or will not stoop to false flattery for gain, and tells her father that she loves him as much as she should, and that she will love her husband as well if she marries. Enraged, the King disinherits and disowns his once-favourite child, and divides her portion between her two elder sisters. The loyal Earl of Kent speaks up boldly to defend Cordelia, and is banished by the furious King. The Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit on finding Cordelia deprived of a dowry, but the King of France gladly accepts her as his bride.|$|E

500|$|Dürer {{would have}} been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's {{portrait}} of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a [...] "highly detailed representation of [...] white haired old man, who defies the pains of <b>growing</b> <b>old</b> with an alert mind and an inner animation".|$|E
500|$|With Modern Vampires of the City, Vampire Weekend {{attempted}} {{to depart from}} the African-influenced indie pop style of their previous records.

Vampire Weekend titled Modern Vampires of the City after a lyric in the 1990 Junior Reid song [...] "One Blood" [...] and chose a Neal Boenzi photograph of the 1966 New York City smog event as the album cover, citing their haunting qualities as the reason for using them.|$|E

The novel is frequently described as a Bildungsroman. Mike Cadden stated that the book is a convincing tale [...] "to a reader as young and possibly as headstrong as Ged, and therefore sympathetic to him". Ged's coming of age is also intertwined with the physical journey he undertakes through the novel.|$|E

500|$|Marina Sirtis, {{who played}} Lwaxana's {{daughter}} Deanna Troi on the show, [...] thought that compared to earlier episodes, [...] "Half a Life" [...] showed a different {{side of her}} character's mother. Lwaxana's interactions in the episode, argues Sirtis, considerably broadened the character; previous episodes {{had a tendency to}} become centered around Deanna and Lwaxana. Sirtis and director Les Landau felt that the plot of [...] "Half a Life" [...] resembled a morality play. [...] Landau noted the similarity between the episode and the morality play-style plots that franchise creator Gene Roddenberry included in [...] [...] "It deals with the whole issue of <b>growing</b> <b>old</b> and how society deals with the elderly and, in my mind, {{it was one of the}} most pertinent story-lines I have done", Landau recalled.|$|E
500|$|Unlike other modernists who {{experimented with}} free verse, Yeats {{was a master}} of the {{traditional}} forms. The impact of modernism on his work {{can be seen in the}} increasing abandonment of the more conventionally poetic diction of his early work in favour of the more austere language and more direct approach to his themes that increasingly characterises the poetry and plays of his middle period, comprising the volumes In the Seven Woods, Responsibilities and The Green Helmet. His later poetry and plays are written in a more personal vein, and the works written in the last twenty years of his life include mention of his son and daughter, as well as meditations on the experience of <b>growing</b> <b>old.</b> In his poem, [...] "The Circus Animals' Desertion", he describes the inspiration for these late works: ...|$|E

500|$|The Wrath of Khan {{features}} several recurring themes, including death, resurrection, and <b>growing</b> <b>old.</b> Upon {{writing his}} script, Meyer hit upon {{a link between}} Spock's death {{and the age of}} the characters. [...] "This {{was going to be a}} story in which Spock died, so it was going to be a story about death, and it was only a short hop, skip, and a jump to realize that it was going to be about old age and friendship," [...] Meyer said. [...] "I don't think that any of [...] scripts were about old age, friendship, and death." [...] In keeping with the theme of death and rebirth symbolized by Spock's sacrifice and the Genesis Device, Meyer wanted to call the film The Undiscovered Country, in reference to Prince Hamlet's description of death in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, but the title was changed during editing without his knowledge. Meyer disliked Wrath of Khan, but it was chosen because the preferred Vengeance of Khan conflicted with Lucasfilm's forthcoming Revenge of the Jedi (renamed Return of the Jedi late in production).|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki {{stated that}} an {{attractive}} {{aspect of the}} story of Howl's Moving Castle was the relatively positive light it shed on <b>growing</b> <b>old.</b> When Sophie becomes old {{as a result of the}} witch's spell, she also feels more able to speak her mind. According to Miyazaki, old women are only infrequently allowed to dominate the screen as in Howl's Moving Castle, which made it a risky concept. Elizabeth Parsons stated that the film disrupts the stereotype of [...] "aged unattractiveness," [...] when the artificially aged Sophie manages to rescue two attractive men (who come to love her) and to unintentionally end the war in her country. Sophie's actions are those usually associated with grandmothers, such as being kind and nurturing to those around her, and engaging in housework; however, these actions are depicted as being powerful and heroic. Sophie is one of several strong female protagonists in Miyazaki's films. According to Parsons, this gives the film a feminist aspect as well. Additionally, even though Sophie manages to make her presence in the castle legitimate by claiming to be a cleaning lady, the film goes on to show that the housework is equitably distributed, strengthening its feminist aspect.|$|E
