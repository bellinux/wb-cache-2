50|$|Fundamentally, cost {{externalization}} {{occurs when}} a company transfers some of its moral responsibilities as costs to the community directly or as degradation to the environment. For example, railroads and <b>airlines</b> <b>transfer</b> the cost of fuel, noise, and terminal infrastructure to the community. Airlines and auto manufacturers transfer the cost of degraded air quality {{to the community and}} the environment. By externalizing to the community or the environment, many true costs become lost in analysis because the true cost is non-quantifiable and neither the community nor the environment have effective advocates to recoup the damages. A major modern theme in the relationship of business to society is the society's ability (or inability) to resist this kind of externalization. In its extreme, society collapses as business realizes its profits.|$|R
