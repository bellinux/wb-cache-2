40|$|Exogenous {{application}} of pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), a ribosome-inhibiting protein {{found in the}} cell walls of Phytolacca americana (pokeweed), protects heterologous plants from viral infection. A cDNA clone for PAP was isolated and introduced into tobacco and potato plants by transformation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Transgenic plants that expressed either PAP or a double mutant derivative of PAP showed resistance to infection by different viruses. Resistance was effective against both mechanical and aphid transmission. Analysis of the vacuum infiltrate of leaves expressing PAP showed that it is enriched in the <b>intercellular</b> fluid. <b>Analysis</b> of resistance in transgenic plants suggests that PAP confers viral resistance by inhibiting an early event in infection. Previous methods for creating virus-resistant plants have been specific for a particular virus or closely related viruses. To protect plants against more than one virus, multiple genes must be introduced and expressed in a single transgenic line. Expression of PAP in transgenic plants offers the possibility of developing resistance to {{a broad spectrum of}} plant viruses by expression of a single gene...|$|R

40|$|Adjacent cells share ions, second {{messengers}} {{and small}} metabolites through intercellular channels which {{are present in}} gap junctions. This type of intercellular communication permits coordinated cellular activity, a critical feature for organ homeostasis during development and adult life of multicellular organisms. Intercellular channels an structurally more complex than other ion channels, because a complete cell-to-cell channel spans two plasma membranes and results from the association of two half channels, or connexons, contributed separately by {{each of the two}} participating cells. Each connexon, in turn, is a multimeric assembly of protein subunits. The structural proteins comprising these channels, collectively called connexins, are members of a highly related multigene family consisting of at least 13 members. Since the cloning of the first connexin in 1986, considerable {{progress has been made in}} our understanding of the complex molecular switches that control the formation and permeability of <b>intercellular</b> channels. <b>Analysis</b> of the mechanisms of channel assembly has revealed the selectivity of inter-connexin interactions and uncovered novel characteristics of the channel permeability and gating behavior. Structure/function studies have begun to provide a molecular understanding of the significance of connexin diversity and demonstrated the unique regulation of connexins by tyrosine kinases and oncogenes. Finally, mutations in two connexin genes have been linked to human diseases. The development of more specific approaches (dominant negative mutants, knockouts, transgenes) to study the functional role of connexins in organ homeostasis is providing a new perception about the significance of connexin diversity and the regulation of intercellular communication. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In most cells, Ca(2 +) {{increases}} {{in response to}} external stimulation are organized {{in the form of}} oscillations and waves that sometimes propagate from one cell to another. Numerous experimental and theoretical studies reveal that this spatiotemporal organization contains a non-negligible level of stochasticity. In this study, we extend the previous work based on a statistical analysis of experimental Ca(2 +) traces in isolated, hormone-stimulated hepatocytes and on stochastic simulations of Ca(2 +) oscillations based on the Gillespie's algorithm. Comparison of the coefficients of variation in the periods of experimental and simulated Ca(2 +) spikes provides information about the clustering and the specific subtypes of the Ca(2 +) channels. In hepatocytes coupled by gap junctions, the global perfusion with a hormone leads to successive Ca(2 +) responses, giving the appearance of an <b>intercellular</b> wave. Statistical <b>analysis</b> of experimental Ca(2 +) oscillations in coupled hepatocytes confirms that this coordinated Ca(2 +) spiking corresponds to a phase wave but suggests the existence of an additional coupling mechanism.

40|$|Gap {{junctions}} {{have traditionally}} been described as transmembrane channels that facilitate intercellular communication via the passage of small molecules. Connexins, the basic building blocks of gap junctions, are expressed in most mammalian tissues including the developing and adult central nervous system. During brain development, connexins are temporally and spatially regulated suggesting they {{play an important role}} in the proper formation of the central nervous system. In the current study, connexins 32 and 43 were overexpressed in PC 12 cells to determine whether connexins are involved in neuronal differentiation. Both connexin 32 and 43 were appropriately trafficked to the cell membrane following overexpression and resulted in the formation of functional gap junctions. Connexin overexpression was found to cause enhanced neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells treated with nerve growth factor to initiate neuritogenesis. Surprisingly, however, enhanced neurite outgrowth was found to be the consequence of functional hemichannel formation as opposed to traditional <b>intercellular</b> communication. Additional <b>analysis</b> revealed that ATP was released into the media likely through hemichannels and acted on purinergic receptors to cause enhanced neurite outgrowth. Collectively, the results of the current study suggest that connexins may {{play an important role in}} neuronal differentiation by non-traditional mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Organisms {{belonging}} to the Kingdom Fungi are known to occupy {{a wide variety of}} ecological niches and are found globally in virtually all environments. Two members of the smallest of the fungal phylum, the Zygomycota, have also been found to harbor intercellular bacteria initially described as being from or closely related to organisms from the Genus Burkholderia. In this study two microaerophilic members of the species Verticilium from the phyla Ascomycota were characterized. Both appear to carry two bacterial endosymbionts. This is the first evidence of bacterial endosymbionts found within a member of the Ascomycota. Through the use of fluorescent stains, isolation of the <b>intercellular</b> bacteria, DNA <b>analysis</b> and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) it appears that the newly isolated Verticilium sp. fungi contain not one but two bacterial endosymbionts from the family Proteobacteria. One putative symbiont is from the genus Bradyrhizobium, a member of the α-Proteobacteria, and one from the genus Burkholderia, a member of the β-Proteobacteria. This is the first evidence of a fungus containing not one, but two distinct endosymbionts from two separate bacterial families. Additionally the fungi were found to grow from spore across a large pH gradient (pH 1. 2 to pH 13. 5) and in conditions lacking given nutrient.

In a stretch-caused injury model of alveolar epithelium, transcellular ion transport function and paracellular permeability of solute transport appear to be differentially regulated. Finally, inhibition of caveolae-mediated transcytosis in lung endothelium led to disruption of paracellular routes, increasing the physical dimension and permeability of tight junctional region. These data together demonstrate the cross talk between transcellular and paracellular transport (function and routes) of lung epithelial and endothelial barriers. Mechanistic (e. g., signaling cascades) information on such cross talk remain to be determined. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Conversion of Ras {{proteins}} into an activated GTP-bound state able to bind effector proteins is catalyzed {{by specific}} guanine nucleotide exchange factors {{in response to}} a large number of extracellular stimuli. Here we report the isolation of mouse cDNAs encoding Ras-GRF 2, a multidomain 135 -kDa protein containing a COOH-terminal Cdc 25 -related domain that stimulates release of GDP from Ras but not other GTPases in vitro. Ras-GRF 2 bound specifically to immobilized Ras lacking bound nucleotides, suggesting stabilization of the nucleotide-free form of Ras as a mechanism of catalyzing nucleotide exchange. The NH 2 -terminal region of Ras-GRF 2 is predicted to contain features common to various signaling proteins including two pleckstrin homology domains and a Dbl homology region. Ras-GRF 2 also contains an IQ motif which was required for its apparent constitutive association with calmodulin in epithelial cells ectopically expressing Ras-GRF 2. Transient expression of Ras-GRF 2 in kidney epithelial cells stimulated GTP binding by Ras and potentiated calcium ionophore-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK 1) dependent upon the IQ motif. Calcium influx caused Ras-GRF 2 subcellular localization to change from cytosolic to peripheral, suggesting a possible mechanism for controlling Ras-GRF 2 interactions with Ras at the plasma membrane. Epithelial cells overexpressing Ras-GRF 2 are morphologically transformed and grow in a disorganized manner with minimal <b>intercellular</b> contacts. Northern <b>analysis</b> indicated a 9 -kb GRF 2 transcript in brain and lung, where p 135 Ras-GRF 2 is known to be expressed, and RNAs of 12 kb and 2. 2 kb were detected in several tissues. Thus, Ras-GRF 2 proteins with different domain structures may be widely expressed and couple diverse extracellular signals to Ras activation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: During both cardiac {{maturation}} and myopathy, {{elevated levels}} of circulating catecholamines coincide with alterations in impulse propagation. An in vitro model of cultured cardiomyocytes was used to {{study the effects of}} adrenergic stimulation on the conduction characteristics of immature heart cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured on preparations designed to measure conduction velocity (CV). CV was measured on the same preparation twice at t= 0 and at t= 24 h. Under control conditions (n= 7), CV at t= 0 (30. 9 +/- 1. 9 cm/s) and t= 24 (32. 4 +/- 4. 4 cm/s) was similar (p= 0. 70). Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of the gap junction proteins connexin (Cx) 40, Cx 43 and Cx 45, with Cx 43 being highly predominant. Stimulation for 24 h with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) significantly increased CV from 28. 0 +/- 2. 0 cm/s at t= 0 to 34. 8 +/- 2. 2 cm/s at t= 24 (p= 0. 002, n= 5). Microelectrode recordings showed a faster upstroke of the action potential (AP) of ISO-treated cells. Reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) showed that ISO increased expression of SCN 5 A and alpha(1 c) (alpha-subunit of the cardiac sodium and L-type calcium channel, respectively). Stimulation of cells with ISO did not induce alterations in distribution or expression of Cx 40, Cx 43 and Cx 45 (both mRNA and protein), but slightly increased the phosphorylation of Cx 43. Stimulation for 24 h with the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine did neither affect CV nor the expression of the connexin isoforms, SCN 5 A and alpha(1 c). CONCLUSIONS: Alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation differently affect propagation of the electric impulse, which is primarily not caused by a differential effect on <b>intercellular</b> coupling. RT-PCR <b>analysis</b> and an enhanced AP upstroke velocity indicate a higher functional expression level of alpha(1 c) and SCN 5 A in beta-adrenergic stimulated cells, which may explain the observed increase in C...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: Tumores do córtex da supra-renal (TCSR) em crianças são raros e correspondem a 0, 2 % dos tumores da infância. Estes tumores são endocrinologicamente ativos, causando na maioria das vezes, virilização do paciente associada, ou não, a um aumento de cortisol. O tratamento dos TCSR é {{principal}}mente cirúrgico, sendo a cirurgia com o procedimento de ressecção completa do tumor e sem ruptura {{a principal}} modalidade terapêutica. No entanto, a distinção entre tumores benignos e malignos, baseada exclusivamente na histologia, pode ser difícil de ser realizada. Os fatores prognósticos são baseados quase exclusivamente no estadiamento da doença, o qual leva em conta o peso e volume tumoral e a disseminação metastática do tumor. Estudos clínicos e experimentais sugerem que a propagação metastática em alguns tumores está relacionada aos níveis de E-caderina e ?-catenina, que são moléculas presentes no tecido epitelial normal, estando envolvidas diretamente na adesão intercelular. A análise da expressão destas moléculas pode fornecer dados que permite identificar grupos de pacientes mais propensos à evolução tumoral desfavorável, proporcionando, assim, um tratamento mais adequado e individualizado a estes pacientes. Com o objetivo de analisar a expressão da E-caderina e ?-catenina em crianças com TCSR e sua correlação com a evolução da doença, foi realizada uma revisão retrospectiva dos prontuários de 33 crianças com diagnóstico de TCSR tratadas no Centro Infantil Boldrini (Janeiro de 1998 a Janeiro de 2005). Foram coletados e analisados dados referentes ao sexo, idade, manifestações clínicas, estadiamento, tratamento e evolução dos pacientes. Para a análise imunoistoquímica, foi empregada a técnica de multitissue array com anticorpos específicos para E-caderina e ?-catenina em 30 tumores de crianças com TCSR e uma adrenal normal. Houve predominância do sexo feminino na amostra e a apresentação clínica mais freqüente foi a virilização. Nesta série, observou-se que crianças com idade inferior a dois anos apresentaram melhor prognóstico e, também que a ruptura e recidiva tumoral apresentaram influência negativa na sobrevida dos pacientes. A análise imunoistoquímica mostrou expressão da E-caderina em 73, 3 % e ?-catenina em 83, 3 % das crianças que apresentavam TCSR. Além disso, não foi verificada sua expressão na glândula adrenal normal. Quando avaliada a relação da expressão da E-caderina e ?-catenina com os estádios evolutivos da doença, não foi verificada associação significativa entre as variáveis. A positividade da E-caderina e ?-catenina na membrana celular, citoplasma ou núcleo, verificou-se que a expressão na membrana celular mostrou associação significativa com mau prognóstico;;Abstract:Adrenal cortical tumor (ACT) in children are rare and they correspond to 0, 2 % of the {{tumors of the}} childhood. They are usually active, causing mainly virilization of patient associate or not with increased levels of corticoids. The treatment of the TCSR is mainly surgical, being the surgery with complete resection of the tumor without spillage the therapeutic mainstay. The distinction between benign and malignant tumors based exclusively on the histology can be difficult and very often uncertain. The prognostic factors are based almost exclusively on the staging of the disease, who {{takes into account the}} weight and volume tumoral and the metastatic dissemination. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that metastatic dissemination in some tumors is related with the levels of E-cadherin and ?-catenin. These molecules are found in the normal epithelial tissues and are strongly related with <b>intercellular</b> adhesion. The <b>analysis</b> of the expression of these molecules maybe can allow identifying groups of patients with higher risk of presenting unfavorable outcomes and ensuing appropriate and individualized treatment. With the objective of analyzing the expression of E-cadherin and ?-catenin in children with ACT and its correlation with the evolution of the disease, a retrospective chart review of 33 children with diagnosis of ACT treated at Centro Infantil Boldrini (January of 1998 through January of 2005). Data regarding sex, age, clinical presentation, staging, treatment and outcome were collected and analyzed. Multitissue array technique using specific antibodies for E-cadherin and ?-catenin was done in 30 tumors from children with ACT and 1 normal adrenal tissue. There was predominance of the feminine sex and the most frequent clinical presentation was virilization. In these series children with age bellow two years had a better outcome and tumoral spillage and relapse have had negative influence in the survival of the patients. Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of E-cadherin in 73, 3 % and ?-catenin in 83, 3 % of the children who had ACT but showed no expression in the normal adrenal tissue. When the relationship between the expression of E-cadherin and ?-catenin with the stages of the disease was analyzed, no significant association was found. When analyzed the expression of E-cadherin and ?-catenin in the cellular membrane, cytoplasm or nucleus, its presence in the membrane of the cell was found as associated with poor outcome. As far we know, this is the first study to evaluate the expression of E-cadherin and ?-catenin in children with ACT and, although with small number of patients due to the rarity of the disease, it apparently shows some relationship with prognosis.
