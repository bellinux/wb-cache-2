40|$|Aims To date, {{there is}} no convincing {{evidence}} that non-insulin treated patients who undertake self-blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) have better glycaemic control than those who test their urine. This {{has led to a}} recommendation that non-insulin <b>dependent</b> patients <b>undertake</b> urine testing, which is the cheaper option. This recommendation does not take account of patients' experiences and views. This study explores the respective merits of urine testing and SBGM from the perspectives of newly diagnosed patients with Type 2 diabetes. Methods Qualitative study using repeat in-depth interviews with 40 patients. Patients were interviewed three times at 6 -monthly intervals over 1 year. Patients were recruited from hospital clinics and general practices in Lothian, Scotland. The study was informed by grounded theory, which involves concurrent data collection and analysis. Results Patients reported strongly negative views of urine testing, particularly when they compared it with SBGM. Patients perceived urine testing as less convenient, less hygienic and less accurate than SBGM. Most patients assumed that blood glucose meters were given to those with a more advanced or serious form of diabetes. This could have implications for how they thought about their own disease. Patients often interpreted negative urine results as indicating that they could not have diabetes. Conclusions Professionals {{should be aware of the}} meanings and understandings patients attach to the receipt and use of different types of self-monitoring equipment.

Basic approach To examine how changes in muscle activation contribute to joint stiffness we: (a) built a simple model of the musculoskeletal system, (b) held the activation of the muscle constant at different levels, (c) applied perturbations and, (d) observed what effect the different levels of muscle activation had on the induced kinematics. Specification of the model The examined system is a single segment with a revolute joint controlled by a single lumped muscle (Supplemental Figure 1). The single joint- which is made to emulate the elbow joint in the related experiments- is simulated as a rigid segment with an inertia of I = 0. 07 kilograms·metres 2, {{similar to that of}} the human forearm and hand taken together [8]. The dynamics for the single joint are thus given by the equation: θ ̈ = τ(t) I (1) where, θ̈, is the angular acceleration of the joint and, τ(t), is the total torque applied at the joint at time, t. The total torque, τ(t), is net of the three 1 Figure 1 : A schematic of the system used for the simulations described in this document.

The aim of these studies was {{to gain a better}} understanding of the behavior of polar molecules under the influence of substrates with different surface geometry. Volumetric adsorption isotherms were used to determine the adsorption areas of the substrate, the molecular areas of the adsorbate and some thermodynamic quantities of the adsorbed system such as the isosteric heat of adsorption and the 2 D compressibility. In addition, layering transitions and the wetting behavior near the triple point were investigated for CH 3 Cl on MgO and BN and for CH 3 Br and CH 3 I on MgO.

40|$|Fibroblast {{senescence}} {{is associated}} with a loss of proliferative potential and an alteration in extracellular gene expression. Because the expression of extracellular gene products are frequently growth state <b>dependent,</b> we <b>undertook</b> a comparative study of the regulation of the components of the plasminogen activation system in young and senescent cells under controlled conditions of growth. Young and senescent cells were compared in quiescent and activated growth conditions for the secretion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 2 (PAI- 2). Whereas young ceils showed decreased levels of PAI- 1 in the secreted and extracellular matrix pools upon serum deprivation, senescent cells showed a more constitutive pattern of gene expression, with no noticeable decrease of the levels in a low concentration of serum. RNA analysis revealed that senescent lung and skin cells, independent of the growth state, constitutively express levels of u-PA and PAI- 1 comparable to the expression levels in young mitotically growing cells. These expression levels are down-regulated in quiescent young cells. In contrast, both t-PA and PAI- 2 were markedly overexpressed in senescent skin lung cells under all growth conditions. Total plasminogen activator activity in conditioned medium was 50 -fold higher in senescent-cell medium compared to young when cultured in 0. 5 % fetal calf serum (FCS) for five days, with the majority of the activity co-migrating on zymograms with u-PA. Increases in PAI- 1 was also observed in senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In summary, cells of various types display alterations in plasminogen activator activity during replicative senescence. The inappropriate over-expression of plasminogen activator activity in vivo may be expected to lead to a progressive disruption of extracellular matrix maintenance. Thus, our observations suggest that cellular replicative senescence {{is associated with}} an altered expression of several genes regulating tissue maintenance which, in turn, could lead to degenerative changes in tissue in age-related disease(s) ...|$|R

40|$|Problem: The {{association}} between personality and traffic accident involvement {{has been extensively}} researched, but the literature is difficult to summarize, because different personality instruments and statistics have been used, and effect sizes differ strongly between studies. Method: A meta-analysis of studies which had used measures of personality which could be converted into Big Five dimensions, and traffic accidents as the <b>dependent</b> variable, was <b>undertaken.</b> Analysis: Outlier values were identified and removed. Also, analyses on effects of common method variance, type of instrument, dissemination bias and restriction of variance were undertaken. Results: Outlier problems exist in these data, which prohibit any certainty in the conclusions. Each of the 5 personality dimensions were predictors of accident involvement, but the effects were small (r<. 1), which is much weaker than in a previous meta-analysis. Effect sizes were dependent upon variance in the accident variable, and the true (population) effects could therefore be larger than the present estimates, something which could be ascertained by new studies using high-risk samples over longer time periods. Newer studies and those using Big Five instruments tended to have smaller effects. No effects of common method variance could be found. Conclusions: Tests of personality are weak predictors of traffic accident involvement, compared to other variables, such as previous accidents. Research into whether larger effects of personality can be found with methods other than self-reports is needed...|$|R
40|$|In plants, {{structural}} and physiological evidence has suggested {{the presence of}} biologically active natriuretic peptides (PNPs). PNPs are secreted into the apoplast, are systemically mobile and elicit a range of responses signaling via cGMP. The PNP-dependent responses include tissue specific modifications of cation transport and changes in stomatal conductance and the photosynthetic rate. PNP also has {{a critical role in}} host defense responses. Surprisingly, PNP-homologs are produced by several plant pathogens during host colonization suppressing host defense responses. Here we show that a synthetic peptide representing the biologically active fragment of the Arabidopsis thaliana PNP (AtPNP-A) induces the production of reactive oxygen species in suspension-cultured A. thaliana (Col- 0) cells. To identify proteins whose expression changes in an AtPNP-A <b>dependent</b> manner, we <b>undertook</b> a quantitative proteomic approach, employing tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, to reveal temporal responses of suspension-cultured cells to 1 nM and 10 pM PNP at two different time-points post-treatment. Both concentrations yield a distinct differential proteome signature. Since only the higher (1 nM) concentration induces a ROS response, we conclude that the proteome response at the lower concentration reflects a ROS independent response. Furthermore, treatment with 1 nM PNP results in an over-representation of the gene ontology (GO) terms “oxidation-reduction process,” “translation” and “response to salt stress” and this is consistent with a role of AtPNP-A in the adaptation to environmental stress conditions...|$|R

It has been noticed, for instance, that Bacon strikes and impresses us, not merely by the substantial merit of what he achieved, but still more by a certain greatness of scheme and conception. This quality is not a mere idle decoration. It is not a theatrical artifice of mask or buskin, to impose upon us unreal impressions of height and dignity. The added greatness is real. Height of aim and nobility of expression are true forces. They grow to be an obligation upon us. A lofty sense of personal worth {{is one of the}} surest elements of greatness. That the lion should love to masquerade in the ass's skin is not modesty and reserve, but imbecility and degradation. And that England should wrap herself in the robe of small causes and mean reasons is the more deplorable, because there is no nation in the world the substantial elements of whose power are so majestic and imperial as our own. Our language is the most widely spoken of all tongues, its literature is second to none in variety and power. Our people, whether English or American, have long ago superseded the barbarous device of dictator and Caesar by the manly arts of self-government.

MethodsFor epitope mapping, the binding motif of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (I-Aq) from DBA/ 1 mice was identified from the amino acid sequence of T cell epitopes and candidate peptides of T cell epitopes in GPI-induced arthritis were synthesised. Human GPI-primed CD 4 + T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were co-cultured with each synthetic peptide and the cytokine production was measured by ELISA to identify the major epitopes. Synthetic peptides were immunised in DBA/ 1 mice to investigate whether arthritis could be induced by peptides. After immunisation with the major epitope, anti-interleukin (IL) 17 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was injected to monitor arthritis score. To investigate the mechanisms of arthritis induced by a major epitope, cross-reactivity to mouse GPI peptide was analysed by flow cytometry and anti-GPI antibodies were measured by ELISA. Deposition of anti-GPI antibodies on the cartilage surface was detected by immunohistology. ResultsWe selected 32 types of peptides as core sequences from the human GPI 558 amino acid sequence, which binds the binding motif, and synthesised 25 kinds of 20 -mer peptides for screening, each containing the core sequence at its centre. By epitope mapping, human GPI 325 – 339 was found to induce interferon (IFN) γ and IL- 17 production most prominently. Immunisation with human GPI 325 – 339 could induce polyarthritis similar to arthritis induced by human GPI protein, and administration of anti-IL- 17 mAb significantly ameliorated arthritis (p < 0. 01). Th 17 cells primed with human GPI 325 – 339 cross-reacted with mouse GPI 325 – 339, and led B cells to produce anti-mouse GPI antibodies, which were deposited on cartilage surface. ConclusionsHuman GPI 325 – 339 {{was identified as a}} major epitope in GPI-induced arthritis, and proved to have the potential to induce polyarthritis.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the associations between health awareness, health behaviour, subjective health status, and satisfaction {{of students with}} their educational experience as independent variables and three outcomes of educational achievement as <b>dependent</b> variables. We <b>undertook</b> two simultaneous cross-sectional surveys among students from one University in the UK during 2008 − 2009. The first survey was a general health survey; the second survey measured students’ satisfaction with different aspects of their learning and teaching experience. Students’ registration numbers linked the responses of both questionnaires together, and subsequently linked the questionnaires to the university database to import the grades that students actually achieved in their studies. Generally, on average, students (N = 380) exhibited medium to high satisfaction with their educational experiences. In the multivariate regression analyses, students’ satisfaction with their educational experiences {{was not associated with}} any of the three indicators of educational achievement (actual module mark; perceived own performance; importance of achieving good grades). The associations of educational satisfaction, health, health behaviours, heath complaints and financial parameters with the three outcomes of educational achievement did not differ between male and female students. Each of the health, health behaviours, health complaints and financial parameters were selectively associated with only some but not all three indicators of student educational achievement. We conclude that the findings support a conceptual framework suggesting reciprocal relationships between health, health behaviour and educational achievement.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Technology {{dependent}} children {{such as those}} who require a feeding tube, tracheotomy or ventilator are a special group of chronically ill children who require complex care on a daily basis. When these children are hospitalized, the accompanying parent and the nurse caring for the child on the inpatient unit must communicate together about {{the care of the}} child. Care for the technology dependent child is optimized when parents and nurses both understand the plan of care for the child. To discover the process of parent-nurse communication that results in mutual understanding of the child’s plan of care, a grounded theory study to explore the perspectives of the parents of previously hospitalized technology <b>dependent</b> children was <b>undertaken.</b> The Theory of Shared Communication emerged from the data and illuminates the parent-nurse communication process. The antecedents of the process are respect for own and others expertise. The communication process consists of six communication behaviors; ask, listen, explain, advocate, verify understanding and negotiate roles. The behaviors are nested within each other and all are not necessarily required for the non-linear process to result in the relational outcome of mutual understanding of the child’s plan of care. An integrative review of the literature regarding the process of communication between parents of hospitalized chronically ill children and their nurses shed light on the components of the process, but no study was found that explicated the entire communication process.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of a Confucian Welfare Regime upon lone mothers in Taiwan, where the family is {{promoted}} as the major welfare provider for individuals. Since the 1980 s, politicians and welfare scholars [...] whether New Right or Third-Way [...] in the West, particularly in the UK, have been very keen to draw lessons from the Confucian Welfare Model in East Asia. The characteristics of this welfare regime are categorised as "conservative corporatism without Western-style worker participation, solidarity without equality, laissez-faire without libertarianism, far too much social control but too little citizenship, far too little state intervention in welfare provision but too much familial welfare responsibilities"(e. g., Jones 1993). The Confucian Welfare State is in fact much deeply familialised, and the family is "the super-major welfare provider" compared to Western welfare states. This thesis will examine the Confucian Welfare Regime from the point of views of gender, and will argue that its distinctive fractures cannot be understood within existing Western comparative typologies and have not been adequately analysed in East Asian studies. How do lone mothers meet their needs within this deeply familialised welfare regime in comparison with lone fathers? In search of an answer, a qualitative approach, a feminist perspective and an East Asian standpoint were employed to conduct this study in the form of semi-structured interviews in the Taiwanese Confucian social context. The participants included 30 lone mothers and 10 lone fathers with unmarried <b>dependent</b> children <b>undertaking</b> full-time education. The situation of lone parents in combining unpaid care work: and paid work makes them a strong case for understanding the gendering of welfare regimes in the West and in East Asia. Thus the Mother-Worker-Family-Outsider Welfare Regime is created on the basis of women's' status as lifetime family outsiders in the Taiwanese social context. An understanding of this specific Confucian cultural arena is essential if we are to appreciate the situation of lone mothers-and its difference from that of lone fathers-in Taiwan. The main findings of this study confirm that the deeply familialised welfare provision affects women and men differently under the Generation-Age-Gender hierarchy of the Confucian family. The family, as the main welfare provider, {{is more likely to be}} effective for lone fathers, who are provided with more accessible childcare, childrearing, housework services, housing, financial investment and resources. They also benefit more from this familial provision to support their continuous employment experience, better career prospects and better entitlement to employment protection. But, in contrast, for the lone mothers in this study, the Confucian family is more likely to be the centre of care responsibilities for young and old, the heart of endless unpaid housework, the battlefield of domestic confrontations and sexual harassment, and the alter of sacrifice of individual well-being. The failure of the family in welfare provision also worsens the situation of lone mothers in- the labour market in terms of interrupted career, -low, wages, lower position in 'occupational hierarchy, more dead-end jobs, and more part-time work, and no or less employment protection. As a consequence of these inequalities the solutions for lone mothers are very different from those for lone fathers in this study. Thus, lone father see the reconstitution of the family via remarriage as their best solution. The retreat from marriage and the family is preferred by most lone mothers, who maintain their current status permanently. And the strategies of improving their human capital via more advanced education, establishing self-employed small business and undertaking extra part-time jobs with full-time work are adopted in order to combine mothering and rice-winning. These disadvantages experienced by lone mothers, seldom by lone fathers, have to be taken seriously into account in response to lone mothers' hopes of being equal and permanent lone parents, fully protected workers and full individual citizens. Therefore, the Mother-Worker-Family-Outsider Welfare Model needs to be transformed into the Parent-Worker-Full-Individual-Citizen Welfare Model based on the notion of "full individual citizens as parents and workers" instead of "family outsiders as selectively protected workers and non-recognised parents", by shifting welfare responsibilities from the family and the market onto the State...|$|R
40|$|Summary This report {{presents}} a narrative literature review of treatments available to pregnant {{women who have}} alcohol use disorders and findings from interviews with key stakeholders regarding current treatment practices and areas requiring improvement. Societal norms on alcohol use are contradictory and conflicting. Whilst {{for the most part}} widely available and accepted, alcohol consumption is regarded with disapproval and shame during pregnancy. This contradiction and associated stigma places unnecessary guilt on women and is in the large part responsible for women’s lack of disclosure of drinking during pregnancy. Such is the stigma and guilt associated with alcohol use during pregnancy that only a minority of pregnant women with alcohol use disorders access treatment. There are also large barriers to treatment that include the fear of losing custody of children and practical barriers associated with the availability of services, access, transport, and childcare. In addition {{women are more likely to}} attribute their problems to mental health issues rather than alcohol use and seek treatment through mental health services or primary care. Often these women are not referred to specialist drug and alcohol (D&A) services. Clinicians interviewed as part of this research reported there are areas where multidisciplinary teams are established and work well but it is clear that services for the treatment of substance use in pregnancy are sparse and, where available, are mainly located in metropolitan areas. Unfortunately there is limited research on effective treatments available for pregnant women with alcohol use disorders. Trials focussing on at risk women have reported reduced alcohol consumption but treatment trials of pregnant women with alcohol use disorders are lacking. The evidence for the safety and effectiveness of pharmacological treatments is also limited. Although pregnant women are difficult to recruit into these studies, methodologically rigorous research into psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for this population is required. This research reports on information gathered from 11 semi-structured qualitative interviews with clinicians that treat pregnant women with problematic alcohol use provided expert clinical advice on current treatment practices and the gold standard for treatment and factors that impinge on this approach. The clinician interviews supported evidence from the literature review reflecting that whilst the prevalence of alcohol use disorders in the population is higher than disorders related to illicit drugs the reverse is noted in specialist treatment services; problematic alcohol use in pregnant women is rarely seen. The interviews with the key stakeholders highlight that despite work aimed at improving the detection of alcohol use, screening and referral rates remain low. Treatments need to be supportive, multidisciplinary and accommodate the woman and her children. A gold standard approach to treatment should incorporate community education about the chronic and relapsing nature of addiction. Overall, the evidence from the literature review and the expertise of the clinicians as part of research undertaken for this report suggests that there has been little progress in the treatment and recruitment of alcohol dependent pregnant women into treatment in the last decade. This report puts forward the gold standards for the treatment of alcohol dependence in pregnancy. These standards should incorporate the following principles:That standardised screening is undertaken of all pregnant women on their alcohol use. This screening should be undertaken by health professionals that see pregnant women and should accompanied by the provision of education, brief intervention, and continued monitoring where appropriate. That all pregnant women who screen positively for alcohol-use disorders should be offered access to treatment and that this treatment should be matched to the severity of the disorder being experienced by the woman. Treatment should include inpatient admission for detoxification if necessary. That all pregnant women who are alcohol dependent should be offered extended hospitalisation post-delivery and birth with help and support. The woman should also be offered assertive follow-up of the mother and child through the child’s formative years. This follow-up should assist to the woman in areas of healthcare, social services, housing and parenting support.
