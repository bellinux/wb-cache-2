5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is <b>fermentation,</b> wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced <b>fermentation</b> products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). <b>Fermentation</b> is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fermentation</b> is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary <b>fermentation,</b> the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary <b>fermentation.</b> Secondary <b>fermentation</b> is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of stuck and sluggish wine <b>fermentations</b> is a persisting {{problem in the}} wine industry worldwide. This study illustrates the suitability of headspace solid-phase dynamic extraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPDE GC-MS) for wine analysis and the subsequent application to discriminate between control and problem <b>fermentations</b> using partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models. The specific analytical technique is relatively new and has not yet to the authors' knowledge been evaluated {{for the analysis of}} wine within this context of problem <b>fermentations.</b> HS-SPDE GC-MS was used to determine 68 volatile compounds (higher alcohols, fatty acids, esters, and carbonyl compounds) in 94 monovarietal fermenting must samples consisting of 56 red and 38 white cultivars. PLS-DA models showed the potential to discriminate between control and problem <b>fermentations</b> using corrected peak area headspace data for the 68 analytes. This possibility to discriminate between problem and control <b>fermentations</b> with only the headspace data could possibly be applied for the prediction of problem <b>fermentations</b> in future studies and to better understand the chemical causes of problem <b>fermentations.</b> © 2009 American Chemical Society.

5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During <b>fermentation,</b> the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during <b>fermentation.</b> Once <b>fermentation</b> is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{can live}} {{on a wide variety}} of {{substrates}} and uses mixed-acid <b>fermentation</b> in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and carbon dioxide.

5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a <b>fermentation</b> process.

40|$|It is {{the focus}} of this study to examine the {{feasibility}} of using hydrocarbon oils as the sole source of carbon for the production of citric acid and biomass. Initial lab experiments were conducted using 1875 ml batch flask <b>fermentations</b> to determine the yeast strain of Candida lipolytica and hydrocarbon feedstock of choice. The two yeast strains investigated were Candida lipolytica NRRL-Y- 1094 and Candida lipolytica NRRL-Y- 1095. The two feedstocks evaluated were kerosene (Kero 1 -K) and n-paraffin solvent (Norpar 15), both obtained from Imperial Oil Ltd. To determine the optimum level of initial biomass concentration, n-paraffin concentration, iron concentration and temperature for the production of citric acid, a central composite design was developed using 200 ml batch flask <b>fermentations.</b> The design involved conducting 31 batch flask <b>fermentations</b> under various combinations of high and low values of these four parameters. These optimum levels of the above operating parameters were implemented in larger scale (7 litre) <b>fermentations.</b> These <b>fermentations</b> were conducted in a 14 L Chemap fermentor. The <b>fermentations</b> investigated the effects of aeration, agitation (mechanical agitation from the fermentor and an external agitator), and batch versus fed-batch systems on biomass and citric acid production.

40|$|Synthesis gas {{is readily}} {{obtained}} by gasifying coal, oil, biomass, or waste organics and represents an abundant, potentially inexpensive, feedstock for bioprocessing. The primary components of synthesis gas, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, {{can be converted}} into methane, organic acids, and alcohols via anaerobic <b>fermentations.</b> Bioconversion of synthesis gas is an attractive alternative to catalytic processing because the biological catalysts are highly specific and often more tolerant of sulfur contaminants than inorganic catalysts. However, because the aqueous solubilities of carbon monoxide and hydrogen are low, synthesis-gas <b>fermentations</b> are typically limited by the rate of gas-to-liquid mass transfer. Consequently, a major engineering challenge in commercial development of synthesis-gas <b>fermentations</b> is to provide sufficient gas mass transfer in an energy-efficient manner. This paper reviews recent progress {{in the development of}} synthesis-gas <b>fermentations,</b> with emphasis on efforts to increase the efficiency of gas mass transfer. Metabolic properties of several microbes able to ferment synthesis gas are described. Results of synthesis-gas <b>fermentations</b> conducted in various bioreactor configurations are summarized.

5|$|These {{processes}} {{are also important}} in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are {{largely responsible for the}} production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use <b>fermentation</b> to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste.

5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary <b>fermentation,</b> or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential.

Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E
40|$|During the {{transformation}} of grapes to wine, wine <b>fermentations</b> are exposed to a large area of specialized equipment surfaces within wineries, which may serve as important reservoirs for two-way transfer of microbes between <b>fermentations.</b> However, the role of winery environments in shaping the microbiota of wine <b>fermentations</b> and vectoring wine spoilage organisms is poorly understood at the systems level. Microbial communities inhabiting all major equipment and surfaces in a pilot-scale winery were surveyed {{over the course of}} a single harvest to track the appearance of equipment microbiota before, during, and after grape harvest. Results demonstrate that under normal cleaning conditions winery surfaces harbor seasonally fluctuating populations of bacteria and fungi. Surface microbial communities were dependent on the production context at each site, shaped by technological practices, processing stage, and season. During harvest, grape- and fermentation-associated organisms populated most winery surfaces, acting as potential reservoirs for microbial transfer between <b>fermentations.</b> These surfaces harbored large populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other yeasts prior to harvest, potentially serving as an important vector of these yeasts in wine <b>fermentations.</b> However, the majority of the surface communities before and after harvest comprised organisms with no known link to wine <b>fermentations</b> and a near-absence of spoilage-related organisms, suggesting that winery surfaces do not overtly vector wine spoilage microbes under normal operating conditions...|$|R

Associations between Escherichia coli O 157 prevalence and feeding of DG were investigated in feedlot cattle (n = 379) given one of three diets: steam-flaked corn (SFC) and 15 % corn silage with 0 or 25 % dried distillers’ grains (DDG) or SFC with 5 % corn silage and 25 % DDG. Ten fecal samples were collected from each pen weekly for 12 weeks to isolate E. coli O 157.
