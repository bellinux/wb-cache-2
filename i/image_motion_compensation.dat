Little was known about Neptune's characteristics because of its great distance from the sun; and its reduced light levels required longer exposure time. Thus, {{it was necessary to}} reduce the spacecraft limit cycle; this was made more difficult by the trajectory selected, which caused high spacecraft-to-target rates (these rates dictated the use of <b>image</b> <b>motion</b> <b>compensation).</b> Another challenge faced by Voyager 2 was the need to perform all the required <b>image</b> <b>motion</b> <b>compensation</b> with a limited quantity of attitude control computer and command computer memory, together with a limited quantity of tape recorder resources.

In this paper, we propose an efficient lossless compression method for 4 D medical images that is based on a multi-frame <b>motion</b> <b>compensation</b> process employing a 4 D search, variable blocksizes and bi-directional prediction.
