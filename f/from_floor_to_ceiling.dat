5|$|The {{original}} hotel tower had 680 rooms, {{and each}} featured {{a room with}} one wall which was fully mirrored <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The hotel featured an 800-seat theatre restaurant and three public dining areas, two health clubs, an epicurean room, a convention hall of up to 2000 people and 20 separate halls and committee rooms, accommodating up to 5000 people in total. Marble was imported from Italy, rosewood from Brazil, with gold leafing throughout the place.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Chola frescoes were {{discovered}} within the circumambulatory corridor of the Brihadisvara Temple, by S.K.Govindasamy, {{a professor at}} the Annamalai University. These are the first Chola paintings discovered. The passage of the corridor is dark and the walls on either side are covered with two layers of paintings <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
50|$|In June 2010, O’Dowd {{successfully}} completed a three-year, $9 million comprehensive fundraising campaign and funds raised were split about evenly between capital development and program enhancement. Funds contributed to renovation of many {{elements of the}} classroom buildings — <b>from</b> <b>floors</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceilings,</b> interior and exterior, every classroom, lab and locker, from ventilation to technology infrastructure.|$|R

25|$|The spatial diagram {{created by}} TtEias (1979) {{is very similar}} to the sense of space and {{movement}} created in her earlier Tecelares series woodprints. Like Tecelares, the lines of TtEias (1979)are made with simple materials, include geometric shapes, and create movement through the intersection of lines and the creation of space. So too, there is a human element in the use of materials and the production of the work, in which each thread is pulled taut <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> by hand.|$|E
25|$|A Casa de Jantar da Rainha (Queen's Dining Room), {{a private}} {{dining room was}} never planned in the 1802 design of the Palace, but by 1880 {{there was a need}} for a {{communal}} space. The final room was decorated in red silk and rich wood grain trim <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> with a wood fireplace/stove on one wall (surmounted by a large mirror), while the opposite wall provides an entrance to adjacent Billiard Room. The floor is cover in inlaid parquet floor with a bronze lustre.|$|E
25|$|The City of San Mateo {{operates}} three libraries {{within the}} city. The Main Library, the Hillsdale Library, and the Marina Library {{are all part}} of the Peninsula Library System. The Main Library located near Central Park in downtown opened in 2006 after residents passed a $30 million bond measure. Upon opening, the three story 93,000 square foot building earned numerous design awards and was LEED certified NC Gold. Windows <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> provide abundant natural light inside. It is modeled after a retail bookstore and is technologically advanced.|$|E
50|$|Several statues {{surround}} the main temple building and a giant, colourful t'aenghwa (scroll painting) hangs behind the main image, depicting a Buddhist pantheon. The main image deified {{on a wooden}} altar is very tall, covering the entire height <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling.</b> There is also {{a portrait of the}} guardian general of Buddhism, Wit'a on one of the side walls, which is akin to 16th century portraits found in China.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{concert hall}} in its namesake county, Sangamon Auditorium's seating {{capacity}} {{is divided into}} three levels; the main level contains a 66-seat orchestra pit, 425 orchestra seats, and 595 loge seats, while the mezzanine contains 564 seats and the balcony, 368 seats. It contains a 47.5-by-60-foot stage rising 30 feet high <b>from</b> stage <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The auditorium contains four backstage dressing rooms. Concession facilities include a bar, the Capitol Perks espresso bar, and a main concession stand.|$|R
50|$|Nymphaea were {{important}} in the architectural movement of mosaic <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> walls and <b>ceiling</b> vaults in the 1st century. Initially they were often decorated with geometrical mosaics often incorporating shells, {{but by the end}} of the century could contain ambitious figure subjects.|$|R
25|$|Circles and squares {{form the}} unifying theme of the {{interior}} design. The checkerboard floor pattern contrasts with the concentric circles of square coffers in the dome. Each zone of the interior, <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> is subdivided according to a different scheme. As a result, the interior decorative zones do not line up. The overall effect is immediate viewer orientation according to the major axis of the building, even though the cylindrical space topped by a hemispherical dome is inherently ambiguous. This discordance {{has not always been}} appreciated, and the attic level was redone according to Neoclassical taste in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{interventions}} {{within the}} buildings allow constant interaction between patrons {{and the outer}} environment. <b>From</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> expansive windows in the pool area to the spiraling staircase with windows opening into the park, the building offers patrons different perspectives of environment outside. Regardless of the season, athletes can enjoy physical recreation and the outdoor environment. The building’s main façade is cloaked in a single concrete matrix of different aggregates used to form the mixture of surfaces within each section. Tucked between the concrete matrix are multicolored glass tiles reminiscent of the glimmering colors of water. These apertures, which are sprinkled along the building’s façade, cast varying shadows on the interior.|$|E
25|$|Of all of Pape's works, TtEias (1979) {{is perhaps}} most emblematic of her artistic process. The TtEias was first {{conceived}} in 1979, {{but it was not}} until the 1990s that it was produced in full scale. The artwork consists of nine semi-transparent prisms, which were created using gold thread. A square platform drilled with nails serves as the base of each prism. The gold thread is then wrapped around each protruding nail, <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> to create the prism. Light is shined onto the prisms at various angles, emphasizing the metallic sheen of the thread. The exhibition space is otherwise dark, giving the allusion that the prisms continue infinitely upwards.|$|E
50|$|World Conferences of {{the church}} are held every {{three years in the}} World Conference chamber, a large hall which seats nearly 6,000. The Conference chamber is 214 x 168 feet and it is 92 ft <b>from</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the dome's interior. The {{exterior}} of the dome rises 114 ft above street level. The original plan for the Auditorium included two balconies, but due to limited finances only one was built. In retrospect, two balconies might have affected the fine acoustics of the Auditorium.|$|R
60|$|On returning, Yellow Elk at once {{set to work}} to rig up {{an upright}} pole <b>from</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling</b> of the cave, using a heavy tree branch for the purpose. The upright was placed close to where {{the smoke from the}} fire found a vent through several large cracks in the ceiling, and the boomer watched these {{proceedings}} with much alarm.|$|R
50|$|The suites {{are famous}} for their Mannerist frescoes. The iconograhic program of frescoes expressing {{the glory of the}} Farnese was worked out by the humanists in Farnese's court, notably his secretary, Annibale Caro; The fresco cycles portray the {{exploits}} of Alexander the Great, and of course of the Farnese themselves: in the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani (the Room of Farnese Deeds), decorated by the brothers Taddeo and Federico Zuccari, the Farnese are depicted at all their most glorious moments, <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> coffered <b>ceiling.</b> Other artists employed in fresco decoration include Giacomo Zanguidi (il Bertoia), Raffaellino da Reggio, Antonio Tempesta, Giacomo del Duca, and Giovanni De Vecchi.|$|R
25|$|The {{ground floor}} {{consists}} of one open space with access {{provided by a}} series of recent aluminium-framed doors with fixed glass panels in between. Stairs lead up to the first floor {{at each end of the}} building. These stairs incorporate heavy timber treads and fine steel sections, which run vertically <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> and act as a screen and a support for the balustrade. The end of one of the staircases is expressed to form a decorative zigzag pattern. The first floor ceiling lining follows the zigzag line of the roof, exposing the steel roof structure. This floor contains the original steel framed hopper windows and fixed glass panels along the south wall. The flooring is of mixed hardwood. An elevated link joins this building to the neighbouring Commerce Building and Meat Hall.|$|E
500|$|In March 1904 {{a three-day}} festival of Elgar's works was {{presented}} at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, [...] "Four {{or five years ago}} if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his mind." [...] The king and queen attended the first concert, at which Richter conducted The Dream of Gerontius, and returned the next evening for the second, the London premiere of The Apostles (first heard the previous year at the Birmingham Festival). The final concert of the festival, conducted by Elgar, was primarily orchestral, apart for an excerpt from Caractacus and the complete Sea Pictures (sung by Clara Butt). The orchestral items were Froissart, the Enigma Variations, Cockaigne, the first two (at that time the only two) Pomp and Circumstance marches, and the premiere of a new orchestral work, In the South, inspired by a holiday in Italy.|$|E
500|$|Inside the house, the Palladian form {{reaches a}} height and {{grandeur}} seldom seen {{in any other}} house in England. It has, in fact, been described as [...] "The finest Palladian interior in England." [...] The grandeur of the interior is obtained with an absence of excessive ornament, and reflects Kent's career-long taste for [...] "the eloquence of a plain surface". Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster reredos. The house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief building fabric is in fact pink Derbyshire alabaster), modelled by Kent on a Roman basilica. The room is over 50feet (15m) <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> and {{is dominated by the}} broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or peristyle: here alabaster Ionic columns support the coffered, gilded ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities.|$|E
60|$|The {{tiers of}} {{horseshoe}} benches rising <b>from</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling</b> were already packed, and the novice {{as he entered}} saw vague curving lines of faces in front of him, and heard the deep buzz of a hundred voices, and sounds of laughter from somewhere up above him. His companion spied an opening on the second bench, and they both squeezed into it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{catalog of}} the {{designer}} Hadi Teherani ranges from office chair range ("Silver" [...] / Inter chair 2004), more seating, sideboards, a mobile office module, lights, door and window fittings, various rug collections, wallpaper and sanitary objects {{down to the}} kitchen (+ ARTESIO / Poggenpohl 2010) and a bicycle (e-bike Teherani Hadi, 2011). One of the key factors {{in the success of}} Teherani, is the abundant use of glass in buildings and his designs. In the majority of his works we can see glasses as the main factor <b>from</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> because he believes that three factors are very important in the structure: light, air and the view of the room. He tries by using the glass bring the building up to the highest standards.|$|R
50|$|Alexander tells an {{interesting}} tale of {{an incident that}} took place after the performance. He was playing billiards at the saloon with the attaché of the court when he noticed the Czar was also playing there. Herrmann shot the ball {{with all of his}} strength against a plate-glass mirror that extended <b>from</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling.</b> It shattered into fifty pieces. Every person in the room was horrified, none more than Herrmann.|$|R
500|$|On {{the first}} floor, at the head-of the east main staircase, was the Astor Gallery, , looking out on 34th Street. The gallery, with seven French windows {{reaching}} [...] <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> opened {{out on a}} terrace over {{the entrance to the}} hotel. The interior was finished {{in the style of the}} Hôtel de Soubise, with a blue, gray and gold color scheme. There was a parquet floor, and on the south side, opposite the street windows, were other windows which opened into the main corridor on the second floor. The musicians' balcony, upheld by two caryatids, was at the east end. All the balcony railings were of gilded metal work. The mural paintings were notable: four panels, two at either end of the room, and twelve pendentive panels, six on either side and painted by Edward Simmons depicted the four seasons and the twelve months of the year. [...] The [...] "Colonial Room" [...] was decorated in red, contrasting with white woodwork. The second floor contained a private suite of apartments at the northeast corner, with large drawing rooms, dining room, butler's pantry, hallway, three bedrooms, three maids' bedrooms and five bathrooms, all finished in old English oak. All the floors above the third were given up to suites and bedrooms up to the 14th floor. There was a bath for nearly every room, and every bathroom had windows opening to the air, not into shafts. In every room, there was a large trunk closet.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E

2500|$|Not {{only was}} Chief Waramug {{respected}} {{far and wide}} for his courage, wisdom and charismatic leadership, {{but he was also}} admired for his magnificent hilltop headquarters overlooking the Housatonic River, not far above the present town of New Milford. Called [...] "Waramaug's Palace," [...] the structure was said to have been at least twenty feet wide and a hundred feet long, a [...] "long house," [...] indeed, and unquestionably the largest Indian building ever constructed in New England. Made from bark and logs which had to be carried for many miles (mostly up hill) {{on the backs of the}} artisans who built it, Waramaug's Palace was famed both for its architectural grandeur and its ornate interior decoration. It is said, for example, that the walls of the cavernous main council chamber were covered with colorful paintings of the chief, members of his family, his councilors and judges, while smaller apartments were adorned <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> with pictures of all the beasts, birds, reptiles and insects to be found in the land of the Pootatucks.|$|E
