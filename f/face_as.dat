5|$|Brian McCoy was {{the first}} to die, having been hit in the back by nine rounds from a 9mm Luger pistol in the initial volley of gunfire. Fran O'Toole {{attempted}} to run away, but was quickly chased down by the gunmen who had immediately jumped down into the field in pursuit. He was then machine-gunned 22 times, mostly in the <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> he lay supine on the ground.|$|E

5|$|While we did {{not always}} {{see eye to eye}} on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the {{existence}} and root of the problem.

5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} <b>face</b> <b>as</b> each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{pay-per-view}} {{focused on}} the tournament, few major feuds were highlighted. Aside from Owen Hart, the tournament did not figure prominently into the future storylines {{of any of the}} other participants. The qualifying match between the 1–2–3 Kid and Adam Bomb did, however, help advance a storyline. Bomb and Kwang, both managed by Harvey Wippleman, began feuding shortly after King of the Ring when Wippleman and Kwang turned on Bomb. Bomb began wrestling as a <b>face</b> <b>as</b> a result. Their feud did not end with a major blow off match, however. Instead, it was quietly resolved in a dark match prior to the SummerSlam 1994 broadcast.|$|E

A group of fans visited his mausoleum in 2011 on the 11th anniversary of his death.

5|$|Lemur {{communication}} can {{be transmitted}} through sound, sight, and smell (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play <b>face</b> <b>as</b> well as a submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} <b>face</b> <b>as</b> it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
5|$|The Sugababes {{are shown}} {{standing}} {{together in the}} next scene, where they are presented in a dark environment and covered in glitter. Range is represented as the season of autumn, and is decorated with a leaf motif on her <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> well as hair that resembles tree branches. The subsequent clip depicts Berrabah in a winter environment. The group is shown together for a second time, although in a natural environment. The next scenes depict Buchanan in the centre of a large purple flower, and leaves blowing past Range. Towards {{the end of the}} video, the Sugababes are shown in the same dark environment and eventually in their solo settings. Mickey McMonagle from the Sunday Mail praised the group's seasonal outfits in the video.|$|E

5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval <b>face.</b> <b>As</b> well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E
5|$|As all cadets are {{commissioned}} {{as second}} lieutenants upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. Military training and discipline {{fall under the}} purview of the Office of the Commandant. Entering freshmen, or fourth class cadets, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day or R-day, which marks the start of cadet basic training (CBT), known colloquially as Beast Barracks, or simply Beast. Most cadets consider Beast to be their most difficult time at the academy because of the transition from civilian to military life. Their second summer, cadets undergo cadet field training (CFT) at nearby Camp Buckner, where they train in more advanced field craft and military skills. During a cadet's third summer, they may serve as instructors for CBT or CFT. Rising Firstie (senior) cadets also spend one-month training at Camp Buckner, where they train for modern tactical situations that they will soon <b>face</b> <b>as</b> new platoon leaders. Cadets also have the opportunity during their second, third and fourth summers to serve in active army units and military schools around the world. The schools include Airborne, Air Assault, Sapper, Pathfinder, etc.|$|E
5|$|At Vengeance, Carlito {{fought in}} a Triple Threat match against Shelton Benjamin and Johnny Nitro for Benjamin's Intercontinental title. Nitro won the match after pulling Carlito {{outside of the}} ring and pinning him. Following Vengeance, Carlito began an {{on-screen}} relationship with Trish Stratus, turning <b>face</b> <b>as</b> a result. He also engaged in a short feud with Johnny Nitro and Melina, which ended after Carlito and Stratus defeated Nitro and Melina in a mixed tag team match at Saturday Night's Main Event. Carlito next feuded with Randy Orton, following a spot where Orton attempted to attack Stratus during a backstage segment. The two wrestlers were booked for a match at Unforgiven and a rematch on Raw; Orton won both matches. The feud concluded in a match at WWE’s annual Tribute to the Troops event, where Carlito won by pinfall. The angle involving Carlito's relationship with Trish Stratus lasted until Stratus' retirement from wrestling following Unforgiven.|$|E

5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women <b>face.</b> <b>As</b> Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Blair {{eventually}} {{decides that}} she wants to be with Chuck, but shuns him once again after he tries to humiliate Dan. She is later courted by a prince from Monaco named Louis. During a private confrontation, a drunken Chuck punches a window after he finds out Prince Louis has proposed to Blair, which cuts Blair's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> it shatters. Afterward, Blair chooses to accept a proposal from Louis. Blair later attempts to warn Chuck about potential trouble in his family. She is then abducted by an enemy of the Basses, Raina's father Russell Thorpe. Chuck later rescues Blair and apologizes for his violent actions. Following a night out together, the two have sex before Chuck advises Blair to return to Louis, believing that she will be happier with him. However, the season ends with the revelation that Blair may be pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him.

Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the <b>face</b> <b>as</b> he tries to protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing {{against the side of}} a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can.
