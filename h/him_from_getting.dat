5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race. They started the race fitted with the tyres used when they set their quickest lap times. Vettel set the fastest times {{in the second and third}} sessions and clinched his fourth pole position of the season with a time of 1:37.587. It was the Red Bull team's eighth pole in the season's nine races. He was joined on the grid's front row by Webber who recorded a lap time 0.075 seconds slower than Vettel. Hamilton qualified third but locked his rear tyres on his final timed heading into turn 17 and slowed down, preventing him from improving his grid position. The two Ferrari drivers were fourth and fifth (with Alonso ahead of Massa); Massa encountered slower cars which prevented him from gaining optimum tyre temperature and could not improve his fastest lap time. Kubica took sixth position and felt more movement on his Renault when he had the medium compound tyre equipped. Button had oversteer through turn 24 and made a mistake in the following corner which restricted him to seventh. Nico Hülkenberg was eighth, ahead of Williams teammate Barrichello in ninth who was affected by a brake-warm up problem. Petrov rounded out the top ten and made mistakes on his final timed lap which prevented <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> a better starting position.|$|E
25|$|Brazil faced Czechoslovakia in the final. Garrincha played despite {{suffering}} from a severe fever, which did not prevent Brazil from winning 3–1 and <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> voted player of the tournament. It was the second consecutive World Cup won by Garrincha and Brazil.|$|E
25|$|In December 2016, President-elect Donald Trump {{was rumored}} to be {{considering}} Kudlow for the position {{as chairman of the}} Council of Economic Advisers. Yet Kudlow's positions advocating free international trade, in contrast to Trump's more nationalist/isolationist views, may have prevented <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> the job.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} Edward Hugh Bengree-Jones in Liverpool, and {{studied at the}} London School of Economics, but was drawn more to philosophy, science, {{sociology}} and literature.

50|$|Chesley (Sully) Sullenberger, Captain of US Airways Flight 1549 that ditched in the Hudson River on January 15, 2009, {{said in a}} Google {{talk that}} the landing could have been less violent, but the anti-phugoid {{software}} installed on the Airbus A320-214 had prevented <b>him</b> <b>from</b> manually <b>getting</b> maximum lift during the four seconds before water impact.|$|R

25|$|In the {{original}} Shower series from 1965, {{a man is}} depicted standing under a shower but with no water. Kabakov interpreted the work as a simple but universal metaphor about the individual who is always waiting for something, but never receives anything. Instead, the Italians and critics of communism interpreted the work as signifying Soviet culture and its lack of material reward. The publicity Kabakov received prevented <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> work as an illustrator for four years, forcing him to work under someone else’s name. The use of an alter ego would become a common tool in Kabakov’s unofficial artwork.|$|E

Captured by police and taken to the Bishop, Valjean is shocked when the Bishop says that he gave him the silver, telling him to use it to do something worthwhile with his life.

I want to stop <b>him</b> (Powell) <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> back on the street. I know this man." [...] That same year, Hettinger {{strongly}} opposed parole for Powell. [...] Hettinger said, [...] "I'm speaking as a victim. A very good friend of mine was murdered and the same men tried to murder me. But the death penalty was not carried out. I don't think it's right. I've been quiet too long." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yunihiko, the Master of the Forest, is a devilish, 'unpure' unicorn {{who enjoys}} {{drinking}} sake and eating fried squid. He is Peganosuke's twin brother.

25|$|Sayama {{debuted in}} New Japan Pro Wrestling, against Shoji Kai, a jobber {{known to have}} been the debut {{opponent}} for future stars (Rusher Kimura, Masa Saito, Osamu Kido, Tatsumi Fujinami, and Mitsuo Momota had debuted against him before). Sayama weighed only 160 pounds, which, even given his training, impaired <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> a permanent spot on NJPW cards. So they sent him abroad, to England (where he wrestled as Sammy Lee) and Mexico, where he wrestled under his real name. It was in Mexico where he started to grow not only in physical stature but also in prominence, winning the NWA World Middleweight Title in EMLL.|$|E
25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that the great thing about Alan was to keep <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E
25|$|For the 2010–11 season Bemidji State {{moved from}} the CHA to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). Hunt's point {{production}} dropped in the new conference as he registered 3 goals and 21 points. He stated that part of reason for the drop in production was teams recognizing his shooting ability and preventing <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> shots off. While his individual numbers were lower he was the quarterback of one the conference's top power plays. In the 2011 WCHA Tournament the Beavers advanced to the semifinals where they were defeated by the University of Denver. In his senor season Hunt was {{named one of the}} team's alternate captains. He increased his production in the WCHA scoring 5 goals and 26 points while reducing his penalty minutes (PIMs) to a career low 8. In the 2012 WCHA Tournament Bemidji State lost in the first round to University of North Dakota. By finishing his Bemidji State career with 112 points Hunt became just the sixth defenceman in school history to eclipse the 100 point mark and left as the beaver's all-time leader in defenceman scoring and defenceman power play goals with 16.|$|E

60|$|The {{news out}} of Silesia are ominously doubtful, bad at the best. Duke Bevern, once Winterfeld was gone, had, as we observed, felt himself free to act; unchecked, but also unsupported, by counsel of the due heroism; and had acted unwisely. Made direct for Silesia, namely, where are meal-magazines and strong places. Prince Karl, they say, was also unwise; took no thought beforehand, or he might have gained marches, disputed rivers, Bober, Queiss, with Bevern, and as good as {{hindered}} <b>him</b> <b>from</b> ever <b>getting</b> to Silesia. So say critics, Retzow and others; perhaps looking too fixedly {{on one side of}} the question. Certain it is, Bevern marched in peace to Silesia; found it by no means the better place it had promised to be.|$|R
500|$|Rangel {{did well}} in {{elementary}} and middle school, and began working at a neighborhood drug store {{at the age of}} eight. [...] Rangel then attended DeWitt Clinton High School, but was often truant and was sometimes driven home by the police. His maternal grandfather, an early role model who worked in a courthouse and knew many judges and lawyers, kept <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> into more serious trouble.

500|$|After the season, {{the four}} seniors {{participated in a}} 21-city barnstorming tour of the state, playing against a group of local players in each city. At the game in Farmer's {{hometown}} of Manchester, Farmer scored 107 points for the seniors' team before switching to the Clay County team {{for the remainder of}} the game, hitting an additional three-pointer for a total of 30. Pelphrey hit a three to give the seniors [...] without Farmer [...] a 179176 lead with 25 seconds left in the game, and the three seniors triple-teamed Farmer to prevent <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> a shot off to tie the game. Twenty percent of the proceeds from each game benefited local charities, and another twenty percent of the total proceeds from the tour was divided between the University of Kentucky Library Fund, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and AIDS Volunteers of Lexington.|$|E
500|$|Trinsey argued that, {{by failing}} to allow for primaries, the state {{legislation}} prevented <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> to select a candidate of his choice, and that this violated the Fourteenth Amendment; {{the terms of the}} statute (and absence of a requirement for primaries) also allegedly infringed the rights of the electorate under the Seventeenth Amendment, which required the selection of Senators by popular vote; Trinsey's complaint was that the legislation had effectively delegated the power to choose candidates to political parties rather than the electorate. Accordingly, Trinsey filed a motion for a declaratory judgment to state that the statute was unconstitutional, and also requested that Wofford be removed from his seat. Counsel for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, joined by the office of the Governor, argued that the constitution did not require the holding of primary elections to fill vacancies, and that the statute [...] "protected valid and compelling state interests in protecting the validity of the electoral process and limiting the term of a appointed Senator".|$|E

50|$|He joined Hull City on 23 July 2004 from Burton Albion {{for a fee}} of £20,000, {{which could}} have risen to £60,000 {{depending}} on appearances. He was a regular starter at Burton, having made 78 league appearances for them in his three seasons at the club, but at Hull he spent several seasons mainly being used as cover for first-choice goalkeeper Boaz Myhill, making few first-team appearances and spending time on loan at Stockport County and Wycombe Wanderers.In 2007-08, Duke impressed sufficiently in a League Cup match against Crewe to retain {{his place in the}} Hull team for the subsequent league game and demote Myhill to the bench.

500|$|Jerry Alan West {{was born}} into a poor {{household}} in Chelyan, West Virginia. He was the fifth of six children of Cecil Sue West, a housewife, and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician. [...] West was a shy, introverted boy, who became even more withdrawn when his closest brother David died in the Korean War at age 22 when Jerry was 12. He was so small and frail that he needed vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children's sports, to prevent <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> seriously hurt. Growing up, West spent his days hunting and fishing, but his main activity was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed. West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle, ignoring mud and snow in the backyard, as well as his mother's whippings when he came home hours late for dinner; he played so often that the NBA acknowledged it as [...] "obsessive".|$|E
500|$|The stadium {{observed}} a minute's silence {{in memory of}} Ray Harford and Manchester United reserve player Jimmy Davis, who both died on 9 August 2003. Arsenal kicked off the match and within the first two minutes Phil Neville and Ashley Cole were booked for mistimed tackles. The match settled into [...] "a more sedate rhythm" [...] soon after, and in the 13th minute, Scholes' long pass found Solskjær, who was subsequently tackled; the ball ran out for a corner. It was delivered by Ryan Giggs and the ball was flicked on by Roy Keane at the near post – an unmarked Mikaël Silvestre headed it into the net, which gave United the lead. It was short-lived, however; in the 18th minute, Nicky Butt conceded a free-kick for a foul on Vieira. From [...] "about 33 yards out", Henry shot the ball past United's wall and beat Howard in goal. Arsenal's equaliser did not hand them the impetus, for United continued to control proceedings. Silvestre's cross in the 28th minute fashioned a chance for Giggs, though Arsenal's defence prevented <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> a shot. Giggs came close to scoring five minutes later; a cross by Butt found the Welshman whose effort hit the post. United finished the half with two half-chances.|$|E
500|$|The Yankees offered Taylor $300,000 {{to sign a}} {{minor league}} contract, the typical amount given to the first overall draft choice at that time. However, Boras advised the Taylor family that the {{previous}} year's top-rated high school pitcher, Todd Van Poppel, was given more than $1.2 million to sign with the Oakland Athletics, and gave up a scholarship to the University of Texas in the process. The Taylors held out for a three-year $1.2 million contract, {{even though they had}} less leverage because Brien's poor grades in high school prevented <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> a major college scholarship offer. They threatened the Yankees that Taylor would not sign and instead attend Louisburg College, a local junior college, to get the Yankees to agree to their terms. The Yankees were without the official services of owner George Steinbrenner, who was serving a suspension at the time, but through the media, Steinbrenner said that if the Yankees let Taylor get away, [...] "they should be shot." [...] Taylor signed for $1.55 million on August 26, the day before his classes were set to begin. Further delay would have meant the deal could not be signed until after the school year ended, which coincided with the following year's draft.|$|E
