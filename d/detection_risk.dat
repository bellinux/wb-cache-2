50|$|<b>Detection</b> <b>Risk</b> {{and quality}} of audit have an inverse relationship: if <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> is high, lower the quality of audit and if <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> is low, {{generally}} increase the quality of audit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Detection</b> <b>Risk</b> (DR) is {{the risk}} that the auditor will not detect a {{misstatement}} that exists in an assertion that could be material (significant), either individually or when aggregated with other misstatements. In other words, the chance that the auditor will not find material misstatements relating to an assertion in the Financial statements through substantive test and analysis. <b>Detection</b> <b>risk</b> results in the auditor's conclusion that no material errors are present where in fact there are. It is a component of audit risk.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} examine how {{different}} types of fraud in most Information Technology (IT) environments affect an audit risk model from 2001 through 2008. Variations in IT fraud are questionable for determining the audit risks that affect audit quality and report. The data sources in this study came from the Computer Crime and Security Survey report (CSI) 2008. By relating different IT fraud to audit risk components through trend analysis in IT fraud improvements from 2001 to 2008, the authors measured declined percentages for control risks, inherent <b>risks,</b> and <b>detection</b> <b>risks.</b> They found that an improvement in control risks has been achieved up to 52. 80 %, 43 % for <b>detection</b> <b>risks,</b> and 14 % for inherent risks. An overall improvement in audit risk is 47. 5 %, which is a considerable development in audit quality. The study shows that progress in detecting IT fraud positively reduced audit risks and has significantly increased the audit quality since 2001...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} {{the extent to which}} Jordanian auditors assessed the inherent risks, control <b>risks,</b> and <b>detection</b> <b>risks</b> when doing audits of financial statements. To achieve the objectives of the study, testing of hypotheses, questionnaire was designed and distributed to a sample of (70) Jordanian Auditors. To conduct data analysis and test hypotheses descriptive statistics, means, standard deviation, and one sample (T-test) were used. The study found that there is a commitment by Jordanian auditors to applying procedures, and tests required to evaluate the internal controls system when assessing the risks. It is necessary to the auditor to assess the inherent risks, control <b>risks,</b> and <b>detection</b> <b>risks.</b> The study recommended a number of recommendations where the most important is that strengthen cooperation must be between the external and internal auditor during the audit in terms of reduces the risk of fraud and misrepresentation in the financial statements to a minimum. </p...|$|R

5000|$|For audits {{performed}} by an outside audit firm, risk assessment {{is a crucial}} stage before accepting an audit engagement. According to ISA315 Understanding the Entity and its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement, [...] "the auditor should perform risk assessment procedures to obtain {{an understanding of the}} entity and its environment, including its internal control". Evidence relating to the auditor’s risk assessment of a material misstatement in the client’s financial statements. Then, the auditor obtains initial evidence regarding the classes of transactions at the client and the operating effectiveness of the client’s internal controls. Audit risk is defined as the risk that the auditor will issue a clean unmodified opinion regarding the financial statements, when in fact the financial statements are materially misstated, and therefore do not qualify for a clean unmodified opinion. As a formula, audit risk is the product of two other risks: Risk of Material Misstatement and <b>Detection</b> <b>risk.</b> This formula can be further broken down as follows: inherent risk × control risk × <b>detection</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} many types of risks {{associated}} with the audit process, each type primarily {{has an effect on}} the overall audit engagement. The effects produced by sampling risk generally can increase audit risk, the risk that an entity's financial statements will contain a material misstatement, though given an unqualified ('clean') audit report. Sampling risk can also increase <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> which suggests the possibility that an auditor will not find material misstatements relating to the financial statements through substantive tests and analysis.|$|E

40|$|The {{result of}} audit {{designation}} is significantly {{influenced by the}} audit evidence collected when planning the audit {{and the degree of}} <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> is further depends on the amount of audit evidence. Therefore, when the assessment factors of <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> are more objective and correct, audit costs and the risk of audit failure can be reduced. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} design an audit <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> assessment system that could more precisely assess <b>detection</b> <b>risk,</b> comparing with the traditional determination method of <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> in order to increase the audit quality and reduce the possibility of audit failure. First, the grounded theory is used to reorganize 53 factors affecting <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> mentioned in literatures and then employed the Delphi method to screen the 43 critical risk factors agreed upon by empirical audit experts. In addition, using the fuzzy theory and audit risk model to calculate the degree of <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> allow the audit staff to further determine the amount of audit evidence collected and set up initial audit strategies and construct the audit <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> assessment system. Finally, we considered a case study to evaluate the system in terms of its feasibility and validity...|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} Aggregation {{is thought}} to enhance an animal’s security through effective predator detection and the dilution of risk. A decline in individual vigilance as group size increases is commonly {{reported in the literature}} and called the group size effect. However, to date, most of the research has only been directed toward examining whether this effect occurs at the population level. Few studies have explored the specific contributions of predator <b>detection</b> and <b>risk</b> dilution and the basis of individual differences in the use of vigilance tactics. We tested whether male and female (non-reproductive or with young) eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) adopted different vigilance tactics when in mixed-sex groups and varied in their reliance on predator <b>detection</b> and/or <b>risk</b> dilution as group size changed. This species exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism with females being much smaller than males, making them differentially vulnerable toward predators. We combined field observations with vigilance models describing the effects of detection and dilution on scanning rates as group size increased. We found that females with and without juveniles relied on predator <b>detection</b> and <b>risk</b> dilution, but the latter adjusted their vigilance to the proportion of females with juveniles within their group. Two models appeared to equally support the data for males suggesting that males, similarly to females, relied on predator <b>detection</b> and <b>risk</b> dilution but may also have adjusted their vigilance according to the proportion of mothers within their group. Differential vulnerability may cause sex differences in vigilance tactic use in this species. The presence of males within a group that do not, or only partially, contribute to predator detection and are less at risk may cause additional security costs to females. Our results call for reexamination of the classical view of the safety advantages of grouping to provide a more detailed functional interpretation of gregariousness. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives to {{test whether}} {{individuals}} differ in deterrability by studying whether the effect of criminal experiences on perceived <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> varies by criminal propensity. Methods Data from the British ‘‘Offending, Crime and Justice Survey’’, a four-wave panel study on criminal behavior and victimization, are analyzed. Two subsamples for analyses are constructed: one of non-offenders at first measurement, to analyze the effect of gaining first offending experiences {{during the time of}} study (n = 1, 279) and one sample of individuals who have committed offenses within the past year (n = 567), to analyze the effect of police contact among active offenders. Fixed-effects regressions of perceived <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> on criminal experiences and interactions between criminal experiences and measures of criminal propensity (risk-affinity, impulsivity) are estimated. Results Analyses support learning models for the formation and change of risk perceptions, but individual differences by criminal propensity are present in the deterrence process: After gaining first offending experiences, impulsive individuals as well as riskaverse individuals are more likely to lower their perceptions about the probability of detection than less impulsive or risk-affine individuals are. A positive effect of police contact on expected <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> is restricted to risk-averse individuals. Conclusions Findings support claims that deterrence works differently for crime-prone individuals. The differential effects of impulsivity and risk-affinity underline the importance of not combining constituent characteristics of criminal propensity in composite indices, because they might have differential effects on deterrence...|$|E

40|$|A {{document}} discusses sequential probability ratio {{tests that}} explicitly allow decision-makers to incorporate false alarm and missed <b>detection</b> <b>risks,</b> and are potentially less sensitive to modeling errors than {{a procedure that}} relies solely on a probability of collision threshold. Recent work on constrained Kalman filtering has suggested an approach to formulating such a test for collision avoidance maneuver decisions: a filter bank with two norm-inequality-constrained epoch-state extended Kalman filters. One filter models the null hypotheses that the miss distance is inside the combined hard body radius at the predicted time of closest approach, and one filter models the alternative hypothesis. The epoch-state filter developed for this method explicitly accounts for any process noise present in the system. The method appears to work well using a realistic example based on an upcoming, highly elliptical orbit formation flying mission...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: False-positives are a {{major concern}} in breast cancer screening. However, false-positives have been little {{evaluated}} as a prognostic factor for cancer detection. Our aim was to evaluate the association of false-positive results with the cancer <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> in subsequent screening participations over a 17 -year period. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 762, 506 women aged 45 – 69 years, {{with at least two}} screening participations, who underwent 2, 594, 146 screening mammograms from 1990 to 2006. Multilevel discrete-time hazard models were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) of breast cancer detection in subsequent screening participations in women with false-positive results. Results: False-positives involving a fine-needle aspiration cytology or a biopsy had a higher cancer <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> than those involving additional imaging procedures alone (OR= 2. 69; 95 %CI: 2. 28 – 3. 16 and OR= 1. 81; 95 %CI: 1. 70 – 1. 94, respectively). The risk of cancer detection increased substantially if women with cytology or biopsy had a familial history of breast cancer (OR= 4. 64; 95 %CI: 3. 23 – 6. 66). Other factors associated with an increased cancer <b>detection</b> <b>risk</b> were age 65 – 69 years (OR= 1. 84; 95 %CI: 1. 67 – 2. 03), non-attendance at the previous screening invitation (OR= 1. 26; 95 %CI: 1. 11 – 1. 43), and having undergone a previous benign biopsy outside the screening program (OR= 1. 24; 95 %CI: 1. 13 – 1. 35). Conclusion: Women with a false-positive test have an increased risk of cancer detection in subsequent screening participations, especially those with a false-positive result involving cytology or biopsy. Understanding the factors behind this association could provide valuable information to increase the effectiveness of breast cancer screening...|$|E
