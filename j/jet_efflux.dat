These beds {{are thought to}} be deposited from mud-rich flows in a distal basin-floor setting; however they remain poorly understood, partly because details of lateral lithological changes are poorly known. In this study, matrix-rich strata are common in proximal basin-floor strata of the Neoproterozoic Windermere Supergroup. The objective of this thesis is to provide detailed description and interpretation of the lithological and mineralogical make-up and lateral facies trends of matrix-rich strata in in a unit 40 m thick and 800 m wide. Here, stratigraphic and petrographic analyses identified five facies: classic turbidites; sandstones; clayey sandstones; sandy claystones and fine-grained banded couplets, which laterally are arranged systematically from matrix-poor sandstones to thin-bedded turbidites.

In 1973, simple {{harmonic}} (SH) {{stationary waves}} in an artery, observed during a radiologist’s rapid injection of radiopaque x-ray “dye” (arteriographic standing waves), at turbulent arterial flow rates, contradicted chaos, initiated research into transition to turbulence (Hamilton 1980). The SH {{high and low}} pressure bands suggested that SH standing wave sound accompanied the periodic fluid shear waves that develop in compliant-walled arteries (G Hamilton 1980, and 2015).2. In wind and water flow, SH waves arise on flat sand surfaces in transition and grow in amplitude in turbulence; photographs show sand particles ejected vertically from troughs and deposited at shallow angles on the following crests of SH sand waves; “.... instead of finding chaos and disorder, the observer never fails to be amazed at a simplicity of form, an exactitude of repetition and a geometric order...” (Bagnold 1941; G Hamilton 2015). 3. In water flow in glass cylinders, SH waves of tiny glass beads begin accumulating in transition along the tube base, persisting and growing in turbulence; Thomas related the glass bead waves to Bagnold’s SH sand waves (Thomas 1964), believing the underlying physics was the same. The SH glass bead waves slide slowly along the shiny glass cylinder; Bagnold’s stationary sand waves cannot slide on sand (Hamilton 2015). If, as with Bagnold’s sand waves, the glass bead waves were stationary, they would resemble the SH particle waves in a glass tube in the Kundt’s tube standing wave sound experiment.4. SH edge tones (and notes of a flute) appear during transition, persisting and growing in amplitude at turbulent flow rates (Sondhaus 1854; Krüger 1920). 5. As SH sound triggered turbulence in laminar cylinder water flow, the now turbulent <b>efflux</b> <b>jet</b> would split into 2, 3, or more similar jets (Tyndall 1867). In water flow, a cylinder’s turbulent column shows 2. 3, or more similar transverse flow sectors, each sector displaying a centripetal streaming flow from the BL, flanked {{by a pair of}} counter-rotating vortices (Hof 2004; Fitzgerald 2004). Logic suggests Tyndall’s turbulent flow divisions are the Hof cylinder sectors (Hamilton 2015). 6. Turbulence in tubes with triangular or rectangular cross sections also revealed organizes transverse flow divisions - a transverse centripetal streaming flow arising from the BL of each mid-wall, flanked by a pair of counter-rotating vortices (J Nikuradse 1931). 7. A powerful SH sound imposes a long-crested SH wave pattern on previously irregular turbulent surface waves (Benjamin 1959).|$|R

The primary objective was to compare model aerodynamic characteristics {{with those of the}} aircraft, with the intent to provide preliminary data needed towards establishing small-to-full scale correlating techniques on jet flap V/STOL aircraft configurations. Lift and drag coefficients from the model and aircraft tests were found to be in reasonable agreement. The pitching moment coefficient and trim condition correlation was poor. A secondary objective was to evaluate a modified thrust nozzle having thrust reversal capability.

40|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>efflux</b> {{characteristics}} are a determining factor in STOVL aircraft aero/propulsion induced effects. Subcritical jets may have core lengths which range up to 6 diameters. The shorter core length jets tend to entrain ambient air more rapidly, inducing larger hover lift losses, and decay more rapidly, reducing adverse ground erosion. In transition flight, shorter core length jets show a larger {{decrease in the}} lift loss and a slight decrease in nose-up pitching moment. Supercritical pressure ratio jets tend to have longer, higher pressure core lengths with a greater hazard for ground erosion. The decay in the fully developed region is similar for both subcritical and supercritical pressure ratio jets. For subsonic jets the decay is inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} jet exit. In ground effect the supercritical jet induces an oscillating pressure distribution on the ground with reflected shocks and expansions which can increase ground erosion and, at low ground heights, cause non-monotonic lift loss variations...|$|E

The comparisons between LES data and experiment measurements were in good agreement for low-velocity round jet.

Detailed surface pressure measurements show that suction pressure peaks located on the upper surface of the wing during conventional wingborne flight for angles of attack greater than 5 deg move to the wing lower surface at angles of attack less than 0 deg. A reduction in these suction pressure peaks is observed when the lift jets are operating. With sonic jet exit conditions, a freestream Mach number of 0. 14, and 0 deg angle of attack, the jet-induced suckdown is equivalent to a 3. 7 deg reduction in angle of attack.

40|$|During {{wind tunnel}} testing of jet-lift, short {{take-off}} and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft it is usual {{to simulate the}} <b>jet</b> <b>efflux</b> but not the intake flows. The intakes, which are commonly faired over or are unpowered, are generally tested in separate wind tunnel experiments. The forces acting on the wind tunnel model {{are determined by the}} linear addition of the forces obtained from the two separate tests. There is some doubt as to whether this is a valid approach. A systematic experimental investigation was, therefore, conducted to determine the magnitude of any jet/intake interference effects on a generic jet-lift STOVL aircraft in transitional flight, out of ground effect. Comparisons made between separate and simultaneous jet and intake testing concluded that a mutual jet/intake interference effect does exist. The existence of this interference means that the aerodynamic wing lift loss in transitional flight deduced from isolated jet and intake testing is less than the lift loss obtained from simultaneous jet and intake testing. The experimental research was supplemented by some simplified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies of elements of the flow-field about the aircraft using the k-e turbulence model. The numerical modelling enabled aspects of the flow-field around the aircraft to be visualised which could not easily be done using the experimental apparatus. It is a requirement of the Eng]) programme that part of this thesis must address a management topic linked to the research. In this case the management aspects of wind tunnel project work were examined. A scenario was developed which established a requirement for a large-scale, low-speed wind tunnel with a Reynolds number capability of 20 million.

40|$|The scalar {{mixing of}} gas turbine exhaust jets is {{important}} to many engineering issues in turbomachinery propulsion and power systems, but especially so with regard to current aircraft emissions concerns. There have been many laboratory scale studies of self-similarity, scalar dissipation, temporal intermittency of passive scalar mixing in isothermal jets, and of fuel/air mixture in reacting jets, but no previous detailed investigations of co-flowing <b>jet</b> <b>efflux</b> development {{in the context of}} engine exhaust interactions with aircraft trailing vortices for emissions impact. The objective of the present project has been to use latest advanced computational simulation techniques to study passive scalar mixing of turbulent co-flowing jets in their initial exhaust development region, as a complement to separate experimental studies, to provide better defined initial conditions for subsequent simpler model predictions of the effect of engine plume/vortex interactions on air quality. Current assessment methods start with either assumed engine exit conditions (which are not fully characterised and whose initial development cannot be accurately reproduced) or take as a starting point the assumed establishment of a fully developed jet plume (for which the degree of development and downstream origin are equally uncertain). However progress towards the application of large eddy simulation (LES) methods to such flows has been growing since they directly solve for the largest scales of the turbulent flow responsible for mixing. Accordingly a well-established Large Eddy Simulation technique has first been validated against new experimental data for a low-speed, isolated round jet, seeded with a gas tracer, and then used to perform a parametric series of simulations, numerical experiments, for a coaxial jet representative of a modern, large by-pass ratio jet engine exhaust under a variety of conditions with passive scalar introduced into either the core or bypass flow.

40|$|Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs) are envisaged to be {{the next}} logical step in {{mobility}} to alleviate modern transport problems. PAVs could combine the freedom of point-to-point personal mobility with the higher speeds of air travel. Hence the principal aim of this research programme was to develop a preliminary design and optimisation methodology for an innovative vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) PAV with a ducted fan propulsion system driven by a single turboshaft engine. A feasibility study conducted {{at the start of the}} programme concluded that a ducted fan powered VTOL PAV provides a flexible, quiet and safe point-to-point mobility platform free from runway constraints and any problems associated with <b>jet</b> <b>efflux</b> or exposed rotating components. To satisfy VTOL and forward flight requirements a design and optimisation methodology for ducted fans and contra-rotating lift fans was developed from a series CFD tests. With a single engine driving all the fans, a methodology was developed for the design of a system of interconnecting gears, gearboxes and shafts. To accommodate the propulsion system and all the other internal components of the aircraft, an innovative tri-surface configuration was generated by adopting a systems packaging approach. Weight minimisation through the use of composites and appropriate prediction methods was crucial to reducing the power requirements and fuel consumption. The aerodynamic surface interaction was explored and optimised using a vortex-lattice method. The same approach was also used to estimate the stability derivatives of the aircraft. The overall performance was analysed utilising the data produced from the above methodologies and that also included an analysis of the transition from hover to forward flight. All the above methodologies were integrated to form an automated PAV design synthesis which in combination with a MATLAB global optimiser is capable of producing variants of the baseline aircraft that are capable of meeting different mission and passenger capacity requirements while maximising a specified merit function.

40|$|Hover and ground-effect {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with the Lockheed-Martin Large Scale Powered Model (LSPM) during June-November 1995 at the NASA Ames Research Center's Outdoor Aerodynamics Research Facility (OARF). This was done {{in support of the}} Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program being lead by the Department of Defense. The program was previously metered to as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) Program. The tests at the OARF included: engine thrust calibrations out of ground effect, measurements of individual nozzle jet pressure decay characteristics, and jet-induced hover force and moment measurements in and out of ground effect. The engine calibrations provide data correlating propulsion system throttle and nozzle settings to thrust forces and moments for the bare fuselage with the wings, canards, and tails removed. This provides propulsive forces and moments while minimizing any of the effects due to the presence of the airframe. The engine calibrations were used later to determine thrust for hover testing at the OARF and for transition testing which took place in the NASA Ames 80 by 120 foot Wind Tunnel. The jet decay characteristics reflect the jet entrainment properties and are related to the aircraft suckdown characteristics. The JSF program provided the opportunity to obtain model scale effects using two models; one at small scale and one at large scale. Examples of data from these tests will be presented out of ground effect which will demonstrate the effect of scale. For one JSF configuration, two small-scale models and one large-scale model were tested and obtained different values for the lift loss out of ground effect. These differences were examined and are found to be largely dependent on the <b>jet</b> <b>efflux</b> characteristics. The jet-induced hover forces and moments are presented in and out of ground effect. For the hover testing the model is methodically built up from the bare fuselage, to include the wings, canards, and vertical tails, {{to determine the effects of}} each.
