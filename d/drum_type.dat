2500|$|The {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}} consists of six evenly spaced large rubber-tired road wheels with the drive sprocket {{at the rear}} and the idler at the front. The road wheels are hollow to minimize weight. These hollow road wheels increase the tank's buoyancy by 30%. There are no track-return rollers. The first and last road wheels have a hydraulic shock absorber and the steel tracks have 96 links each when new, each link has a single pin. There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. Its straight 6-cylinder, 4-stroke water-cooled diesel engine was developed under the designation [...] "V-6" [...] by halving the [...] "V-12"-engine from the T-54/55. It develops 240hp (179kW) at 1,800rpm which gives it a road speed of 44km/h {{and a range of}} 370km to 400km. The vehicle can cross 1.1 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches and climb 52° gradients. The engine has a cooling system and an initial heater (intended for use when the air temperature is -20°C or colder). The PT-76 has a 5-speed manual shaft-type transmission system similar to the one in the T-34/85. The gearbox has four forward gears and one reverse. The vehicle has a side clutch that enables it to make turns and a handbrake. The tank has four mounts for additional external fuel tanks {{at the rear of the}} hull. The two on the corners are for flat type external tanks and the two in the center are for a <b>drum</b> <b>type.</b> These additional tanks increase the range from 370km – 400km to 480km – 510km. The PT-76 is a reliable, simple to operate and highly mobile reconnaissance vehicle and is ideally designed for amphibious operations, but it has many limitations as a fighting vehicle.|$|E

PRIOR SUBSPACE ANALYSIS Prior Subspace Analysis (PSA) is a technique for sound source separation in single channel mixtures in cases where prior knowledge is available about the sources [1, 2]. PSA represents sound sources as low dimensional independent subspaces in the timefrequency plane and is based on Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) and the generalised sound classification techniques created by Casey [3, 4]. It uses prior knowledge about the sources to overcome a number of problems associated with ISA not least of which is the problem of estimating the amount of information to be retained from the dimensional reduction stage of ISA. The mixture signal is transferred to a timefrequency representation such as a spectrogram. PSA then assumes that the overall spectrogram Y results from the summation of l unknown independent spectrograms Yj. This yields...|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} the oxygenator, or {{artificial}} lung, dates back to 1885, with the first demonstration of a disc oxygenator, on which blood was exposed to the atmosphere on rotating discs by Von Frey and Gruber. These pioneers noted the dangers of blood streaming, foaming and clotting. In the 1920s and 30s, research into developing extracorporeal oxygenation continued. Working independently, Brukhonenko in the USSR and John Heysham Gibbon in the USA demonstrated the feasibility of extracorporeal oxygenation. Brukhonenko used excised dog lungs while Gibbon used a direct contact <b>drum</b> <b>type</b> oxygenator, perfusing cats for up to 25 minutes in the 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|The dhol is a drum {{that dates}} back to the 15th century. It was {{probably}} introduced to the Indian subcontinent via the Persian <b>drum</b> <b>type</b> dohol (duhul). Evidence for this is found in Ain-i-Akbari, which describes the use of duhul in the orchestra of the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great. The Indo-Aryan word [...] "dhol" [...] appears in print around 1800 in the treatise Sangitasara.However images of dhol players appear to be present in the bas relief carvings on Indian temple walls from the earliest times. It is possible that both the instrument as well as the name have some deep Indo-European connection. However, at this point it is just really difficult to make any firm statement as to the origin of the instrument.|$|E
