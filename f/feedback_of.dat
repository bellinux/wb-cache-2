At (3:11), the bass guitar joins in, followed by the drum kit, building to a gradual crescendo, eventually climaxing at (3:42) into a distortion-laden chord progression, using the chords F♯ minor, D major, and A major. At (3:46), a guitar solo is played over these chords. This continues until (5:09), after all instruments have faded out except for the tremolo-laden <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> the guitar.|$|E
5|$|According to Haga, the story's main {{theme was}} saving Elena from the curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was {{kept to a minimum}} so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman {{who did not want to}} be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E

25|$|The average onset age of {{menopause}} after hysterectomy with ovarian conservation is 3.7 years earlier than average. This {{has been suggested}} {{to be due to}} the disruption of blood supply to the ovaries after a hysterectomy or due to missing endocrine <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> the uterus. The function of the remaining ovaries is significantly affected in about 40% of women, some of them even require hormone replacement treatment. Surprisingly, a similar and only slightly weaker effect has been observed for endometrial ablation which is often considered as an alternative to hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|Cyproterone is a steroidal {{antiandrogen}} that competitively inhibits {{the binding}} of testosterone or DHT to AR. Cyproterone binds to ARs that are expressed by prostate cancer cells {{as well as}} to the AR that are expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary. Therefore, cyproterone blocks the negative <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> androgens at the hypothalamic-pituitary level leading to increased luteinizing hormone (LH) serum levels. This rise in LH levels causes an increase in serum testosterone levels and ultimately diminishes the ability of cyproterone to compete for AR binding and to block androgenic stimulation.|$|E

25|$|Pure AR antagonists like {{flutamide}} and bicalutamide are potent progonadotropins with indirect estrogenic {{activity in}} males. This {{is because they}} block the AR in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus and thereby inhibit the negative <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. This, in turn, results in increased gonadotropin secretion, activation of gonadal steroidogenesis, and an up to 2-fold increase in testosterone levels and 2.5-fold increase in estradiol levels. Conversely, AR antagonists that are also progestogens, like cyproterone acetate, are not progonadotropic, as activation of the PR is antigonadotropic, and, indeed, cyproterone acetate is potently antigonadotropic in clinical practice.|$|E

Open circuit scuba regulators must also deliver against a variable ambient pressure. They must be robust and reliable, as they are life-support equipment which must function in a relatively hostile environment (sea water).|$|E

In addition to DMX512, newer control connections include RDM (remote device management) which adds management and status feedback capabilities to devices which use it while maintaining compatibility with DMX512; and Architecture for Control Networks (ACN) which is a fully featured multiple controller networking protocol. These allow the possibility of <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> position, state or fault conditions from units, whilst allowing much more detailed control of them.|$|E
25|$|The HDD's {{electronics}} {{control the}} movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the disk controller. <b>Feedback</b> <b>of</b> the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor. Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media which have failed.|$|E

25|$|In PWRs reactor {{power can}} be viewed as {{following}} steam (turbine) demand due to the reactivity <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> the temperature change caused by increased or decreased steam flow. (See: Negative temperature coefficient.) Boron and control rods are used to maintain primary system temperature at the desired point. In order to decrease power, the operator throttles shut turbine inlet valves. This would result in less steam being drawn from the steam generators. This results in the primary loop increasing in temperature. The higher temperature causes the density of the primary reactor coolant water to decrease, allowing higher neutron speeds, thus less fission and decreased power output. This decrease of power will eventually result in primary system temperature returning to its previous steady-state value. The operator can control the steady state operating temperature by addition of boric acid and/or movement of control rods.|$|E
25|$|Assistive {{technology}} {{in this area}} is broken down into low, mid, and high tech categories. Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading. Mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.|$|E
