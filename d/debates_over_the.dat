5|$|<b>Debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{origin of}} falafel have {{sometimes}} devolved into political {{discussions about the}} relationship between Arabs and Israelis. In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt, Palestine, and of Israel. Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for {{what they see as the}} appropriation of their dish by Israelis. Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel.|$|E
5|$|Recreational gold mining {{is popular}} along the Klamath {{and some of}} its tributaries, {{including}} the Salmon and the Trinity. Although simple methods such as panning are still used, some methods use suction pumps—a practice involving turning over deposits of sediment and spreading them in order to find gold. <b>Debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> practice, which opponents contend damage water quality (mercury) and fish habitat, continue. Currently, suction dredge mining is banned in California until 2016.|$|E
5|$|The book {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> book in the English-speaking world.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the century the ideas of {{population}} genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of the genetics of behavior, sociobiology, and, especially in humans, evolutionary psychology. In the 1960s W.D. Hamilton and others developed game theory approaches to explain altruism from an evolutionary perspective through kin selection. The possible origin of higher organisms through endosymbiosis, and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the gene-centered view (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the neutral theory (which made genetic drift a key factor) spawned perennial <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> proper balance of adaptationism and contingency in evolutionary theory.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen of {{the forty}} {{participants}} completed the 4½-mile course; of the 21 who did not, two suffered fatal falls on the first circuit, reigniting <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> safety of the event. Irish horse Ballabriggs won the race, securing the first-place prize money of £535,135 and a first Grand National win for trainer Donald McCain, Jr., the son of four-time winning trainer Ginger McCain. Owned by Trevor Hemmings, Ballabriggs was ridden by Irish jockey Jason Maguire and was sent off at odds of 14/1. The pairing completed the race in 9 minutes 1.2 seconds, the second-fastest time in Grand National history.|$|E
5|$|On 11th May, William and Mary {{formally}} {{accepted the}} Scottish throne and on 5th June, the Convention was {{converted into a}} full Parliament. William tried to avoid abolishing Episcopacy but Dundee's 1689 Highland campaign on behalf of James highlighted his reliance on Presbyterian support. He withdrew his opposition and the measures were approved by Parliament in 1690. The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in a Parliament and Kirk far more independent than before but ending Episcopacy isolated {{a significant part of}} the political class. This was a major factor in political <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 1707 Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement.|$|E

5|$|The Netherlands {{intended}} by 1912 to replace its fleet of pre-dreadnought armoured ships with a modern fleet composed of dreadnoughts. After a Royal Commission proposed {{the purchase of}} nine dreadnoughts in August 1913, there were extensive <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> need for such ships and, if they were necessary, the actual number needed. These lasted into August 1914, when a bill authorizing funding for four dreadnoughts was finalized, but the outbreak of World War I halted the ambitious plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E
5|$|The {{reports of}} bin Laden's death on May 2, 2011, are not universally {{accepted}} despite unreleased DNA testing confirming his identity, bin Laden's twelve-year-old daughter witnessing his death, and a May 6, 2011, al-Qaeda statement confirming his death. The swift burial of bin Laden's body at sea, {{the speed of}} the DNA results, and the decision not to release pictures of the dead body have led to the rise of conspiracy theories that bin Laden had not died in the raid. Some Internet blogs suggested that the U.S. government feigned the raid, and some Internet forums hosted <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> alleged hoax.|$|E

5|$|Barely {{five years}} after {{upgrades}} were completed in 1888, it was suggested the fort be demolished. <b>Debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fort lingered on between the Colonial Defence Committee in London, and the Local Defence Committee in Singapore for nearly a decade. The fort was finally rendered obsolete and abandoned in 1901 when the guns were removed. Instead of destroying the fort, the British thought it simpler to bury it, which was done sometime after World War I. A portion of a bastion was still visible above ground well into the 1960s, when a public park was built atop the fort for the fast-growing Katong suburbs. In the late 1960s, the bastion was finally buried when land reclamation in the East Coast took place, and its memory was soon forgotten in the ensuing decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th and through the 19th century, {{criticism}} centred on <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> moral message of the play. Actor and playwright David Garrick's 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been purposely included in the play to show how reckless the hero was {{and that this was}} the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, when Breckinridge was 12 years old, {{his father}} {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate. The family moved to Bedford County, Virginia, where they lived with {{relatives}} in order to be closer to the elder Breckinridge during the congressional session at Washington, D.C.. While there, Cabell Breckinridge attended New London Academy (now Colby–Sawyer College). A case of measles prevented him from attending William and Mary College (now College of William & Mary), his father's alma mater, where his cousin, future Congressman James Breckinridge, was enrolled. In 1803, he accompanied his father to the capital where he witnessed the <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Louisiana Purchase before returning to college in October. After Congress adjourned in March, John Breckinridge met his son in Virginia, and they arrived back at Cabell's Dale, the family estate near Lexington, on April 18, 1804. He did not return to Virginia with his father in late 1804, instead pursuing preparatory studies under Colonel Samuel Wilson in advance of his enrollment at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University).|$|E

5|$|On {{arriving}} in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic {{doctrine of the}} Eucharist, the most sensitive area of disagreement between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli {{at the forefront of}} <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> nature of the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|Religious <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Harry Potter {{series of}} books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels {{go out of their way}} to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat {{that the}} Strait would be closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they might have to fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means. This was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E
