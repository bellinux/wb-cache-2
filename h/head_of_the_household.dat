5|$|From 1916 {{through her}} {{retirement}} in 1954, Morgan was a department chair or co-chair. Initially, {{the leadership of}} the Department of Home Economics was split between Morgan (as the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> science division) and Mary Patterson (as the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> arts division). Morgan was not fond of sharing a department with Patterson, who had a background in decorative arts and no inclination toward science. By 1920, Berkley president David Prescott Barrows agreed to Morgan's request to separate the two divisions into distinct departments since they had different curricula, philosophies and faculty, and Morgan became the sole chair of the Department of Household Science.|$|E

5|$|In August 1938, Elonzo Williams was {{temporarily}} {{released from the}} hospital. He showed up unannounced at the family's home in Montgomery.

5|$|In Muslim families, {{women and}} men are {{considered}} equal, {{but not in the}} westernised sense. The Quran teaches that the minds of males and females work differently and are generally different biologically. Therefore, Islam grants different rights to the husband and wife. One such right which the wife owes to her husband is being <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fox {{divided the}} {{patients}} at Brislington House according to social class, '1st', '2nd' and '3rd' class ladies and gentlemen, who were housed in different blocks, {{as well as}} behavioural presentation. Fox insisted that patients should be separated from their families as they needed {{to move away from}} the conventional authority of the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> following the madness of King George III. It had erroneously been suggested that the king become a patient at Brislington House.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} issues are aspects of sharia (Islamic law) known as Muslim {{personal}} law (MPL) or Muslim family law. Some of the thorny issues regarding {{the way in which}} MPL has thus far been formulated include polygyny, divorce, custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since the 17th century, the Grand and General Council {{became more}} oligarchic, with {{political}} power resting in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> powerful landowners. <b>The</b> Sammarinese Socialist Party agitated for universal male suffrage by convening an arengo in 1906. <b>The</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> {{agreed to let}} all adult male citizens vote.|$|R

50|$|In a {{controversial}} move in November 2012, President Ouattara sacked his {{government in a}} row over a new marriage law that would make wives joint <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household.</b> His own party supported the changes but <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruling coalition resisted, with the strongest opposition coming from <b>the</b> Democratic Party <b>of</b> Côte d'Ivoire.|$|R
5|$|During {{her time}} editing The Suffragette, Barrett {{struck up a}} {{friendship}} with the Australian author I. A. R. Wylie, who contributed to the paper in 1913. The two of them started a relationship and became lovers. In 1919 both Barrett and Wylie travelled to the United States, where they bought a car and spent over a year travelling the country. They stayed in New York and San Francisco and were recorded in the 1920 census as living in Carmel-By-The-Sea in California, where Wylie is classed as the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> and Barrett her friend.|$|E
5|$|Penelope's {{story is}} an attempt at {{narrative}} justice to retribute Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as the archetypal female. Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca {{as the head of}} state and, during Odysseus' absence, as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household.</b> The ancient form of justice and punishment, which was swift and simple {{due to the lack of}} courts, prisons, and currency, is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens. Penelope's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial, as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple has}} three children. The eldest is Lindesfarne Dewclaw, an English {{hedgehog}} daughter Kevin adopted {{during his first}} marriage. The second eldest child is Rudy, Kell's son from her first marriage to a fox. Rudy, a talented artist, once challenged Kevin for the position of alpha male, unable to accept a rabbit as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> and as his stepfather. He has since matured and has {{come to terms with}} the marriage. The youngest child is Coney, a carnivorous rabbit and their only child by birth. Although only five years old, she is a capable hunter, though Kevin's mother, Dorothy, keeps trying to make her into an herbivore, as well having an artistic streak like her half-brother.|$|E

5|$|Three {{days after}} Parnell's speech in Ennis, a process server and {{seventeen}} {{members of the}} Royal Irish Constabulary began the attempt to serve Boycott's eviction notices. Legally, {{they had to be}} delivered to the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> or his spouse within a certain time period. The process server successfully delivered notices to three of the tenants, but a fourth, Mrs Fitzmorris, refused to accept the notice and began waving a red flag to alert other tenants that the notices were being served. The women of the area descended on the process server and the constabulary, and began throwing stones, mud, and manure at them, succeeding in driving them away to seek refuge in Lough Mask House.|$|E
5|$|Nina McNary {{became the}} <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household,</b> while other {{siblings}} took jobs {{in order to}} provide for the family. As a boy, Charles worked as a paperboy, in an orchard, and at other farming tasks. He met Herbert Hoover, a future U.S. president, who moved to Salem in 1888. He later worked in the county recorder's office for his brother John Hugh McNary, who had been elected as county recorder in 1890, and for a short time attended the Capital Business College. After leaving that school, he enrolled in college preparatory classes at Willamette University, with an eye towards attending Stanford University or the University of California. During this time he met Jessie Breyman, whom he began dating, at a social club he helped start. Another member of the club was Oswald West, a future governor of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother is the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household.</b> As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and {{is a factor in}} the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E
