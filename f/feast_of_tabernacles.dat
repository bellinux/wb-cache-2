Loaded with honors and titles, Agrippa returned home, and the few remaining years of his benevolent sway afforded the people {{a brief period of}} peace and prosperity. The evil consequences of a ruler's unbridled passions and tyranny had been sufficiently evident to him in Rome, and they had taught him moderation and strict self-control. His people regarded him with love and devotion, because he healed with tender hand the deep wounds inflicted upon the national susceptibilities by brutal Roman governors. He ruled his subjects with compassion and friendliness. Like the ancestral Asmoneans from whom he sprang through his noble grandmother Mariamne, he honored the Law. Like the merest commoner, he carried his basket of first-fruits to the Temple; with the people he celebrated appropriately the <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tabernacles,</b> and he devoted to the sanctuary a golden chain with which Caligula had honored him. On one occasion, while in the street, he met a bridal procession which drew up to let him pass, but he halted and bade it take precedence. He sought to lighten taxation, remitting the impost on houses in Jerusalem. On the coins minted by him he carefully avoided placing any symbols which could offend the people's religious sentiment. Thus, prosperity and comfort seemed to be dawning anew for the Jews.|$|E

Past studies have achieved consensus on certain points of interpretation but overlooked important evidence at other points. Some scholars have also been too quick to cite John’s treatment <b>of</b> the <b>feasts</b> as evidence <b>of</b> his anti-Jewish posture in the Gospel as a whole. In what follows, therefore, I will give particular attention to those background sources which have not been accorded due attention. I will also attempt to situate my study within the wider question of Judaism in the Fourth Gospel and to suggest how the results achieved in the end may bear upon ongoing debates on this matter.

It is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (shalosh regalim) {{mentioned}} in the Bible.

On the latter occasion the word טל ("dew") is substituted for the word גשם ("rain"), used on Shemini Aẓeret, and hence the titles [...] "Geshem" [...] and [...] "Ṭal" [...] given to the Musaf of these festivals.

2500|$|An {{example of}} the textual {{argument}} is given by North in his comparison of [...] with [...] The first passage establishes the timing, in days, for the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot), while the second prescribes the timing, in years, for the Jubilee. In the first passage, the start of counting for the Festival of Weeks {{is said to be}} [...] "the day after the Sabbath" [...] (mimaharat ha-shabat, [...] ), and is to end [...] "the day after the seventh Sabbath" [...] (mimaharat ha-shabat ha-sheviyit, [...] ). These seven weeks would constitute 49 days in most modern methods of reckoning. Nevertheless, verse 16 says that they are to be reckoned as 50 days. This method of reckoning (sometimes called [...] "inclusive numbering") is fairly common in Scripture; for example, the <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tabernacles</b> is to last for seven days (...) , but the last day is called the eighth day (v. 36). North found this comparison between Leviticus 23 (Feast of Weeks) and Leviticus 25 (Jubilees) to be [...] "the strongest possible support for the forty-ninth year" [...] as the Jubilee year. His conclusion that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year was followed by Lefebvre, for this as well as additional reasons.|$|E

The Papists substituted St. Bartholomew for the heathen goddess.

60|$|Between {{the first}} and second Passover John and Christ baptized together, till the {{imprisonment}} of John, which was four months before the second. Then Christ began to preach, and call his disciples; and after he had instructed them a year, lent them to preach in the cities of the Jews: at the same time John hearing of the fame of Christ, sent to him to know who he was. At the third, the chief Priests began to consult about the death of Christ. A little before the fourth, the twelve after they had preached a year in all the cities, returned to Christ; {{and at the same time}} Herod beheaded John in prison, after he had been in prison two years and a quarter: and thereupon Christ fled into the desart for fear of Herod. The fourth Christ went not up to Jerusalem for fear of the Jews, who at the Passover before had consulted his death, and because his time was not yet come. Thenceforward therefore till the <b>feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tabernacles</b> he walked in Galilee, and that secretly for fear of Herod: and after the <b>feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tabernacles</b> he returned no more into Galilee, but sometimes was at Jerusalem, and sometimes retired beyond Jordan, or to the city Ephraim by the wilderness, till the Passover in which he was betrayed, apprehended, and crucified.|$|E

Pentecost was a feast of the first-fruits of the harvest. The <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tabernacles</b> was a great national harvest home. The Passover itself, though not at first an agricultural festival, became one by the waving of the Paschal sheaf, which gave permission to the people to begin their spring-harvest--so thoroughly were they to be an agricultural and cattle-feeding people. They were going into a good land, a land of milk and honey and oil olive; a land of vines and figs and pomegranates; a rich land; but a most uncertain land--a land which might yield a splendid crop one year, and be almost barren the next.|$|E
