50|$|The {{minimum wage}} was {{introduced}} in 1998 to combat the problem of in-work poverty and inequality. The act established {{for the first time}} in the UK a minimum hourly rate of pay. In order, to guarantee that workers received the wage an enforcement structure was created using two methods. These were worker-led Industrial Tribunal claims and the minimum wage enforcement teams (Inland Revenue). Few workers have used the employment tribunals to recover money because many victims of breach of minimum wage are vulnerable, for example, ethnic minorities, youth, uneducated and non-unionsed workers. A more likely channel of action is the minimum wage enforcement teams, which are run by the Inland Revenue. These teams have a number of powers including power of entry into workplaces and seizure of employers' records. In order to enforce these regulations through a ‘pyramid of sanctions’, which include: <b>enforcement</b> <b>order,</b> penalty enforcement and prosecution under criminal law. The <b>enforcement</b> <b>order</b> requests the employer to repay the worker any underpayment. If the employer refuses to comply with this requirement, penalty enforcement is issued which orders the firm to not only repay the worker (s), but to also pay a substantial fine. However, if the employer still refuses payment, as a consequence they will face prosecution under criminal law. This action can, however be seen as ineffective as only two companies have ever been prosecuted for such offences. The low rates of enforcement action are demonstrated below.|$|E

As a result, when a plaintiff wins a case involving the transfer of a domain name, and the defendant is unwilling to voluntarily transfer the domain name, the plaintiff may seek to enforce the judgment in rem by obtaining an <b>enforcement</b> <b>order</b> directing Verisign to transfer the domain name. See, for example, Office Depot v.

Broadcast Service, 380 U.S. 255, 85 S.Ct. 876, 13 L.Ed.2d 789 (1965),3 the Court of Appeals disagreed with the Board and decided that on the facts presented Kiewit and South Prairie were a single [...] "employer." [...] It reasoned {{that in addition to}} the [...] "presence of a very substantial qualitative degree of centralized control of labor relations," [...] the facts [...] "evidence a substantial qualitative degree of interrelation of operations and common management one that we are satisfied would not be found in the arm's length relationship existing among unintegrated companies". 171 U.S.App.D.C. 102, 108, 109, 518 F.2d 1040, 1046, 1047 (1975). The Board's finding to the contrary was, therefore, {{in the view of the}} Court of Appeals [...] "not warranted by the record." [...] Id., at 109, 518 F.2d, at 1047.The Court of Appeals was evidently of the view that since the Board dismissed the complaint it had necessarily decided that the employees of Kiewit and South Prairie would not constitute an appropriate bargaining unit under § 9. But while the Board's opinion referred to its cases in this area and included a finding that [...] "the employees of each constitute a separate bargaining unit," [...] 206 N.L.R.B. 562, 563 (1973), its brief discussion was set in the context of what it obviously considered was the dispositive issue, namely, whether the two firms were separate employers. We think a fair reading of its decision discloses that it did not address the [...] "unit" [...] question on the basis of any assumption, Arguendo, that it might have been wrong on the threshold [...] "employer" [...] issue.In foreclosing the Board from the opportunity to determine the appropriate bargaining unit under §9, the Court of Appeals did not give [...] "due observance (to) the distribution of authority made by Congress as between its power to regulate commerce and the reviewing power which it has conferred upon the courts under Article III of the Constitution." [...] FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 1940 USSC 15; 309 U.S. 134, 1411940 USSC 15; , 60 S.Ct. 437, 4401940 USSC 15; , 84 L.Ed. 656, 661 (1940).The petitions for certiorari are accordingly granted, and that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeals which set aside the determination of the Board on the question of whether Kiewit and South Prairie were a single employer is affirmed. That part of the judgment which held that the two firms' employees constituted the appropriate bargaining unit for purposes of the Act, and which directed the Board to issue an <b>enforcement</b> <b>order,</b> is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for proceedings consistent with this opinion.|$|E
