5|$|At Christmas, Kurt elects {{not to go}} back home, and so {{his father}} comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and {{spend some time with}} him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has {{prostate}} cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine <b>hook</b> <b>up,</b> leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.|$|E

We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> with one of our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E
5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will diverge, and follow {{different}} routes. The inbound track will <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> with the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} metallic colour is green, but {{can vary}} by region, ranging from metallic green to purple. In the Flinders Ranges of South Australia and Alice Springs, the colour of the ants shifts from the typical green {{to a dark}} purple colour. In areas with more rainfall such as the New South Wales tablelands and Victorian savannahs, green-head ants are mostly green with purplish tints seen {{on the sides of}} the mesosoma. In the northern regions of New South Wales and Queensland, the alitrunk is reddish-violet, which shades into golden around the lower portions of the pleura. The green colour is either limited or completely absent in this case. Most populations have a bright green gaster, except for those living in the central desert. In some areas examined near Brisbane, two different colour forms were discovered within a single colony. One possibility is that the two colour forms may represent two sibling species, but this cannot be confirmed because of lack of evidence. In far north Queensland, populations appear to be dull green and distinct to those living in the south, but it is unknown how the ants in the far north and south <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> at the western and southern regions of the Atherton Tableland. With this said, it is unknown if the far north populations are actually a different species. In addition to colour variation, there are morphological differences among populations. For example, the size and shape of the head and petiole, the length of the appendages, and other sculptural details of the body may all vary.|$|E

40|$|Love {{experiences}} have changed along time and have set new meanings, especially for young people. Thus, this qualitative research aimed at understanding {{the meanings of}} love relationships, <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> and dating in the vision of ten adolescents between 17 and 23 years old using a questionnaire. The results revealed that the <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> is permeated by kisses, fondling and even by sexual intercourse {{in a short period}} of time and often through the intermediary of a friend at the time of the conquest. The commitment of dating, on the other hand, is established when love is present in the relationship. Therefore, adolescents revealed that opt for dating, which can begin in the <b>hooking</b> <b>up.</b> However, in the opinion of the participants, the young people's preference nowadays is the <b>hooking</b> <b>up...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between substance use, <b>hooking</b> <b>up,</b> and the context in which it occurs. It was hypothesized that the social setting would moderate the relationship between <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> and alcohol, marijuana, and hard drug use. The convenience sample included 356 college students between the ages of 18 - 24. Participants completed an online survey about their frequency of attendance at different party types, as well as frequency of substance use and frequency of sexual behavior at these parties. Responses were recorded on seven-point, semantic differential scales. Findings show that the social setting has no moderation on alcohol and <b>hooking</b> <b>up,</b> partial moderation on marijuana and <b>hooking</b> <b>up,</b> and full moderation on hard drug use and <b>hooking</b> <b>up.</b> The discussion is focused on the dangers of risky hook-ups and substance use, particularly in certain social settings, and how these results can be used for educational and preventative efforts regarding sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancies, and negative emotional effects.

Neitherfamilystructurenornumberofstructure transitionswere related to the number of hookup partners in the past 12 months. Having an avoidant attachment, being an underclassman, con-suming more alcohol, and not being in an exclusive relationship were related to having a greater number of hookup partners, and avoidant attachment was a stronger indicator of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> for men than for women. Among those who had <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> in the past 12 months (63. 8 %), family structure did not significantly differentiate those havingapenetrative sexhookup(i. e., oral sex and/or intercourse) versus a non-penetrative sex hookup (i. e., kissingand/or sexual touchingonly).

25|$|Toon Boom Animation's Toon Boom Harmony {{software}} {{was used as}} the main software package for the production of the film, as the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) system that Disney developed with Pixar in the 1980s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become outdated.

25|$|In a {{conventional}} design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires the core {{to shut down}} and the pressure vessel to be opened. Due to the arrangement used in CANDU, only the single tube being refuelled needs to be depressurized. This allows the CANDU system to be continually refuelled without shutting down, another major design goal. In modern systems, two robotic machines <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> to the reactor faces and open the end caps of a pressure tube. One machine pushes in the new fuel, whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking fuel bundle can {{be removed from the}} core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary cooling loop.|$|E
