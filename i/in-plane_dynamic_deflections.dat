40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{behaviors}} of triangular honeycombs cores (THCs) are investigated {{by using the}} finite element (FE) simulations under the <b>in-plane</b> <b>dynamic</b> crushing loadings. With the increasing impact velocities, different deformation modes are observed and the kinetic energy of specimen increases rapidly. The <b>in-plane</b> <b>dynamic</b> plateau stress {{is the sum of}} the static plateau stress and the dynamic enhancement due to the inertia effect. The static plateau stress has been discussed in Part I. When all configuration parameters are kept constant, the dynamic enhancement stress is proportional to the square of impact velocity. For a given impact velocity, the dynamic enhancement stress is proportional to the density of THCs when the expanding angle is kept constant. The <b>in-plane</b> <b>dynamic</b> plateau stress is expressed empirically in terms of configuration parameters and impact velocity...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimation}} of the runway pavement deflection during landing for design purposes has been a challenging problem for engineers. This paper presents a simple analytical model to predict <b>dynamic</b> <b>deflection</b> of a runway pavement at touchdown point caused by a landing gear load during aircraft landing. Three independent parameters, {{modulus of subgrade reaction}} (k s), contact pressure (p), and vertical component of aircraft velocity (v v), are required to estimate the deflection using this model. This model shows that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>deflection</b> increases with an increase in vertical velocity and contact pressure. These observations follow an expected trend and the field observations made during inspection of the runways. Likewise, the impact factor, which is defined as the ratio of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>deflection</b> to static deflection, also increases with an increase in vertical velocity for a given value of the contact pressure. Irrespective of contact pressure values, the impact factor for zero vertical velocity is 2 under elastic runway pavement conditions.

The <b>in-plane</b> <b>dynamic</b> crushing behaviors of the honeycombs with various cell-wall angles are studied by means of explicit dynamic finite element simulation. The influences of the cell-wall angle, the impact velocity, and the edge thickness on the macro/microdeformation behaviors, the plateau stresses, and the specific energy absorption of auxetic honeycombs are discussed in detail. Numerical results show, that except for the impact velocity and the edge thickness, the <b>in-plane</b> <b>dynamic</b> performances of auxetic honeycombs also rely on the cell-wall angle. The “> <”-mode local deformation bands form under low- or moderate-velocity impacting, which results in lateral compression shrinkage and shows negative Poisson's ratio during the crushing. For the given impact velocity, the plateau stress at the proximal end and the energy-absorbed ability can be improved by increasing the negative cell angle, the relative density, the impact velocity, and the matrix material strength. When the microcell parameters are the constant, the plateau stresses are proportional to the square of impact velocity...|$|R

40|$|The pavement-subgrade {{interaction}} {{is an important}} issue in the concrete pavement design. The present study focuses on the analysis of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>deflection</b> and the velocity response of airport concrete pavements to impact loading. The pavement-subgrade {{interaction is}} simplified as a linear viscoelastic model, in which the subgrade is composed of two layers (a base layer and a soil layer). The subgrade's synthetical modulus and damping coefficient are obtained by the method of weighed mean. Through the Fourier and the Laplace transform the solution of the equilibrium equation of the pavement-subgrade system is deduced and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>deflection</b> solution of the pavement-subgrade system is obtained. In this study, an impact aircraft landing load increasing proportional to the aircraft vertical landing acceleration is considered. A Matlab program is compiled based on the solution to assess the influence of various system parameters (slab thickness h, slab size, subgrade reaction modulus Ks and subgrade damping factor C 0) on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>deflections</b> of the pavement slab. The influence of h and Ks on the dynamic velocity response of the slab is also discussed. The results show that changing the damping factor and the subgrade reaction modulus has only a small influence on the deflection of the slab and the deflection, while the amplitude of velocity response and the frequency of velocity responses all decrease with the increase of the slab thickness. If the pavement slab size is decreased, the deflection {{at the center of the}} slab will decrease. A nonlinear relationship can be established between h and the maximum deflection, while linear relationships exist between C 0 and the maximum deflection, as well as Ks and the maximum deflection. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
