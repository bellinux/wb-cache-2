Since such disparity exists in the USA too, the subject of the study is the analysis of the relation between agricultural and non-agricultural incomes and of the causes of income disparity. The analysis leads {{to the conclusion that the}} narrowing of the gap between the <b>incomes</b> <b>per</b> <b>head</b> of farm and non-farm population is due to the growing off-farm incomes received by the farm population. The disparity between incomes from farming and from non-farm sources has not yet disappeared. The main cause of income disparity is not the difference in productivity in agriculture and in the rest of the economy, but the unfavourable tendencies in the level of prices received and paid by the farmers. Since one of the principal aims of the American agricultural policy is the rise of agricultural incomes level and the narrowing of the disparity between incomes received from farming and from other occupations, it can by said, that in this respect the American agricultural policy appears ineffective.

Risks to growth remain, however, stemming from high private debt levels, weak foreign demand, large external imbalances, volatile terms of trade, a severe drought and an exchange rate that appears overvalued. The main structural challenge will be to create the conditions that encourage resources to shift towards more sustainable sources of prosperity. <b>Incomes</b> <b>per</b> <b>head</b> are well below the OECD average, and productivity growth has been sluggish for a long time.

40|$|This paper {{rejects the}} {{characterization}} of globalization as an autonomous and irresistible process driven by the impersonal forces {{of the market and}} technical progress. Whether domestic or global, market forces are shaped and controlled by policy choices and the institutional frameworks in which they are made. In the absence of adequate institutional frameworks and productive capacities, rapid liberalization is as likely to lead to stagnation and unemployment as to growth and rising <b>incomes</b> <b>per</b> <b>head.</b> We show that the major economic forces presumed to be crucial for spreading the benefits of globalization have been less global than often presented, have proved to be much weaker than widely predicted and carry potentially damaging effects as well as benefits. Accordingly, and without denying that by the late 1970 s many developing countries needed to find new ways of inserting themselves into the international economy, we argue that the new policy orientation of macroeconomic stringency, downsizing the public sector and the rapid opening of developing country markets to foreign trade and capital after the debt crisis, has failed to produce an economic environment that supports faster economic growth and strengthens productivity performance. In suggesting the outlines of a more strategic approach to economic development the emphasis is on the need for domestic investment to be mobilized as the basis for industrialization and for a gradual approach to integration with the global economy. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{good deal}} of {{research}} into the likely future structure of the New Zealand economy {{has been carried out}} in the Agricultural Economics Research Unit. The aim has been to provide realistic quantitative sectoral targets or guidelines to centralised policy making bodies to assist in planning future economic growth in New Zealand. This type of exercise has often been referred to as indicative planning. Until now, the work has entailed the use of an input-output projection model which {{has come to be known}} as the Lincoln Model. Briefly, the procedure is to calculate for some future year an economic structure which satisfies the inter-industry relationships and which achieves an exogenously specified increase in the base year consumption level. Economic structure in this context means: the level of output of each sector of the model, the level of exports from each sector, the level of investment by each sector, the level of importing of current and capital goods by each sector. Whenever the Lincoln model has been discussed there has usually been some mention of the optimum economic structure. It has been said that the structure is optimum when resources are so allocated between sectors that the highest level of net national product <b>per</b> <b>head</b> is achieved, consistent with the maintenance of overseas balance of payments equilibrium, full employment and a reasonable growth in <b>incomes</b> <b>per</b> <b>head.</b> While many would question this definition, it is probably a reasonable basis on which to begin investigations into the best future shape of the economy and it is certainly where scrutiny of the projected structure should begin. It has also been suggested that the most efficient method of investigating the nature of an optimum structure is by the use of mathematical programming methods. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how the linear programming technique might be used to calculate the optimum economic structure, although it has been found necessary to modify the definition quoted above. Instead of accepting an exogenous target for consumption, programming is used to calculate the maximum level of consumption consistent with the inter-industry relationships and resource availabilities. The need to formulate linear functions has prevented optimisation of consumption <b>per</b> <b>head</b> which would be more acceptable theoretically...|$|R
40|$|Income inequalities and {{subjective}} well-being have been increasingly {{identified in the}} literature as important measures of socio-economic cohesion. This is particularly relevant for developing economies that are typically characterised by strong population growth and relatively low <b>incomes</b> <b>per</b> <b>head.</b> Although in those economies a considerable share of resources is derived from rural areas, data availability for these regions is often an issue which precludes important insights into the overall socio-economic tissue of the developing world. This dissertation seeks to advance our knowledge on various aspects of inequalities and well-being with particular emphasis on rural Pakistan. At {{the core of the}} present monograph lie three chapters that deal with income inequality, subjective well-being as well as physical well-being (i. e. health). The empirical analysis is based on a unique survey dataset that covers the four provinces of rural Pakistan. The dissertation seeks to contribute to the existing literature in several dimensions. We decompose overall income inequality by its different types to disentangle which sources of income are inequality-increasing and which ones reduce socio-economic divergence. The empirical measurement and assessment of both subjective and physical well-being in rural Pakistan is a rather novel aspect. We introduce and examine different well-being measures as indicators of (subjective) poverty and find that well-being in rural areas is largely driven by financial factors. When it comes to health, however, overall results are less clear-cut. The thesis is therefore able to offer several policy recommendations for important socio-economic factors in rural Pakistan. On a more general note, some of the results discussed might also illuminate the policy debate in other geographic areas with similar characteristics...|$|R

Investment priorities implied by various equity and efficiency criteria are quite at variance. It doet not follow that there is allways a conflict between equity and efficiency. This is not the case in the group of regions with a low supply of public capital and un acceptable return to investment. The contribution of infrastructure police to the reduction of regional disequality in Spain during the period analysed has been very small (around 1 %). The assignation of FEDER transfers has proven to be clearly a redistributive criterion. The impact of these funds has been considerable, although limited by the small volume of available resources. According to our results, FEDER has reduced dispersion of regional income in Spain, for the most optimistic scenario, around 5 %, a figure which represents approximately one third of the total reduction in regional disequality during the decade of the eighties...|$|R

Convergence of <b>incomes</b> or ofGDPs <b>per</b> <b>head</b> is an important issue in growth theory. Some models of international trade imply the convergence of factor prices across countries. The European Union treaty includes some convergence rules on interest, exchange and inflation rates, and on budget deficits, for countries to enter a. monetary union. This thesis starts by reviewing this literature. These developments are accompanied by a number of empirical studies concerning the issue of measuring and testing for convergence. Proposed methods and provided results are in apparent contradiction. They are critically surveyed in Chapter 2. The aforementioned disparate results constitute one of the main motivations for the systematic evaluation of the different methods. This is done resorting to simulation techniques using artificial data. Different techniques are assessed considering a number of different patterns of convergence. Chapters 3 to 7 include several experiments considering unconditional and conditional convergence, convergence clubs, limited and time-varying convergence as the true data generation process. Their results allow a better understanding of previous empirical studies and of the comparative advantages and weaknesses of different tests. In general terms, cross-sectional methods are not very reliable in the presence of cross-sectional heterogeneity. Time series methods do not share this disadvantage. A Kalman filter method is more robust to a time-varying speed of convergence when compared to cointegration techniques. The thesis includes an empirical investigation on the convergence of GDPs <b>per</b> <b>head</b> across 16 industrialised countries using annual data from 1890 to 1989 (Chapter 8).
