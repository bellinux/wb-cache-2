25|$|The Northwich Public Baths was {{constructed}} following subsidence of the Verdin Park swimming pool. The project was sanctioned on 16 September 1913 {{with a budget}} of £11,732 payable over 26 years. It was insured for £10,500. Brunner Mond & Co sanctioned the supply of 10,000 gallons of brine per week. London architect, Mr Franck, who had considerable experience in public baths construction , was handed the reins of project management. A great mass of running sand underneath the construction site was discovered and the architect advised {{that it was necessary}} {{for the construction of a}} <b>ferro-concrete</b> raft under the whole site, at an additional cost of £3000.|$|E
25|$|Mr A. Hardy of Woking, {{with his}} company Hardy & Co., was the {{contractor}} {{for the construction}} of the second phase of The King's Hall in 1912–1913. The main challenge in this project was the ground work, since a large mass of the cliff had to be removed. The firm had already carried out previous works for the Council amounting to £20,000, plus important projects for the councils of Strood, Frimley, Farnham, Woking and Chertsey. Other council works carried out in 1913 were for Kirkby, Portsmouth, Woking and Blean. In 1913 the company accepted a £30,000 contract for whitstable's town main drainage works complete with house, pumping station and outfall works. In respect of The King's Hall, all the ground-work, <b>ferro-concrete</b> work and decorative work was done under supervision of P. Taylor and G. Breward.|$|E
25|$|Fort de la Malmaison {{lay on the}} Chemin-des-Dames {{ridge and}} had been built {{as part of an}} entrenched camp north of the Aisne, in the Séré de Rivières system, {{designed}} by General Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières and built from the 1870s. The fort was in the northern angle between the Chemin-des-Dames and the Soissons–Laon road. The fortress casemates were tested with high explosives in 1887 and found to be insufficiently robust. Steel reinforced concrete had been added but in 1913, the fort was sold to a Laon contractor, to demolish and use the materials to build new barracks in town. A long tunnel, the Montparnasse Quarry lay on the northern slopes below the fort, on the route to Chavignon village {{at the foot of the}} ridge. The quarry was big enough to shelter an infantry brigade. The fort was to the north-west of the quarry, on the summit of the plateau at the western end of the ridge and the dismantled work was surrounded by a moat filled with mud. The subterranean galleries had been rebuilt and garrisoned by the Germans in September 1914, the outworks and interior being provided with several <b>ferro-concrete</b> machine-gun nests. From the ramparts, the Germans could see all movement from the Ailette to the Aisne and on the spurs running down to the Aisne from the Chemin-des-Dames ridge.|$|E
500|$|Keswick's history {{throughout}} the 20th century {{was one of}} increasing reliance on tourism, the pencil industry being the second largest source of employment. The Cumberland Pencil Company, formed {{at the turn of}} the century, occupied a large factory near the River Greta on the road leading out of Keswick towards Cockermouth. The conservation movement continued to develop; Rawnsley led successful campaigns to save the medieval Greta and Portinscale bridges from replacement with <b>ferro-concrete</b> structures; and the National Trust continued to acquire land locally. In the First World War Keswick lost many of its young men: the war memorial near Fitz Park commemorates 117 names, from a population at the time of less than 4,500. By the 1930s Keswick was firmly established as the main centre of tourism in Cumberland and Westmorland. An article in The Manchester Guardian in 1934 called it [...] "the capital of the Lake District", and continued: ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1914 (1915 in some sources), a [...] long {{replacement}} {{bridge was}} opened. Designed by R.F. Moore, the designer of Grafton Bridge, {{it was also}} built by the same company, the <b>Ferro-Concrete</b> Company of Australasia (in a time when almost all bridges in the country were being built by the Public Works Department). This <b>ferro-concrete</b> bridge with driven concrete piles was considered a substantial engineering achievement in its time. With a width of 11.6m, it allowed for a double tram track. The bridge however did not provide for enough clearance to let anything but small boats pass under it. In World War II, an anti-tank road block was erected on the bridge near {{the middle of the}} spans, with a small sentry shelter close by. These structures were later removed, and it is unclear whether the bridge had also been mined.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977 Liepāja {{was awarded}} the Order of the October Revolution for heroic defense against Nazi Germany in 1941. Five {{residents}} were awarded the honorary title Hero of Socialist Labor: Anatolijs Filatkins, Artūrs Fridrihsons, Voldemārs Lazdups, Valentins Šuvajevs and Otīlija Žagata. Because of {{the rapid growth of}} the city's population, a shortage of apartment houses resulted. To resolve this, the Soviet government organized development of most of the modern Liepāja districts: Dienvidrietumi, Ezerkrasts, Ziemeļu priekšpilsēta, Zaļā birze and Tosmare. The majority of these blocks were constructed of <b>ferro-concrete</b> panels in standard projects designed by the state Latgyprogorstroy Institute (...) [...] In 1986 the new central city hospital in Zaļa birze was opened.|$|E
2500|$|The Grebbeline by {{that time}} had been largely {{constructed}} behind vast inundations, after which a front line lay that was composed of classic trench works mixed with ferro and <b>ferro-concrete</b> bunkers of light and medium grade. The front-line trenches had hardly any depth and contained only half a battalion of infantry per single km of stretched line. Behind this front-line was a second row of trenches which had the function of a blocking defence should the front-line be penetrated. Reserves could be thrown in from this line and behind it were battalion and regimental CP's as well as forward light artillery positions. More to the rear were the medium and heavy artillery positions as well as divisional reserves.|$|E
2500|$|This {{involved}} {{creating a}} new junction at Bleach Green where the Larne and Loop Lines diverged. The former main line from Greenisland Junction was singled and joined the new Main Line at a new connection, Mossley Junction, {{to the east of}} Mossley station. The old main line became known as the [...] "Back Line". The ruling gradient on the Loop Line was 1 in 75 which could only be achieved by excavating and lowering a section of the existing Main Line near Mossley station. The new lines were carried over Valentine's Glen on imposing <b>ferro-concrete</b> viaducts. The smaller of these curved to the east from Bleach Green Junction as a burrowing junction passing under a skew span of the larger Main Line viaduct which curved westwards. The old masonry Main Line viaduct was retained to carry what had become the up Larne Line.|$|E
2500|$|Melton {{manufactured}} <b>ferro-concrete</b> fence posts, {{then from}} 1915, signal posts. During World War I, Marriott {{was asked by}} the Government to develop building blocks for postwar housing (as there has been bombing). Although concrete had been used before on the railways, William mass-produced it and made everything out of concrete. There were many patents produced relating to developments in concrete sleepers, chairs and signal posts. When the original Holt station burnt down, Melton concrete works produced a new concrete station. Today there are still many examples of the concrete products, including the lamp posts at Sheringham station on the North Norfolk Railway and the station sign at West Runton railway station. Cromer signal box base is made of Melton concrete. After 1916, the M used the concrete blocks for box construction, however only Cromer Beach was built to this design. Gedney railway station ...|$|E
2500|$|The main {{manner of}} this type of field {{fortification}} was to close potential vehicular transport and attack routes with multiplied anti-tank ditches, hedgehogs, dragon's teeth and mine fields. These obstacle-zone are followed by a quite small but peculiarly complex system of ditches and barbed wire obstacles, which protects the anti-tank barrier against sappers, bridge-layer tanks and engineer teams. The semi-mobile engagement is the main point, soldiers fight in open firing positions, while bunkers served as only shelters during bombardments. Thus it is possible to quickly reallocate between the points of defense (manpower not locked in pillboxes), and counterattacks feasible by defense force. The main defense line usually lies at hilltop {{on the edge of a}} forest, divided into circularly defensible independent subsectors (platoon size) which allow a full 360° arc of fire. A sector includes 3 (or more) trench-rings and no more than a few <b>ferro-concrete</b> shelters surrounded by a wide zone of anti-personnel obstacles and 2 (or more) [...] "V" [...] or [...] "U" [...] shaped anti-tank trenches or dragon's teeth. 3-4 independent sectors connect by communication trenches into a defensive zone or fortress (company or battalion size).|$|E
2500|$|In 1913 the Pavilion was {{developed}} as a memorial to the late King Edward VII. The architect was again the Council surveyor F.W.J. Palmer who presented his plans in April 1911. [...] The Council applied to the Local Government Board (LGB) for a loan, and the work cost £6,000: £5,000 for the excavation and construction; £1,000 for furnishings. £5,956 was received from the LGB in August 1912. The builders were Hardy & Co. of Woking whose tender of £5,578 on 16 September 1912 was accepted for the erection work, {{and one of the}} contractors was electricity company Hunt & Sons of Charles Street, Herne Bay, who ran a cable underground from their works, beneath Canterbury Road and through the cliff. The entertainers Rouse, Way & Wilson made an advance investment of £700 in the theatre, the profits to be shared by the Council. The excavation commenced in October 1912, and [...] "many thousands of yards of London Clay" [...] were removed to extend the building into the cliff. The 1904 building was incorporated and extended as a theatre, concert hall and dance hall below the Downs on East Cliff, and the existing small auditorium became the vestibule for the new hall. The 1913 Hall was designed to accommodate 1,500, with 1,100 in the open-air theatre on the roof. The high price for this build partly reflects the large excavation into the cliff for the Hall, and the early use of <b>ferro-concrete,</b> with steel bars made by the Spiral Bond Bar Company, who had patented the process that they used in the same year. The building was specially designed not to interfere with the view from houses on Beacon Hill to the south; nevertheless a [...] flagstaff was erected between the Hall and the Beacon Hill estate.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the Princess arrived at the Hall, the {{roadside}} crowds had gathered at the site, where the Fusiliers were playing in the bandstand, the 6th Dragoon guard of honour was marshalled at the south-east corner, and all the local schoolchildren were {{lined up on the}} north side, including New College cadets, Herne Bay College cadets from St George's Terrace, the Scouts and Guides, and the Council scholars in red, white and blue caps and waving flags. On the east and west sides of the building were beflagged grandstands full of members of the public, and there was a dais for the Princess and VIPs on the north side. As the Princess arrived, the National Anthem was played yet again, then the children sang it unaccompanied (following much rehearsal). On display were uniformed Scouts and Guides, members of the National Reserve, Army and Navy veterans wearing their medals and [...] "Friendly Society men in their distinctive regalia" [...] There were speeches by various dignitaries. The enrobed Clerk of the Council read and presented a crested and illuminated address, inscribed on vellum and scrolled on an ivory roller, to the Princess. The address was presented in a <b>ferro-concrete</b> casket to match the fabric of the Hall's 1913 build:The casket was rectangular in form, embellished with wrought, silver framing, surmounted by chiselled silver ornaments. On the front of the casket, in a panel of wrought silver, appeared the arms of Her Royal Highness; while on the reverse side were the arms of the Herne Bay Urban District Council. The whole was surmounted by a silver crown. [...] On the front of the sloping lid was a silver plate inscribed, Presented by the town of Herne Bay, July 10th, AD 1913. [...] The interior was lined with silver-grey velvet.
