50|$|A urine sensor is a {{necessary}} part of any bedwetting alarm. A basic urine sensor consists of two <b>electricity</b> <b>conductors</b> separated by moisture absorbing insulating material. A low DC electric voltage, provided by batteries, is applied across these conductors. This low voltage is usually about 3 volts, {{so as not to be}} dangerous to the user. When this insulating material (frequently cotton cloth as in common briefs) absorbs urine, it allows electricity to pass through it and between the conductors, resulting in a small electric current in the conductors. The conductors are attached to an alarm device, which triggers an alarm when it senses this current. Most sensors and alarms are engineered based on this concept. Note that unless the urine reaches the sensor mechanism and adequately wets the briefs (or insulator between the conductors), the urine may not be sensed and the alarm will not activate. Sensors are usually classified in terms of their attachment mechanisms to the briefs or other urine absorbing medium. The major sensor attachment categories are mechanical clips, sticky tape or pads for flat surface sensors, magnetic attachment, and wiring sewed into special briefs.|$|R

"From the {{conductor}} of an electrical machine suspend, by a wire or chain, a small metallic ball (one of wood covered with tinfoil); {{and under the}} ball place a rather wide metallic basin, containing some oil of turpentine, at the distance of about three-quarters of an inch. If {{the handle of the}} machine be now turned slowly, the liquid in the basin will begin to move in different directions and form whirlpools. As the <b>electricity</b> on the <b>conductor</b> accumulates, the troubled liquid will elevate itself in the centre, and at last become attached to the ball. Draw off the <b>electricity</b> from the <b>conductor,</b> to let the liquid resume its position; a portion of the turpentine remains attached to the ball. Turn the handle again very slowly, and observe now the few drops adhering to the ball assume a conical shape, with the apex downward; while the liquid under it assumes also a conical shape, the apex upward, until both meet. As the liquid does not accumulate on the ball, there must necessarily be as great a current downward as upward, giving the column of liquid a rapid circular motion, which continues until the <b>electricity</b> from the <b>conductor</b> is nearly all discharged silently, or until it is discharged by a spark descending into the liquid. The same phenomena take place with oil or water. Using the latter liquid, the ball must be brought much nearer, or a much greater quantity of electricity is necessary to raise it.|$|R

40|$|Powerlines are {{important}} {{in the process of}} electricity transmission and distribution (T & D) and their essential role in transmitting electricity from the large generating stations to the final consumers cannot be over emphasized. Over the years, an increase in the demand for electrical energy (electricity) has led to the construction and inevitable use of high transmission voltage, sub-transmission voltage and distribution voltage power conducting lines, for the electricity T & D process. Along with this essential role, <b>electricity</b> <b>conductors</b> can also give rise to some electrically related effects such as interference with telecommunication circuits, electric shocks, electromagnetic fields, audible noise, corona ion discharges, etc. The presence of powerline generated corona ions in any ambient air environment can be associated with the local modification of the earth’s natural dc electric field (e-field), while the interactions between these ions and other airborne aerosol particles can be associated with the presence of charged aerosol particles in the environment of the corona ion emitting lines. When considering all the studies conducted to date on the possible direct and indirect effects of high voltage powerlines (HVPLs), of significant interest are those suggesting links between powerlines and some adverse human health effects – with such health effects alleged to be strongest amongst populations directly exposed to HVPLs. However, despite the numerous studies conducted on HVPLs, to date a lack of proper scientific understanding still exist in terms of the physical characterization of the electrical environment surrounding real-world HVPLs - mostly in terms of the entire dynamics of ions and charged particles, as well as the possible links/associations between the different parameters that characterize these electrical environments. Yet, gaining a sound understanding about the electrical environment surrounding energized real-world HVPLs is imperative for the accurate assessment of any possible human exposure or health effects that may be associated with powerlines. The research work presented in this thesis was motivated by the existing gaps in scientific understanding of the possible association between corona ions generated by real-world HVPLs and the production of ambient charged aerosol particles. The aim {{of this study was to}} supply some much needed scientific knowledge about the characteristics of the electrical environment surrounding real-world energized HVPLs. This was achieved by investigating the possible effects of corona ions generated by real-world overhead HVPLs on ambient aerosol particle number concentration level, ambient aerosol particle charge concentration level, ambient ion concentration level and the magnitude of the local vertical dc e-field; while also taking into consideration the possible effect of complex meteorological factors (such as temperature, pressure, wind speed wind direction, solar radiation and humidity) on the instantaneous value of these measured parameters, at different powerline sites. The existence of possible associations or links between these various parameters measured in the proximity of the powerlines was statistically investigated using simple linear regression, correlation and multivariate (principal component, factor, classification and regression tree-CART) analysis. The strength of the regression was tested with coefficient of determinations R 2, while statistical significance was asserted at the 95...|$|R
30|$|One {{limitation}} of this method is {{that the amount of}} heat dissipated is reduced as the quantity of water decreases and in case the majority of water is converted into steam as a result of heating. One suggestion is to use water injection along with this method (Harvey et al. 1979). According to Akfhampour (1985), commercially available mineral insulated (MI) cables can be used for producing heat. In this method brine is not needed to conduct <b>electricity</b> instead, two <b>conductors</b> insulated with graphite and polymer are used for the purpose. With the rise of temperature, the mineral resistance also increases which in turn increases the temperature even more. A self-regulating mechanism is achieved which prevents from overheating. These heater wires are available in lengths ranging from 300 to 1, 000  m and are suitable for use in horizontal and shallow reservoirs for heating purpose. The source required for this purpose is 480  V AC.|$|R
60|$|The law thus {{strongly}} indicated admits of corroboration by the Method of Concomitant Variations. The Leyden jar {{is capable}} of receiving a much higher charge than can ordinarily {{be given to the}} conductor of an electrical machine. Now {{in the case of the}} Leyden jar, the metallic surface which receives the induced <b>electricity</b> is a <b>conductor</b> exactly similar to that which receives the primary charge, and is therefore as susceptible of receiving and retaining the one electricity, as the opposite surface of receiving and retaining the other; but in the machine, the neighboring body which is to be oppositely electrified is the surrounding atmosphere, or any body casually brought near to the conductor; and as these are generally much inferior in their capacity of becoming electrified, to the conductor itself, their limited power imposes a corresponding limit to the capacity of the conductor for being charged. As the capacity of the neighboring body for supporting the opposition increases, a higher charge becomes possible: and to this appears to be owing the great superiority of the Leyden jar.|$|R
6000|$|... 78. I had {{occasion}} in {{the commencement of}} this paper (2.) to refer to an experiment by Ampère, {{as one of those}} dependent upon the electrical induction of currents made prior to the present investigation, and have arrived at conclusions which seem to imply doubts of the accuracy of the experiment (62. &c.); it is therefore due to M. Ampère that I should attend to it more distinctly. When a disc of copper (says M. Ampère) was suspended by a silk thread and surrounded by a helix or spiral, and when the charge of a powerful voltaic battery was sent through the spiral, a strong magnet at the same time being presented to the copper disc, the latter turned at the moment to take a position of equilibrium, exactly as the spiral itself would have turned had it been free to move. I {{have not been able to}} obtain this effect, nor indeed any motion; but the cause of my failure in the latter point may be due to the momentary existence of the current not allowing time for the inertia of the plate to be overcome (11. 12.). M. Ampère has perhaps succeeded in obtaining motion from the superior delicacy and power of his electro-magnetical apparatus, or he may have obtained only the motion due to cessation of action. But all my results tend to invert the sense of the proposition stated by M. Ampère, [...] "that a current of electricity tends to put the <b>electricity</b> of <b>conductors</b> near which it passes in motion in the same direction," [...] for they indicate an opposite direction for the produced current (26. 53.); and they show that the effect is momentary, and that it is also produced by magnetic induction, and that certain other extraordinary effects follow thereupon.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conductor}} {{offers a}} certain resistance, akin to friction, to {{the displacement of}} electricity, and heat is developed in the conductor, proportional to {{the square of the}} current(as already stated herein), which current flows as long as the impelling electric force continues. This resistance may be likened to that met with by a ship as it displaces in the water in its progress. The resistance of the dielectric is of a different nature and has been compared to the compression of multitudes of springs, which, under compression, yield with an increasing back pressure, up to a point where the total back pressure equals the initial pressure. When the initial pressure is withdrawn the energy expended in compressing the [...] "springs" [...] is returned to the circuit, concurrently with the return of the springs to their original condition, this producing a reaction in the opposite direction. Consequently, the current due to the displacement of <b>electricity</b> in a <b>conductor</b> may be continuous, while the displacement currents in a dielectric are momentary and, in a circuit or medium which contains but little resistance compared with capacity or inductance reaction, the currents of discharge are of an oscillatory or alternating nature.|$|R
60|$|Since common or machine electricity, and voltaic electricity, may be {{considered}} for the present purpose to be identical, Faraday wished to know whether, as the prime <b>conductor</b> develops opposite <b>electricity</b> upon a <b>conductor</b> in its vicinity, so a voltaic current running along a wire would induce an opposite current upon another wire laid parallel to it at a short distance. Now this case {{is similar to the}} cases previously examined, in every circumstance except the one to which we have ascribed the effect. We found in the former instances that whenever electricity of one kind was excited in one body, electricity of the opposite kind must be excited in a neighboring body. But in Faraday’s experiment this indispensable opposition exists within the wire itself. From the nature of a voltaic charge, the two opposite currents necessary to the existence of each other are both accommodated in one wire; and there is no need of another wire placed beside it to contain one of them, {{in the same way as}} the Leyden jar must have a positive and a negative surface. The exciting cause can and does produce all the effect which its laws require, independently of any electric excitement of a neighboring body. Now the result of the experiment with the second wire was, that no opposite current was produced. There was an instantaneous effect at the closing and breaking of the voltaic circuit; electric inductions appeared when the two wires were moved to and from one another; but these are phenomena of a different class. There was no induced electricity in the sense in which this is predicated of the Leyden jar; there was no sustained current running up the one wire while an opposite current ran down the neighboring wire; and this alone would have been a true parallel case to the other.|$|R
