5|$|Kesselring {{was back}} where he started. Park's {{handling}} of the actions was a masterpiece of aggressive defence, yet he was not under the same pressure as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battles during August when air battles were so confusing they were hard to control. A big set-piece offensive played into his hands.|$|E
5|$|Although the Spanish had won decisive {{victories}} at Sonsonate and Acajutla, {{they failed}} to take the fortified Pipil cities of Cuscatlan and Izalco. Alvarado was informed that extensive lands lay ahead, with difficult terrain, many cities, and large populations. Frustrated {{by the lack of}} progress, Alvarado withdrew to Guatemala to regroup, with the intention of returning in the dry season; <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province of Cuscatlan for seventeen days, and left it at the end of June 1524.|$|E
5|$|Lower Norfolk County {{was large}} when first organized, defined {{as from the}} Atlantic Ocean west past the Elizabeth River, {{encompassing}} the entire area now within the modern cities of Portsmouth, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach. It attracted many entrepreneurs, including William Moseley {{with his family in}} 1648. Belonging to the Merchant Adventurers Guild of London, he immigrated from Rotterdam of the Netherlands, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international trade. He settled on land {{on the north side of}} the Elizabeth River (Virginia), east of what developed as Norfolk.|$|E

5|$|The Senators {{made major}} changes in their hockey staff during the off-season. On June 17, 2007, General manager John Muckler was fired; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{last year of his}} contract.

5|$|Nine years earlier, Tchaikovsky had penned a {{ruthless}} dissection of The Five for Nadezhda von Meck. At that time, his feelings of personal isolation and professional insecurity {{had been at}} their strongest. In the nine intervening years, Mussorgsky and Borodin had both died, Balakirev had banished himself to the musical sidelines, and Cui's critical missives had lost much of their sting for Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov {{was the only one}} left who was fully active as a composer, and much had changed in the intervening years between him and Tchaikovsky as a result of Rimsky-Korsakov's change in musical values. Tchaikovsky had also changed. More secure as a composer and less isolated personally than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, Tchaikovsky enjoyed the company he now kept with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, and found much to enjoy in their music.|$|E
5|$|In January 1833, {{strong winds}} forced {{the old and}} poorly built Jaguaripe aground off Santa Marta beach in the {{southern}} province of Santa Catarina, where it sank. Joaquim Inácio was again the last to abandon ship. The entire crew was rescued, though he himself barely survived. Joaquim Inácio {{and his younger brother}} Bento José (who was also a navy officer) stayed afloat by holding onto a leather basket until reaching the shore. Afterward, Joaquim Inácio was court martialed and absolved of any wrongdoing. On 5 April 1833, he was given command of the barque-brig Vinte e nove de agosto (the same ship he had saved in 1828) and sailed to the province of Maranhão. The last time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province was in 1825. He remained stationed in the provincial capital (São Luís) as chief of the port until his return to Rio de Janeiro on 30 December 1836. He was transferred to the steam barque Urânia in 1837 and later, on 19 July of the same year, to the brig Constança (a different vessel than the schooner he lost in 1827).|$|E

25|$|The party {{expelled}} Denis Donaldson, a party official, in December 2005, {{with him}} stating publicly that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> employ of the British government {{as an agent}} since the 1980s. Donaldson told reporters that the British security agencies who employed him were behind {{the collapse of the}} Assembly and set up Sinn Féin to take the blame for it, a claim disputed by the British Government. Donaldson was found fatally shot in his home in County Donegal on 4 April 2006, and a murder inquiry was launched. In April 2009, the Real IRA released a statement taking responsibility for the killing.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, as Corey's {{politics}} {{turned against}} his Stalinist beliefs, he ran {{afoul of the}} Federal prosecutors. In December 1950, Corey was served with a deportation warrant from the US Department of Justice charging that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country illegally almost his entire life and for being a Communist. His father {{had come to the}} United States without obtaining naturalization papers and young Louis had decided against filing later due to his 1917 conviction as a conscientious objector. The case was tied up for years, and his application for a Certificate of Lawful Entry was denied under the McCarren Act.|$|E
25|$|Having {{defeated}} Olivier Rochus, Marsel İlhan and Evgeny Korolev in the Australian Open, González {{was defeated}} by Andy Roddick in the fourth round in a tense, controversial five-set match lasting 3 hours and 25 minutes. On set point in the fourth set, a Roddick forehand winner was called out which Roddick challenged. Hawk-eye revealed that the ball was in fact in, and Roddick received the set. Gonzalez argued that the point should have been replayed, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right position and {{would have made a}} play on the ball if it had been called in. Gonzalez lost the match, 3–6, 6–3, 6–4, 5–7, 2–6.|$|E

25|$|Like the Speaker of the House, the Minority Leaders are {{typically}} experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position. When Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, became Minority Leader in the 108th Congress, she {{had served in}} the House nearly 20 years and had served as minority whip in the 107th Congress. When her predecessor, Richard Gephardt, D-MO, became minority leader in the 104th House, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House for almost 20 years, had served as chairman of the Democratic Caucus for four years, had been a 1988 presidential candidate, and had been majority leader from June 1989 until Republicans captured control of the House in the November 1994 elections. Gephardt's predecessor in the minority leadership position was Robert Michel, R-IL, who became GOP Leader in 1981 after spending 24 years in the House. Michel's predecessor, Republican John Rhodes of Arizona, was elected Minority Leader in 1973 after 20 years of House service.|$|E
25|$|After {{replacing}} Dennis Green on {{an interim}} basis {{to end the}} 2001 season, Mike Tice was officially named head coach on January 10, 2002. One of the strategies the Vikings first-year head coach came up with was a formula to get Moss the ball more often. Coach Tice called it the Randy Ratio. It was an effort on the coaches part to throw 40% of the passes to Moss {{as a way to}} keep him involved in the offense more than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2001 season when he had stretches in games where he was being shut out, and partly to use more game clock by sustaining long drives to give the Vikings defense a chance to rest. An assistant coach would stand on the sidelines during games and track how many times Moss had been thrown to, and then inform Tice of the percentages so that he is always aware of it. In the 2001 season, the Vikings record was 4–1 when Moss had 40% of the passes thrown his direction, and 1–10 in other games.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1871, George Freeman {{had started a}} {{business}} as an auctioneer and this restricted his appearances that year. Although he was not quite so lethal as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous four seasons, {{it was still a}} surprise when Freeman did not play in the early matches of the 1872 season, reappearing only against Gloucestershire for his own benefit match. W. G. Grace scored 150 against him, and {{for the next five years}} Freeman, with a growing business claiming all his time, played only very occasionally in minor matches for the Malton club. In 1878, however, playing as an amateur, Freeman appeared in first-class cricket for the first time in six years against Middlesex at Lord’s, but lack of practice and the improvement in pitches from the heavy roller and motor mower meant he could not take more than three wickets at a cost of ninety-one runs. He played once against each of the first two Australian touring teams, but took only two wickets in total. However, George Freeman still bowled with success for “Gentlemen of Yorkshire” teams as late as 1883.|$|E
