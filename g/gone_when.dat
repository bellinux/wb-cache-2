5|$|Some {{coastal cities}} {{surrendered}} to the Romans which allowed {{them to have a}} base in the coastal regions of Laconia. Gythium was a large city and had been made by the Spartans as their main port and naval arsenal. The Romans advanced upon the city and they were joined there by the combined Rhodian and Pergamese fleets. The sailors from the Roman, Pergamese and Rhodian fleets built siege engines which had devastating effects on the walls. One of the city's joint commanders, Dexagoridas, offered to surrender the city to the Roman legate in charge of the fleet while Flamininus was <b>gone.</b> <b>When</b> the other commander Gorgopas found out he murdered Dexagoridas.|$|E
5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is <b>gone</b> <b>when</b> they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the entity needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has been moving him around to both protect him and contain the entity. Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the entity back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the phone that his brother and the entity cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the entity escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the entity from attacking another victim.|$|E

Robinson & Co. became a limited company in 1920, when Robinson and Bean were still partners. The carefree days of Singapore and the then Malaya were <b>gone</b> <b>when</b> the Great Depression came.

For many years the company operated at a loss until 1936 when it made a profit. Stamford Robinson died in 1935 at 83 in Edinburgh, Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Three days later, Parma welcomed Catania to the Tardini. Parma {{started the}} game in the perfect fashion, opening the scoring after five minutes through a Francesco Modesto header off a deep cross, but Catania hit back after 21 minutes through a scrappy penalty area {{scramble}} that ended in a neat yet simple finish for Sergio Bernardo Almirón. Parity was soon <b>gone</b> <b>when</b> Sebastian Giovinco's pass found Jonathan Biabiany {{on the edge of the}} penalty area two minutes later; the Frenchman finished emphatically. On the stroke of half-time, Sergio Floccari doubled Parma's leader after a fine run and an exchange of passes with Giovinco allowed him to finish impressively. However, a Catania penalty 17 minutes from the match's end brought the islanders right back into the game; Fabiano Santacroce was the offending defender and Francesco Lodi stepped up to convert to halve the deficit. The scoring was not finished and Andrea Catellani's close-range volley consigned Parma to a fourth consecutive draw in a familiar second-half slump performance.|$|E

25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had <b>gone.</b> <b>When,</b> finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

It is revealed that the gallery show is a sham and that Fairey is an undercover officer who helped the police identify Bart as the graffiti artist that had been spray-painting Springfield. Since Bart is just a boy, he is not sent to jail. Instead, he is punished by once again being locked up in the rabbit cage. When Bart tells Wiggum that he has to go to the bathroom, Wiggum covers the cage with the blanket and finds Bart <b>gone</b> <b>when</b> he removes the blanket from the cage.|$|E

500|$|On {{the same}} day Lieutenant Chris Pearce's 13 Troop, 3 Commando, on patrol with a platoon of Rhodesian African Rifles under Lieutenant Ron Marillier, was fired upon {{on the bank of}} the Maura River in {{northern}} Mashonaland by about 70 ZIPRA, encamped in a strong defensive position on the side of a hill feature. [...] "We were going on up the bank and all hell broke loose," [...] recalled Pearce. [...] "How we didn't take casualties I didn't quite know." [...] Pearce's 12 men were pinned down by heavy machine-gun fire and outnumbered by around six to one. Lance-Corporal Dennis Croukamp [...] "on his own initiative and with complete disregard for his own safety" [...] in the words of the official report, twice crawled forward to throw grenades at the enemy position to allow the troop to redeploy into better cover. Pearce unsuccessfully attempted to assault the enemy position, then gave covering fire to an abortive flank attack by Marillier's RAR men. The security forces then attempted one final assault just before nightfall, but this also failed due to the superior numbers of ZIPRA fighters. The cadres dispersed and evacuated the area during the night and were <b>gone</b> <b>when</b> a Rhodesian sweep took place the next morning.|$|E
500|$|The younger Angelo Padovani {{went with}} De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani {{recalled}} finding her in tears. After the visitors {{assured her that}} they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo's sickness, and shown her how to perform it. She had not mentioned it to anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo's brother Aristide {{died at the age}} of one in 1857—when a neighbour's servant called Regina proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo [...] "slipped out of my mouth". According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo's removal: [...] "figuring that it was all my fault, I was very unhappy, and still am." [...] Morisi agreed to have this formally recorded, but was <b>gone</b> <b>when</b> Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their hearsay account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: [...] "Her words, and her demeanour, and her tears before she could launch into her story, persuaded me that what she told me was all true." ...|$|E

[...] In his review for Blender, Rob Sheffield stated [...] "The days are <b>gone</b> <b>when</b> U2 were {{trying to keep it}} simple—at this point, the lads have realized that over-the-top romantic grandiosity is the style that suits them, so they come on like the cosmic guitar supplicants they were born to be." [...] Uncut magazine's Andrew Mueller commented, [...] "It's U2's least immediate album—but there's something about it that suggests it may be one of their most enduring." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly graded it an [...] "A−" [...] and called the album [...] "an eclectic and electrifying winner, one that speaks to the zeitgeist the way only U2 can and dare to do." [...] BBC Music reviewer Chris Jones said, [...] "There's plenty to rejoice about here" [...] while noting that the [...] "symbiotic relationship with Brian Eno (and Daniel Lanois) seems to have reached the point of imperceptibility." [...] NME contributor Ben Patashnik called the album [...] "a grand, sweeping, brave record that, while not quite the reinvention they pegged it as, suggests they've got the chops to retain their relevance well into their fourth decade as a band." ...|$|E
