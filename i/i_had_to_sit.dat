25|$|It was a set-up. The {{two other}} Board members cried off with feeble excuses and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> alone in judgment. I heard the case; found Chappell guilty as charged, and {{suspended}} him forthwith {{for a period}} of six weeks. I sent my report to the Board who did not back me up. Chappell's sentence was suspended. I had no other course of action than to see the season through and not re-nominate again.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} , Aguilera {{revealed}} the occasion, theme {{and meaning of}} [...] "Fighter". She talked about her [...] "very chaotic and abusive" [...] home, where she did not feel [...] "safe". In school, Aguilera was picked on and alienated because of her musical passion. However, it made her become [...] "smarter and stronger". To release herself, Aguilera started to write songs {{at the age of}} 15, both music and lyrics; and it was the way how she found her voice. The writing process of [...] "Fighter" [...] began during her promotion for her debut album in 1999, when she was [...] "a part of the big craze pop phenomenon". According to Aguilera, her debut album helped her a lot to develop the process. She wanted to make an [...] "emotionally rich and positive empowering" [...] song, especially for women, {{in order for them to}} speak for themselves be strong. About the idea of the track, she revealed, [...] "I was coming up with titles and ideas and deciding what I wanted to write about. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and make sense of my feelings and experiences. I learned a lot from the first record that helped me to develop. I took the good and the bad and considered some of the choices I made and became better because of it.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, The New York Times asked {{prominent}} horror filmmakers what film {{they had}} found the scariest. Two, John Sayles and Edgar Wright, cited The Thing. [...] "The theater was full, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the front row," [...] Sayles recalled.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm not tired, but you {{may take}} an oar, if you like. There's room enough, though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> nearly in the middle, else the boat won't trim," [...] {{returned}} Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't be me, then," [...] said Melissa {{in a calm}} sort of rage. [...] "I won't {{marry him}} if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on this roof {{for the rest of}} my life. You can take him. It's really you he wants, anyway; he asked you first." ...|$|R

I love my wife, I love my wife. Ah, {{this is a tough}} sport guys. This is a tough sport. You gotta have thick skin. The family has to have thick skin. Your coaches have to have thick skin. You drag your family through mud in this sport with the things that they have to hear. Feels good to get back where I deserve." ...|$|E
2500|$|DC war-comics {{editor and}} writer Robert Kanigher {{recalled}} {{that on the}} feature [...] "Gunner and Sarge" [...] in particular, Grandenetti [...] "managed to get the grime and the humor of the two Marines (and, eventually their wonderful Pooch) fighting in the jungle as no one else could. Jerry liked to experiment and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on him {{to get him to}} stop it. Especially in his covers, which were outstanding, when I forced him to draw as realistically as possible". With Kanigher, Grandenetti co-created the feature [...] "Mlle. Marie", about a World War II French Resistance fighter, in Star Spangled War Stories #84 (Aug. 1959).|$|E
2500|$|Only Fox and Terry's scripts {{explained}} {{the nature of}} the Sideways world; Lindelof and Cuse explained its meaning to the others while filming the church scene, the last time the cast members were together. They have expressed satisfaction regarding the finale; Daniel Dae Kim stated [...] "If you think about how many pieces the writers had to put together {{in order to make it}} fall into place, it’s mind-boggling, and they did such a great job... For me it was very satisfying. After I read it, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> for five or 10 minutes, just reflecting and digesting, because it definitely makes an impact." [...] Emerson said: [...] Carbonell described the finale as being [...] "all about everyone’s resolutions." [...] Cusick said [...] "There are so many walks of life getting together to talk about the show and so many issues to be brought up and that's exactly what the ending will bring up.

5000|$|While the Dash had 7 {{players at}} the 2016 Olympics, Privett {{was asked to}} make a start at the right back {{position}} against the Portland Thorns on July 16. Privett had only played on the outside for one season: {{when she was a}} freshman at California-Irvine, she played wide midfield. [...] "We felt like we needed her on the field," [...] Waldrum said. [...] "Missing our national team players, it is about figuring out how we get the best 11 on the field at the same time. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> put her at center back, then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> Ellie (Brush) or Cari (Roccaro). If I put her at holding midfield, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> Amber (Brooks). All of those players, we need." [...] Privett did well in this position, and continued to be utilized as a rotating substitute or starter at the position {{for the remainder of the}} 2016 season.|$|R
2500|$|On October 13, 1972, {{he turned}} up as a last-minute fill-in on The Merv Griffin Show, and, getting {{increasingly}} irritated by Charo butting in every few seconds and mangling the English language, he finally stood up, told Griffin off, [...] "...you dragged me out of bed because {{you said you were}} stuck for a guest, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and listen <b>to</b> this nonsensical babble..." [...] and walked off the set. Griffin was, uncharacteristically, completely flustered.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a freedom}} fighter he {{took issue with}} BNP's {{alliance}} with Jamaat-e-Islami since their top leaders were accused of war crime. He left BNP because of disagreements with chairperson Khaleda Zia regarding Jamaat-e-Islami inclusion in the Four Party Alliance. In a statement he said,"It hurts my conscience when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> with Razakaar and al-Badrs at the same table.

He campaigned countrywide to raise support for the trial.|$|R

60|$|I had {{to hurry}} breakfast, {{for the train}} started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the {{carriage}} {{for more than an}} hour before we began to move.|$|E
