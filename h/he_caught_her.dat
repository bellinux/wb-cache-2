5|$|However, Smith did court Daisy Dixon, an {{aspiring}} actress and chorus girl from Chicago, in 1896. The courtship turned sour after <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> cavorting with his jockey and notorious ladies man Tod Sloan. Dixon later married fellow gambler, Riley Grannan, who eventually died broke in Rawhide, Nevada in 1908. According to McGill, Smith {{never had an}} interest in another woman after Dixon's betrayal.|$|E
5|$|She reports {{her brother}} Jake after she {{witnessed}} {{him trying to}} rape Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox). Steph told Max that he and Tom were now her family, a family further bonded when he proposed marriage. Steph becomes friends with Niall, who fell for her, although she saw him more as someone to confide her problems in. Max began to see Steph as selfish and only interested in her career and money, which led to several arguments between the pair. One day, <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> alone with Niall, wearing only a shirt. She'd spilled something on her dress, but he assumed the worst and they broke up. A few days later {{she went back to}} Niall's place and they kissed, but were interrupted by his room-mate.|$|E
5|$|Serbian epic poetry {{agrees that}} King Vukašin was Marko's father. His {{mother in the}} poems was Jevrosima, sister of voivode Momčilo, {{the lord of the}} Pirlitor Fortress (on Mount Durmitor in Old Herzegovina). Momčilo is {{described}} as a man of immense size and strength with magical attributes: a winged horse and a sabre with eyes. Vukašin murdered him {{with the help of the}} voivode's young wife, Vidosava, despite Jevrosima's self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava (the original plan), Vukašin killed the treacherous woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city, Skadar, and married her according to the advice of the dying Momčilo. She bore him two sons, Marko and Andrijaš, and the poem recounting these events says that Marko took after his uncle Momčilo. This epic character corresponds historically with Bulgarian brigand and mercenary Momchil, who was in the service of Serbian Tsar Dušan; he later became a despot and died in the 1345 Battle of Peritheorion. According to another account, Marko and Andrijaš were mothered by a vila (Slavic mountain nymph) married by Vukašin after <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> near a lake and removed her wings so she could not escape.|$|E

5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its opening {{statement}} to the jury, was that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He knew she would have to cross the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she attempted to elude him, but <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he had treated in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E
500|$|The Oxford English Dictionary {{defines the}} word cunt as [...] "The female {{external}} genital organs" [...] and notes [...] "Its currency is restricted {{in the manner}} of other taboo-words: see the small-type note s.v. FUCK v." [...] During the Middle Ages the word may often have been considered merely vulgar, having been in common use in its anatomical sense since at least the 13thcentury. [...] In The Miller's Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer writes [...] "And prively he caughte hire by the queynte" [...] (and intimately <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> by her crotch), and Philotus (1603) mentions [...] "put doun thy hand and graip hir cunt." [...] Gradually though the word became used more as the obscenity it is generally considered to be today. [...] In John Garfield's Wandring Whore II (1660) the word is applied to a woman, specifically a whore—"this is none of your pittiful Sneakesbyes and Raskalls that will offer a sturdy C— but eighteen pence or two shillings, and repent of the business afterwards". [...] Francis Grose's A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue (1785) lists the word as [...] "C**t. [...] The chonnos of the Greek, and the cunnus of the Latin dictionaries; a nasty name for a nasty thing: un con Miege." ...|$|E
500|$|They launch [...] "Proposition Infinity" [...] ("Proposition ∞") which, in {{days before}} the election, slumps in the polls. Amy loses hope, but Bender says that they will win due to his {{upcoming}} debate against Professor Farnsworth, {{the leader of the}} Proposition Infinity opposition. At the debate (moderated by the head of George Takei) Bender gives a heartfelt speech, which the audience applauds. The Professor follows with his rebuttal, relaying a story from his past where {{he was in love with}} a fellow scientist named Eunice whom he later discovered in bed with a robot, breaking his heart. Because of this, the Professor hates robosexuals. [...] This does not impress the audience. [...] Frustrated by the audience's lack of sympathy for his cause, he accidentally admits that Eunice was actually a robot. [...] Having suppressed the truth for so long, Farnsworth reveals that the robot's name was actually Unit C and that <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> in bed with another robot. [...] With his heart broken, he takes his anger out on other robosexuals. After admitting the truth, the Professor withdraws his argument, now fully in support of Proposition Infinity. The next day the proposition is approved. Amy is ecstatic, but Bender quickly dumps her when he realizes marriage means that he must be monogamous. Amy is dejected, but Kif wins back her heart by adopting a bad boy persona and the two ride off together on a motorcycle.|$|E

2500|$|Francia had a {{very liberal}} view of sexuality. He made {{marriage}} subject to high taxation and restrictions, and insisted he personally officiate over all weddings. Francia kept a ledger of all the women he slept with, and despite having no close relationships he sired seven illegitimate children, the oldest being Ubalda García de Cañete. When <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> prostituting herself outside his palace, he declared prostitution an honourable profession and that all whores should wear golden hair combs. They thus became known as [...] "peinetas de oro" [...] (gold combs) in order to humiliate Spanish ladies, {{as it was a}} Spanish fashion.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Alsop {{reported}} {{that on the}} night of 19 February 1838, she answered the door of her father's house to a man claiming to be a police officer, who told her to bring a light, claiming [...] "we have caught Spring-heeled Jack here in the lane". She brought the person a candle, and noticed that he wore a large cloak. The moment she had handed him the candle, however, he threw off the cloak and [...] "presented a most hideous and frightful appearance", vomiting blue and white flame from his mouth while his eyes resembled [...] "red balls of fire". Miss Alsop {{reported that}} he wore a large helmet and that his clothing, which appeared to be very tight-fitting, resembled white oilskin. Without saying a word he caught hold of her and began tearing her gown with his claws which she was certain were [...] "of some metallic substance". She screamed for help, and managed to get away from him and ran towards the house. <b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> on the steps and tore her neck and arms with his claws. She was rescued by one of her sisters, after which her assailant fled.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> roughly to him, {{dragging}} her towards his couch.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{scarcely}} <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> meaning, but {{the peculiar}} tone {{of her voice}} caused him instantly to rise, and he saw Bess on her knees before an open pack which he recognized as the one given him by Jane.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very sorry," [...] she said, as if <b>he</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> {{stealing}} jam. The hood {{had fallen}} back, {{and she looked}} pleadingly at him. She had the appearance of one who was entirely in his hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} have your hands full, Dora," [...] answered the young cadet. [...] "I wish I could take this burden off your shoulders, indeed I do!" [...] and impulsively <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> up <b>her</b> plump, hand and kissed it.|$|R

60|$|She had {{hold of her}} father's hand by that, but <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> up with <b>her,</b> very red in the face.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> arm {{and turned}} her face toward his; her eyes were full of tears.|$|E
60|$|Then Roy got down. Helen was {{surprised}} to find him lame. <b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> quick glance.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> to him. His {{eyes were}} bright, his face hungry with {{the love of}} her.|$|E
60|$|He made a {{few paces}} after her, and then stopped; she seemed to stop too, and <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> up with <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{inclined}} her head, smiling {{through her}} tears, and <b>he</b> would have <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> to him {{but that she}} rose of a sudden.|$|R
60|$|Tom was {{standing}} just under her, {{on the lower}} deck, as she fell. In one moment he sprang after her. The next <b>he</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> his arms, and was swimming {{with her to the}} boat-side, where eager hands were held out to take her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> {{wrist and}} turned her face towards him. Her eyes were wide open with amazement.|$|E
