40|$|Experiments {{show that}} the {{gravitational}} mass of a test mass will increase when <b>heat</b> <b>conducts</b> upwards through it. A ~ 489 gm copper hemisphere was placed above a 1000 W heat element and below and two ice-filled copper containers. After 400 seconds of heating, the gravitational mass of the hemisphere had increased by 9. 6 % or 47 gm. If the sun’s warmth decreases earth’s dayside surface gravity by as little as 0. 08 %, the produced pressure imbalance at its center {{will be enough to}} account for its centripetal acceleration towards the sun.

For example, an {{ablative}} heat shield loses most of its thermal protection effectiveness when the outer wall temperature drops below the minimum necessary for pyrolysis.

50|$|Adding a {{layer of}} {{graphene}} to each side of a copper film increased the metal's heat-conducting properties up to 24%.

The improvement is the result of changes in copper’s nano- and microstructure, not from graphene’s independent action as an added <b>heat</b> <b>conducting</b> channel. High temperature chemical vapor deposition stimulates grain size growth in copper films. The larger grain sizes improve heat conduction. The heat conduction improvement was more pronounced in thinner copper films, which is useful as copper interconnects shrink.|$|E

Electricity is run through the wire to heat it, with the power use of each zone being separate controlled and recorded by the manikin control software. Finally, the manikins are designed to simulate humans as accurately as possible, and so any necessary additional mass is added to the interior of the manikin and distributed as needed.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{understanding}} the temperature and heat flux fields in building roofs, {{and how they are}} modulated by the interacting influences of albedo and insulation at annual, seasonal and diurnal scales. High precision heat flux plates and thermocouples were installed over multiple rooftops of varying insulation thickness and albedo in the Northeastern United States to monitor the temperature and the heat flux {{into and out of the}} roof structures for a whole year. Our analysis shows that while membrane reflectivity (albedo) plays a dominant role in reducing the <b>heat</b> <b>conducted</b> inward through the roof structures during the warmer months, insulation thickness becomes the main roof attribute in preventing heat loss from the buildings during colder months. On a diurnal scale, the thermal state of the white roof structures fluctuated little compared to black roof structures; membrane temperature over white roofs ranged between 10 °C and 45 °C during summer months compared to black membranes that ranged between 10 °C and 80 °C. Insulation thickness, apart from reducing the <b>heat</b> <b>conducted</b> through the roof structure, also delayed the transfer of heat, owing to the thermal inertia of the insulation layer. This has important implications for determining the peak heating and cooling times...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{gradient}} {{and heat}} flux. A temperature gradient produces a flux of heat as the heat flows from hot to cold. The {{rate at which}} this flow occurs {{is determined by the}} material property called the thermal conductivity, k. The empirical observation that the flux is linear in the gradient is known as Fourier’s law of heat conduction q = −kdT dx Fourier’s law of heat conduction (1) in which q is the heat flux, energy per area per time, x is spatial position, and T is temper-ature.

50|$|Since Max Gort-Barten’s first {{commercial}} toaster in 1952, Dualit’s toaster elements {{have been made}} using a heating wire wound repeatedly around a Mica supporting substrate. Mica is a naturally occurring silicate compound. It is completely inert and also can be naturally separated into flat sheets a lot like slate. As a result, it is readily suited to the manufacture of heating elements. Mica varies in grade - the clearer the Mica, the less impurities it contains. Dualit engineer their elements out of the highest grade Mica which is critical {{for the performance of}} the toaster; if there are no impurities then there are no hotspots where the <b>heat</b> <b>conducting</b> wire comes into contact with the supporting silicate substrate. Hotspots diminish longevity and cause uneven toasting. Despite this, the Dualit elements could still be damaged by consumers sticking knives and other implements into the toaster slots and damaging them. Dualit worked on a solution to this and in 1999 patented the ProHeat element, which won the company a Millennium Award. It is similar to previous Dualit elements but has two differences; the first is that it has more “winds per square centimetre” - the heating wire was wound around the mica substrate a greater number of times resulting in much improved toasting ability. The second and most crucial difference is the entire element is coated in a very thin, protective layer of mica, which allows the heat to escape but blocks injurious ingress from the knife. ProHeat elements are currently fitted to every Dualit Classic Toaster, with replacement elements available to be purchased if required.|$|E
