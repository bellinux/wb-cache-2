From 8 analyzed enzymic systems, enzymes MDH, SKDH, ME and IDH were polymorphic, while {{there were no differences}} in zymograms for enzymes PGM, PHI, PGD, and ADH. Analysis of phaseolin revealed two types: S and T. The S type of phaseolin was found in most of analyzed genotypes (9). Phaseolin type T was found in varieties of Novi Sad selection: Zlatko, Sremac and Aster, domestic population Žuto-zeleni Stepanovićevo and Jovandeka, Croatian variety Slavonski žuto-zeleni.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of an intrinsic defect of <b>germ</b> <b>plasma</b> {{put forward by}} Streeter to explain the abnormalities observed in 'amniotic bands sequence' (ABS) was not supported by Torpin, who suggested that the bands derived from early amnion rupture, with formation of mesodermal strings and naked chorion, which then constricted or adhered to fetal parts. Recently, several authors have recorded and discussed possible mechanisms for 'non-band related' malformations in patients with otherwise typical limb constrictions and amputations. The mouse mutant disorganisation (Ds) is a semidominant with 72 % of heterozygotes manifesting abnormalities, which include cranioschisis, limb duplications and deficiencies, gastro/thoracoschisis, and papillae protruding {{from other parts of}} the body. We report similar abnormalities including papillae in five fetuses and one newborn with ABS and, based on these observations and published reports, we suggest that a human homologue for Ds may be the cause of at least some examples of ABS...|$|E

Binding {{was found to}} be reversible and pH-dependent with maximum binding occurring at pH 5. The on-rate and off-rate constants were 2. 26 ± 0. 8 × 105 M− 1 min− 1 (n= 3) and 0. 016 ± 0. 004 min− 1 (n= 3), respectively. Scatchard analysis showed a single class of binding sites, with 12. 38 ± 4. 62 × 1012 sites per mg of membrane protein (n= 3) and a dissociation constant (KD) estimated at 26. 43 ± 2. 68 nM. There was inhibition of iodinated-BLG (variant A) (125 I-BLGA) binding to <b>germ</b> cell <b>plasma</b> membrane enriched fractions in the presence of unlabelled BLG variant A, BLG variant B, retinol complexed BLGA and human retinol-binding protein. Inhibition was observed neither with BSA nor with lactoferrin. 125 I-BLGA incubated with a Triton X- 100 solubilized plasma membrane fraction formed a high molecular mass complex in Superose 12 B gel filtration. This receptor complex disappeared in the presence of unlabelled BLGA and in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. The results suggest that <b>germ</b> cell <b>plasma</b> membrane may contain a receptor which is capable of binding either retinol free or retinol complexed BLGA...|$|R
40|$|Many animal {{development}} processes, such as neuronal {{growth and}} spermatogenesis, are actively regulated by intracellular membrane trafficking pathways. One well-known membrane trafficking pathway is the clathrin-mediated trafficking pathway. Important clathrin regulators include Actin-related kinase (Ark) family proteins, {{which have been}} implicated in biochemical modifications of clathrin adaptors. However, the physiological role of Ark family members during animal development was only partially understood. Here I use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to study {{the function of the}} Ark family proteins Numb-associated kinase and Auxilin. Microscopic and ultrastructural morphology of auxilin mutants, the rescue of the auxilin phenotype via ectopic expression of wild type and domain-deleted variants of Auxilin, and the way clathrin and adaptor protein localizations are affected by auxilin mutation together show that Auxilin is essential for clathrin-coated vesicle formation at TGN to support <b>germ</b> cell <b>plasma</b> membrane growth during Drosophila spermatogenesis. In contrast, phenotypic studies indicate that nak mutation affects dendrite arborization. Genetic interaction between nak and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the effects of nak mutation on dendritic clathrin puncta localization and local dendrite growth show that Nak functions in neuronal growth by regulating the localization of clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery in developing high-order dendrites. Taken together, both neuronal growth and spermatogenesis in Drosophila are regulated by specific clathrin-mediated trafficking pathways. ...|$|R

An investigation looked into ecology and habitat degradation of fisheries affecting biodiversity. It has been found that more than 35 fish species commonly available in river Ganga are at the edge of extinct. Some of them are Hilsa (Tenualosa ilsa), Mahaseer (Tor putitora), Tiger prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) and Indian trout (Raiamas bola). Among other species, more than 60 in numbers declined to the extent of 10 to 90 percent in total fish stock. The implication of this change was noted in decrease in availability of fish and fish catch by fishermen adversely affecting employment and livelihood of fishing community. Prices of fishes has shoot up and variety of fishes liked by consumers declined. An economic valuation of biodiversity loss indicated a decreased level of consumer and producers surpluses an indicator of economic welfare. Hedonic pricing and total economic valuation technique were used for analysis. While including the diverse aquatic <b>germ</b> <b>plasma</b> resources needed for genetic research and variety of protein having medicinal implications, the loss of magnitude of biodiversity overweigh the claims of development through intervention in river Ganga. Construction of dams for electricity generation, high siltation and decreased flow of tributaries, industrial effluents were identified as major cause of environmental degradation affecting the biodiversity of river Ganga.

40|$|There are {{frequently}} no bases for economically evaluating a forest, following fire. An evaluation needs to consider: a) The original {{commercial value of}} the forest (timber, tourism, <b>germ</b> <b>plasma</b> etc.) b) The cost of restoring the forest to its original condition; and c) The opportunity cost involved in restoration. This is essentially feasible, provided that the original state of the forest area prior to the fire is known. However, {{one of the most}} frequent problems in the management of forest resources is the difficulty in defining the spatial distribution of the forest characteristics. In this study the use of geo-statistical techniques are described {{and the manner in which}} they are used to define the continuous surfaces of some characteristics of a forest: the base areas; number of species; average diameter; the number of trees per hectare, as a basis for the reconstruction of a forest area prior to a fire. The data was taken from a forest in the state of Chihuahua, México (1998). 554 points were chosen as random samples, within a 1400 hectare area. The definition of continuous surfaces was made on the basis of ordinary kriging (OK), from which it was possible to model acceptably the spatial distribution of the characteristics mentioned. In this way the original form of any area can be estimated within the study zone. If there is no previous inventory available, it is suggested that this methodology be used by taking information from the sample points around the burned area...|$|E

Even, Aceh cattle are an endangered condition if not controlledproperly. It is therefore, a necessity to select males with good performance and high fertility. This condition is associated with the ability of the males to produce spermatozoa with high fertility. This study aimed to determine the effect of age on body weight, scro tumdiameter and serum testosterone levels of Aceh Cattle in various age levels and rearing patterns and its correlations.

Des-Gly 10 (S-Ala 6) -LHRH ethylamide acetate salt-(LHRH-A), on the female {{phase of the}} protogynous Monopterus albus were investigated, and the plasma levels of androstenedione (Ad), testosterone (T), 11 -oxotestosterone (KT), 11 β-hydroxytestosterone (OHT), 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and progesterone were determined. In the post-spawning stage, oLH induced precocious sex reversal in the gonad from female to male and increased plasma levels of Ad, T, KT and OHT. However, such oLH effects in M. albus females were slight at the early prespawning stage, and no significant signs of precocious sex reversal were found either in gonadal structure or in plasma hormones as those in postspawning treatment. After LHRH-A treatment of M. albus females in both postspawning and early prespawning stages, the gonadal structure remained 'female type' {{with no sign of}} proliferation of either Leydig cells or male <b>germ</b> cells.

40|$|Abstract Background In the C. elegans {{germ line}}, syncytial germ line nuclei are {{arranged}} at the cortex of the germ line as they exit mitosis and enter meiosis, forming a nucleus-free core of germ line cytoplasm called the rachis. Molecular mechanisms of rachis formation and germ line organization {{are not well}} understood. Results Mutations in the fli- 1 gene disrupt rachis organization without affecting meiotic differentiation, a phenotype in C. elegans referred to here as the germ line morphogenesis (Glm) phenotype. In fli- 1 mutants, chains of meiotic germ nuclei spanned the rachis and were partially enveloped by invaginations of <b>germ</b> line <b>plasma</b> membrane, similar to nuclei at the cortex. Extensions of the somatic sheath cells that surround the germ line protruded deep inside the rachis and were associated with displaced nuclei in fli- 1 mutants. fli- 1 encodes a molecule with leucine-rich repeats and gelsolin repeats similar to Drosophila flightless 1 and human Fliih, which {{have been shown to}} act as cytoplasmic actin regulators as well as nuclear transcriptional regulators. Mutations in let- 60 Ras, previously implicated in germ line development, were found to cause the Glm phenotype. Constitutively-active LET- 60 partially rescued the fli- 1 Glm phenotype, suggesting that LET- 60 Ras and FLI- 1 might act together to control germ line morphogenesis. Conclusion FLI- 1 controls germ line morphogenesis and rachis organization, a process about which little is known at the molecular level. The LET- 60 Ras GTPase might act with FLI- 1 to control germ line morphogenesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{conditions}} to increase the yield and quality of rice {{in the country is}} improving sort composition in manufacturing. The most common and fastest method for providing a new, genetically different plant material is the introduction. Introduced varieties can be used for direct introduction into production, after well acclimate and stabilize, but also as a starting material for making new combinations and genotypes. Adaptation of introduced varieties to new conditions in the region varies between varieties and depend on their ecological plasticity, ie the interaction of their genotype and environmental conditions in which they are introduced. Some of them very easily and quickly acclimatize, although often external conditions in the new region significantly differ from those in the region of origin, while others do not fail. According to a lot of studies the transfer of plants from one region to another is more successful, if there is greater similarity in the regions in terms of climate features. In Macedonia rice production it is known the example with introduced Italian varieties because of their good ecological plasticity already are domestic and longer period represent our basic varieties in rice production. In the pedigree of selected domestic rice varieties also participate introduced varieties from abroad. Besides the breeding of introduced varieties from abroad can be quite effective, not always the terms of the new region respond on introduced varieties. Therefore the breeding of introduced varieties, especially from distant geographic regions, it is necessary to properly evaluate them in terms of behavior and achievement in the new region. Such trials would represent one of the primary goals of this project. Exceptional value as a source of genetic variability have natural populations and selective domestic <b>germ</b> <b>plasma</b> rice.

40|$|AbstractThe sperm antigen fertilin α/β and the {{integrin}} complex α 6 β 1 {{present on}} the oolemma {{are two of the}} most promising candidates to mediate gamete interaction. During growth, the plasma membrane of both hamster and mouse zona-free oocytes acquires the capacity to fuse with acrosome-reacted sperm when oocytes reach the size of 25 – 30 μm in diameter, suggesting changes in the membrane molecular composition. The present study has two aims: to determine the timing of (1) gene expression of α 6 and β 1 integrins and (2) localization of these integrin subunits on the plasma membrane in primordial germ cells and in oocytes during oogenesis. We found that both α 6 and β 1 genes are expressed in female germ cells during all the stages of development analyzed, from 10. 5 to 18. 5 d. p. c., during oocyte growth, and in ovulated eggs. The alternatively spliced isoform α 6 Bis expressed from 10. 5 d. p. c., whereas α 6 Abegins to be expressed at 12. 5 d. p. c., suggesting a different role for the two variants. In situimmunodetection of α 6 or β 1 shows a ring of fluorescence on the female <b>germ</b> cell <b>plasma</b> membrane for both integrins at 10. 5 d. p. c., then the fluorescent signal becomes undetectable at 12. 5 d. p. c. to reappear again, this time with a patchy distribution, at 18. 5 d. p. c. This pattern of localization is maintained in oocytes isolated from newborn individuals and only when oocytes during growth reach the size of about 25 – 30 μm in diameter does the fluorescence become homogenous all around the whole oocyte surface. These data, although not conclusive, support the hypothesis of an involvement of α 6 and β 1 integrins in sperm–egg fusion...|$|R

In thè present study we dealt with the seasonal testicular activity. Testis and blood samples were taken from 54 adult specimens caught from April to December by commerciai fishing vessels operating in the Gulf of Taranto. Testis samples were fixed in Bouin's solution and embedded in Paraplast. Hydrated sections (5 um thick) were stained with haematoxylin-eosin. The immunohistochemical detection of Proliferating Celi Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) was performed by anti-PCNA monoclonal antibodies (PC 10) and visualized by the avidin-bition-peroxidase complex (ABC).

40|$|We {{describe}} two {{new methods}} for the separation and quantificationf {{the bone and}} liverisoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3. 1. 3. 1) in plasma. In the first,we use wheat-germ lectin to precipitate the bone isoenzyme. About 80 % of this, but minimal liver isoenzyme, is precipitated. The activity of the bone isoenzyme is calculated from measuring the alkaline phosphatase activity in the precipitate, that of liver alkaline phosphatase by subtracting {{the activity of the}} bone isoenzyme from total alkaline phosphatase activity. The liver fraction will also contain biliary, intestinal, and placental alkaline phosphatase if these are present in the original plasma, but correction for such activity is readily made. In the second method, samples are separated on cellulose acetate membranes that, before electrophoresis, have been soaked in buffer containing wheat-germ lectin. The bone isoenzyme is retarded and clearly separated from the liver fraction, allowing these isoenzymes to be quantified by densitometry. Both methods are rapid, reproducible, and suitable for use in the diagnostic laboratory. AddItIonal Keyphrases: wheat-germ lectin electrophoresis on cellulose acetate. affinity electrophoresis. enzyme activi-ty. reference interval Lectinsare highly specific, carbohydrate-binding proteins ofplantorigin.
