25|$|Concerning the {{lifespan}} of drones and Minds, {{given the}} durability of Culture technology and the aforementioned options of mindstate backups, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> that they live {{as long as they}} choose.

25|$|Lindsay’s 606 runs in {{the series}} remains the record for a wicketkeeper. Accurate figures for his overall run-rate are unavailable, but {{according}} to R.S.

Overall series run-rates for the two sides were 47 per 100 balls for South Africa (43 per 100 apart from Lindsay), 40 per 100 balls for Australia; his scoring rate was therefore 50 per cent higher than the series average.|$|E

25|$|Functional {{theories}} of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> that its structures are best analysed and understood {{with reference to}} the functions they carry out. Functional {{theories of}} grammar differ from formal theories of grammar, in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend {{to pay attention to the}} way language is actually used, and not just to the formal relations between linguistic elements.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) was {{occupied}} by the British in 1796 and became a British colony in 1815. As in all places that the British arrived in large numbers, cricket soon followed and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> that the game was first played on the island by 1800. The earliest definite mention of cricket in Ceylon was {{a report in the}} Colombo Journal on 5 September 1832 which called for the formation of a cricket club. The Colombo Cricket Club was formed soon afterwards and matches began in November 1832. Since then, the sport has grown domestically with major events such as the Premier Trophy (starting 1938) and Premier Limited Overs Tournament (starting 1988–89). Sri Lanka's one day international debut came in the 1975 cricket world cup and were later awarded Test cricket status in 1981, by the International Cricket Council.|$|E
25|$|A 'probable combatant' {{is someone}} killed at a {{location}} {{and at a time}} during which an armed confrontation was going on, who appears most likely – but not certain – to have been an active participant in the fighting. For example, in many cases where an incident has resulted in a large number of Palestinian casualties, the only information available is that an individual was killed when Israeli soldiers returned fire in response to shots fired from a particular location. While {{it is possible that the}} person killed had not been active in the fighting and just happened to be in the vicinity of people who were, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> that the number of such coincidental deaths is not particularly high.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> {{that the}} present site of Cromer, around the parish church of Saints Peter and Paul, is what was in 1337 called Shipden-juxta-Felbrigg, {{and by the end}} of the 14th century known as Cromer. A {{reference}} to a place called Crowemere Shipden can be seen in a legal record, dated 1422, (1 Henry VI), the home of John Gees. The other Shipden is now about a quarter of a mile to the north east of the end of Cromer Pier, under the sea. Its site is marked by Church Rock, now no longer visible, even at a low spring tide. In 1888 a small pleasure steamer called Victoria struck the remains of the church tower, and the rock was subsequently blown up for safety. In the present day, members of Great Yarmouth sub-aqua club dived at the site, and salvaged artefacts from both the medieval church and the wreck of Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Thymidine kinase {{has been}} {{determined}} in tissue samples after extraction of the tissue. No standard method for the extraction or for the assay has been developed and TK determination in extracts from cells and tissues have not been validated in relation to any specific clinical question, see however Romain et al. and Arnér et al. A method has been developed for specific determination of TK2 in cell extracts using the substrate analog 5-Bromovinyl 2'-deoxyuridine. In the studies referred to below the methods used {{and the way the}} results are reported are so different that comparisons between different studies are not possible. The TK1 levels in fetal tissues during development are higher than those of the corresponding tissues later. Certain non-malignant diseases also give rise to dramatic elevation of TK values in cells and tissue: in peripheric lymphocytes during monocytosis and in bone marrow during pernicious anemia. As TK1 is present in cells during cell division, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> that the TK activity in malignant tissue should be higher than in corresponding normal tissue. This is also confirmed in most studies.|$|E
25|$|It {{is certain}} that John Paul I would not have {{reversed}} Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, {{since it was a}} question of sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, Giovanni Urbani, that argued that the contraceptive pill should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI. When Humanae vitae was released, Luciani defended that document. But he seemed to contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical. In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.|$|E
