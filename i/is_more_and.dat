And yet time hath his revolutions; {{there must be a}} period and an end to all temporal things—finis rerum—an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; and why not of de Vere?

There are also loanwords of Turkic origin.

25|$|Seven Or More Players: Beyond six players, {{the game}} becomes either very complex, or hard to {{maintain}} with multiple decks. An additional side effect of an increased number of players is a short game, {{as the number of}} cards held by each player is reduced and high trump <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more likely to take the trick. Seven players should normally be split into groups of four and three, eight players into two groups of four players, nine players into either groups of four and five players, or three groups of three players.|$|E

25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more complex, the information <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E

[...] On the subject of being too obscure, he said in a 1996 interview that [...] "maybe the area where we're on dodgy ground, is this idea that you need great knowledge [...] esoteric music to understand what we're doing." [...] Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she [...] "think we have achieved a music that will make sense {{to a lot of people}} whether they know about Steve Reich or not." [...] The duo were up-front about their desire to grow the group's sound: for Gane, [...] "otherwise it just sounds like what other people are doing," [...] and for Sadier, [...] "you trust that there <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> that it can be done more interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Munro's {{influences}} {{included the}} work of General Idea, and the queercore movement. Speaking about the confluence of his music events and his art, Munro said in 2004, [...] "This is where the music scene and gay underground come together. We're {{at a time when}} all kinds of shifts are happening. The structure of artists' galleries are changing. Magazines are changing. There's more different kinds of artist activity that's happening. All this is having an impact on my visual work. And my visual work <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more going into performance." [...] Galleries exhibiting his work have included Art in General, in New York City, Confederation Centre Art Gallery in Charlottetown, and Toronto galleries Zsa Zsa, Mercer Union, YYZ Artists' Outlet, Paul Petro Contemporary Art, and the Art Gallery of York University. Munro was named on the longlist of finalists for the Sobey Art Award in 2010.|$|E

All that remains <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more precise measurement." [...] Five years later, Albert Einstein published his paper on special relativity, which challenged the very simple set of rules laid down by Newtonian mechanics, which had been used to describe force and motion for over two hundred years.|$|E

2500|$|Debnam-Carey said {{figuring}} out how to portray all these aspects of the character was the most challenging part.

A director advised her that less <b>is</b> <b>more,</b> <b>and</b> she adapted to the character, and learned more about her, via portrayal. [...] "I realized that I was slowly developing all of these things. Someone was like, 'Is it a thing you've chosen to do, to not blink all the time?' I was like, 'Wow!'

2500|$|The military's {{constitution}} {{passed the}} referendum, {{and a general}} election was held in December 2007. The People's Power Party (PPP), consisting of many former Thai Rak Thai Party MPs and supporters, won the majority and formed a government. The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) {{refused to accept the}} election results and started protests, eventually laying siege to Government House, Don Mueang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Although the PAD claimed they were defending the monarchy, Bhumibol remained silent. However, after a PAD supporter died in a clash with police, Queen Sirikit presided over her cremation. Princess Sirindhorn, when asked at a U.S. press conference whether PAD was acting on behalf of the monarchy, replied, [...] "I don't think so. They do things for themselves." [...] Questioning and criticism over Bhumibol's role in the crisis increased, particularly from the international press. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more difficult for them to hold the illusion that the monarchy is universally adored", says a Thai academic.|$|E
2500|$|In the wild, {{diseases}} and parasites are normally at low levels, {{and kept in}} check by natural predation on weakened individuals. In crowded net pens they can become epidemics. Diseases and parasites also transfer from farmed to wild salmon populations. A recent study in British Columbia links the spread of parasitic sea lice from river salmon farms to wild pink salmon in the same river. The European Commission (2002) concluded [...] "The reduction of wild salmonid abundance is also linked to other factors but there <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more scientific evidence establishing a direct link {{between the number of}} lice-infested wild fish and the presence of cages in the same estuary." [...] It is reported that wild salmon on the west coast of Canada are being driven to extinction by sea lice from nearby salmon farms. These predictions have been disputed by other scientists and recent harvests have indicated that the predictions were in error. [...] In 2011, Scottish salmon farming introduced the use of farmed wrasse for the purpose of cleaning farmed salmon of ectoparasites.|$|E
