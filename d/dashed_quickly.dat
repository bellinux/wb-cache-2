60|$|There {{were also}} shrill {{commands}} that she halt, but to these she paid no attention. Before she had half circled the enclosure {{she discovered that}} her chances for successful escape were great, since it was evident to her that her pursuers were not so fleet as she. High indeed then were her hopes as she came in sight of the hill, but they were soon dashed by what lay before her, for there, in the fields that lay between, were fully a hundred creatures similar to those behind her and all were on the alert, evidently warned by the whistling of their fellows. Instructions and commands were shouted to and fro, {{with the result that}} those before her spread roughly into a great half circle to intercept her, and when she turned to the right, hoping to elude the net, she saw others coming from fields beyond, and to the left the same was true. But Tara of Helium would not admit defeat. Without once pausing she turned directly {{toward the center of the}} advancing semi-circle, beyond which lay her single chance of escape, and as she ran she drew her long, slim dagger. Like her valiant sire, if die she must, she would die fighting. There were gaps in the thin line confronting her and toward the widest of one of these she directed her course. The things on either side of the opening guessed her intent for they closed in to place themselves in her path. This widened the openings on either side of them and as the girl appeared almost to rush into their arms she turned suddenly at right angles, ran swiftly in the new direction for a few yards, and then <b>dashed</b> <b>quickly</b> toward the hill again. Now only a single warrior, with a wide gap on either side of him, barred her clear way to freedom, though all the others were speeding as rapidly as they could to intercept her. If she could pass this one without too much delay she could escape, of that she was certain. Her every hope hinged on this. The creature before her realized it, too, for he moved cautiously, though swiftly, to intercept her, as a Rugby fullback might maneuver in the realization that he alone stood between the opposing team and a touchdown.|$|E
50|$|The 2001 season saw the {{momentum}} of the program slowing, with a five-win season and a loss to Central Michigan. Slowing further in 2002, the program won four games, managing to defeat both Central Michigan in Mount Pleasant and Eastern Michigan University in the same season. Some optimism was felt in Kalamazoo for the 2003 season, with high expectations for the program <b>dashed</b> <b>quickly,</b> after a blowout by Virginia, and losses began mounting after the Broncos lost to Ball State, Northern Illinois, Marshall, and Toledo.|$|E
5000|$|Powerslide <b>dashes</b> <b>quickly</b> in a {{straight}} line, which can bash the enemy emotion. Passion's Powerslide is faster, goes further, and has more force.|$|R
5000|$|... "Bicyclists riding au naturel {{is nothing}} new to the quirky parade, which is known for {{participants}} in outlandish and sometimes risque costumes. But police say yesterday's arrests were made primarily for safety: The nude bicyclists typically <b>dash</b> <b>quickly</b> {{in and out of}} the parade audience." ...|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{each stage}} is {{to clear the}} map of all the {{peaceful}} enemy characters, many of which will not attack until provoked. The player takes control of Kokopolo (or Tatsumo) who can stroll around the stages with the DPad, or <b>dash</b> <b>quickly</b> around the stage {{with one of the}} shoulder buttons. Knowing when to walk, and when to dash, is actually a key component of this game. The player can also jump with the A button, or scratch with the B button. All of these actions take place on the top screen.|$|R
50|$|The {{final chapter}} begins with Luke, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, and Dash infiltrating Xizors palace on Coruscant to save Princess Leia, whom Xizor has taken captive. Dash enters the palace through the {{underground}} sewer system, and battles an enormous dianoga, {{before entering the}} palace itself. To stall the mercenary, Xizor summons his gladiator Droid, which <b>Dash</b> <b>quickly</b> disposes of. After defeating the droid, Xizor flees to his Skyhook space station. Xizors forces engage in battle with the Rebellion, but during the conflict an Imperial star destroyer arrives. The conflict turns as the star destroyer engages Xizor and his forces. Utilizing this distraction, Dash destroys the Skyhooks outer defenses then proceeds to fly inside the station, destroying its core. Dash is presumably killed in the blast, along with Xizor.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{relatively}} short poem apparently <b>dashed</b> off <b>quickly</b> (and denied by its author for years), [...] "Casey at the Bat" [...] {{had a profound effect}} on American popular culture. It has been recited, re-enacted, adapted, dissected, parodied and subjected to just about every other treatment one could imagine.|$|R
5000|$|Rabbits and hares can <b>dash</b> away very <b>quickly</b> {{and seldom}} seem at ease. The {{expression}} [...] "scared as a rabbit" [...] reminds of this image.|$|R
5|$|ReCore is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. It centers around Joule Adams {{and her three}} robotic machines known as corebot companions, whose function is to aid her in combat and puzzle solving; these types of machines are amenable to improvement, should players find the blueprints and materials to do so, which grants upgrades to their attack and defense. The machines' cores can be swapped between them, changing their abilities in succession, and their frames are rearrangeable. Players can level up Joule's weapons and vitality. Ranged weapons have three kinds of ammunition that serve the purpose of taking down an enemy with a matching color: red, blue and yellow. Furthermore, if one of Joule's corebots matches the color of an enemy, it will thus inflict more damage in combat. Joule also wields a grappling hook that she uses to extract her enemies' energy cores after {{a certain amount of}} damage is done. Joule must dodge, jump or <b>dash</b> <b>quickly</b> to avoid taking damage while engaged in enemy conflict.|$|R
50|$|Jimmy {{returns from}} New York, his dreams of {{becoming}} a famous stand-up comic <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed.</b>  He asks his Uncle Harry for his job back, and Harry, after some initial reluctance, agrees, glad to have Jimmy home (“Where I Belong”).|$|R
50|$|Now on the mat, Jackson {{offers an}} exuberant, {{mind-blowing}} routine that breaks {{the rules of}} cheerleading, but inspires wild applause from the arena ("Cross The Line"). The dream of victory, though, is <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed.</b> Truman wins Nationals. Jackson doesn’t even place.|$|R
50|$|A poor start, {{which saw}} only one point {{taken from the}} first 5 league games, meant that any hopes of {{challenging}} for promotion were <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> and eventually Dumbarton finished 11th out of 16 with 25 points - 28 behind champions East Fife.|$|R
50|$|Whatever chances the Lions had {{of getting}} back into the contest were <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> {{in the third quarter}} as South Fremantle ran rampant and opened up a match winning lead by the last change, with a resounding seven goal to two quarter.|$|R
500|$|To defeat enemies, {{players can}} {{make use of}} various {{offensive}} and defensive abilities. Jack can find four types of firearms: pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, and carbine rifles. He also possesses several types of time manipulating powers, which increase his efficiency in combat. [...] "Time Stop" [...] freezes time around enemies with a time bubble. If the player shoots an opponent trapped in the bubble, its power amplifies, and the bullets will kill the enemy when the bubble vanishes after {{a short period of}} time. [...] "Time Rush" [...] allows Jack to dash next to an enemy and perform an immediate melee takedown. He can also use this power to speed up time and dodge between cover to confuse unaware enemies as to his location. [...] "Time Blast" [...] levitates enemies and freezes them. The defensive ability [...] "Time Shield" [...] deflects all incoming damage, while [...] "Time Dodge" [...] allows players to <b>dash</b> <b>quickly</b> to evade attacks. Most of these time manipulating powers have a short cooldown period after use. In combat, Jack automatically takes cover when he is standing next to environmental objects. However, the artificial intelligence in the game is designed to push the player out of cover by coordinating with each other.|$|R
50|$|In {{a chamber}} of the temple, the wolf is smooching the girl beagle. As Oswald knocks on the door, the wolf stops momentarilly to confront the rabbit. After opening the door, the wolf hurls a log at Oswald, only to miss. Oswald <b>quickly</b> <b>dashes</b> into the chamber, locking the wolf outside.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the group}} of touring widows comes to visit. When they eye the virile young farmers, the ladies, led by Clara Weiss, reveal their hopes of finding {{suitable}} husbands. Though their dreams are <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> when all the men {{turn out to be}} married, Clara is still optimistic ("Chin Up, Ladies").|$|R
50|$|Su-Ren (Omni) is {{actually}} an AI descended from GAIA. She now runs Omni's Project Nidus, guiding and training the warriors in the wastes just outside the city. Her powers allow her to <b>quickly</b> <b>dash</b> around the map doling heals, damage, buffs, debuffs, and shields while also laying damage with her staff.|$|R
50|$|Cleomenes' reforms excited hostility {{amongst the}} wealthy of the Peloponnese who feared social revolution. For others, {{especially}} among the poor, Cleomenes inspired hope - a hope {{that was to be}} <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> when Cleomenes started taking cities and it became obvious that social reform outside Sparta was the last thing on his mind.|$|R
50|$|These ideas {{captured}} {{the imagination of}} many physicists, even though Wheeler himself <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> some of the early hopes for his program. In particular, spin 1/2 fermions proved difficult to handle. For this, one has to go to the Einsteinian Unified Field Theory of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dirac system, or more generally, the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs System.|$|R
50|$|From a {{tactical}} standpoint, He usually {{plays in a}} free role. He is capable of attacking on either wing or {{through the center of}} the pitch. He could manage himself effectively in limited spaces, and would attract defenders only to <b>quickly</b> <b>dash</b> out of the melee or give an assist to a free teammate.|$|R

60|$|None of {{the boys}} could answer that question, nor could the {{gardener}} enlighten them. Joseph had been coming {{along the side of}} the orchard when he had espied the fellow and had called to him, thinking it was some boy from Crumville who had sneaked up to steal some of the orchard fruit. He had been surprised when the fellow <b>dashed</b> away so <b>quickly.</b>|$|R
50|$|The text {{presents}} the aggressiveness of Serbia {{as the reason}} for the war, claiming that the Empire had tried all the ways to avoid the conflict. The document was signed by Franz Joseph and Karl von Stürgkh, minister-president of Austria. The belief of some that a peaceful solution could be still reached was <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> - all political parties, including the Social Democrats, expressed their support for the war.|$|R
50|$|Hope of {{additional}} pennant races was <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed,</b> as the club plummeted {{to the bottom}} of the standings in 1993, finishing an abysmal 26 games out of first. Since 1992, highlights were few and far between as the franchise failed to produce a winning season, having not fielded a competitive team because of a combination of bad management and financial constraints that limit the team relative to the resources available to other, larger-market clubs.|$|R
50|$|The Stooges {{are caught}} {{sleeping}} in a closed awning situated over a store. A brief argument among the trio results in Curly casually tossing a pot over his shoulder, breaking several dishes. The shopkeeper (Max Davidson) becomes irate, calls the police and chases the Stooges for vandalizing his store, who <b>quickly</b> <b>dash</b> into a building’s revolving door. Upon exiting the building, the Stooges have clipboards in tow, having inadvertently landed jobs as census takers.|$|R
50|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 21, 1861, the arrival of BG General Joseph E. Johnston reversed the tide of Battle, the ensuing Confederate counterattack turned victory into a rout, and euphoric Northern hopes for a short war were <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed.</b> Lieutenant General Winfield Scott had hoped that Patterson and his Department of Pennsylvania would prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard at Manassas Junction, and when Johnston's troops became a major deciding factor, Patterson's actions became a subject of controversy.|$|R
50|$|After almost being relegated in 1920-21 Stoke {{finished}} 2nd in 1921-22 to gain {{a return}} to the First Division. Key to Stoke's success was the early season signing of the Broad brothers Tommy and Jimmy with the later scoring 27 goals. However any hope that it be the start of a sustained spell in the top-flight was <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> as Stoke struggled all through the 1922-23 season and with relegation looming Shallcross was sacked in March 1923.|$|R
5000|$|Jacques and Fernanda are newlyweds, {{but they}} are {{mismatched}} in many ways, not least in age and education. Both enter into marriage with high hopes, but these are <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> by a massive quarrel {{early on in the}} book, which becomes an important turning point in the book. The means of reconciliation used by the two characters are very different. After the fight, Fernande attempts to mend the rift by begging and pleading, but Jacques responds with disgust.|$|R
5000|$|Rawls {{thought that}} {{identifying}} instrumental means for achieving value-rational justice {{would make his}} rule of justice-as-fairness generally acceptable: [...] "... political power is legitimate only when it is exercised in accordance with a constitution (written or unwritten) the essentials of which all citizens as reasonable and rational, can endorse {{in the light of}} their common human reason". His hope to generate a persuasive [...] "overlapping consensus" [...] was <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> by a colleague in the Harvard philosophy department.|$|R
6000|$|Soon {{he was out}} of breath, and {{although}} he wanted to call [...] "Whoa!" [...] to the horse, he found he could not get the word out of his throat. Then the end of the tail he was clutching, being nothing more than a dead branch, suddenly broke away, and the next minute the boy was rolling in the dust of the road, while the horse and its pumpkin-headed rider <b>dashed</b> on and <b>quickly</b> disappeared in the distance.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} sequel, the Robinsons {{celebrate}} {{the arrival of}} spring after surviving a fierce winter. Soon their happiness is <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> as a Forest Service ranger informs them they must prove their mountain home is located on a legitimate mining claim or they must move out. Also, Pat finds out that her mother is ill and decides {{to go back to}} Los Angeles. Will the Robinsons lose their mountain home? Will Pat come back from the city? ...|$|R
50|$|They {{begin by}} telling of young Victor Conte. He was {{aspiring}} musician (and hippie, and alleged drug dealer), but those dreams were <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed.</b> So, undaunted, {{he decided to}} open his own health clinic. That idea crashed as well, but the third time was a charm for Conte. He decided {{that he wanted to}} become a nutritionist and help star athletes to reach their physical potential. Despite not having a background in chemistry, Conte quickly gained respect among athletes and nutrition buffs.|$|R
25|$|Baisden {{was born}} in Beverly Hills, Michigan to Tina and Anthony Baisden. She {{attended}} Detroit Country Day School and was first interested in playing tennis, looking {{to follow in the}} footsteps of Serena Williams. It was during tennis practice that her speed was noticed and the coaches recommended she compete in track and field instead. She ran in a range of sprint distances and at state level won three 400-meter dash and two titles in both the 100-meter dash and 200-meter <b>dash.</b> She <b>quickly</b> showed her skill at national level, placing in the top three of the 200m at the 2007 AAU Junior Olympic Games at the age of twelve. A National Junior Olympic double in the short sprints followed in 2009, with her runs of 11.73 seconds and 23.69 seconds being American records for the age group.|$|R
50|$|By 1992 Ghana's {{relations}} with Ivory Coast were relatively good. Hopes for lasting improvement in Ghana's {{relations with}} its western neighbor, however, were <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> following some ugly incidents in late 1993 and early 1994. They began on November 1, 1993, {{with the return}} of sports fans to Ivory Coast following a championship soccer match in Kumasi, Ghana, that had resulted in the elimination of Ivory Coast from competition. Ghanaian immigrants in Ivory Coast were violently attacked, and as many as forty or more Ghanaians were killed.|$|R
50|$|Llanelli {{were drawn}} against Dinamo Tiblisi. The first leg was played at Parc Y Scarlets. Llanelli, who were missing 5 key players, stunned the Georgians {{by taking the}} game 2-1, with a brace coming from Jordan Follows. Tiblisi pulled a goal back in {{stoppage}} time with a penalty. The Reds approached the second leg in with confidence, key players returning and a 2-1 advantage. Hopes of progressing were <b>quickly</b> <b>dashed</b> as a rampant Tiblisi side knocked in 5 goals without reply. Llanelli went out 6-2 on aggregate.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{having their}} dreams {{of playing in}} the final <b>dashed,</b> Klinsmann's squad <b>quickly</b> {{recovered}} their composure, and journalists noted the team's upbeat mood in the practices {{leading up to the}} third-place match. Three starters, including captain Michael Ballack, would not be available for the third place match, and their opponent Portugal's goalkeeper, Ricardo, had up to that point conceded only one goal in regular play. Nonetheless, Germany thoroughly defeated Portugal 3–1, at one point leading 3–0 due to Bastian Schweinsteiger's two goals and an own goal, also off his shot, by Portugal's Petit.|$|R
