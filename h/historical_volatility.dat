50|$|It {{is helpful}} to note that implied {{volatility}} is related to <b>historical</b> <b>volatility,</b> but the two are distinct. <b>Historical</b> <b>volatility</b> is a direct measure of {{the movement of the}} underlying’s price (realized volatility) over recent history (e.g. a trailing 21-day period). Implied volatility, in contrast, is determined by the market price of the derivative contract itself, and not the underlying. Therefore, different derivative contracts on the same underlying have different implied volatilities as a function of their own supply and demand dynamics. For instance, the IBM call option, strike at $100 and expiring in 6 months, may have an implied volatility of 18%, while the put option strike at $105 and expiring in 1 month may have an implied volatility of 21%. At the same time, the <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> for IBM for the previous 21 day period might be 17% (all volatilities are expressed in annualized percentage moves).|$|E
40|$|In theory, by {{institutional}} trading options (wholesale), professional {{market participants}} asses and set future volatilities {{that can be}} identified for the retail using the Black-Scholes-formula in reverse. In reality, as regression analysis suggests, it is historical market data which instead are used to determine future values. Further analysis shows that <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities</b> are insufficient predictors. Yet this questionable practice is considered by international accounting standards (IAS 39 /IFRS) to allow "historical data and implied volatilities" for "reasonable estimations". In a kind of short-circuit, <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities</b> are introduced into option trading and returned as implied volatility-indexes. In reality, both differ significantly from future values. Comparing the volatility of the past nine weeks {{with that of the}} following nine weeks, estimation error ranges from four to over ten percentage points. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{predicting}} future volatility, {{empirical studies}} find mixed results regarding two issues: (1) whether model free implied volatility has more information content than Black-Scholes model-based implied volatility; (2) whether implied <b>volatility</b> outperforms <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities.</b> In this thesis, we address these two issues using the Canadian financial data. First, {{we examine the}} information content and forecasting power between VIXC - a model free implied volatility, and MVX - a model-based implied volatility. The GARCH in-sample test indicates that VIXC subsumes all information that is reflected in MVX. The out-of-sample examination indicates that VIXC is superior to MVX for predicting the next 1 -, 5 -, 10 -, and 22 -trading days' realized volatility. Second, we investigate the predictive power between VIXC and alternative volatility forecasts derived from historical index prices. We find that for time horizons lesser than 10 -trading days, VIXC provides more accurate forecasts. However, for longer time horizons, the <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities,</b> particularly the random walk, provide better forecasts. We conclude that VIXC cannot incorporate all information contained in historical index prices for predicting future volatility...|$|R

50|$|Standard {{deviation}} is {{a measure}} of volatility of the fund's performance over a period of time. The higher the figure the greater the variability of the fund's performance. High <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> may indicate high future volatility, and therefore increased investment risk in a fund.|$|E
50|$|In {{financial}} mathematics, {{the implied}} volatility of an option contract is that {{value of the}} volatility of the underlying instrument which, when input in an option pricing model (such as Black-Scholes) will return a theoretical value equal to the current market price of the option. A non-option financial instrument that has embedded optionality, such as an interest rate cap, can also have an implied volatility. Implied volatility, a forward-looking and subjective measure, differs from <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> because the latter is calculated from known past returns of a security.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. If {{volatility}} parameter σ 2, {{involved in}} Black-Sholes formula, is time dependent, the parameter σ 2 {{is replaced by}} its average value (T − t) − 1 ∫ T t σ 2 (s) ds. We propose a method of evaluation of this aver-aged parameter via others (Ti − ti) − 1 ∫ Ti ti σ 2 (s) ds corresponding to im-plied and <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities.</b> We also {{consider the case of}} stochastic volatility. 1...|$|R

The results show that future stock volatility is better predicted by our method than the conventional models. We also analyze the functional role of text in media either as a passive documentation of past information flow or as an active source for new information influencing future volatility.

50|$|The use of Bollinger Bands {{varies widely}} among traders. Some traders buy when price touches the lower Bollinger Band and exit when price touches the moving {{average in the}} center of the bands. Other traders buy when price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band or sell when price falls below the lower Bollinger Band. Moreover, the use of Bollinger Bands is not {{confined}} to stock traders; options traders, most notably implied volatility traders, often sell options when Bollinger Bands are historically far apart or buy options when the Bollinger Bands are historically close together, in both instances, expecting volatility to revert towards the average <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> level for the stock.|$|E
50|$|Sullivan works {{late that}} night to finish Dale’s project, and discovers that current {{volatility}} in the firm's portfolio of mortgage-backed securities will soon exceed the <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> levels of the positions. Because of excessive leverage, if the firm's assets decrease by 25%, the loss will be greater than {{the value of the}} firm itself and the firm will go bankrupt. Sullivan and junior analyst Seth Bregman (Penn Badgley) tell their desk head Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) about the situation. Emerson alerts floor head Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), who also returns to the office. They attempt to contact Dale, but his company phone has been shut off and he hasn’t returned home yet.|$|E
50|$|Value Investors see {{securities}} {{as either}} priced correctly, under-priced, or over-priced. In contrast, MPT proponents insist that, by definition under the efficient-market hypothesis, a realized {{price of a}} stock is the correct price. Value investor purists reject the usefulness of capital asset pricing model (CAPM), in part, because it wrongly extrapolates <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> {{as a proxy for}} risk. For example, if equity prices of a company fell 75%, assuming the underlying fundamentals of the company were solid, an MPT practitioner would view it as volatile (risky); whereas, a value investor would determine whether it was undervalued, and if so, buy it, reasoning that the resulting downward risk is less than before. Therefore, value investors see MPT metrics—such as standard deviation, beta (relative standard deviation), alpha (excess return), and the Sharpe ratio (risk adjusted return)—as inadequate and even misleading.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{flexible}} method, we develop the term structure of volatility implied by corn futures options with differing maturities, and evaluate {{its ability to}} predict subsequent realized price volatility. The implied forward volatilities anticipate realized volatility well. For the nearby interval, the implied forward volatilities provide unbiased forecasts, and are superior to forecasts based on <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities.</b> For more distant intervals, early-year options predict the direction and magnitude of future volatility changes {{about as well as}} a three-year moving average and better than a na�ve forecast. However, later-year options display less forecast power in part due to reduced trading activity. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Bayesian {{statistical}} methods are naturally oriented towards pooling in a rigorous way information coming from separate sources. It {{has been suggested}} that both <b>historical</b> and implied <b>volatilities</b> convey information about future volatility. However, typically in the literature implied and return volatility series are fed separately into models to provide rival forecasts of volatility or options prices. We develop a formal Bayesian framework where we can merge the backward looking information as represented in historical daily return data with the forward looking information as represented in implied volatilities of reported options prices. We apply our theory in forecasting (in- and out- of sample) the prices of FTSE 100 European Index options. We find that for forecasting option prices out of sample (i. e. one-day ahead) our Bayesian estimators outperform standard forecasts that use implied or <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities.</b> For explaining the observed market prices of options we find, as expected, no evidence to suggest that standard procedures that use implied volatility estimates are redundant...|$|R

In this paper, we first provide the convergence results of CLM and numerically examine the convergence properties. Then, the comparative analysis is empirically conducted using a large {{sample of the}} S&P 100 Index (OEX) puts and IBM puts. The results on the convergence show that choosing the shifted Legendre polynomials with four regressors is more appropriate considering the pricing accuracy and the computational cost. With this choice, CLM method is empirically demonstrated to be superior to the benchmark methods of binominal tree and finite difference with <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities...</b>|$|R

Using the Fraser Index component covering taxes and fees specifically, Zambia {{is in the middle}} of African countries, on par with South Africa, worse than Botswana, but better than the DRC. Perceptions that the taxes and fees for mining in Zambia is attractive does not necessarily mean the fiscal rates are themselves attractive (and vice versa) as investors tend to view taxes and fees in a broader context of risks to existing framework including its <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> and expectations regarding future changes, the possibility of negotiating a deal which is ‘better’ than the ‘official’ headline rates through exemptions or allowances, and other factors shaping the economics of the project for example if the geology is very favourable and extraction is low-cost, a firm will be able to accept a higher tax rate.|$|E

For the FTSE 100 futures, we find that <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> using high frequency returns outperforms implied volatility in forecasting future volatility. However, we find that implied volatility outperforms <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> in forecasting future volatility for the S&P 500 futures. The results also indicate that <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> using high frequency returns could be an unbiased forecast for the FTSE 100 futures. ...|$|E
40|$|The initial {{paper had}} {{concluded}} that implied volatility {{is not a good}} predictor of the realized volatility, and instead <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> does a better job of explaining the realized volatility. Based on our findings from the data during the subprime crisis, we observe that both implied volatility and <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> are not efficient predictors of future volatility, but when compared, implied volatility does a better job than <b>historical</b> <b>volatility.</b> Our findings differ from the original research as we used a different time-period, and the findings are in line with logical reasoning as during periods of high volatility, <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> does not give any prediction of future volatility as circumstances change drastically...|$|E

In the empirical part of the paper I focus on the European financial sector and find the credit-implied volatilities and fear gauges to behave well.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine small sample {{properties}} of a generalized {{method of moments}} (GMM) estimation using Monte Carlo simulations. We assume that the generated time series describe the stochastic variance rate of a stock index. We use a mean reverting square-root prooess to simulate the dynamics of this instantaneous variance rate. The generated time series consist of 63, 250, and 1000 data points, respectively. They are used to estimate the Parameters of the assumed variance rate process by applying GMM. The results obtained are described and compared to our estimates from empirical volatility data.

40|$|This paper {{specifies}} {{a multivariate}} stochastic volatility (SV) {{model for the}} S&P 500 index and spot interest rate processes. We first estimate the multivariate SV model via the efficient method of moments (EMM) technique based on observations of underlying state variables, and then investigate the respective effects of stochastic interest rates, stochastic volatility, and asymmetric S&P 500 index returns on option prices. We compute option prices using both reprojected underlying <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities</b> and the implied risk premium of stochastic volatility to gauge each model's performance through direct comparison with observed market option prices on the index. Our major empirical findings are summarized as follows. First, while allowing for stochastic volatility can reduce the pricing errors and allowing for asymmetric volatility or "leverage effect" does help to explain the skewness of the volatility "smile", allowing for stochastic interest rates has minimal impact on o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} whether implied volatility is an efficient estimator of future one-month volatility from an informational perspective {{and whether it}} outperforms <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> in this regard. We first compare the predictive powers of implied volatility, simple <b>historical</b> <b>volatility,</b> and exponential <b>historical</b> <b>volatility,</b> using monthly observations of the S&P 500, FTSE 100, and DAX equity and option markets from 2004 to 2010. Then, we introduce a GARCH(1, 1) model and compare in-sample GARCHfitted volatility and implied volatility from 2004 to 2010, as well as out-ofsample GARCH-forecasted volatility and implied volatility from 2005 to 2010, using data on the S&P 500. We find that implied volatility {{is not only an}} efficient estimator of future volatility, but also that its information content is at least as good, if not much better, than that of <b>historical</b> <b>volatility.</b> Our results also suggest that implied volatility systematically subsumes the information included in <b>historical</b> <b>volatility,</b> even when a GJR-GARCH model is utilized. by Vladimir M.

40|$|Credit default swaps (CDS) {{are similar}} to out-of-the-money put options in that both offer a low cost and {{effective}} protection against downside risk. This study investigates whether put option-implied volatility is an important determinant of CDS spreads. Using a large sample of firms with both CDS and options data, we find that individual firms' put option-implied volatility dominates <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> in explaining the time-series variation in CDS spreads. To understand this result, we show that implied volatility is a more efficient forecast for future realized volatility than <b>historical</b> <b>volatility.</b> More importantly, the volatility risk premium embedded in option prices covaries with the CDS spread. These findings complement existing empirical evidence based on market-level data.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the predictive properties of risk indicators {{for the foreign}} exchange markets. In particular it considers the predictive properties of <b>historical</b> <b>volatilities</b> and implied volatilities for movements in various bilateral exchange rates and compares them with the analogous properties of a composite indicator of risk, the Global Hazard Index (GHI). The GHI {{is a function of}} the implied volatility derived from currency options on the three major exchange rates, i. e. the euro-US dollar, the US dollar-yen and the euro-yen. For the empirical analysis this paper employs the concept of kernel volatility, which, loosely speaking, expresses the volatility of one variable conditional on the level of another. Simple regressions show that the levels of all the indicators on a particular day have a strong link to the variance of the nominal bilateral exchange rate on the next day. A strong overall influence is displayed by the GHI, especially for the currencies of small open economies. JEL Classification: F 01, F 31...|$|R

40|$|This study compares {{different}} methods of forecasting price volatility in the crude oil futures market using daily {{data for the}} period November 1986 through March 1997. It compares the forward-looking implied volatility measure with two backward-looking time-series measures based on past returns [...] a simple <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> estimator {{and a set of}} estimators based on the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) class of models. Tests for the relative information content of implied volatilities vis [...] vis GARCH time series models are conducted within-sample by estimating nested conditional variance equations with returns information and implied volatilities as explanatory variables. Likelihood ratio tests indicate that both implied volatilities and past returns contribute volatility information. The study also checks for and confirms that the conditional Generalized Error Distribution (GED) better describes fat-tailed returns in the crude oil market as compared to the conditional normal distribution. Out-of-sample forecasts of volatility using the GARCH GED model, implied volatility, and <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> are compared with realized volatility over two-week and fourweek horizons to determine forecast accuracy. Forecasts are also evaluated for predictive power by regressing realized volatility on the forecasts. GARCH forecasts, though iii superior to <b>historical</b> <b>volatility,</b> do not perform as well as implied volatility over the twoweek horizon. In the four-week case, <b>historical</b> <b>volatility</b> outperforms both of the other measures.

The TOP method consists in searching for a robust noise-averaged optimal path of the distance matrix along which the two time series have the greatest similarity. Here, we generalize the TOP method by introducing a more general definition of distance which takes into account possible regime shifts between positive and negative correlations. This generalization to track possible changes of correlation signs is able to identify possible transitions from one convention (or consensus) to another. Numerical simulations on synthetic time series verify that the new TOP method performs as expected even {{in the presence of}} substantial noise.
