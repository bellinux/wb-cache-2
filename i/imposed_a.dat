5|$|In 1798, {{the revolutionary}} French {{government}} conquered Switzerland and <b>imposed</b> <b>a</b> new unified constitution.

The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation.|$|E
