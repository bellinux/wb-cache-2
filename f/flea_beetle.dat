5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis, {{commonly}} known as the Lundy cabbage <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> or the bronze Lundy cabbage <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a species of <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> endemic to the island of Lundy, where it lives and feeds upon the endemic Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii). Along with the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> Psylliodes napi, it is known only from the Lundy cabbage. The species was first recorded by Thomas Vernon Wollaston in the 1840s, and was named by the Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Two {{invertebrate}} taxa are {{endemic to}} Lundy, with both feeding on the endemic Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii). These are the Lundy cabbage <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> (Psylliodes luridipennis), {{a species of}} leaf beetle (family Chrysomelidae) and the Lundy cabbage weevil (Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes), a variety of true weevil (family Curculionidae). In addition, the Lundy cabbage is the main host of a flightless form of Psylliodes napi (another species of <b>flea</b> <b>beetle)</b> and {{a wide variety of}} other invertebrate species which are not endemic to the island. Another resident invertebrate of note is Atypus affinis, the only British species of purseweb spider.|$|E
5|$|Adult Psylliodes luridipennis beetles are {{invariably}} {{found on}} the Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species endemic to the island of Lundy, where they feed on the leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure the beetles onto other crucifers taken from gardens. Two other taxa are known only from Lundy cabbages—the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of the <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> Psylliodes napi—making the plant unique to Britain as the only endemic species which is the exclusive host to endemic insect species. However, the Lundy cabbage is also host to a diverse variety of other invertebrate species.|$|E

40|$|Leaf beetles {{belong to}} most diverse groups of insects {{and the biggest}} {{diversity}} inside this group is among <b>flea</b> <b>beetles.</b> This work summarizes existing hypotheses about their relationships with other groups of leaf beetles (especially galerucines) and compares various hypotheses about their phylogenetic position and suprageneric systematics. I also rewiev known fossils of flea beeltes and discuss their systematic position and evolutionary or biogeographic significance. The success of <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> is likely caused among others by their specific characters, (e. g. their jumping ability), and also their ability to reach dozens of various strategies and ecological adaptations. I discuss both morphological and ecological specifics of <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> and especially, I focus on apparently marginal life strategies - terrestrial and moss inhabitance, because in these ecological niches, an interestingly big diversity of <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> is uncovered recently. Moss-inhabiting <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> are also a very interesting model for ecological, evolutionary and biogeographical studies, because of their high endemism and low dispersal abilities.

5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E

40|$|The feeding periods {{required}} by corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> to acquire and transmit Pantoea stewartii were investigated in the Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s disease of corn pathosystem. To quantify {{the effect of}} acquisition feeding period on percentage of acquisition, field-collected corn beetles were allowed to feed for 6, 12, 24 36, 48, and 72 h on corn seedlings previously inoculated with a rifampicin- and nalidixic acid-restraint strain of P. stewartii. Acquisition of P. stewartii by corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> was considered positive if the rifampicin- and nalidixic acid-marked strain was recovered on selective media. To quantity the effect of transmission feeding period on percent transmission of P. stewartii by corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles,</b> P. stewartii- infested corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> were allowed to feed on healthy corn seedlings for periods of 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h.

The aim of this work was evaluation sensibility of the <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> of birth Phyllotreta and Psylliodes to active substances of pyrethroid insecticides (lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin and tau-fluvalinate), neonicotinoids (thiacloprid) and organophosphorous insecticides (chlorpyrifos-ethyl). The research was conducted during 2013 in the 22 locations and in 2014 at 15 sites in the Czech Republic. Beetles were collected from normal commercial oilseed colza and mustard. Testing was conducted by laboratory methods of IRAC number 011, 021 and 025, during testing was used the (adul-vial-test). These metods are determined for monitoring (Meligethes spp.), but also these metods are suitable for testing another kind of pest of colza.
