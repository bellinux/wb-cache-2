500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yaxley's {{motto is}} [...] "Let me try and, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can't do it, I'll <b>know,</b> but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it, then watch out world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> well <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get my way," [...] {{answered}} Christopher, with a merry laugh. [...] "Say now, Father, if {{it should}} so be that this lady were willing, could you marry us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave them to me!" [...] now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself easily heard {{through all}} the din. [...] "Leave them to me. I fancy <b>I</b> <b>know</b> them. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only {{get a good look}} at them, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> soon tell who they are." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jones, though, {{is happy}} with those odds. He has beaten worse {{predictions}} before after being given a 70% chance of recovering from his horrific cruciate ligament injury at Brisbane in 2002. [...] "I'll always back myself," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> bowl {{at the top of}} my game I can get in that side." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elliott {{has said}} {{that she wants to}} start a family, but she is afraid of giving birth. She stated, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take that kind of pain [...] Maybe in the year 2020 you could just pop a baby out and it'd be fine. But right now I'd rather just adopt." [...] Elliott and her father {{occasionally}} talk, but the rapper says she has not forgiven him.|$|E
2500|$|Scott-Heron {{admitted}} ambivalence {{regarding his}} association with rap, remarking in 2010 in an interview for the Daily Swarm: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take the blame for [...] ". As New York Times writer Sisario explained, he preferred the moniker of [...] "bluesologist". Referring to reviews of his last album and references {{to him as the}} [...] "godfather of rap", Scott-Heron said: [...] "It's something that's aimed at the kids ... I have kids, so I listen to it. But I would not say it's aimed at me. I listen to the jazz station." [...] In 2013, Chattanooga rapper Isaiah Rashad recorded an unofficial mixtape called Pieces of a Kid, which was greatly influenced by Heron's debut album Pieces of a Man.|$|E

"As long as {{you don't}} know whether they are in that room or not, you are {{uncertain}} what to do," [...] said Miss Pross to herself; [...] "and you shall not <b>know</b> that, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hold you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... <b>if</b> <b>i</b> <b>can</b> cook / {{you know}} god <b>can</b> (sometimes <b>known</b> as <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Cook You <b>Know</b> God Can) is a culinary memoir by Ntozake Shange. It was {{originally}} published by Beacon Press, in Boston MA, United States in 1998. The piece is both memoir and cookbook. Short essays precede recipes written in personal vernacular, and these recipes cover locations such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the United States.|$|R
2500|$|At Sakura-Con 2013, Kawahara {{noted that}} [...] "the {{character}} of Asuna I might {{have created a}} little too perfectly for Sword Art Online. When teamed up with Kirito, there were hardly any problems the two as a pair could not overcome", in response to whether Asuna was a [...] "tricky character" [...] to develop. In an interview with Haruka Tomatsu, Asuna's voice actor, she said that [...] "rather than having something similar to her, I feel that to me, she is the ideal person that I would want to become. After all, she can cook, she's smart... I think that she's the type of woman I wanted to become and admired. Leaving aside if I can cook well, though, I really like to cook. I don't really <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say if we are alike because of that, though." ...|$|E
2500|$|The music {{industry}} suggested that iPods {{have a substantial}} and legitimate commercial use in contrast to Grokster, to which Souter replied, [...] "I know perfectly well that I can buy a CD {{and put it on}} my iPod. But I also <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get music without buying it, I'm going to do so." [...] On the other hand, the justices seemed troubled at the prospect of ruling that Grokster's alleged business model of actively inducing infringement and then reaping the commercial benefits was shielded from liability. Grokster argued that affirming the Ninth Circuit would only prevent an injunction against future use of the P2P software, while the plaintiffs would still be free to pursue damages in the district court for alleged past wrongful acts. Much of the Court, however, expressed skepticism that Grokster's continuing enterprise could be severable from the consequences of those prior acts.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do let me <b>know</b> <b>if</b> there's {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{do to help}} you. We're {{acquainted with}} two or three of your engineering faculty at the Office. They write in about various things. Do you happen to know Dr. Philgren?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come!" [...] he said, [...] "that's brave! but it {{will not}} be {{necessary}} to make quite so violent a sacrifice. I have great power too in this city and great influence over the bereaved father," [...] he continued, lying unblushingly, [...] "I <b>know</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> restore his daughter to him within the next four and twenty hours, I could prevail upon him to give up pursuit of the villain who abducted her, and to let him go free." ...|$|R

[...] "So, as <b>I</b> say, <b>if</b> your excellency were to give me my freedom for a few days, being a man of understanding, I should then repay the government and be in position to be of service to your excellency.

6000|$|... "That guy's a tight one," [...] said Billy, jerking {{his hand}} in the {{direction}} of the guardian of the free lunch. [...] "I scoops up about a good, square meal for a canary bird, an' he makes me cough up half of it. Wants to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> t'ink <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go into the restaurant business on a fi'-cent schooner of suds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Uncle John, [...] "I want to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep {{my little}} room in your apartments, Patsy; or if you'd prefer {{me to find}} another {{boarding}} place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was lunching here to-day and {{attended}} {{one of the}} waiters who was taken ill afterwards. I should be very glad to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see {{him for a few}} moments." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then, friend, {{you shall}} <b>know</b> it now, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> but find {{a dozen men}} to follow me," [...] {{answered}} Peter with a savage laugh. [...] "What? Shall I see my mistress carried off before my eyes and strike no blow to save her? Rather will I trust in God and do it, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> die, then die I must, as a man should.

6000|$|... 'Now, mind!' she exclaimed, {{turning back}} {{on her way to}} the door, and looking shrewdly at me, with her {{forefinger}} up again.--'I have some reason to suspect, from what I have heard--my ears are always open; I can't afford to spare what powers I have--that they are gone abroad.

6000|$|... "Don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> I've started kind of late. But listen! What do {{you think}} I've done this two weeks? I've read almost clear through a Latin grammar, and about twenty pages of Caesar." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, let us {{understand}} each other," [...] he said gently. [...] "There is no anger between us, {{though there is}} that which I cannot endure at present.

5000|$|It is {{the example}} of the rider who wishes to become an expert horseman: [...] "None of your soft-mouthed, docile animals for me," [...] he says; [...] "the horse for me to own must show some spirit" [...] in the belief, no doubt, if he can manage such an animal, it will be easy enough to deal with every other horse besides.
