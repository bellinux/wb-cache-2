Interactions between gums are conducted to enhance functional properties of finished products and reduce processing costs. In this study, camelina gum, from the oil-seed plant Camelina sativa, is characterized by carbohydrate composition and morphological, thermal, and rheological properties. Interactions with xanthan gum, galactomannans guar gum, and locust bean gum (LBG) are also studied. Camelina gum is composed of arabinose, rhamnose, galactose, glucose, xylose and mannose; according to high-performance anion exchange chromatography analysis. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed camelina gum with fibrillar structure and <b>intermeshed</b> <b>network.</b> Camelina gum solutions exhibited a shear thinning flow behavior {{in a range of}} concentrations (0. 1 % to 2. 0 % w/w) and shear rate (0. 001 sˉ¹ to 3000 sˉ¹). Camelina gum is temperature independent at temperature ranges from 4 °C to 90 °C. The apparent viscosity increased as gum concentration increased. Mechanical properties of camelina gum demonstrated viscoelastic behavior with entangled molecular chains. Interaction of camelina gum with monovalent salt NaCl significantly reduced the viscosity of camelina gum solution at 1 % when NaCl concentration increased. Camelina gum is soluble in water up to 60 % ethanol content, in which the rheological properties do not significantly differ from camelina gum in water solution only. A synergy with xanthan and galactomannans was determined. All mixtures exhibited shear-thinning flow behavior, solid-like behavior at low frequencies, and liquid-like behavior at high frequencies. For camelina-galactomannans mixtures, synergistic interactions occurred in LBG-camelina mixtures at ratios of 1 : 1 and 3 : 1. For xanthan-camelina mixture, maximum synergy was observed at the ratio 1 : 1. Synergistic effects of gum mixtures suggest dependency on the ratios and chemical structures of the gums. The effect of temperature on apparent viscosity of mixtures is not significant. Results showed that camelina gum can be used for commercial applications...|$|E
40|$|In summary, the {{presented}} thesis analyzes {{two distinct}} economic subjects: {{security of supply}} in natural gas markets and greenhouse gas abatement potentials in the residential heating market. These subjects considered both reflect key points in the triangle of energy policy and are both associated with transnational market failures within energy markets. The security of supply analyses in an <b>intermeshed</b> <b>network</b> are approached from a rather normative, top-down perspective of a social planner. On the contrary, the analyses of greenhouse gases emitted by households are positive analyses of consumer choices. The normative analyses of security of supply in natural gas markets and the positive analyses on greenhouse gas abatement in the residential heating market are organized in {{two parts of the}} thesis. 1. Normative analyses - Security of supply in natural gas markets: The two papers of {{the first part of the}} dissertation thesis are based on a normative approach with the European natural gas market and infrastructure model TIGER that allows for security of supply analyses. The general idea behind the modeling approach is based on the assumption of a social planner and finds an efficient utilization of the natural gas infrastructure. More precisely, the security of supply analyses conducted in the first part of the thesis refer to scenario simulations of disrupted supply routes in the European natural gas network. The effects of these security of supply scenarios on the usage of other infrastructure components, on marginal supply costs and disruptions to consumers are investigated. 2. Positive analyses of greenhouse gas abatement potentials - Econometric modeling of consumer choices and evaluation of public policies: The second part of the thesis includes two positive analyses which investigate household choices to derive greenhouse gas abatement potentials. In the residential heating market, the energy efficiency level exhibited and the type of energy carrier used are determined by investment decisions and significantly affect the level of greenhouse gas emissions. Major investment decisions of households concern investments in heating systems and in dwelling insulation. The investment decision of heterogenous households is not strictly driven by monetary objectives but also by non-monetary preferences. Hence, understanding household behavior is crucial for the development of targeted policies in greenhouse gas abatement. In the third paper of the thesis, micro-economic greenhouse gas abatement curves are derived theoretically and numerically by applying the dynamic microsimulation model (DIscrHEat) for the residential heating market, which integrates a discrete choice estimation of household behavior by using data on actual heating choices. The last paper is a panel data analysis of the effectiveness of subsidies on residential investments in energy efficiency and on energy consumption applying a differences-in-differences-in-differences approach. ...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{spread of}} mobile devices, the {{emergence}} of key wireless technologies, and the nomadic user and com-puting lifestyles on current networks are continuously evolving in synergy. MANETs, WSNs, and WMNs are examples of self-organizing unstructured networks that have their local communication paradigms and are opti-mized to perform under their particular physical constraints. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are particularly interesting because {{of their ability to}} operate in a pure ad-hoc mode or to include some infrastructural compo-nents, making them suitable for a multitude of applications. Inter-networking among the heterogeneous access networks is currently offered by the Internet Protocol (IP). However, the evolution of and the innovation within these networks is greatly hindered by the rigidity of the current Internet implementation and its lag in efficiently supporting flexible unstructured communication paradigms. To broaden the user’s innovation space and to effi-ciently embrace the characteristics of emerging networks, clean-slate architectural approaches are being pursued. In this paper, we propose InterMesh, a novel iner-networking platform for wireless mesh <b>networks.</b> <b>InterMesh</b> enables heterogeneous access networks to converge at a novel Persistent Identification and Networking Layer (PINL), providing a seamless service to individual network entities. This paper identifies the key concepts be-hind the <b>InterMesh</b> <b>network</b> platform, presents an interesting prototype implementation that can coexist wit...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{participate}} in most aspects of cellular differentiation and homeostasis, and consequently have roles in many pathologies, including cancer. These small non-coding RNAs exert their {{effects in the}} context of complex regulatory networks, often made all the more extensive by the inclusion of transcription factors as their direct targets. In recent years, the increased availability of gene expression data and the development of methodologies that profile miRNA targets en masse have fuelled our understanding of miRNA functions, and of the sources and consequences of miRNA dysregulation. Advances in experimental and computational approaches are revealing not just cancer pathways controlled by single miRNAs but also <b>intermeshed</b> regulatory <b>networks</b> controlled by multiple miRNAs, which often engage in reciprocal feedback interactions with the targets that they regulate.

40|$|The European Union (EU) is an {{international}} actor (Stavridis and Fernandez Sola 2011) having a long-standing relationship with the Southern Mediterranean countries that may {{be traced back to}} the 1950 s, when Algeria was still part of France. Over the years, the EEC (European Economic Community) has gradually strengthened its links with the Southern riparian states. After developing into the EU, it began a new process of (inter-) regional links by setting up the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP; also known as ´Barcelona Process´) in 1995. In 2008, this process was further transformed into the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM. Those institutionalized relations fall within a wider context where other sets of <b>intermeshing</b> connections and <b>networks</b> exist, be they bilateral or multilateral, including or not an EU dimension (for a review, see Sabic and Bojinovic 2007). The purpose of this study is to offer a descriptive analysis of two important dimensions of already existing institutionalized relations: its parliamentary dimension on the one hand, its decentralized (also referred to as territorialized) dimension on the other. Even if changes are almost inevitably made in the way the current UfM structure works due to the unavoidable impact of the Arab Revolutions, there is no need for new institutional frameworks to be set up. Our argument is that those welcome changes will hopefully make the existing structures work better … at long last.
