Jointly Managed Inventory(JMI) {{have shown}} inimitable {{foreground}} in management system, it can balance {{upstream and downstream}} enterprises ' risk-sharing authority and responsibility by the coordination of their common stock, suppliers and manufacturers can share their joint stock of raw materials, manufacturers and sale agents can share and sales their joint stock of finished product. Because steel market need to face price wave frequently and acutely, JMI is adapt to it especially. In the paper, we tried to proposal a model of <b>jointly</b> <b>managed</b> <b>inventory</b> simulation for third-party stock mode in the steel market's ERP system, we discussed the design goals and principles of the system, described the internal structure of the model in detail, and then advised the key points in implementation strategies...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a finite-horizon, multiechelon inventory {{system in which}} the surplus of stock can be sold (i. e., disposed) in the secondary markets at each stage in the system. What are called nested echelon order-up-to policies are shown to be optimal for <b>jointly</b> <b>managing</b> <b>inventory</b> replenishments and secondary market sales. Under a general restriction on model parameters, we establish that it is optimal not to both sell off excess stock and replenish inventory. Secondary market sales complicate the structure of the system, so that the classical Clark and Scarf echelon reformulation no longer allows for the decomposition of the objective function under the optimal policy. We introduce a novel class of policies, referred to as the disposal saturation policies, and show that there exists a disposal saturation policy, determined recursively by a single base-stock level at each echelon, that achieves the decomposition of this problem. The resulting optimal replenishment policy is shown to be the echelon base-stock policy. We demonstrate the heuristic performance of this disposal saturation policy through a series of numerical studies: except at extreme ranges of model parameters, the policy provides a very good approximation to the optimal policy while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We also conduct numerical studies to determine the value of the secondary markets for multistage supply chains and assess its sensitivity to model parameters. The results provide potentially useful insights for companies seeking to enter or develop secondary markets for supply chains...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} four variants of supplier <b>managed</b> <b>inventory</b> on total costs and cost distribution in a capital goods supply chain consisting of a parts supplier who delivers parts to an original equipment manufacturer’s assembly plant. The four supplier <b>managed</b> <b>inventory</b> variants differ in the components of inventory costs that the supplier has to carry. The performance of the supplier <b>managed</b> <b>inventory</b> relationships is benchmarked with the situation where the assembly plant <b>manages</b> the <b>inventories.</b> Interesting managerial insights follow from this comparison. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Supply chain {{information}} flow significantly influences material flow behaviour. To improve supply chain performance, efficient information sharing practices are largely recommended. However limited knowledge exists on how companies should choose their supply chain planning approaches {{and the extent}} to which information is required. Additionally, current literature does not give answers to the question of which situations, or during which supply chain phase, vendor <b>managed</b> <b>inventory,</b> VMI is an efficient replenishment mechanism. This research treats the selection of coordination mechanisms, especially supply chain planning and VMI, for manufacturing companies. The coordination theory is applied to provide a theoretical basis to consider how companies can <b>jointly</b> <b>manage</b> business processes across the supply chain. The research questions are (1) how to select operational coordination mechanisms to match demand and supply in manufacturing companies, and (2), how reach the balance between {{information flow}} and material flow by the use of chosen mechanism. The thesis consists of six studies, which contain three empirical cas...|$|R
