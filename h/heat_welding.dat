Using a common probe station and photolithographically patterned gold electrodes, the welding process is completed using a common semiconductor analyzer.

This procedure is designed for metal–metal contacts where a strong dielectric intermediate layer might exist, which can occur with metals prone to oxidation or corrosion in air, or {{as a result of the}} electrode deposition process. Ohmic connections are also established in cases where there is an initial gap between two nanowires.|$|E
30|$|Welding {{can be used}} to {{construct}} complex structures from the bottom-up out of simple constituents. Connecting nanowires with electrodes and the formation of nanowire interconnects also require ohmic welding. Methods used to weld nanowires include electron beam bombardment [7], ion beam bombardment [8], plasmonic welding [9], soldering [10], cold fusion [11], pulsed laser [12], and Joule heating [13, 14, 15]. Of these, Joule <b>heat</b> <b>welding</b> has several advantages. Electrical contact to small structures is already well understood, and the equipment required for this process is readily available and inexpensive. This is in contrast to the other methods which require equipment such as ion or electron guns, lasers, advanced microscopy, and vacuum technology which make them costly and complex. Using Joule heating, one can construct a self-executing process whereby the welding mechanism autonomously stops when the weld is complete. This trait is only shared with certain types of plasmonic welding, where the localized plasmonic excitations decrease once welding is completed [9, 16]. However, because the wavelength required for plasmonic welding is material dependent, a sophisticated light source is required, and there can be difficulty in welding dissimilar materials. Joule <b>heat</b> <b>welding</b> is more versatile and only requires the materials to be capable of conducting current. Joule heating can also be applied regardless of contact direction and is concentrated at the junction, whereas bombardment techniques can cause damage to the nanowire away from the contact point and introduce impurities. For these reasons, Joule heating is chosen here as the method of welding.|$|E

Ti stabilization is ineffective at the heat inputs used in this investigation due to the rapid cooling rate through the temperature region where TiC precipitates. The presence of N was found to be detrimental since it consumes Ti on cooling, forming TiN, effectively lowering the amount of Ti available for TiC formation during rapid cooling after welding.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in bio-based plastics due to environmental concerns as well as fluctuating oil and gas prices. Bio-based plastics, as defined here, are those plastics that are fully or partially produced from renewable feedstock. As with many products, sealing and cutting of semi-finished parts are required. This is particularly true with packaging applications, such as food packages, where there is a natural fit for bio-plastics because of the product 2 ̆ 7 s short life cycle (3 ̆c 1 year) and large amount of waste associated with this product (12. 5 million tons of containers and packaging per year). In order to increase the acceptance of polylactic acid (PLA a starch derived bioplastic), its weldability and cuttability was studied in detail. Ultrasonic and <b>heat</b> <b>welding,</b> which are two common welding techniques in industrial applications, are examined in terms of weld strength, cycle time, and weld strength consistency. While the ultrasonic welding of PLA is very effective, <b>heat</b> <b>welding</b> is examined in great detail to find the activation energy for diffusion in such processes. In addition, the ultrasonic cutting that is often done simultaneously with ultrasonic welding processes is examined here too. The cuttability of PLA was studied by examining the cutting speed, the mechanical properties of the material after cutting as well as the surface of the cut. In addition, a new kind of cutting tool was developed that can cut and seal simultaneously. However, the manufacturing of products from bio-based plastics may result in more energy consumption, waste, and emissions than traditional plastics, which would reduce or eliminate the acceptance of PLA. In order to address this issue, a model was generated to examine the `Carbon Footprint 2 ̆ 7 of bio-plastics such as zein (a corn based protein polymer), soy protein isolate (SPI) (a soy bean based protein polymer), and polylactic acid (PLA) which compares these materials to petroleum based plastics with similar mechanical properties and potentially similar applications, such as polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS).

40|$|Stainless steels are a {{classification}} of materials {{that have been}} available for over 100 years and over that time manufacturers have created variations on chemical composition and manufacturing route, to create materials that meet specific criteria set by the consumer. One type of stainless steel, ferritic, is restricted in applications {{as a result of}} a reduction in properties, namely toughness, when it is welded as a result of grain coarsening in the heat affected zone. Welding equipment manufacturers are constantly incorporating new technologies and capabilities into welding equipment, to make welding easier and create better welds, which then gives that manufacturer a competitive advantage. Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) welding is one such innovation and is claimed by the manufacturer to be a lower heat input process. This research project examines the effects of this lower <b>heat</b> <b>welding</b> process, on the joining of ferritic stainless steels to determine if CMT can reduce the detrimental effects, seen in this material, through welding. The research examines the mechanical and metallurgical effects of using the Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) welding process to weld various grades of ferritic stainless steel including, EN 1. 4016, EN 1. 4509, EN 1. 4521 and EN 1. 4003 and compares them to welds created using a standard Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) technique, with comparisons made using tensile testing, hardness testing, impact testing, fatigue testing and microstructural characterisation. Experimental results show that grades such as EN 1. 4016 and EN 1. 4003 are more sensitive to the welding process due to a phase change to martensite present within the heat affected zone. Work has been conducted to determine the temperature at which ferrite transforms to austenite, prior to transformation to martensite under non equilibrium cooling. Some of the findings from this work included; Fatigue testing and microstructural characterisation has shown a benefit in properties for using CMT over the conventional GMAW process for the EN 1. 4003 material.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, with driving currents, {{the power}} reduces as the resistance decreases. This {{means that a}} process can be designed whereby as the welding completes, the heat automatically subsides, leading to a self-executing welding process. As Tohmyoh showed [14], there is a threshold of power at which the heat applied is enough for welding yet low enough not to cause to damage to the nanowires. Current ramps serve {{as a method of}} finding the appropriate current quickly, without having to incrementally adjust a constant current measurement. While resistance is still high, small current steps must be used because large steps can burn the nanowire. However, when using small steps, it takes an impractically long time to reach a sufficiently high current to complete the weld (and current-source units often have a maximum limit to the number of measurement steps). That is why multiple current ramps, each with larger step sizes, are thus used to lower the contact resistance step by step. During each current ramp, before welding begins and resistance changes, power and heat increase along with the increasing current. As the heat approaches the breakdown temperature of the intermediate layer, the layer partly dissolves and the resistance decreases, which is observed as a drop in the voltage response. Since the power decreases as the intermediate layer becomes ineffective, the complete dissolution of the intermediate layer does not typically occur until a current on the order of 1  mA is reached. At this point, the heat at the junction is also high enough for local melting of the silver and thus for welding to occur. As found in other works on Joule <b>heat</b> <b>welding</b> of metallic nanowires [14], the power required for welding was not dependent on nanowire length since the resistance of the junction is much larger than the resistance of the nanowires themselves [26]. Once melting is achieved, the junction exhibits a linear voltage–current response. The completion of welding is evident with further measurements. This is done by first leaving the junction to settle without current for several minutes and then running a current ramp. A linear response would confirm the completion of the weld, while a surge response with a voltage spike {{at the start of the}} measurement would show an uncompleted weld. The typical electrical response to such current ramp sweeps is shown in Fig.  3 b, and an image of a typical overlapped junction after welding is shown in Fig.  3 c. The image shows that the morphology of the nanowires is minimally affected away from the junction, including next to either electrodes.|$|E
