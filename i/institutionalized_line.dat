40|$|The {{constant}} {{progress of}} the socio-economic development in our time has triggered competition worldwide which makes industrial and commercial establishments divert to human resources in order to distinguish themselves and survive. Family businesses both in Turkey and other countries, therefore, apply to HRM so as to overcome such problems deriving from their structures. This study tackles the family business that faces the problems in HRM and finds the solution to these problems. Studies show that companies who efficiently benefit from the principles of human resources have made remarkable headway. Additionally the family businesses which benefit from HRM and functions can solve the structural problems and catch the successful and <b>institutionalized</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{strengths}} of product line engineering {{have been described}} before. But how can an organization make the move from developing one-of products to product line engineering without major interruptions in the day-today work? This paper describes how to perform the transition to product line engineering and lists the various strategies for such a transition. It also describes how to create an adoption plan and how to <b>institutionalize</b> product <b>line</b> engineering in an organization. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{good fit}} between {{the person and}} the {{organization}} is essential in a better organizational performance. This is even more crucial in case of institutionalization of a software product line practice within an organization. Employees’ participation, organizational behavior and management contemplation {{play a vital role}} in successfully <b>institutionalizing</b> software product <b>lines</b> in a company. Organizational dimension has been weighted as one of the critical dimensions in software product line theory and practice. A comprehensive empirical investigation to study the impact of some organizational factors on the performance of software product line practice is presented in this work. This is the first study to empirically investigate and demonstrate the relationships between some of the key organizational factors and software product line performance of an organization. The results of this investigation provide empirical evidence and further support the theoretical foundations that in order to <b>institutionalize</b> software product <b>lines</b> within an organization, organizational factors play an important role...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. 1 Currently, the key {{approach}} to large-scale software reuse is product line development, an approach built upon the systematic development of {{building blocks for}} reuse. While most work on product lines focusses on technical issues, {{in the end they}} are built by by people. Winning them for product line development is a key issue in successfully introducing and <b>institutionalizing</b> product <b>line</b> development in an organization. This makes people issues a key concern in technology transfer. Based on our experience in technical transfer in the product line area we developed some hypotheses on how these people issues can be formed in a way favorable to product line development. In particular, we focus on the relation between the mind set of people, communication patterns, and the organizational structure. We then give concrete rules based on our own industrial experience as well as industry reports that support instutionalizing product line development...|$|R
40|$|Published online: 28 Apr 2014 By {{analysing}} widening as {{the cause}} of deepening, the contribution examines unintended effects of enlargement. During the Eastern enlargement process, the European Commission was assigned competences vis-à-vis the candidate states which exceeded the powers formally conferred to it by the European Union acquis. During the pre-accession phase, the Commission thus implemented double standards that applied to candidate states but not to members. However, these special capacities did not expire in all policies, as expected. Theoretically, this raises the question: Under which conditions does policy-making lead to an increase of supranational capacities? The contribution concludes that widening produces systematic pressure for the deepening of supranational policy-making capacities. Whether such deepening persists depends not only on the interplay of actor preferences and institutional contexts, but to a decisive extent on the actual policy type that is <b>institutionalized.</b> Along these <b>lines,</b> the policy-making exercised in the most recent widening rounds did indeed cause deepening...|$|R
