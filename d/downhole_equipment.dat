40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{numerical}} method to predict the work performance of hydraulic seals used in <b>downhole</b> <b>equipments.</b> The impact of key factors, namely, compression rate and the number of seals, on the wearing behavior of seal components is studied. To simulate the wear process of sealing contact surface, a methodology is built with the iterative wear prediction procedure in which the geometry of the contact interfaceprogressively changes according to the wear model. In this method, the structural and the thermal coupled mechanism is investigated and the performance of seal structure containing different number of seals is discussed. By taking a gear pump used in the downhole robots as a case study, both numerical analysis with proposed method and practical experiment are presented. The simulation results of the worn volume of the seals are consistent with the experiment data.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used RC drill bits are 5-8 inches (13-20 cm) in diameter and have round tungsten 'buttons' that protrude from the bit, which are required to drill through shale and abrasive rock. As the buttons wear down, drilling becomes slower and the rod string can potentially become bogged in the hole. This is a problem as trying to recover the rods may take hours {{and in some cases}} weeks. The rods and drill bits themselves are very expensive, often resulting in great cost to drilling companies when equipment is lost down the bore hole. Most companies will regularly re-grind the buttons on their drill bits in order to prevent this, and to speed up progress. Usually, when something is lost (breaks off) in the hole, it is not the drill string, but rather from the bit, hammer, or stabilizer {{to the bottom of the}} drill string (bit). This is usually caused by operator error, over-stressed metal, or adverse drilling conditions causing <b>downhole</b> <b>equipment</b> to get stuck in a part of the hole.|$|E

Considerations {{must be given}} to the various functions under which the completion equipment must operate and the effects any changes in temperatures or differential pressure will have on the equipment.

30|$|Chokes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of <b>downhole</b> flow-control <b>equipment.</b> The particle erosion mathematical model, which considers particle-particle interaction, was established and used to simulate solid particle movement as well as particle erosion characteristics of the solid-liquid two-phase flow in a choke. The corresponding erosion reduction approach by setting ribs on the inner wall of the choke was advanced. This mathematical model includes three parts: the flow field simulation of the continuous carrier fluid by an Eulerian approach, the particle interaction simulation using the discrete particle hard sphere model by a Lagrangian approach and calculation of erosion rate using semiempirical correlations. The results show that particles accumulated in a narrow region from inlet to outlet of the choke and the dominating factor affecting particle motion is the fluid drag force. As a result, the optimization of rib geometrical parameters indicates that good anti-erosion performance can be achieved by four ribs, each of them with a height (H) of 3 mm and a width (B) of 5 mm equaling the interval between ribs (L).|$|R

Alternative power sources are sought that could be deployed in these harsh environments to replace or supplement standard power sources currently in use. To this end, four investigations were performed to support the design of such a device. In the first investigation base assumptions used in the preliminary design of an electromagnetic energy harvester were shown to be in doubt, implying that the expected power output would not meet initial projections. In the second investigation a parametric study was performed to understand how high uncertainty variables affect the natural frequency and damping ratio of a producing hydrocarbon well. In the third investigation a structural housing was designed to satisfy American Petroleum Institute load cases. Using finite element models and standard tube/casing geometries, design pressures were iterated until a permissible housing design was achieved. This preliminary design provided estimates of the radial width and volume in which energy harvesting and storage elements may be situated. In the last investigation two software programs were developed to estimate the energy that might be harvested from user specified harvester configurations. The programs are dependent on user input production tube accelerations; this permits well operators to use well-specific vibrational data as inputs to generate well-specific energy output estimates. Results indicate that a downhole energy harvesting tool is structurally feasible under reasonable operating conditions but conclusions regarding power output may only be made if actual downhole accelerations are known...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master thesis is borehole stability in the Åre Formation of the Heidrun reservoir, in connection with open hole sand screen completions. Due to operational limitations this type of completion will be more sensitive for borehole stability problems, and each failure or misrun will {{cost a lot of}} money in lost equipment, downtime, side tracking and delayed production. To find a best practice for drilling and completing these wells will therefore be of key importance for the further field development. The purpose of this Master Thesis was to perform literary studies on coal, borehole stability of fractured formations and previous coal experience, and tie this back to the experienced problems with running screens in the Åre reservoir. Some of the main results are shown below: o Coal is a combustible, organic rock with large heterogeneities and anisotropydue to a very characteristic cleat system. With confining strengths Heidrun coal are quite strong with a UCS of 37 MPa from rock mechanical laboratory testing performed by SINTEF. However, due to the cleat system coal appearsas an easily friable rock, which can cause significant problem <b>downhole</b> whenrunning <b>equipment</b> like open hole screen completions, as is the case on Heidrun. o The presence of coal in the Heidrun reservoir has been investigated, as has the coal appearance in Åre problem wells. The coalbed thickness is mostly quite small, about 0, 5 mTVD, and this would most likely not cause a problem inlow to medium angle wells. Almost horizontal wells on the other hand canhave severe differences with this thickness, well illustrated by well A- 24 T 2. o Due to the unpredictable nature of the coal abundance and cleat orientation some uncertainties can not be eliminated in the planning phase. o Even though there are at least 4 of the problem wells that seemingly has nocoal in them, the general assumption from CPI logs is that coal is the mainproblem geology regarding hole enlargements and possible ledge problematic. o Due to the cleat system, coal can be particularly sensitive to pressure transients, caused by surge/swab and ECD variations. This also applies to other geologies, but to a much smaller degree. The solution can prove to be implementing a good mud system that can prevent pressure equalization through the cleat system of coal. Also LEDO drilling and “finesse” during drilling operations are recommended. o The increase in failure wells in the recent years can possibly explained by an increase in ECD and other pressure transients. In addition, depletion in thereservoir can in case of a permeable borehole wall and high angles have a negative effect on stability. </p...|$|R
40|$|During oil {{production}} from several wells in Arabian Gulf area, significant productivity decline was noticed. One {{of the reasons}} behind the productivity decline might be asphaltene precipitation. Production data of the particular wells were collected and analyzed. It was found {{that many of these}} wells were injected with scale and corrosion inhibitors in <b>downhole</b> and surface <b>equipment.</b> Thus, it was desired to investigate the potential of formation damage due to asphaltene in the presence of scale and corrosion inhibitors as field chemicals. The effect of asphaltenes on the wettability, surface, and interfacial tensions were measured in the presence of scale and corrosion inhibitors. It was observed that the scale inhibitor did not indicate any alteration of the wettability, while the presence of corrosion inhibitor indicates high potential for wettability change into oil-wet conditions especially in the presence of asphaltenic oil. Similar results were obtained from the measurements of surface and interfacial tensions, in which corrosion inhibitors showed a significant decrease in surface and interfacial tensions. To assess the potential of asphaltene precipitation in the presence of both inhibitors and to study the effect of asphaltenes on the oil productivity, flooding experiments were carried out and oil/water relative permeability was determined. The results of flooding displacements showed that the presence of scale inhibitors indicates no effect on the oil/water relative permeability even in the presence of asphaltenes, while a significant decrease in oil relative permeability associated with an increase of residual oil saturation was observed in the presence of corrosion inhibitors. Mixture of scale and corrosion inhibitors showed no effect on relative permeability curves. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Production of {{hydrocarbon}} {{from both}} consolidated and unconsolidated clastic reservoir rocks poses {{a risk of}} sand production especially if a well articulated programme of sand management strategy is not {{put in place to}} deal with the problem at the onset of field development. A well articulated programme of sand management would include sand production potential prediction in real time if it is going to be effective at all in achieving the goal of dealing with likely sand problem. Sanding potential prediction in real time is considered an element of sand management strategy that involves the evaluation of risk of sand failure/production and the prediction of the likely sand rate and volume to facilitate optimum design of both <b>downhole</b> and surface <b>equipment</b> especially as related to sand control. Sanding potential prediction is therefore very crucial to reducing costs of field developments to make hitherto unattractive development environments profitable. This undoubtedly will impact positively the present drive to increase worldwide production of hydrocarbon. Specifically, real time sanding potential prediction enables timely reservoir management decisions relating to the choice, design and installation of sand control methods. It is also an important input to sand monitoring and topside management. The current sanding potential prediction models in the industry are found to lack the robustness to predict sanding potential in real time. They also are unable to provide the functionality to track the grain size distributions of the sand producing formation and that of the produced sand. This functionality can be useful in the application of grain size distribution to sanding potential prediction. The scope of this work therefore covers the development of coupled models for grain size distribution and sanding potential predictions in real time. A previous work has introduced the use of a commercial neural network technique for grain size distribution prediction. This work has built upon this by using a purposefully coded neural network in conjunction with statistical techniques to develop a model for grain size distribution prediction in both horizontal and vertical directions and extending the application to failure analysis and prediction of strength and sanding potential in formation rocks. The theoretical basis for this work consists in the cross relationships between formation petrophysical properties and grain size distribution parameters on one hand and between grain size distribution parameters and formation strength parameters on the other hand. Hoek and Brown failure criterion, through an analytical treatment, serves as the platform for the development of the failure model, which is coupled to the grain size distribution and Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) models. The results obtained in this work have further demonstrated the application of neural network to grain size distribution prediction. They also demonstrate that grain size distribution information can be used in monitoring changes in formation strength and by extension, the formation movement within the failure envelope space especially during production from a reservoir formation...|$|R
30|$|Lost {{circulation}} (LOC) is {{a challenge}} for many drilling operators.

30|$|Sand {{production}} {{is one of}} the common problems in oil and gas production wells drilled in unconsolidated formations (Fattahpour et al. 2012). The abrasive flow of sand grains inside the wells and production lines leads to undesirable consequences including erosion of downhole or wellhead equipment, clogging of <b>downhole</b> <b>equipment,</b> subsidence of formation rock, walls destruction, reduction in reservoir recovery, maintenance cost, and in severe cases even death of the well (Ikporo and Sylvester 2015; Isehunwa and Olanrewaju 2010; Pedersen et al. 2017; Singh and van Petegem 2014). Sand production begins when the imposed in situ stresses on the formation exceeds the in situ formation strength (Gholami et al. 2016). On the contrary, sand consolidation usually happens when the natural bonds attach the grains by the cement materials in formations (Marfo et al. 2015).|$|E
30|$|Shear rate {{of layers}} {{of oil in}} {{relative}} positions in flow also is important role for the waxing process of wells. Shear rate directly depends on well flow rate. With its increase up to certain values, the depth of organic deposition moves towards the wellhead due to excess of shear stress in flow upon adhesion of the formed solid organic matters {{to the surface of}} tubing (Jennings and Weispfennig 2005). However, further increase in well flowrate results in the intensive mixing of layers of oil (as the result of the change in the flow condition), the mass transfer per unit time increases, {{and at the same time}} the dynamics of solid organic compounds to form in oil strengthens accelerating the process of the <b>downhole</b> <b>equipment</b> waxing (Jennings and Weispfennig 2005). Thus, the slightest change in production conditions will definitely affect changes in properties of the whole production system.|$|E
30|$|However, the {{production}} conditions of oil show dual nature of impact of watercut on formation of asphaltene-resin-paraffin deposits in well. On the one hand, increase in watercut of mixture increases total heat capacity of upstream, which promotes to raise temperature at the wellhead. This reduces temperature gradients between the bottomhole and wellhead and decreases kinetics of wax precipitation. At the higher watercut (up to 60  % by weight), water performs as the external phase separating oil from surface of tubing and changes the steel surface from oil wet to water wet. In that case, solid asphaltene-resin-paraffin particles being formed in volume do not deposit onto {{surface of the}} <b>downhole</b> <b>equipment.</b> This {{is the case for}} the oil-in-water emulsion only. On the other hand, in case of formation of water-in-oil emulsions, the inhibiting tubes of water droplets presented by natural surface active agents (surfactants), strengthened with three-dimensional structure of wax adhere to the wellbore surface in accordance with its larger free surface and high adhesion factors forming organic deposits that are hard to remediate.|$|E
