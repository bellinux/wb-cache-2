5000|$|In 1958, {{the brand}} rollout in the US {{involved}} a heavily publicized <b>house-to-house</b> <b>distribution</b> of free sample jars from special trucks {{emblazoned with the}} then Jif mascot, the [...] "Jifaroo", a blue kangaroo. An early slogan was [...] "Jif is never dry; a touch of honey tells you why." [...] Early advertising also emphasized the beveled edge of the jar base, meant {{to make it easier}} to get the last bit of Jif out of the corner. For many decades, TV commercials for the product have ended with the tagline, [...] "Choosy mothers choose Jif" [...] and, in the 1990s, [...] "Choosy moms choose Jif." [...] A recent ad features an example of a divide and choose scenario. From 1998 to 2000, there was a musical jingle that accompanied many Jif ads, which used the lyrics, [...] "Moms like you choose Jif, choose Jif!" ...|$|E
40|$|Major {{efforts for}} malaria {{prevention}} programs {{have gone into}} scaling up ownership and use of insecticidal mosquito nets, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where the malaria burden is high. Socioeconomic inequities in access to long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are reduced with free distributions of nets. However, the relationship between social factors and retention of nets after a free distribution has been less studied, particularly using a longitudinal approach. Our research aimed to estimate the ownership and use of LLINs, and examine the determinants of LLIN retention, within an Indigenous Batwa population after a free LLIN distribution. Two LLINs were given free of charge to each Batwa household in Kanungu District, Uganda in November 2012. Surveyors collected data on LLIN ownership and use through six cross-sectional surveys pre- and post-distribution. Household retention, within household access, and individual use of LLINs were assessed over an 18 -month period. Socioeconomic determinants of household retention of LLINs post-distribution were modelled longitudinally using logistic regression with random effects. Direct <b>house-to-house</b> <b>distribution</b> of free LLINs {{did not result in}} sustainable increases in the ownership and use of LLINs. Three months post-distribution, only 73 % of households owned at least one LLIN and this period also saw the greatest reduction in ownership compared to other study periods. Eighteen-months post distribution, only a third of households still owned a LLIN. Self-reported age-specific use of LLINs was generally higher for children under five, declined for children aged 6 - 12, and was highest for older adults aged over 35. In the model, household wealth {{was a significant predictor of}} LLIN retention, controlling for time and other variables. This research highlights on-going socioeconomic inequities in access to malaria prevention measures among the Batwa in southwestern Uganda, even after free distribution of LLINs, and provides critical information to inform local malaria programs on possible intervention entry-points to increase access and use among this marginalized population...|$|E
2500|$|Activities of the Bible Students Association {{were banned}} in the states of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (April 10, 1933) and Bavaria (April 13). When Witnesses responded with a {{nationwide}} <b>house-to-house</b> booklet <b>distribution</b> campaign, many were arrested and within a week bans were extended to the states of Saxony and Hessen. Publications were also confiscated in some states. On April 24 police seized the Bible Student headquarters at Magdeburg, withdrawing five days later after US diplomatic efforts. From mid-May other states issued decrees outlawing the Bible Students and {{by the middle of}} June they were banned in almost every state. In one state's decree, the rationale for the ban was said to be that Bible Students were [...] "imposing" [...] on householders Watch Tower Society journals [...] "which contain malicious attacks on the major Christian churches and their institutions".|$|R
40|$|During an {{outbreak}} of meningococcal disease in a rural community in southwest Alabama in 1975 - 76, we undertook an aggressive campaign of <b>house-to-house,</b> community-wide chemoprophylaxis <b>distribution.</b> Over a three-day period 1, 045 households were visited and 4, 454 persons received medication. The 1970 census lists 967 households with 4, 067 persons residing in the community. To evaluate compliance we cultured for meningococcal carriers {{before and after the}} chemoprophylaxis campaign. All of the previously discovered carriers were negative three weeks after the drug distribution. The cost of the campaign ($ 26, 520) was very small compared to the possible benefit achieved. The methods of planning and executing this campaign are described in detail...|$|R
40|$|Background The renewed {{interest}} in malaria elimination using long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) for malaria prevention has shifted from targeted distributions of vulnerable groups to universal access. Many countries are now reaching high net coverage levels and need to consider options for sustained control. Objectives This review addresses the question: which LLIN distribution mechanisms might be best suited for these approaches? Methods We searched PudMed, EMBASE, Popline, BIDS, African Journals Online, and SciELO using a board list of search terms to identify studies on bed nets. Additional searches were conducted in Google and through reference tracking. The net distribution mechanisms {{in the included studies}} were categorized using an open system of six characteristics with the distribution channel serving as the primary descriptive element. Studies were then further evaluated on net coverage, equity and cost per net delivered. Results Searches of the eight electronic databases produced 258 articles. The secondary search using reference lists and other search engines revealed an additional 44 sources. After an initial screening, 174 reports and studies were included in the detailed review. Community-based distributions (campaigns) achieve rapid increases in net coverage of 30 - 80 %-points among the targeted population and no differences between different implementation models (stand-alone or integrated, <b>house-to-house</b> or <b>distribution</b> point) was found. Equity ratios post distribution were found to b...|$|R

They linked Jehovah's Witnesses to [...] "international Jewry" [...] by pointing to Witness reliance on certain Old Testament texts. The Nazis had grievances {{with many of the}} smaller Protestant groups on these issues, but only Jehovah's Witnesses and the Christadelphian Church refused to bear arms or swear loyalty to the state. Activities of the Bible Students Association were banned in the states of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (April 10, 1933) and Bavaria (April 13).
