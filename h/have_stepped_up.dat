25|$|Although U.N. {{sanctions}} were suspended in 1999, foreign investment was curtailed {{due to the}} U.S. Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA), which capped the annual amount foreign companies can invest in Libya at $20 million (lowered from $40 million in 2001). On 14 August 2003, Libya agreed to compensate families of the 1988 bombing with $2.7 billion, {{to be released in}} three tranches; the first following a lifting of UN sanctions, the second after lifting of US sanctions, and the third after Libya is removed from the U.S. State Department's state sponsors of terrorism list. On 22 December 2003, Libya announced it would abandon WMD programs and comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The US welcomed the move, but said it would maintain economic sanctions until it saw evidence of compliance. On 4 June 2004, US Assistant Secretary of Commerce William H. Lash announced that Libya had sent its first shipment of crude oil to the US since resumption of ties between the two countries. In May 2006, the U.S. officially removed Libya from its list of states that sponsor terrorism and normalized ties and removed sanctions.

2500|$|A {{range of}} {{officials}} {{inside and outside}} Pakistan <b>have</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> suggestions of links between the ISI and terrorist groups in recent years. In fall 2006, a leaked report by a British Defense Ministry think tank charged, [...] "Indirectly Pakistan (through the ISI) has been supporting terrorism and extremism--whether in London on 7/7 , or in Afghanistan, or Iraq." [...] In June 2008, Afghan officials accused Pakistan's intelligence service of plotting a failed assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai; shortly thereafter, they implied the ISI's involvement in a July 2008 Taliban attack on the Indian embassy. Indian officials also blamed the ISI for {{the bombing of the}} Indian embassy. Numerous U.S. officials have also accused the ISI of supporting terrorist groups including the Afghan Taliban. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said [...] "to a certain extent, they play both sides." [...] Gates and others suggest the ISI maintains links with groups like the Afghan Taliban as a [...] "strategic hedge" [...] to help Islamabad gain influence in Kabul once U.S. troops exit the region.

He further stated, [...] "Extremist organizations serving as proxies of the government of Pakistan are attacking Afghan troops and civilians as well as US soldiers." ...|$|E

Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates <b>have</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> contacts with Israel and pro-Israel Jewish groups in the USA. The outreach has the Bush administration's blessing: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said six Arab States of the Persian Gulf and Egypt, Jordan and Israel are a new alignment of moderates to oppose extremists backed by Iran and Syria. She has said an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal would weaken militants such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Saudi and Arab states' contacts with Israelis and American Jews go back more than a decade but have never been so public. Arab countries have treated Israel as a pariah since it gained independence in 1948 (require source and not personal opinion). Most Arab countries ban travel to Israel, investment there and other commercial ties with the Jewish state and routinely refer to it as the [...] "Zionist entity" [...] (require source and personal opinion).
