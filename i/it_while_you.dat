It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29, 2012. In the episode, the Simpson family goes on cruise after being convinced by a bored Bart. He enjoys himself on the vacation until Rowan Priddis, {{the director of the}} cruise, performs a song called [...] "Enjoy <b>It</b> <b>While</b> <b>You</b> Can" [...] that makes him realize the cruise is soon to be over and he has to return to his boring life. Bart decides to trick the crew and the passengers on the ship that the world {{is coming to an end}} back on land because of a pandemic and that the ship therefore has to stay out at sea. He manages to do this with the help of a large television screen, on which he displays a scene from the film The Pandora Strain that features a general officer named William Sullivan warning humanity about a deadly virus.|$|E
