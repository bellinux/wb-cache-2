6000|$|If aught from fearful dreams may be divined, [...] They signify a cock of {{dunghill}} kind.

[...] When choler overflows, then dreams are bred [...] 150 [...] Of flames, and all the family of red; [...] Red dragons, and red beasts, in sleep we view, [...] For humours are distinguish'd by their hue. [...] From hence we dream of wars and warlike things, [...] And wasps and hornets with their double wings. [...] Choler adust congeals our blood with fear, [...] Then black bulls toss us, and black devils tear. [...] In sanguine airy dreams, aloft we bound; [...] With rheums oppress'd, we sink in rivers drown'd. [...] More I could say, but thus conclude my theme, [...] 160 [...] The dominating humour makes the dream. [...] Cato was in his time accounted wise, [...] And he condemns them all for empty lies. [...] Take my advice, and when we fly to ground, [...] With laxatives preserve your body sound, [...] And purge the peccant humours that abound.

[...] Since hot and dry in your complexion join, [...] Beware the sun when in a vernal sign; [...] For when he mounts exalted in the Ram, [...] If then he finds your body in a flame, [...] 180 [...] Replete with choler, I dare lay a groat, [...] A tertian ague is at least your lot. [...] Perhaps a fever (which the gods forefend!) [...] May bring your youth to some untimely end: [...] And therefore, sir, as you desire to live, [...] A day or two before your laxative, [...] Take just three worms, nor under nor above, [...] Because the gods unequal numbers love, [...] These digestives prepare you for your purge; [...] Of fumetory, centaury, and spurge, [...] 190 [...] And of ground ivy add a leaf or two,-- [...] All which within our yard or garden grow.

6000|$|He {{used to talk}} {{to himself}} when he was little, but one day his mother said to him jokingly, [...] "Don't {{you know that he}} who talks to himself has the devil for a listener?" [...] and after that he never dared whisper above his breath when he was alone, though his father and mother had both taught him that there was no devil but his own evil will. He shuddered when he heard a dog howling in the night, for that was a sign that {{somebody}} was going to die. If he heard a hen crow, as a hen sometimes unnaturally would, he stoned her, because it was a sign of the worst kind of luck. He believed that warts came from playing with toads, but you could send them away by saying certain words over them; and he was sorry that he never had any warts, so that he could send them away, and see them go; but he never could bear to touch a toad, and so of course he could not have warts. Other boys played with toads just to show that they were not afraid of having warts; but every one knew that if you killed a toad, your cow would give bloody milk. I dare say the far forefathers of the race knew this too, when they first began to herd their kine in the birthplace of the Aryan peoples; and perhaps they learned then that if you killed a snake early in the day its tail would live till sundown. My boy killed every snake he could; he thought it somehow a duty; all the boys thought so; they dimly felt that they were making a just return to the serpent-tribe for the bad behavior of their ancestor in the Garden of Eden. Once, in a corn-field near the Little Reservoir, the boys found on a thawing day of early spring knots and bundles of snakes writhen and twisted together, in the torpor of their long winter sleep. It was a horrible sight, that afterwards haunted my boy's dreams. He had nightmares which remained as vivid in his thoughts as anything that happened to him by day. There were no poisonous snakes in the region of the Boy's Town, but there were some large blacksnakes, and the boys said that if a blacksnake got the chance he would run up your leg, and tie himself round your body so that you could not breathe. Nobody had ever seen a blacksnake do it, and nobody had ever seen a hoop-snake, but the boys believed there was such a snake, and that he would take his tail in his mouth, when he got after a person, and roll himself along swifter than the fastest race-horse could run. He did not bite, but when he came up with you he would take the point of his tail out of his mouth and strike it into you. If he struck his tail into a tree, the tree would die. My boy had seen a boy who had been chased by a hoop-snake, but he had not seen the snake, though for the matter of that the boy who had been chased by it had not seen it either; he did not stop to see it. Another kind of snake that was very strange was a hair-snake. No one had ever seen it happen, but every one knew that if you put long horsehairs into a puddle of water and let them stay, they would turn into hair-snakes; and when you drank out of a spring you had {{to be careful not to}} swallow a hair-snake, or it would remain <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>stomach</b> and grow there.|$|E

'I can't stand it, sir,' says I. 'You must,' says the captain, 'because it's the cure.' I crammed down a mouthful, and turned paler than ever. 'Go on deck,' says the captain. 'Get rid of the cod's head, and come back to the cabin.' Off I go, and back I come. 'Boiled leg of mutton and trimmings,' says the captain, and helps me. 'No fat, sir,' says I. 'Fat's the cure,' says the captain, and makes me eat it. 'Lean's the cure,' says the captain, and makes me eat it. 'Steady?' says the captain. 'Sick,' says I. 'Go on deck,' says the captain; 'get rid of the boiled leg of mutton and trimmings and come back to the cabin.' Off I go, staggering--back I come, more dead than alive. 'Deviled kidneys,' says the captain. I shut my eyes, and got 'em down. 'Cure's beginning,' says the captain. 'Mutton-chop and pickles.' I shut my eyes, and got them down. 'Broiled ham and cayenne pepper,' says the captain. 'Glass of stout and cranberry tart. Want to go on deck again?' 'No, sir,' says I. 'Cure's done,' says the captain.
