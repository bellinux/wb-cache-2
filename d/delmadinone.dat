50|$|<b>Delmadinone</b> acetate (abbreviated as DMA), {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Tardak, is a {{progestin}} and antiandrogen which is used in veterinary medicine to treat androgen-dependent conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. It must be used with care as {{it has the potential}} to cause adrenal insufficiency via inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion from the pituitary gland. DMA is the C17α acetate ester of <b>delmadinone,</b> which, in contrast to DMA, was never marketed for medical use.|$|E

50|$|CMA, {{also known}} as 17α-acetoxy-6-chloro-6-dehydroprogesterone or as 17α-acetoxy-6-chloropregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a chlorine atom at the C6 position, a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17α position. Analogues of CMA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as cyproterone acetate, <b>delmadinone</b> acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and osaterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|MGA, {{also known}} as 17α-acetoxy-16-methylene-6-dehydro-6-methylprogesterone or as 17α-acetoxy-16-methylene-6-methylpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a methyl group at the C6 position, a methylene group at the C16 position, a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17α position. Analogues of MGA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, <b>delmadinone</b> acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and osaterone acetate. The only structural difference between MGA and megestrol acetate {{is the presence of}} the C16 methylene group in the former.|$|E
40|$|An ultra-performance {{convergence}} chromatography (UPC 2) system coupled tandem {{mass spectrometry}} was successfully utilised to analyse chlormadinone acetate, <b>delmadinone</b> acetate, fluorogestone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, melengestrol acetate, chlortestasterone acetate in bovine and porcine kidney fat. This novel approach obtained an improved resolution {{in comparison to}} previously reported chromatographic methods combined with MS detector in a shorter analytical time. All the acetylgestagen compounds were well separated on a ACQUITY UPC 2 HSS C 18 column (3. 0 × 100 mm, 1. 7 μm) by applying methanol and carbon dioxide (2 / 98). The LOQ of <b>delmadinone</b> acetate, melengestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate are 0. 5 μg/kg, fluorogestone acetate, chlormadinone acetate and chlortestasterone acetate 1. 0 μg/kg. The recoveries of gestagens spiked in kidney fats at a concentration range of 0. 5 to 4 μg/kg were above 86. 1 % with relative standard deviations (RSD) less than 13. 1 %. These rapid and reliable methods {{can be used to}} efficiently separate, characterize and quantify the residues of gestagens in kidney fats with advantages of shorter time, more sensitive and environmental friendly. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} and validated that allows for the simultaneous detection of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA), Megestrol Acetate (MGA), Melengestrol Acetate (MLA), Chlormadinone Acetate (CMA) and <b>Delmadinone</b> Acetate (DMA) in animal kidney fat using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The compounds were extracted from kidney fat using acetonitrile, defatted using a hexane wash and subsequent saponification. Following this extracts were purified on Isolute TM CN solid phase extraction cartridges and analysed by LC-MS/MS. The method was validated in animal kidney fat {{in accordance with the}} criteria defined in Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. The decision limit (CCąwas calculated to be 0. 12, 0. 48, 0. 40, 0. 63 and 0. 54 µg kg- 1, respectively, for MPA, MGA, MLA, DMA and CMA detection capability (CCßvalues of 0. 20, 0. 81, 0. 68, 1. 07 and 0. 92 µg kg- 1 respectively, were obtained. The measurement uncertainty of the method was estimated at 16, 16, 19, 27 and 26 % for MPA, MGA, MLA, DMA and CMA respectively. Fortifying kidney fat samples (n = 18) in three separate assays, show the accuracy of the method to be between 98 and 100 %. The precision of the method, expressed as % RSD values for the within-lab reproducibility at the three levels of fortification (1, 1. 5 and 2 µg kg- 1 for MPA, 5, 7. 5 and 10 µg kg- 1 for MGA, MLA, DMA and CMA) was less than 5 % for all analytes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of <b>delmadinone</b> acetate (DMA) for the treatment of hypersexuality (HS) and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), which are frequently observed in male dogs, for which no surgical treatment has been indicated. The study was performed with 21 intact male dogs that had HS (n = 12) and signs of BPH (n = 9). DMA (Tardak ® or Tardastrex®) was administered subcutaneously to each dog at a dose of 3 - 5 mg/kg and was repeated 15 days later as a second treatment. DMA administration was repeated in some cases until the clinical signs disappeared. The successful recovery rate of HS cases was found to be 50 % after a single application and 25 % by the second and third applications. The mean “recovery periods ” and mean “stable periods ” of these 3 consecutive applications were found to be 5. 83, 7. 66, and 6. 00 days, and 16. 7, 18. 7, and 20. 0 months, respectively. With regard to BPH after consecutive applications, treatment success rates, mean recovery periods, and mean stable periods were 33. 3 %, 22. 2 %, 44. 4 %, 12. 0, 11. 0, 9. 5 days, and> 30, 12, and 13. 5 months, respectively. DMA is clinically applicable as a therapeutic agent for HS and BPH cases; however, repeated applications were required due to temporary recoveries.
