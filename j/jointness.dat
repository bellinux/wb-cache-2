[...] Earlier to this, Majid was known for welcoming dr. Qadeer Khan in the country's military science circles where Qadeer Khan was still welcomed. In 2010, while lecturing on nuclear weapons politics, Majid endorsed Qadeer Khan's services and stressed to the fact that: [...] "Pakistan had {{to be mindful of}} a blatant pursuit of military preponderance in its eastern neighborhood". Lecturing at the National Defence University, General Majid argued that [...] "a proposed fissile material cutoff treaty would target Pakistan specifically. Islamabad has refused to allow talks on such a pact to proceed at the International Conference on Disarmament. As chairman joint chiefs, Majid had asserted his role as principle military adviser to the [...] government of Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and President Asif Ali Zardari on the matters involving the nuclear policy, military affairs, and geostrategic positions of Pakistan. [...] He presented the government a tri-services combat framework to tackle the joint combat operations against the extreme elements; a plan which was duly approved by Prime minister Gillani as part of his war strategy. While presenting this plan Majid noted to Prime minister Gillani {{that there is a need}} to harmonize individual capacities of the services so that efforts are synergized within a framework of <b>jointness</b> and inter-operability to meet present and future challenges. He played a vital role in devising the government to change its foreign policy to neutral matters in Afghanistan, and to lessen the American influence in the country which had dismayed the civil society of the country.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jointness</b> is a {{neologism}} {{coined by}} the United States Armed Forces to describe cross-service cooperation in {{all stages of}} the military processes, from research, through procurement and into operations. Today, it is accepted by many advanced militaries. <b>Jointness</b> is aimed at satisfying the requirements for increasing efficiency and economizing the military budget.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jointness</b> {{is defined}} as a dynamic process {{representing}} an emotional system for attachment and for communication between separate individuals who jointly approach each other in a third, joint, virtual space. <b>Jointness</b> represents an encounter between mother and infant, psychotherapist and patient, or any partners experiencing simultaneously mutual intimacy, while concomitantly safeguarding separateness.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between <b>jointness</b> and symbiosis. Both may commence {{with the beginning of}} life; they may seem similar, and yet they are widely different experiences. In symbiosis, baby and mother behave and function as though they were [...] "an omnipotent system - a dual unity within one common boundary" [...] (Margaret Mahler, 1968, p. 201). Partners of symbiosis can be fully satisfied {{as long as there is}} no hint of separateness. <b>Jointness,</b> on the other hand, represents both the separateness of the two (or more) individuals and their joining in a third virtual space.|$|E
50|$|This {{approach}} views <b>jointness</b> as key for proceeding flexibly in {{a changing}} world. It stresses conceptual flexibility which is obtained {{through the development of}} new mindsets and which precedes flexibility of power and resource.|$|E
50|$|Hence, {{symbiosis}} is a dyadic pathological process, {{even from}} the beginning of life that results in self fragility, narcissistic disturbances and in an immature personality; while <b>jointness</b> represents a triadic healthy development that depends on healthy narcissism and generates separation-individuation, communication and relationship.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of this basic process of <b>jointness</b> between baby and mother depends on mother's capacity to tolerate separateness. It is the mother who imprints the quality {{and the intensity of}} the rapprochement-separation balancing process in their relationship, while both of them are fully invested in each other.|$|E

50|$|<b>Jointness</b> {{is a term}} (R. Solan 1991) in {{psychoanalysis}} and psychodynamic theory, {{describing a}} new look at normal object relation that takes place from the beginning of life.

5000|$|The unique <b>jointness</b> and {{the unique}} communication, {{in a unique}} psychic virtual space are created by the sharing of {{interests}} (emotional or cognitive), and by the mutual investment of partners in a joint phenomenon, object, or idea, meaningful to both.

Each of them is sensorily attentive to the strangeness and the separateness of the “non-I” that the other represents for him. Such a dynamic process of <b>jointness,</b> represents healthy development from birth, paves the way to a sense of individuation and culminates to establish the valuable communication with others relating to their otherness, while preserving separateness and self integrity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jointness</b> {{also creates}} the {{possibility}} for a new manner of warfare called Network-centric warfare. Network-centric Warfare {{is characterized by the}} representation and analysis of information, and its transfer between agents and the center of command who may be distant from one another or even members of different units in the military. This new technology and outlook enable the military to improve operational efficiency {{in a way that was}} not possible in the past. What began as a gradual technological advancement within individual military limbs has grown to include several branches of the armed forces.|$|E
5000|$|On June 12, 2006, President Néstor Kirchner {{brought into}} force the Defense Law, {{which had been}} passed in 1988 {{as a means to}} {{modernize}} the doctrine of the armed forces and define their role, though successive governments had failed to put it into effect. The law states that the armed forces will only be used against foreign aggression, and reduces the powers of the heads of the armed services, centralizing whole operational and acquisitions decisions under the authority of the Armed Forces Joint General Staff ( [...] Estado Mayor Conjunto de las Fuerzas Armadas EMC [...] ) emphasizing <b>Jointness.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{properly}} designed OWS {{system will}} make it clear and easy for regulatory enforcement agencies to determine if OWS system regulations are being violated. At present, {{there is no clear}} and efficient method of determining whether regulations are violated or not. At the most basic level, the absolute absence of any type of standardization of OWS systems makes the initial investigation confusing, dirty, time consuming and sometimes plain incorrect. In the marine industry there is a long-standing and important tradition of [...] "jointness" [...] in marine forensic investigations, where all parties at interest examine the same things at the same time. However, due to the criminal character of OWS violations the <b>jointness</b> concept is abandoned, which leads to very poor technical investigative methods and severe unnecessary disruptions to vessel operations.|$|E
5000|$|Most Western {{countries}} have abolished mandatory income splitting, while {{in several countries}} income splitting is optional (if the couple chooses it). A 2009 study of 26 European countries found that: [...] "In France, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Portugal, couples are jointly assessed. Ireland and Germany operate joint taxation, respectively, with an option for individual taxation {{and the right to}} be individually taxed when this is more advantageous; conversely individual taxation is the default option in Spain and Poland, but the option of joint assessment is offered. Elements of <b>jointness</b> remain in some income tax codes for which the individual is the unit of taxation - the Belgian, Estonian, Greek, Icelandic and Norwegian codes - some of which are minor while others matter. The remaining countries enforce individual income taxation without exceptions".|$|E

In addition, the headquarters is also responsible for implementing all the Joint Training/Exercise. Other than managing current operations, JFHQ is also responsible to give input on the preparation for future capability development. In fulfilling that need, one current challenge that has to be taken into account is budgetary constraint. For that, JFHQ is focused on the concept of “fit for the purpose” or enabling a capability that fulfil the true requirement as well as a balanced capability development that also takes into account the aspect of interoperability. This is to make sure that any capability developed in the future contribute to the effective execution of the operation and the limited budget can be spent in the most optimal manner.|$|E
