This approach also increased average speed of vehicles by 24 %. The second dynamic {{ramp metering}} approach, ALINEA 2, accomplished to reduce the average delay time per vehicle by 29 %, average number of stops by 21 %, average stopped <b>delay</b> per vehicle <b>by</b> 35 %, total <b>delay</b> time <b>by</b> 30 %, number of stops by 22 %, total stopped <b>delay</b> <b>by</b> 35 %, and total travel time by 18 %.
