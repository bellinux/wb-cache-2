25|$|The {{death of}} Valentine Baker in an {{aircraft}} accident in 1942 prompted James Martin to investigate new methods for aircrew escape and survival. Martin had previous experience of aircraft survival systems and had designed a quick-release canopy system during the Battle of Britain, {{a very successful}} device that was later <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> to all Spitfires during manufacture.|$|E

25|$|The suffix W e.g.: -10W denotes a {{sub-series}} {{modified to}} use A.D.I Anti-Detonant Injection or water injection equipment, using various mixes {{of water and}} methyl alcohol (CH3OH) injected into the carburetor to increase power for short periods: several models of R-2800s were <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> with A.D.I and {{did not use the}} W suffix. Few commercial aircraft used water injection.|$|E
25|$|The 997 was an {{evolution}} of the preceding 996, with the most significant changes being interior and exterior styling. Larger 18 inch wheels were <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard,</b> and other engineering changes include slightly increased power; however, the car is technically very similar to its predecessor. A new S version was offered, with additional power from a slightly larger engine, sports suspension, and sports exhaust.|$|E
25|$|The {{rear spoiler}} also {{underwent}} a redesign to an aero wing, which phased in during 1997 as standard equipment on some models, {{such as the}} GP Version R. After its late introduction in the pre-facelift era, the now facelifted GP was given a full styling make-over with a 'Version R' tag - heralding a further external styling feature with this new large spoiler (also <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> on both Aero Series later GPvR and GX models, or as an OE option for other extant models).|$|E

25|$|The Alpine A610 was {{launched}} in 1991. It was re-styled inside and out but was still recognisable as a GTA derivative. The chassis structure was extensively reworked but the central box principal remained the same. The front was completely re-designed the interior was also greatly improved. Air-conditioning and power steering were <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard.</b> The total production run for A610s derivatives was 818 vehicles 67 RHD and 751 LHD. After production of the A610 ended, the Alpine factory in Dieppe produced the Renault Sport Spider and a new era was to begin.|$|E
25|$|The C.200 {{featured}} a typical armament {{of a pair}} of 12.7mm (.5in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns; while these were often considered to be insufficient, the Saetta was able to compete with contemporary Allied fighters. According to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, perhaps the greatest weakness of the C.200 had been its light machine gun armament. Moreover, the radio was not <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard,</b> while its flight characteristics, even if better than the G.50, were not easily mastered by the average Italian pilot, even after new wings, which provided for improved flight characteristics, had been adopted.|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{aircraft}} is the large cargo door, which is <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> on all aircraft. According to Pilatus, the PC-24 is the first business jet to be fitted with this standard pallet-sized cargo door. The cargo door provides {{direct access to the}} heated and fully pressurized luggage compartment. This feature is useful for air medical services, utility and special mission operators. The door and baggage compartment are both capable of accepting a standard pallet; the compartment itself is deliberately located close to the aircraft's center of gravity to minimize the impact of heavy cargo. The trailing edge of the wing is reinforced against instances of incidental damage during loading/unloading. The design was optimized for special missions and by government customers.|$|E
40|$|B {{chromosomes}} {{are often}} considered genomic parasites. Paternal sex ratio (PSR) {{is an extreme}} example of a parasitic B chromosome in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. PSR is transmitted through the sperm of carrier males and destroys the other paternal chromosomes in early fertilized eggs. PSR disrupts the normal haplodiploid sex determination in this wasp by converting diploid (female) eggs into haploid (male) eggs that bear PSR. In this study I compare a number of phenotypic fitness aspects of PSR and standard (non-PSR) males. In general, PSR males were <b>as</b> <b>fit</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> males. No {{significant differences were found}} in longevity (with one exception), ability to compete for mates and sperm depletion rates. PSR males produced 11 - 22 % larger family sizes and developed slightly faster than standard males. Under conditions of sperm competition, females who mated with both types of males fertilized a constant proportion of eggs with each sperm type over their lifetime. PSR males produced fewer offspring among progenies from double-inseminated females. Phenotypic fitness effects are believed to play a minor role in determining PSR frequencies in natural populations. ...|$|R
50|$|Earlier TriStar 500s were {{delivered}} {{with the standard}} wing; these were later retrofitted with ailerons and extended wingtips. Pan Am was the first customer to order the -500 with the extended wingtips and active ailerons.

50|$|The 2009 X-City 125/250 {{received}} an height adjustable windshield (four positions) and it now includes the rear carrier base. Both are welcome additions, especially the adjustable windshield {{is very good}} for taller drivers above 6.06 ft or 1,85 m, and the rear carrier base was also a very good addition, since most X-City scooters {{make use of the}} rear carrier in order to have enough space to store two full size helmets. The carrier base costs €140. The rear carrier, which still has to be bought separately (not in the Netherlands, where it is <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> a <b>standard</b> accessory) costs another €140. Yamaha offers several accessories, including leg shields (€133) that protect against rain and wind at higher speed, as well as a taller windshield (€127) that includes protection for the hands.|$|R
25|$|For 2000 the R was {{available}} in 6 colours: Black Stone, Nautic Blue Pearl, Silver Metallic, Venetian Red Pearl, Dark Olive Green, Laser Blue. All apart from the first one were metallic paints with Laser Blue being only available on the R. A new 2.4L engine was introduced and power increased to 265PS by use of a larger turbo and VVT. The only available transmission was a newly introduced 5-speed adaptive automatic, rear brakes were upgraded to vented discs unique to the R. A dual outlet exhaust was <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> with the rear bumper being modified to accommodate it. The interior could now be ordered in a two tone design which paired white alcantara and black leather for the seat covers.|$|E
500|$|The {{first six}} {{locomotives}} were initially fitted with plywood sheeting over the cab-side windows as a wartime material-saving measure, with No. 21C107 Wadebridge {{the first to}} receive glass windows. [...] Two of the front route indicator irons (of which there are five) were originally located on the smoke deflectors, which meant that the indicator discs stood proud of the casing. This necessitated a trial relocation to the smokebox door at the three and nine o'clock positions on No. 21C109 Lyme Regis, and <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> from No. 21C118 Axminster onwards. The batch constructed between June and October 1946 received a modified steam regulator [...] and LMS-style parallel buffer casings.|$|E

50|$|The P99 RAD grip {{shape and}} texture has been altered when {{compared}} to the P99 variants and an extended ambidextrous slide release and extended ambidextrous magazine release levers are <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> a <b>standard</b> feature. Besides that the slide shape, dimensions and serrations have been altered. The standard sights are high-contrast 3 dot sights with contrast enhancements that have been painted with afterglow paint that can aid target acquisition under unfavourable lighting conditions. As an option the P99 RAD can also be fitted with self-luminous tritium night sights. The P99 RAD pistol is available with the DAO trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately 39 N and the QA trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately 32 N. The grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching tactical lights and laser sighting devices.|$|R
25|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, the Dunlop Maxaret {{anti-skid}} system was in widespread aviation {{use in the}} UK, with aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor, Vickers Viscount, Vickers Valiant, English Electric Lightning, de Havilland Comet 2c, de Havilland Sea Vixen, and later aircraft, such as the Vickers VC10, Hawker Siddeley Trident, Hawker Siddeley 125, Hawker Siddeley HS 748 and derived British Aerospace ATP, and BAC One-Eleven being <b>fitted</b> with Maxaret <b>as</b> <b>standard.</b> Maxaret, while reducing braking distances by up to 30% in icy or wet conditions, also increased tire life, and had the additional advantage of allowing take-offs and landings in conditions that would preclude flying at all in non-Maxaret equipped aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Background: Colorectal cancer {{screening}} {{is key to}} early detection and thus to early treatment, but uptake is often sub-optimal, particularly amongst lower income groups. It is proposed that the imminent introduction of the single-sample Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) in Scotland may lead to increased uptake {{as compared to the}} current Faecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT), but underlying reasons are yet to be determined. The aim was to evaluate attitudes and intentions towards completing the FIT compared to the current FOBT for colorectal {{cancer screening}}. Methods: A convenience sample of 200 adults (mean age 56. 5, range 40 - 89; 59 % female) living in Scotland rated both the FOBT and the FIT with regard to ease of completion, perceived disgust and intention to complete and return (all measured on Likert-type 1 - 7 scale). Participants were randomised to be presented (via a face-to-face contact) with either the FIT or FOBT first. Results: Participants reported higher intention to complete and return the FIT versus the FOBT (mean difference 0. 62, 95 % CI (0. 44, 0. 79)). Overall, 85. 0 % (n = 170) of participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would intend to complete and return the FIT compared to 65. 5 % (n = 131) for the FOBT (χ 2 = 20. 4, p <. 001). The FIT was also perceived to be easier to complete (mean difference 0. 85, 95 % CI (0. 70, 1. 01) and much less disgusting (mean difference 1. 11, 95 % CI (0. 94, 1. 27)). Lower perceived disgust, higher socio-economic status and previous participation in any cancer screening were significant predictors of intention to complete the FOBT, whilst only higher perceived ease of completion predicted intention to complete the FIT. Conclusions: People reported higher intentions to complete and return a FIT than a FOBT test for colorectal cancer screening, largely due to a perception that it is easier and less disgusting to complete. The findings suggest that the introduction of the <b>FIT</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> in the UK could result in a notable increase in screening uptake...|$|R

2500|$|A design {{improvement}} that came about {{was with the}} propellers. Akron, as originally built, was fitted with [...] two-bladed, fixed-pitch wooden propellers to each of her engines but, in June 1932, was modified to be fitted with new, three-bladed, variable pitch metal propellers. These new propellers were <b>fitted</b> to Macon <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> while she was under construction, increasing the ship's fuel efficiency. This, combined with {{design improvement}}s that removed a number of hull protrusions (improving her aerodynamics) and a reduction of her overall dead weight {{by as much as}} , led to her achieving a speed of [...] during speed trials in August 1933, more than 3 knots faster than the maximum speed requirement specified by the Navy, and 6 knots faster than Akrons best recorded speed of 69 knots.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, after a {{production}} run of 14,000, the Mechanical Horse was superseded by the Scammell Scarab. The Scarab retained all the familiar, useful features of its predecessor, with many innovations. The chassis frame was cranked downwards {{to give a}} lower centre of gravity. The engine, gear box and rear axle were built as one unit, which aided major maintenance. The whole power unit was fitted low down in the chassis behind the cab. The engine radiator was fitted in {{the back wall of}} the cab, drawing cooling air from a duct behind the right-hand cab door. The larger side-valve petrol engine of 2090cc was used for both the 3 and 6-ton models. Scammell introduced diesel engines to the range, using the Perkins 4-199 for 3-ton and 4-203 for 6-ton models. The rounded all steel cab, <b>fitted</b> with doors <b>as</b> <b>standard,</b> was slightly more comfortable for drivers. The Scarab remained in production until 1967.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{designed}} as a fighter-interceptor aircraft, the Spitfire proved its versatility in other roles. As a fighter, the F Mk 24 armament consisted of 4 × short-barrelled Mk.5 20mm Hispano cannon – operational experience had proved that the hitting power of these larger weapons was necessary to overcome the thicker armour encountered on enemy aircraft as the war progressed. The aircraft was also used as a fighter-bomber, carrying 1 × [...] and 2 × [...] bombs, with rocket-projectile launch rails <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard.</b> Late production aircraft were built with the lighter, short-barrelled, electrically fired Mark V Hispano cannon.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1988, the Camry was marketed in Australasia with a four-cylinder engine only.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Mobile Radiofrequency Phone Exposed Users' Study (MoRPhEUS), a {{cross-sectional}} {{epidemiological study}} examined cognitive function in secondary school students. We recruited 317, 7 th grade students (144 boys, 173 girls, median age 13 years) from 20 schools around Melbourne, Australia. Participants completed an exposure questionnaire based on the Interphone study, a computerised cognitive test battery, and the Stroop colour-word test. The principal exposure metric was {{the total number of}} reported mobile phone voice calls per week. Linear regression models were fitted to cognitive test response times and accuracies. Age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status and handedness were <b>fitted</b> <b>as</b> covariates and <b>standard</b> errors were adjusted for clustering by school. The accuracy of working memory was poorer, reaction time for a simple learning task shorter, associative learning response time shorter and accuracy poorer in children reporting more mobile phone voice calls. There were no significant relationships between exposure and signal detection, movement monitoring or estimation. The completion time for Stroop word naming tasks was longer for those reporting more mobile phone voice calls. The findings were similar for total short message service (SMS, also known as text) messages per week, suggesting these cognitive changes were unlikely due to radiofrequency (RF) exposure. Overall, mobile phone use was associated with faster and less accurate responding to higher level cognitive tasks. These behaviours may have been learned through frequent use of a mobile phone...|$|R
