5|$|From 1964–2010, {{and again}} since 2012, the Flag of Malawi {{is made up}} of three equal {{horizontal}} stripes of black, red and green with a red rising sun superimposed {{in the center of the}} black stripe. The black stripe represented the African people, the red represented the blood of martyrs for African freedom, green represented Malawi's ever-green nature and the rising sun represented the dawn of freedom and hope for Africa. In 2010, the flag was changed, removing the red rising sun and adding a <b>full</b> <b>white</b> sun in the center as a symbol of Malawi's economic progress. The change was reverted in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Nan Chiau High School's uniform {{is closely}} linked to its {{heritage}} as a former traditional Chinese school. Originally, the school uniform was in <b>full</b> <b>white</b> with the Chinese name of the school sewed on the right chest level of the blouse, much similar to other institutions with Chinese heritage. Students in the senior high and pre-university section wore white shirts with dark coloured skirts, before the pre-university classes were made mandatory to be taught at junior colleges, a policy declared by the ministry of education in 1979. Nearing the 1990s, the school uniform was switched to be worn with dark coloured school pants or skirt, with dark coloured school tag was sewed {{on the left side}} of the shirt. The uniform was redesigned as an effort to preserve the school's identity along with the relocation of the campus in 2000, which integrated the original heritage of the uniform in the 1960s and the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of {{women into the}} Corps doubled the number of uniforms, as women had an equivalent for every male uniform. After the war, female uniforms became close to their male equivalents as women were more closely integrated into the Corps, and the green service uniform was worn year-round as the khaki summer version was discontinued. In the late 1980s, the <b>full</b> <b>white</b> dress uniform coat was discontinued, though the white dress trousers remain in use for ceremonial units today.|$|E

25|$|Two {{designs were}} submitted. Mr <b>Fuller</b> <b>White</b> {{proposed}} a timber structure and Robert Taylor a thirteen-arch Portland stone bridge.

Taylor therefore modified the design so that only the river arches were of Portland stone, the rest in brick.|$|R
25|$|These train {{cars are}} fitted with green-blue tinted Glastroch (Germany) windows glass, and are almost {{identical}} to the first generation train cars before its refurbishment, except that its traction produces a louder, lower-pitched noise when accelerating/braking. The run number display {{on the front of}} each train is made up of electronic green flip-dot display, as opposed to the manual plastic rollers of the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, while the rubber strips between the doors are thicker. The trains have a <b>full</b> <b>white</b> body and a thick red stripe in the middle. Similar to the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, the Siemens C651 trains have no visual passenger information systems, but have a built-in audio announcement system until the STARIS was installed and activated around 2010.|$|E
25|$|When Aelony {{arrived at}} the University of Minnesota, he met some of the few {{students}} of color and discovered {{that only a small}} number were from the local communities, since most local blacks chose to attend black colleges and universities in the South. He also found that other minority students were having trouble obtaining local housing and employment in Minneapolis. Aelony worked with a group of students to help find housing for Persian students. This population had difficulty securing housing because it was rumored that they rubbed their skin with olive oil, which ruined the bedding. If the minority students were told an apartment complex was <b>full,</b> <b>white</b> students would go ask for a room there to test the fairness of the renters. The students would then talk to the renters, who were often embarrassed and would agree to rent to the minority students.|$|E
500|$|At first, Gautier {{thought that}} some of the dancers in the waltz for the Wilis should dress in ethnic costume and dance ethnic steps.

2500|$|Saint Nicholas is {{a popular}} subject portrayed on countless Eastern Orthodox icons, {{particularly}} Russian ones. He is depicted as an Orthodox bishop, wearing the omophorion and holding a Gospel Book. Sometimes he is depicted wearing the Eastern Orthodox mitre, sometimes he is bareheaded. Iconographically, Nicholas is depicted as an elderly man with a short, <b>full,</b> <b>white,</b> fluffy beard and balding head. In commemoration of the miracle attributed to him by tradition at the Council of Nicea, he is sometimes depicted with Christ over his left shoulder holding out a Gospel Book to him and the Theotokos over his right shoulder holding the omophorion. Because of his patronage of mariners, occasionally Saint Nicholas will be shown standing in a boat or rescuing drowning sailors; Medieval Chants and Polyphony, image {{on the cover of}} the Book of Hours of Duke of Berry, 1410 ...|$|E

2500|$|EL-WLED: The LCD {{panel is}} {{lit by a}} row of white LEDs placed at one or more edges of the screen. A light {{diffuser}} is then used to spread the light evenly across the whole display. As of 2012, this design {{is the most popular}} one in desktop computer monitors. It allows for the thinnest displays. Some LCD monitors using this technology have a feature called dynamic contrast, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan [...] Using PWM (pulse-width modulation, a technology where the intensity of the LEDs are kept constant, but the brightness adjustment is achieved by varying a time interval of flashing these constant light intensity light sources), the backlight is dimmed to the brightest color that appears on the screen while simultaneously boosting the LCD contrast to the maximum achievable levels, allowing the 1000:1 contrast ratio of the LCD panel to be scaled to different light intensities, resulting in the [...] "30000:1" [...] contrast ratios seen in the advertising on some of these monitors. Since computer screen images usually have <b>full</b> <b>white</b> somewhere in the image, the backlight will usually be at full intensity, making this [...] "feature" [...] mostly a marketing gimmick for computer monitors, however for TV screens it drastically increases the perceived contrast ratio and dynamic range, improves the viewing angle dependency and drastically reducing the power consumption of conventional LCD televisions.|$|E
