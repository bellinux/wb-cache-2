In 1980 he stated that [...] "I don't think I could sit down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. [...] I wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to begin, but I can still sing it." [...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, and they just give me a sense of awe.

500|$|Sasha {{became aware}} of {{electronic}} dance music in 1988 at The Haçienda, a Manchester dance venue. [...] Drawn to the rough sound of acid house music and the rebellious attitude he associated with it, he visited Manchester weekly and soon moved to nearby Disley. [...] Sasha purchased many jazz records and began to teach himself how to mix. A local DJ at a club Sasha frequented {{announced that he was}} looking for other DJs to travel with him on a regional tour. Sasha volunteered and made his first live appearance in nearby Stockport. Sasha recalled of his debut, [...] "I'd never even touched a Technics: I thought the pitch control was the volume, I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to plug my headphones in! I'm sure I was absolutely horrendous." ...|$|E

This was something I was excited to do." [...] This is {{in stark contrast to}} the recording of The High End of Low (2009) and Born Villain, when he was frequently [...] "dragged into the studio" [...] late at night to record vocals. He credited this enthusiasm to the collaborative process between him and Bates, saying that he realized after the first performance of [...] "Birds of Hell Awaiting" [...] that [...] " [...] just sang it. I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the music was going to go and I just went with it and it was very organic. And then it opened up a whole different part of my mind." ...|$|E

500|$|The season's finale Death And All His Friends {{was highly}} praised. Marsi gave the episode five stars, and {{expressed}} {{that it may}} have been the best episode of the series, adding: [...] "The writing and acting were absolutely stellar, and may lead to many Emmy nominations, but even more impressively, despite a killing spree, it remained distinctly Grey's. Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to begin now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding: [...] " [...] two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's Anatomy, and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours. It was emotional, expertly paced and had me in tears for most of the finale." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "At any rate, now you can at least see where it all began. And while you’re still pondering how Grey's can still be so damn good sometimes," ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fix a Heart" [...] is a pop piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I just ran out of bandaids / I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to start / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never really can fix a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really can fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a little piece of it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things that make you happy".|$|E

Those negotiations took place {{in the center of the}} city without Russian government assistance and while under Russian artillery bombardment; some of the prisoners were released on the promise they would never fight the Chechens again.|$|E
2500|$|During his youth, {{his mother}} would work several jobs {{in order to support}} the family, often taking odd jobs as a nurse and caterer. She would also attend night school to learn English. His father later {{abandoned}} the family, prompting his maternal grandmother to take care of Abel. This allowed him to become fluent in Amharic in his early years, with this Semitic language acting as his first language. His grandmother would also take him to services at an Ethiopian Orthodox church. About his father, The Weeknd stated [...] "I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he lived — I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole.

2500|$|When Blackwell {{arrived at}} the college, she was rather nervous. Nothing was familiar– the surroundings, the {{students}} and the faculty. She did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to get her books. However, she soon found herself at home in medical school. [...] While she was at school, she was looked upon as an oddity by the townspeople of Geneva. She also rejected suitors and friends alike, preferring to isolate herself. In the summer between her two terms at Geneva, she returned to Philadelphia, stayed with Dr. Elder, and applied for medical positions in the area to gain clinical experience. The Guardians of the Poor, the city commission that ran Blockley Almshouse, granted her permission to work there, albeit not without some struggle. Blackwell slowly gained acceptance at Blockley, although some young resident physicians still would walk out and refuse to assist her in diagnosing and treating her patients. During her time there, Blackwell gained valuable clinical experience, but was appalled by the syphilitic ward and those afflicted with typhus. Her graduating thesis at Geneva Medical College ended up being on the topic of typhus. The conclusion of this thesis linked physical health with socio-moral stability– a link that foreshadows her later reform work.|$|E
50|$|From {{a feminist}} perspective, the most {{important}} point to be drawn is that early human society was almost certainly organised along matrilineal lines with people tracing their kin ties through their mothers.

5000|$|... "We Must Have Been Out of Our Minds" [...] was Montogmery's first {{national}} hit, {{and the most}} successful recording from the Jones-Montgomery duet pairing. The song reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in July 1963, and spent 23 weeks in the chart's top 40, one of the longer runs of any country single released during the 1960s. Montgomery later remembered: [...] "I was nervous as a cat! Not only was it my first major session, but it was with George Jones! George had been out roarin' the night before, and nobody <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> he was until {{an hour before the}} session.

Later, Beckman informs the team that the grave robber is Cole Barker, a Fulcrum agent. Chuck suddenly flashes to learn that Cole's belt buckle belonged to White and contains government intelligence.

2500|$|As {{with their}} batting Australia could muster {{a strong and}} varied bowling attack; Garth McKenzie (29.78), Dennis Lillee (23.92), Alan Connolly (29.22), Ashley Mallett (29.84), John Gleeson (36.20) and Terry Jenner (31.20) with all-rounders Doug Walters (29.08), Kerry O'Keeffe (38.20) and Greg Chappell (40.70). Unfortunately, they were seldom {{given the chance to}} settle into the team and only Gleeson of the regular bowlers played in five Tests. Garth McKenzie had been Australia's premier fast bowler in the 1960s, but had failed spectacularly in South Africa (averaging 333.00), was struck in the face by a John Snow bouncer at Sydney and retired from Test cricket to play for Ray Illingworth's Leicestershire as a professional. Alan Connolly had been a fast bowler in his youth, but slowed his pace to {{increase}} his accuracy and became a reliable support bowler. Alan Thomson - [...] "Froggie" [...] Thomson - was a fast-medium paceman with a [...] "strange, whirlwind, running-through sort of action" [...] in which he loosed the ball while both feet were in the air. He was a non-smoking, non-drinking, physical education teacher whose shaggy red hair make him look like a 'Wild Man of Borneo'. He frequently bounced the England batsmen, took 6/80 against the MCC for Victoria and was called up for the First Test. 'He can't last' predicted Richard Whitington, 'He doesn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he's aiming', and he averaged 54.50 in the Tests. John Gleeson was a mystery bowler who used his bent middle finger to turn the ball either way, but lost control in search of variation and was punished by the England batsmen once they figured out his action. The more orthodox off-spinner Ashley Mallett could turn the ball very sharply and took 28 wickets (19.10) in India in 1969-70. Tom Graveney thought he was the finest Australian off-spinner since the war and he became the spinning arm of Ian Chappell's all-conquering Australians. Historically Australian selectors always preferred a leg-spinner and Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner vied for the place, but they never quite fulfilled their promise. Doug Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced [...] "Golden Arm" [...] was capable of breaking any partnership and he deserved to be regarded an all-rounder. Greg Chappell was also seen as an all-rounder in his youth, and continued to bowl throughout his Test career, but mainly to tie up one end while the other bowlers rested. The greatest Australian bowler of the next decade would be Dennis Lillee, but in 1970 he was a raw, undisciplined fast bowler who had yet to reach his full potential.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2012, Brownlee made {{controversial}} {{comments about}} Finland, after he suggested during a parliamentary session that Finns are uneducated, unemployed murderers who don't respect women. With his comments Brownlee rejected New Zealand Labour Party's plans {{to model the}} economy on Finland, and added that Finland [...] "has worse unemployment than us, has less growth than us, can hardly feed {{the people who live}} there, has a terrible homicide rate, hardly educates its people, and has no respect for women." [...] Brownlee's comments were debated in Finnish media with Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja stating that Finland would not take any action as the comments were clearly a device for internal politics rather than an attack on Finland.

50|$|From 1419 to 1705, Dirmstein {{belonged to}} two lords together; {{these were the}} Prince-Bishop of Worms and the Elector Palatine.

Bishop Johann II of Fleckenstein and Elector Ludwig III shared all rights at and in Dirmstein, each getting half. It {{must have been in}} this time that the Kurpfälzisches Schloss (“Electoral Palatinate Castle”) was built, which might well have been envisaged rather more as an administrative building.

Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{autobiography}} I Lived To Tell It All, Jones remained quite {{proud of the}} work he did with Montgomery: [...] "I had giant records years later with Tammy Wynette, {{and there were many}} other successful duet partners, such as Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton and Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn. I'm not saying Melba and I were the first to sing male-female duets in country music because we weren't. And I'm not saying we were the best.

50|$|Details of {{his early}} life are unavailable; it is not <b>even</b> <b>known</b> <b>where</b> he was born. The first record of Donato is as a singer at St. Mark's in Venice in 1550, and he was given charge of the musical {{training}} of the boys there in 1562. When Gioseffo Zarlino took over the post of maestro di cappella from Cipriano de Rore in 1565, Donato was demoted {{back to being a}} singer; conflict between the two men {{seems to have been a}} feature of life at St. Mark's, culminating in a climactic fight in 1569, publicly and scandalously, during the Feast of St. Mark. In 1577 Donato took a position at the Scuola Grande di S Rocco, another Venetian church with an impressive musical tradition and substantial performing ensemble; however he failed to get along with his employers there as well, resigning by 1580. In 1588 he became assistant maestro di cappella at St. Mark's, while Zarlino was still alive (whether because of reconcilement or politics is not clear), and in 1590 he took over the post of his former antagonist, holding it until his death in 1603.|$|R
