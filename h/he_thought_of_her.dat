60|$|He {{thought of}} his poor child, Little Dorrit, {{for a long time}} there; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> going home; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> in the night; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> when the day came round again. And the poor child Little Dorrit thought of him--too faithfully, ah, too faithfully!--in the shadow of the Marshalsea wall.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{with the}} hair blown about her flushed cheeks as they stood {{together}} after their race....|$|E
60|$|That {{she was a}} shepherdess pleased Hare, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as free on {{the open}} range, with the wind blowing her hair.|$|E
50|$|It would seem, {{from this}} version of the tale, that Gunnlöð helped Odin willingly, and that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> well <b>of</b> <b>her</b> in return.|$|R
60|$|Maggie's cheeks {{began to}} flush with triumphant excitement. She thought Mr. Riley {{would have a}} respect for her now; it had been evident that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> nothing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardman, you say you--you married my--this girl?" [...] rasped out Pan, choking {{over his}} words {{as if they}} were poison, unable to speak of Lucy as <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> all his life.|$|R
60|$|Thereafter <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as {{freed from}} persecution, {{although}} {{he knew that}} others of the valley held her in view as legitimate quarry.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Thomasin eagerly. [...] "It {{was before}} he knew me that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and it {{was nothing but a}} mere flirtation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{said she}} was a lady in mind and manners, and of {{excellent}} principles, but he declared he would not tell us all <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> lest we should be disappointed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, my dear, {{you know}} I told you {{last week that}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{bringing}} <b>her</b> here while he went South on business. You know, being a widower, he has no one to leave her with." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Only his {{terror of}} the hours of night grew on him, obsessed him like a mania. He slept fitfully, with {{constant}} wakings of anguish. The fear wore away the core of him.|$|R
60|$|The more he saw <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and {{the more}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> the more unapproachable did she seem to him. But since he had no {{intention}} <b>of</b> approaching <b>her,</b> this was anything but an unsatisfactory fact. He was glad he had her in his office, and hoped she'd stay, and that was about all.|$|R
60|$|At first, to Durgan's {{infinite}} distress, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> all day, and then, {{as the old}} familiar interests grappled him again, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> in {{the morning}} and the evening and as he walked between his home and the laboratory and at all sorts of incidental times--and even when the close-locked riddles of his research held the foreground and focus of his thoughts, he still seemed to be thinking of her as a radiant background to ions and molecules and atoms and interwoven systems of eddies and quivering oscillations deep down in the very heart of matter.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> words an hour later, when on {{his return}} to the hotel they handed him a telegram. He passed it on at once to Lord Redford, and glanced at his watch.|$|E
60|$|All Mr. Brumley's philosophizing had {{vanished}} {{at the sight}} of her. His spirit was reborn within him. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and of his effect upon her, vividly, and of nothing else in the world.|$|E
50|$|In 1860 the White {{family lived}} {{on a farm in}} Welches Creek township, Columbus County. Because George White was so young when Mary Anna joined the family, <b>he</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as his mother. She and his father had more {{children}} together, his half-siblings.|$|R
60|$|Sam started. Somehow {{this girl}} {{had always been}} so {{individual}} to him that <b>he</b> had never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> having a father.|$|R
6000|$|Lawrence {{began to}} [...] "go with" [...] Bessy Houghton {{regularly}} after that. In his single-mindedness he never feared that Bessy would misjudge his motives or imagine {{him to be}} prompted by mercenary designs. <b>He</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> riches himself, and {{it never occurred to}} him that she would suppose he did.|$|R
60|$|Of {{all that}} was painful in that experience, nothing now remains. John thinks of her only as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> in the fair {{illusion}} of first love,--the dearest and most sacred of all illusions.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{as he sat}} at {{the table}} with George and his aged mother. They lived alone, and their lives were curiously silent. Once in a while a low-voiced question, and that was all.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and {{wondered}} what had happened. As he walked swiftly across the narrow footbridge, and reached {{the other side of}} the river, the events of the past few hours rushed upon his memory with terrible, overwhelming force.|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, Walthew {{was sitting}} with Blanca Sarmiento. He was quiet, for he still felt languid and the patio was hot; but he was {{conscious}} of his companion's charm. Indeed, <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> often since <b>he</b> left Rio Frio, and {{she had had a}} place in the fantastic dreams the fever brought him.|$|R
60|$|Tessa took up her {{bowl and}} lantern, {{and closed the}} door behind her. The pretty loving {{apparition}} had been no more to Baldassarre than a faint rainbow on the blackness to the man who is wrestling in deep waters. <b>He</b> hardly <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> again till his dreamy waking passed into the more vivid images of disturbed sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you learn}} to be ill-natured, Glossop. And {{remember}} {{that there is no}} form so bad as that of calling young ladies by their Christian names. I do know that poor Morton has left Miss Trefoil a sum of money which is at any rate evidence that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> well <b>of</b> <b>her</b> to the last." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> as she {{had been}} that night when he and his bride came home. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{as she had}} been, in all the home-events of the {{abandoned}} house. He thought, now, that of all around him, she alone had never changed. His boy had faded into dust, his proud wife had sunk into a polluted creature, his flatterer and friend had been transformed into the worst of villains, his riches had melted away, the very walls that sheltered him looked on him as a stranger; she alone had turned the same mild gentle look upon him always. Yes, to the latest and the last. She had never changed to him--nor had he ever changed to her--and she was lost.|$|E
6000|$|But when Sir Tristram {{stood with}} them in the chapel, he gave them hardly any greeting, but said at once: [...] "Messires, how doth it fare with the Lady Belle Isoult?" [...] For <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> the first of all and above all things else.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and himself, and {{no longer}} in that vein of {{incidental}} adventure {{in which he had}} begun. He thought, too, of the fretful invalid who lay in the next room to his, whose money had created his business and made his position in the world.|$|E
60|$|And {{that was}} how he tried to dismiss <b>her.</b> <b>He</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> personally. Everything deep in him he denied. Paul hated his father for sitting sentimentalising over her. He knew he would do it in the public-houses. For the real tragedy went on in Morel in spite of himself. Sometimes, later, he came down from his {{afternoon}} sleep, white and cowering.|$|R
60|$|Excited as Bray was, he {{recognized}} with a hysterical sensation the track made by Eugenia in her fall, which {{he himself had}} noticed. But <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> only <b>of</b> <b>HER.</b>|$|R
60|$|Aggie was {{the name}} of the old nurse; <b>he</b> had not <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> till now; but that he should think <b>of</b> <b>her</b> at all was a trait that {{surprised}} me in the man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Magnificent!" [...] Bradley replied; but <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> not the stars. The team started up, and {{the worn}} old seat swayed {{from side to}} side so perilously that Bradley with {{incredible}} audacity put his arm around, and grasped the end of the seat {{on the other side of}} Ida.|$|E
60|$|Now Gizur loved Swanhild much, for she {{had thrown}} her glamour on him as once she did on Atli, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> day and night. For there was this strange thing about Swanhild that, though she was a witch and wicked, being both fair and gentle she could lead all men, except Eric, to love her.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{this was}} not exactly as it should be; yet let us hope the angels look tenderly down on the sins of too much love. John {{felt as if he}} would be glad of a chance to die for her; and, when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> in his prayers, it was because he loved her better than himself.|$|E
60|$|His frankness was startling, but {{the girl}} showed neither astonishment nor resentment. She felt certain that this {{stranger}} was not posing or speaking for effect. It did not occur to Wyllard {{that he might have}} gone too far, and {{for a moment or two}} he leaned against the gate, while she looked at him with what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as <b>her</b> gracious English calm.|$|R
5|$|Whoever had joy or gladness, Troilus {{suffered}} affliction and grief. That was for {{the daughter}} of Calchas, for he loved her deeply. He had set his whole heart on her; so mightily was he possessed by his love that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> only <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> She had given herself to him, both her body and her love. Most men knew of that.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I couldn't. I couldn't say {{but what}} you had been good and faithfull all through, {{and you had a}} perfect right to do it. There ain't any one to blame. He's behaved like a gentleman, and I can see now that <b>he</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and that it was you all the while. Well, marry him, then! He's got the right, and so have you." ...|$|R
