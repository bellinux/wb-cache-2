40|$|Research to {{correlate}} bearing {{remaining useful life}} (RUL) predictions with Helicopter Health Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) condition indicators (CI) to indicate the damage state of a transmission component has been developed.

50|$|A limited {{production}} {{version of}} the WR450F was the WR450F 2-Trac, which featured 2-wheel drive. The <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> sprocket drove a short, fully enclosed chain to a pump, which in turn pushed the oil to the front hub via the pipe and back via the parallel pipe. A maximum of 15% of the power was transmitted to the front wheel at any time.

50|$|The {{power train}} from the four-speed gearbox {{to the two}} rear wheels was also unusual: fixed to the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> drive was {{something}} called a Hardy disc, which was a cardan joint made of rubber. On {{the other side of}} it was a cardan shaft, and finally a second Hardy disc, which in turn was located at the entrance to a chain case. A duplex chain running in an oil bath led finally to a rigid shaft, at each end of which were the two rear wheels. Thanks to this elaborate power transfer, the engine-gearbox unit was both free of tension and well soundproofed in its linkage to the rear axle.|$|R
50|$|The system {{features}} an oil pressure operated device {{attached to the}} back of the standard gearbox operating on the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft. Through a system of oil pressure, solenoids and pistons, the overdrive would drop the revs on whatever gears it was used on by 22% (.778). For instance, the overdrive system applied to a Triumph TR5 operates on 2nd, 3rd and top gear. When engaged, the overdrive would drop the revs from 3000 by 666 RPM, or from 3500 the drop would be 777 RPM to 2723 net. The advantages this reduced rpm had on fuel consumption was most often quite near 22% decrease during highway driving.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the early}} {{development}} {{of cars and}} the almost universal rear-wheel drive layout, the final drive (i.e. rear axle) ratio for fast cars was chosen to give the ratio for maximum speed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic design methodology for split hybrid vehicles using a single planetary gearset (PG) as the transmission. The design methodology {{consists of four}} steps: 1) analyze clutch locations on the PG and operation modes, 2) generate dynamic models, 3) evaluate drivability (acceleration performance) via forward simulations, and 4) optimize the fuel economy using the dynamic programming technique. The 1 -PG split hybrid transmission can have 12 configurations, and each configuration can have four operation modes when three clutches are added. This methodology systematically evaluates all configuration candidates and identifies the optimal design, and we demonstrate how it helps to identify a simplified design based in the output-split configuration used by the Chevy Volt. The simplified design, named the Volt-, has {{only two of the}} four operation modes of the original Volt. The Volt- achieves the same fuel economy as the original Volt in the FUDS cycle, and has only slightly reduced drivability and fuel economy in the HWFET cycle. In addition, an improved design based on the input-split configuration used by the Toyota Prius is also identified, named the Prius+, which has one additional mode than the original Prius. The Prius+ outperforms the Prius in both drivability and fuel economy.

50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive.

5000|$|Lancia's {{permanent}} four-wheel-drive {{system was}} based on three differentials.An epicyclic gear train served as centre differential, splitting the torque between {{the front and rear}} axle according to a fixed predetermined ratio—56% front&#x2009;/&#x2009;44% rear on the Prisma 4WD. The ring gear of the epicyclic differential meshed with the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft, its sun gear transmitted torque the front open differential, and its planet carrier, through a pair of bevel gears and a three-piece drive shaft, to the rear differential. A Ferguson coupling controlled the centre differential, preventing excessive relative slippage of the two axles. The epicyclic differential, the Ferguson coupling and the front differential were mounted coaxially in a single transverse unit just behind the engine.In place of the complex Torsen rear differential of the Delta HF 4WD, the Prisma 4WD had a simpler [...] "open" [...] type one, with differential lock—useful at low speeds in low grip conditions—controlled by the driver via a switch on the dashboard.

However, most of these works are performed in laboratory environments and there are hardly any published works on in-service application.

A number of helicopters have been found with grease leak and radial play in the tail rotor <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft during field maintenance. Subsequent tear-down inspections of the tail rotor gearboxes revealed that they had similar defects of bearing race spalling and widespread pitting of the rolling elements. Spectral analysis was carried out on the accelerometer data from these helicopters and correlated with the tear-down inspection findings. The fault patterns exhibited correspond well to progressing stages of bearing wear and are consistent across defective gearboxes from different helicopters. It is demonstrated that simple spectral analysis can be effective in tracking progressive stages of bearing damage using both low-frequency and high-frequency bandwidths.

5000|$|Yamaha {{launched}} the YZF-R1 after redesigning the Genesis engine {{to create a}} more compact engine by raising the gearbox input shaft and allowing the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> shaft to be placed beneath it. This design feature was revolutionary, called a 'stacked gearbox', it has set a precedent for other manufacturers to follow. This [...] "compacting" [...] of the engine made the total engine length much shorter overall, thereby, allowing the wheelbase of the motorcycle to be shortened significantly. This, in turn, allowed the frame design to place the weight of the engine in the frame to aid handling because of an optimized center of gravity. The swingarm was able to be made longer without compromising the overall wheelbase, which was a short 1385mm. Four Kehin CV carburetors of 40mm diameter fed fuel to the engine, 140 bhp was claimed by the factory, at the countershaft. USD 41mm front forks supplied by KYB mounted 300mm semi-floating disk brakes. The instrument panel was electrical with, self diagnosis system inbuilt, and digital speed readout. The exhaust system utilised an EXUP valve, which controlled the exhaust gas flow, to maximise engine power production at all revs, creating a high powered but also torquey engine. The twin headlights were powerful. The Yamaha YZF-R6 was introduced in 1999 as the 600 cc version of the R1 super bike.|$|R
