5|$|Some species <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> {{numerous}} {{that they}} conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations {{have risen to}} 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by sea lions. Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing Pacific Northwest salmon populations. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted {{to ward off the}} sea lions using bombs, rubber bullets and bean bags. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective. Critics like the Humane Society object to the killing of the sea lions, claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon. Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually {{have a negative effect on}} the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.|$|E

25|$|Complex {{manufacturing}} and construction techniques and organizations {{are needed to}} make and maintain these new technologies, and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and educationâ€“ their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> complex that entire fields have been created to support them, including engineering, medicine, and computer science, and other fields have been made more complex, such as construction, transportation and architecture.|$|E

During these shows, well groomed pets strut down the runway wearing high fashion clothes. Some well known designers such as Alexander Wang have designed outfits for the dogs.|$|E
25|$|The primary aim {{of modern}} warfare (in {{accordance}} {{with the principles of}} doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.

At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so,</b> even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.|$|E

25|$|Los Angeles is rich {{in native}} plant species partly because of its {{diversity}} of habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub, chaparral shrubland, and riparian woodland. Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Ceanothus, Chamise, Coast Live Oak, sycamore, willow and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> rare as to be considered endangered. Though it is not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (Erythrina caffra) and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia reginae).|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the attributive use of the noun Jew, in phrases such as Jew lawyer or Jew ethics, is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of Jew as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as There are now several Jews on the council, which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like Jewish people or persons of Jewish background may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.|$|E
25|$|The first chess engine (a chess playing {{computer}} program) to beat {{a person}} in tournament play was the Mac Hack Six, in 1967. Soon after, tournaments were created just for chess computers. In 1970, the first North American Computer Chess Championship (NACCC) was held in New York City, and in 1974, the first World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC) was held in Stockholm. Kaissa, a chess program of the Soviet Union was named the world's first computer chess champion. In 1995, the first World Computer Speed Chess Championship was held in Paderborn, Germany for blitz chess. For a time, computers competed in human tournaments as well, but computers <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> strong that humans are {{no longer able to}} compete with them; players now tend to treat them as analysis tools rather than as opponents. Interest remains in computer chess tournaments, especially the World Computer Chess Championship and Top Chess Engine Championship. As of 2016, the World Computer Chess champion is Komodo.|$|E

25|$|The {{predictions}} of Ehrlich and other neo-Malthusians were vigorously challenged {{by a number}} of economists, notably Julian Lincoln Simon, and advances in agriculture, collectively known as the Green Revolution, forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%. The world population has grown by over four billion {{since the beginning of the}} Green Revolution, but food production has so far kept pace with population growth. Most scholars believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents. However, neo-Malthusians point out that fossil fuels provided the energy for the Green Revolution, in the form of natural gas-derived fertilizers, oil-derived pesticides, and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation, and that many crops <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions.|$|E

Most have to do with battle imagery and tantric metaphysics. The most popular however is a devotional view. According to Rachel Fell McDermott, the poets portrayed Siva as [...] "the devotee who falls at [...] feet in devotion, or in surrender of his ego, or in hopes of gaining moksha by her touch.

500|$|For most {{of their}} {{recorded}} history, Taiwanese aborigines have been defined by the agents of different Confucian, Christian, and Nationalist [...] "civilizing" [...] projects, {{with a variety of}} aims. Each [...] "civilizing" [...] project defined the aborigines based on the [...] "civilizer"'s cultural understandings of difference and similarity, behavior, location, appearance and prior contact with other groups of people. Taxonomies imposed by colonizing forces divided the aborigines into named subgroups, referred to as [...] "tribes". These divisions did not always correspond to distinctions drawn by the aborigines themselves. However, the categories <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> firmly established in government and popular discourse over time that they have become de facto distinctions, serving to shape in part today's political discourse within the Republic of China (ROC), and affecting Taiwan's policies regarding indigenous peoples.|$|E
500|$|Reenactments, {{in which}} a group dressed in 19th-century garb travels for one or more days pushing and pulling handcarts, have become a popular {{activity}} among LDS wards, youth groups, and families. The reenactments have been lauded by LDS leaders; for example, M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said, [...] "Through music, drama, and stirring reenactments, we will be reminded of incredible pioneer journeys, both temporal and spiritual." [...] The reenactments <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> popular that the Bureau of Land Management is studying {{the impact on the}} trail and its environment, especially in the area around Rocky Ridge, Wyoming.

[...] Peck sees parallels between the Slender Man and common anxieties about the digital age, such as feelings of constant connectedness and unknown third-party observation. Similarly, Tye Van Horn, a writer for The Elm, has suggested that the Slender Man represents modern fear of the unknown; in an age flooded with information, people <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> unaccustomed to ignorance that they now fear what they cannot understand. Troy Wagner, the creator of Marble Hornets, ascribes the terror of the Slender Man to its malleability; people can shape it into whatever frightens them most.

500|$|Bryant and Bob Green were {{divorced}} in May 1979, {{in a dispute}} made public through newspapers. Bryant moved to Alabama and gave a candid interview to Ladies Home Journal in 1980 where she told {{the details of her}} marriage during the campaign. She claimed she had been [...] "married for the wrong reasons" [...] and that she and Green had fought regularly, often considering divorce. Green became her manager and she claimed exhaustion due to being booked for every event available, making $700,000 in 1976 ( [...] dollars). She had checked herself into a Christian psychiatric facility in 1973, and regularly saw psychiatrists and marriage counselors. Her anxiety manifested itself in chest pains, tremors, difficulty swallowing food, and a bout with 24-hour paralysis during a trip to Israel with the Falwell family. Bryant revealed she had received severe criticism from Christians following her divorce. One Canadian pastor expressed doubt to her that she had [...] "ever met the Lord", to her humiliation. As a result of the backlash she received from Christians, Bryant had softened her stances on gay rights: [...] "The church needs to be more loving, unconditionally, and willing to see these people as human beings, to minister to them and try to understand. If I had it to do over, I'd do it again, but not in the same way," [...] and feminism: [...] "The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems that are based on Biblical principles. I believe in the long run God will vindicate me. I've about given up on the fundamentalists, who <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> legalistic and letter-bound to the Bible." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this means is that public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and it is something that their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might be what the Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however my impression is that the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by lawyers at Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not have a case on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E
