A number of the redundancies made in October 2007 were directly attributable to the introduction of this new technology.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel image adaptive data hiding system using {{properties of the}} discrete wavelet transform and which is ready to use in combination with JPEG 2000. Image adaptive watermarking schemes determine the embedding samples and strength from the image statistics. We propose to use the energy of wavelet coefficients at high frequencies to measure the amount of distortion that can be tolerated by a lower frequency coefficient. The watermark decoder in image adaptive data hiding needs to estimate the same parameters used for encoding from a modified source and hence is vulnerable to desynchronization. We present a novel way to resolve these synchronization issues by employing specialized insertion, deletion and substitution codes. Given the low complexity and reduced perceptual impact of the embedding technique, it is suitable for <b>inserting</b> <b>camera</b> and/or projector information to facilitate image forensics...|$|R

50|$|Symptoms {{suggestive of}} colitis are worked-up by obtaining the medical history, a {{physical}} examination and laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, stool culture and sensitivity, stool ova and parasites et cetera). Additional tests may include medical imaging (e.g. abdominal computed tomography, abdominal X-rays) and an examination with a <b>camera</b> <b>inserted</b> into the rectum (sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy).|$|R
50|$|When using a {{sheet film}} holder, {{the device is}} <b>inserted</b> into the <b>camera,</b> often a view camera, and the dark slide is withdrawn, making the film {{available}} for exposure.

40|$|In laparoscopic surgery, tiny incisions {{are made}} in the patient's body and a {{laparoscope}} (an optical tube with a camera at the end) is <b>inserted.</b> The <b>camera's</b> image is projected onto two video screens, whose views guide the surgeon through the procedure. AESOP, a medical robot developed by Computer Motion, Inc. with NASA assistance, eliminates the need for a human assistant to operate the camera. The surgeon uses a foot pedal control to move the device, allowing him to use both hands during the surgery. Miscommunication is avoided; AESOP's movement is smooth and steady, and the memory vision is invaluable. Operations can be completed more quickly, and the patient spends less time under anesthesia. AESOP has been approved by the FDA...|$|R
50|$|Mass {{production}} {{started in}} July 1966. The first ads showed cameras with release bolting devices and battery test keys. The first {{proved to be}} redundant, since with the lens <b>inserted</b> the <b>camera</b> could not be released anyway. The latter feature was dropped, for reasons of reliability - electrical contacts could easily fail. The voltage of the mercury battery dropped so rapidly {{at the end of}} the battery's life that it would be hard to obtain a wrong exposure. Likewise a switch for the exposure meter was also dropped. The exposure meter was always on, even with the lens inserted. Enclosed in the darkness of the camera bag, practically no current drained from the battery, which therefore remained usable for many years.|$|R

Kodak spent tremendous resources studying customer behavior, finding out that women in particular loved taking digital photos but were frustrated in moving them to their computers. This key unmet consumer need became a major opportunity. Once Kodak got its product development machine started, it released {{a wide range of}} products which made it easy to share photos via PCs. One of their key innovations was a printer dock, where consumers could <b>insert</b> their <b>cameras</b> into this compact device, press a button, and watch their photos roll out. By 2005, Kodak ranked No. 1 in the U.S. in digital camera sales that surged 40% to $5.7 billion.|$|R

30|$|Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} {{performed}} by <b>inserting</b> a <b>camera</b> and an instrument through small incisions {{in the body}} cavity. In laparoscopic surgery, smaller incisions produce less physical stress for patients [1]. Therefore, studies are being carried out to develop thinner surgical instruments [2]. However, as instruments become thinner, the sizes of the end effectors also decrease. Consequently, grasping an organ becomes difficult because of the decrease in grasper size [3]. To address this problem, new instruments that transform into large graspers inside the body cavity have been developed [4, 5]. In laparoscopic surgeries that {{require the use of}} various instruments, exchanging instruments is a complicated task that consumes 10 – 30 % of the total procedure time [6]. Therefore, a single instrument that has multiple functions can reduce the amount of instrument exchange required and thereby reduce the total procedure time [7].|$|R
40|$|This paper uses social {{practice}} {{theory to}} explore the potential of video to generate new ‘ways of seeing’ organising and management practices. The ontological assumptions of social practice theory are invoked to suggest how organisational researchers should practice the videoing, analysing and representing of videography-based research. Examples are drawn from visual anthropology, film theory and film studies to show how <b>inserting</b> the <b>camera</b> into ordinary everyday research practices is likely {{to change the way}} we construct and represent new organisation, management and market knowledge. In so doing, we show the power of videography to generate new knowledge at an ontological level. Finally, the institutional implications for publishing and the production and circulation of knowledge are considered in light of these new researching-videoing practices, in the context of technological change in the world of video production and circulation...|$|R

5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible <b>camera</b> <b>inserted</b> into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy.

50|$|A grism (also {{called a}} grating prism) is a {{combination}} of a prism and grating arranged so that light at a chosen central wavelength passes straight through. The advantage of this arrangement is that one and the same camera can be used both for imaging (without the grism) and spectroscopy (with the grism) without having to be moved. Grisms are <b>inserted</b> into a <b>camera</b> beam that is already collimated. They then create a dispersed spectrum centered on the object's location in the camera's field of view.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{features}} {{found on}} many SLR cameras include through-the-lens (TTL) metering and sophisticated flash control {{referred to as}} [...] "dedicated electronic flash". In a dedicated system, once the dedicated electronic flash is <b>inserted</b> into the <b>camera's</b> hot shoe and turned on, there is then communication between camera and flash. The camera's synchronization speed is set, along with the aperture. Many camera models measure the light that reflects off of the film plane, which controls the flash duration of the electronic flash. This is denoted TTL flash metering.|$|R
50|$|Many camera {{phones and}} most digital cameras use memory cards having flash memory to store image data.

50|$|There is much {{disagreement}} among ETS surgeons {{about the}} best surgical method, optimal location for nerve dissection, and {{the nature and extent}} of the consequent primary effects and side effects. When performed endoscopically as is usually the case, the surgeon penetrates the chest cavity making multiple incisions about the diameter of a straw between ribs. This allows the surgeon to <b>insert</b> the video <b>camera</b> (endoscope) in one hole and a surgical instrument in another. The operation is accomplished by dissecting the nerve tissue of the main sympathetic chain.|$|R
5000|$|The {{panoramic}} cameras, {{which were}} used {{for most of the}} early lenticular prints, were French-made and weighed about 300 lb. In the 1930s they were known as [...] "auto-stereo cameras". These wood-and-brass cameras had a motorized lens that moved in a semicircle around the lens' nodal point. Sheet transparency film, with the lenticular lens overlay, was loaded into special dark slides (about 10×15 inches or [...] ), and these were then <b>inserted</b> into the <b>camera.</b> The exposure time was several seconds long, giving time for the motor drive to power the lens around in an arc.|$|R

50|$|Adiana {{sterilization}} {{was approved}} by the FDA in 2009. Adiana sterilization is a hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure, which is very similar to Essure sterilization. The Adiana procedure involves <b>inserting</b> a small <b>camera</b> (hysteroscope) through the cervix and into the uterine cavity. A smaller catheter is inserted into the tubal ostia. The catheter emits radiowaves (microwaves). The radiowaves cause injury to the tubal lining and will result in the tube gradually closing. Prior to removal of the catheter a small silicone stent is left inside the isthmic portion of the tube and this promotes tubal closure by the acceleration of the tubal scarring.|$|R
50|$|A {{long-established}} legend {{attached to}} the Glenfinnan Viaduct was that a horse had fallen {{into one of the}} piers during construction in 1898 or 1899. In 1987, Professor Roland Paxton failed to find evidence of a horse at Glenfinnan using a fisheye <b>camera</b> <b>inserted</b> into boreholes in the only two piers large enough to accommodate a horse. In 1997, on the basis of local hearsay, he investigated the Loch nan Uamh Viaduct by the same method but found the piers to be full of rubble. Using scanning technology in 2001, the remains of the horse and cart were found at Loch nan Uamh, within the large central pylon.|$|R
50|$|Essure {{sterilization}} is a {{tubal occlusion}} procedure that {{was approved by}} the FDA in 2002. The Essure procedure involves <b>inserting</b> a small <b>camera</b> (hysteroscope) through the cervix and into the uterine cavity. Two small, metallic coils are then inserted into each tubal ostia and into the isthmic portion of the fallopian tube. The coils cause the isthmic portion of the fallopian tube to be blocked with scar tissue. To confirm tubal closure, a hysterosalpingogram should be performed three months after the Essure procedure. If either fallopian tube is open after the Essure procedure, then the Essure procedure can be repeated or another type of tubal occlusion method can be performed.|$|R

50|$|Polyps can be surgically removed using {{curettage}} with {{or without}} hysteroscopy. When curettage is performed without hysteroscopy, polyps may be missed. To reduce this risk, the uterus can be first explored using grasping forceps {{at the beginning of}} the curettage procedure. Hysteroscopy involves visualising the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) and polyp with a <b>camera</b> <b>inserted</b> through the cervix. If it is a large polyp, it can be cut into sections before each section is removed. If cancerous cells are discovered, a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) may be performed. A hysterectomy would usually not be considered if cancer has been ruled out. Whichever method is used, polyps are usually treated under general anesthetic.|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{photographs}} of cultural heritage items and monuments is publicly available in various Open Access Image Repositories (OAIR) and social media sites. Metadata <b>inserted</b> by <b>camera,</b> user and host site may help to determine the photograph content, geo-location and date of capture, thus allowing us, with relative success, to localise photos in space and time. Additionally, developments in Photogrammetry and Computer Vision, such as Structure from Motion (SfM), provide a simple and cost-effective method of generating relatively accurate camera orientations and sparse and dense 3 D point clouds from 2 D images. Our main goal {{is to provide a}} software tool able to run on desktop or cluster computers or as a back end of a cloud-based service, enabling historians, architects, archaeologists and the general public to search, download and reconstruct 3 D point clouds of historical monuments from hundreds of images from the web in a cost-effective manner. The end products can be further enriched with metadata and published. This paper describes a workflow for searching and retrieving photographs of historical monuments from OAIR, such as Flickr and Picasa, and using them to build dense point clouds using SfM and dense image matching techniques. Computational efficiency is improved by a technique which reduces image matching time by using an image connectivity prior derived from low-resolution versions of the original images. Benchmarks for two large datasets showing the respective efficiency gains are presented...|$|R
