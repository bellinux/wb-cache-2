25|$|Although it {{functions}} as an endogenous precursor to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT, DHEA {{has been found}} to possess some degree of androgenic activity in its own right, acting as a low affinity (Ki = 1 μM), weak partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). However, its intrinsic activity at the receptor is quite weak, and on account of that, due to competition for binding with full agonists like testosterone, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> behave more like an antagonist depending on circulating testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, and hence, like an antiandrogen. However, its affinity for the receptor is very low, and for that reason, is unlikely to be of much significance under normal circumstances.|$|E

The magnetic anisotropy drops significantly when the micro-rods were replaced by microspheres, even when they were aligned in chain-like formations.

2500|$|Although McKenna avoided {{giving his}} {{allegiance}} {{to any one}} interpretation (part of his rejection of monotheism), he was open {{to the idea of}} psychedelics as being [...] "trans-dimensional travel". He proposed that DMT sent one to a [...] "parallel dimension" [...] and that psychedelics literally enabled an individual to encounter 'higher dimensional entities' or what could be ancestors or spirits of the Earth, saying that if you can trust your own perceptions it appears that you are entering an [...] "ecology of souls." [...] McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were [...] "doorways into the Gaian mind", suggesting that [...] "the planet has a kind of intelligence, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> open a channel of communication with an individual human being" [...] and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication. In a more radical version of biophysicist Francis Crick's hypothesis of directed panspermia, McKenna speculated on the idea that psilocybin mushrooms may be a species of high intelligence, which may have arrived on this planet as spores migrating through space and which are attempting to establish a symbiotic relationship with human beings. He postulated that [...] "intelligence, not life, but intelligence may have come here [...] in this spore-bearing life form". He said, [...] "I think that theory will probably be vindicated. I think in a hundred years if people do biology they will think it quite silly that people once thought that spores could not be blown from one star system to another by cosmic radiation pressure," [...] and also believed that [...] "few people {{are in a position to}} judge its extraterrestrial potential, because few people in the orthodox sciences have ever experienced the full spectrum of psychedelic effects that are unleashed." ...|$|E

For if <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> and in reality exist, it is not right to call it ideal or imaginary; it would be better to call it characteristic or general, and to reserve the word ideal for the results of the operation of the imagination, either on the perfect or imperfect forms.|$|E
60|$|Now I presume that, in the {{termination}} of my last sentence, few of my readers have noticed anything especially objectionable—particularly wrong. I said that {{the distance of the}} Earth from the Sun being taken at one foot, the distance of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of Alpha Lyræ, 159. The proportion between one foot and 159 has appeared, perhaps, to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion between the two intervals—that of the Earth from the Sun and that of Alpha Lyræ from the same luminary. But my account of the matter should, in reality, have run thus:—The distance of the Earth from the Sun being taken at one foot, the distance of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of Alpha Lyræ, 159——miles:—that is to say, I had assigned to Alpha Lyræ, in my first statement of the case, only the 5280th part of that distance which is the least distance possible at which <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> lie.|$|E

50|$|Whereas GLS is more {{efficient}} than OLS under heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation, {{this is not true}} for FGLS. The feasible estimator is, provided the errors covariance matrix is consistently estimated, asymptotically {{more efficient}}, but for a small or medium size sample, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be <b>actually</b> less efficient than OLS. This is why, some authors prefer to use OLS, and reformulate their inferences by simply considering an alternative estimator for the variance of the estimator robust to heteroscedasticity or serial autocorrelation.But for large samples FGLS is preferred over OLS under heteroskedasticity or serial correlation. A cautionary note is that the FGLS estimator is not always consistent. One case in which FGLS might be inconsistent is if there are individual specific fixed effects.|$|R

40|$|We derive a {{generating}} function {{for all the}} 3 -point functions of higher spin conserved currents in four dimensional conformal field theory. The resulting expressions have a rather surprising factorized form which suggest that they can all be realized by currents built from free massless fields of arbitrary (half-) integer spin s. This property is however not necessarily true also for the higher-point functions. As an illustration we analyze the general 4 -point function of conserved abelian U(1) currents of scale dimension equal to three and find that apart from the two free field realizations there is a unique possible function which may correspond to an interacting theory. Although this function passes several non-trivial consistency tests, it remains an open challenging problem whether <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be <b>actually</b> realized in an interacting CFT.

40|$|Recent papers ([16, 17]) {{have shown}} that the {{performance}} of Time Warp simulators can be improved by appropriately selecting the positions of checkpoints, instead of taking them on a periodic basis. In this paper we present a checkpointing technique which selects the positions of checkpoints basing on a checkpointing-recovery cost model. Given the current state S, the model determines the convenience of recording S as a checkpoint before the next event is executed. This is done by taking into account the position of the last taken checkpoint, the granularity (i. e., the execution time) of intermediate events and basing on an estimate of the probability that S will have to be restored due to rollback in the future of the execution. Simulation results of a classical benchmark in several different configurations are reported.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} colloids at a fluid interface driven by attractive capillary interactions. At submillimeter length scales, the capillary attraction is formally analogous to two-dimensional gravity.

We introduce a mean-field model for the dynamical evolution of the particle number density at the interface. For generic values of the physical parameters the homogeneous distribution is found to be unstable against large-scale clustering driven by the capillary attraction. We also show that for the instability to be observable, the appropriate values for the relevant parameters (colloid radius, surface charge, external electric field, etc.) are experimentally well accessible. Our analysis contributes to current studies of the structure and dynamics of systems governed by long-ranged interactions and points towards their experimental realizations via colloidal suspensions.
