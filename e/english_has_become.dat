It goes on to claim, however, that this will first require a substantial overhaul of English language testing, given that teachers and learners alike will be reluctant to embrace any curriculum change that is not reflected in the targets set by the major examination boards...|$|R

5000|$|A further {{reason that}} English Bible {{translation}} is less central to Jews than Christians is that often, those Jews {{who study the}} Bible regularly still do so, {{to a greater or}} lesser extent, in its original language, as it is read in the synagogue.

Nevertheless, Jewish translations of the Bible to <b>English</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> far more widespread, especially since the 1980s, and been made available in numerous complementary versions and styles.

The majority of advising researchers and students were from abroad and <b>English</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> the language of communication.|$|R

5|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{analyses of}} the name must account for {{the origins of the}} different forms found in early sources Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages.
