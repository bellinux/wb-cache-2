5|$|Another {{indirect}} {{effect of the}} boom was the growth of gambling and prostitution <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>communities.</b> These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E
5|$|Festivals often {{involved}} a ceremonial procession {{in which a}} cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation, processions <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>communities</b> carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals {{were meant to be}} repetitions of the events of the mythic past, renewing the beneficial effects of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout. The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god's own life.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the hurricane's {{landfall}} in Nicaragua, the country's army evacuated about 500people from {{a settlement}} near Bluefields, {{and along the}} coastline, boats were advised to remain at port. When it moved ashore, the hurricane produced sustained winds of 46mph (74km/h) in Bluefields. The winds destroyed 27houses in the region. Observations were not available in the sparsely populated region near where Irene moved ashore, although winds were believed to have reached hurricane force there. Reconnaissance planes reported heavy structural and tree damage in southeastern Nicaragua. Satellite imagery suggested that heavy rainfall occurred from Panama through Honduras, and one location in Nicaragua reported more than 6.3inches (160mm) of precipitation. The rainfall caused flooding <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>communities,</b> killing three people in Rivas. At least five rivers reported flooding; along one of the rivers, 35houses were inundated, and along another, the floodwaters swept away all of the crops and personal belongings of three villages. Across the country, the hurricane destroyed 96homes, and 1,200people were left homeless. In Costa Rica, Irene's passage resulted in more than $1million (USD) in damage to the banana crop.|$|E
