40|$|Synthetic {{pyrethroids}} are lipophilic insecticides whose {{biological activity}} {{seems to be}} directly related to their chemical structure. In this investigation differences in cutaneous sensation were detected by human participants between synthetic pyrethroids with a cyano group in the (S) -configuration of the 3 -phenoxybenzyl alcohol of their molecular structure (fenvalerate) {{and those that do}} not (permethrin). A strong relation was noted between insecticidal potency and degree of induced cutaneous sensation for the alpha-cyano and non-cyano pyrethroids, with a prominent difference between the two. No sensation was observed by any of the same participants on topical exposure to the inert ingredients of these agents. A linear correlation between concentration and degree of induced dysaethesia was observed for both pyrethroids. Regressing the cutaneous sensation on the common logarithm of concentration resulted in a regression equation of Y = 84. 0 + 31. 0 X 1 for fenvalerate and Y = 27. 5 + 15. 8 X 1 for permethrin.

Materials and Methods: Quercetin, gossypin, HR flavone or <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> (200 mg/kg, i. p.) were administered just before percutaneous administration of SM and {{protection against the}} SM lethality was evaluated. In another experiment quercetin, gossypin, HR flavone or <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> were administered against 2 LD 50 SM. The animals were sacrificed seven days post SM administration and various biochemical parameters were estimated. Results: The protection against the lethality of SM was very good with the flavonoids (quercetin = 4. 7 folds; gossypin = 6. 7 folds and HR flavone = 5. 6 folds), compared to no protection with <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> (0. 7 fold). SM (2 LD 50) showed decrease in reduced and oxidised glutathione (GSH and GSSG) levels, {{and an increase in}} malondialdehyde level (MDA). Oxidative stress enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase were significantly decreased. The total antioxidant status was also significantly decreased. Additionally, there was a significant increase in red blood corpuscles and hemoglobin content. All the flavonoids significantly protected the GSH, GSSG and MDA, and also the hematological variables. <b>Tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> failed to offer any protection in those parameters. Gossypin protected glutathione peroxidase, while HR flavone protected both glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase significantly.

The present work presents a novel strategy to prevent the formation of a biofilm on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. PTFE grafts were coated with gentamicin and teicoplanin incorporated into different lipid-like carriers under aseptic conditions in a dipping process. Poly-d,l-lactic acid, <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate,</b> the diglyceride Softisan 649, and the triglyceride Dynasan 118 were used as drug carriers. The drug release kinetics, anti-infective characteristics, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility of the coatings developed were studied. All coatings showed an initial drug burst, followed by a low continuous drug release over 96 h. The dimension of release kinetics depended on the carrier used. All coated prostheses reduced bacterial growth drastically over 24 h, even below pathologically relevant concentrations. Different cytotoxic levels could be observed, revealing <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> as the most promising biocompatible carrier. A possible reason for the highly cytotoxic effect of Softisan 649 could be assessed by demonstrating incorporated lipids in the cell soma with Oil Red O staining. Tromboelastography studies, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and an amidolytic substrate assay could confirm the hemocompatibility of individual coatings. The development of the biodegradable drug delivery systems described here and in vitro studies of those systems highlight the most important requirements for effective as well as compatible anti-infective coatings of PTFE grafts. Through continuous local release, high drug levels can be produced at only the targeted area and physiological bacterial proliferation can be completely inhibited, while biocompatibility as well as hemocompatibility can be ensured...|$|R

To estimate the effectiveness of synthetic and naturally occurring antioxidants, namely various <b>tocopherols,</b> <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> and phytosterol fractions, phenolic compounds like quercetin, oryzanol, ferulic acid, gallates, BHT, BHA and other compounds like ascorbic acid 6 -palmitate and squalene were added to refined sunflower and rape seed oil, and their oxidative stability at elevated temperature (OSET) values determined. Both linoleic and oleic rich oils gave comparable results for the activity of the various compounds. alpha-tocopherol, tocopherol esters and BHA had low effects on oil stability at frying temperature, while ascorbyl palmitate and some phytosterol fractions were found to have the most stabilizing activity under frying conditions...|$|R

Aims : To measure the facial skin effects in Indian women of the daily use of a lotion containing niacinamide, panthenol, and <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> using quantitative image analysis. Methods : Adult women 30 - 60 years of age with epidermal hyperpigmentation were recruited in Mumbai and randomly assigned to apply a test or control lotion to the face daily for 10 weeks. Effects on skin tone were measured using an image capturing system and associated software. Skin texture was assessed by expert graders. Barrier function was evaluated by transepithelial water loss measurements. Subjects and evaluators were blinded to the product assignment. Results : Of 246 women randomized to treatment, 207 (84 &#x 0025;) completed the study. Women who used the test lotion experienced significantly reduced appearance of hyperpigmentation, improved skin tone evenness, appearance of lightening of skin, and positive effects on skin texture. Improvements versus control were seen as early as 6 weeks. The test lotion was well tolerated. The most common adverse event was a transient, mild burning sensation. Conclusions : Daily use of a facial lotion containing niacinamide, panthenol, and tocopheryl acetate improved skin tone and texture and was well tolerated in Indian women with facial signs of aging...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of the antioxidant potential of lyophilized mushroom mycelia from 5 strains of the species Pleurotus ostreatus and Coprinus comatus (obtained by submerged cultivation in batch system) was analyzed as ethanolic extracts by evaluating ABTS and the hydroxyl scavenging activity, FRAP method, the chelating capacity, the inhibition of human erythrocyte hemolysis, and the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity. The main compounds present in all extracts were determined by HPLC chromatography. Overall, results demonstrated that the biologically active substances content is modulated by the extraction method used. The most beneficial extract, characterized by determining the EC 50 value, was that of C. comatus M 8102, followed by P. ostreatus PQMZ 91109. Significant amount of α-tocopherol (179. 51 [*]±[*] 1. 51 [*]mg/ 100 [*]g extract) was determined as well as flavones such as rutin and apigenin. In the P. ostreatus PQMZ 91109 extract, 4. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 05 [*]mg/ 100 [*]g extract of <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> known to {{play a significant role}} as an antioxidant in skin protection against oxidative stress generated by UV rays was determined.

In {{order to examine}} donor age effect, fibroblasts from 19 - (young) or 49 - (aged) year-old females were used. Culture medium was supplemented with nutrients complex containing soy extract, tomato extract, grape seed extract, white tea extract, sodium ascorbate, <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate,</b> zinc gluconate and BioMarine complex. Epidermal and dermal structure and composition were examined after 42 and 60 days of culture. In untreated samples, SE generated from young fibroblasts was superior to SE from aged fibroblasts in all characteristics. Those include number and regularity of keratinocyte layers, number of keratinocytes expressing proliferation marker Ki 67, content of collagen type I, fibrillin- 1, elastin, and SE lifespan. Effects of nutritional supplementation were observed in SE from both young and aged fibroblasts, however, those effects were more pronounced in SE from aged fibroblasts. In epidermis, the treatment increased number of keratinocyte layers and delayed epidermal senescence. The number of cells expressing Ki 67 was nine folds {{higher than those of}} controls, and was similar to that of young cell SE. In dermis, the treatment increased mRNA synthesis of collagen I, fibrillin- 1 and elastin. In conclusion, skin cell donor age had major important effect on formation of reconstructed SE. Imperfections in epidermal and dermal structure and composition as well as life span in SE from aged cells can be improved by supplementation with active nutrients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a {{heritable}} ectopic mineralization disorder affecting cutaneous, ocular, {{and cardiovascular}} systems, caused by mutations in the ABCC 6 gene. PXE presents with a marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Furthermore, heterozygous carriers may present with limited histopathological features. This {{study was conducted}} to investigate a patient with PXE and her family members clinically, histopathologically, and genetically. METHODS: Clinical and histopathological examinations and mutation analyses of ABCC 6 gene were performed. RESULTS: Lesional skin biopsy of the patient with PXE demonstrated clumping and fragmentation of elastic fibers, and calcification in the dermis. Non-lesional axillary skin samples of the husband, daughter, and older son were histopathologically normal. The skin from a similar region of a younger son revealed elastic fibers with some fragmentation and clumping but no mineralization. The patient with PXE was homozygous for the R 1141 X mutation in the ABCC 6 gene. The husband had wild-type alleles, while all children were heterozygous carriers. Daily treatment of antioxidant therapy with <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> and ascorbic acid was prescribed to the patient with PXE. After one year, both clinical and histopathological regression of the lesions was observed; however, lesions began to progress during the additional 6 -month period of treatment. CONCLUSION: The mutation analyses of ABCC 6 gene are important to determine the genotype of both patients with PXE and putative heterozygous carriers, as histopathological features of carriers may differ even in the same family. The role of antioxidant therapy for PXE is unclear, and {{there is a need for}} controlled clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effect of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and alpha <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> (ATA) on the antioxidant potential, lipid stability {{and the quality of the}} broiler breast meat and meat products. The treatment plan was as (T 1 [*]=[*]control feed, T 2 [*]=[*] 200 [*]mg ATA[*]+[*] 25 [*]mg ALA/kg feed, T 3 [*]=[*] 200 [*]mg ATA[*]+[*] 75 [*]mg ALA/kg feed, T 4 [*]=[*] 200 [*]mg ATA[*]+[*] 150 [*]mg ALA/kg feed, T 5 [*]=[*]Oxidized oil (4 %), T 6 [*]=[*] 200 [*]mg ATA[*]+[*] 150 [*]mg ALA[*]+[*]Oxidized oil (4 %) /kg feed). After two weeks of acclimatization the birds were fed with ALA and ATA enriched diet. The results revealed that maximum deposition of ALA took place in T 4 which contain maximum dose of ALA. The TBARS and DPPH values of the broiler breast meat were in T 4 (0. 14 [*]±[*] 0. 01 MDA/kg of meat, 76. 69 [*]±[*] 0. 14 %) and in T 5 were (0. 24 [*]±[*] 0. 15 MDA/Kg of meat, 44. 98 [*]±[*] 0. 04 %) accordingly. ATA concentration were also highest in T 4 (206. 43 [*]±[*] 0. 22 [*]mg/g of meat) and lowest in T 5 (79. 09 [*]±[*] 0. 06 [*]mg/g of meat). Sensory evaluation results showed that nuggets and patties made of T 5 containing oxidized oil were least liked and T 4 got highest score. In a nutshell, 150 [*]mg/kg feed dietary supplementation of ALA with constant level of ATA can ameliorate the antioxidant potential, lipid stability and nutritional qualities of broiler breast meat and meat products. </p...|$|R
