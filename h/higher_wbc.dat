40|$|Objective: Inflammaging, a {{state of}} chronic {{inflammation}} in the elderly, is now {{thought to be a}} key element of the ageing process and contributor to age-related disease. In a previously published study, we identified a significant association between inflammation levels and severity of presbycusis among individuals aged 63 to 73 ('younger old") within an available audiometric range 0. 5 to 4 kHz. Our aim was to see if this association would be identified among participants in the MRC national study of hearing, and whether the strength of the association would increase with greater age, or for very low or very high audiometric frequencies. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of cohort data. Study sample: Three hundred and sixty community-dwelling adults age 60 years and over, representing all those with white blood cell count and audiometric data available. Results: A significant independent association between (<b>higher)</b> <b>WBC</b> and (worse) hearing level was identified. This effect increased with age. The strongest association was among those over 75, for whom average hearing threshold levels among those with lower WBC was 17 dB better than those with <b>higher</b> <b>WBC.</b> Conclusions: The current findings support an association between inflammaging (a condition potentially amenable to pharmacological treatment or lifestyle management) and presbycusi...|$|E
40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies (ICT) {{have come to}} impact nearly all aspects of modern life, including the development, function and operation of urban and rural landscapes. Impaired vascular endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), a bio-marker of vascular endothelial dysfunction, is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events. EDD is reduced with age, but is preserved in middle-aged and older (MA/O) adults who habitually perform aerobic exercise. The purpose of these studies {{was to determine the}} role of chronic low-grade inflammation, as assessed by white blood cell (WBC) count and endothelial nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling, in the modulation of EDD in sedentary and aerobic exercise-trained MA/O adults. EDD was 34 % less in MA/O sedentary adults with higher compared with lower WBC count. Vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to nitric oxide (NO) was 18 % less in subjects with higher vs. lower WBC count, but did not fully explain the differences with EDD. Inhibition of NO reduced EDD in subjects with lower, but not <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> count. Tetrahydrobiopterin selectively improved EDD in subjects with <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> count by increasing NO bioavailability. Thus, among healthy sedentary MA/O adults, a <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> count is related to impaired EDD and this is mediated by reduced responsiveness to NO and reductions in tetrahydrobiopterin and NO bioavailability. MA/O sedentary adults had a greater expression of NF-kappaB, a key pro-inflammatory transcription factor, in their vascular endothelial cells compared with young sedentary and MA/O aerobic exercise-trained adults. In a sub-group of MA/O subjects, oral salsalate was used to inhibit NF-kappaB signaling. Salsalate treatment reduced endothelial NF-kappaB expression in sedentary subjects, but had no effect in exercise-trained subjects. EDD improved by 76 % with salsalate in the sedentary adults, whereas there was no improvement in the exercise-trained adults. In sedentary subjects, antioxidant vitamin C infusion improved EDD by 32 % during the placebo condition, but had no effect during salsalate. In exercise-trained subjects, vitamin C infusion did not change EDD during either treatment. Therefore, in sedentary MA/O adults, increased NF-kappaB signaling suppresses EDD, in part, by increased oxidative stress. Reduced NF-kappaB signaling is a key mechanism for preserved EDD in exercise-trained MA/O adults...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the prevalence of abnormal leukocyte count (either low or high) and identify factors associated with <b>high</b> <b>WBC</b> counts in a sample of Saudi patients with SCD. Methods: A cross-sectional and retrospective chart review study was carried out on 290 SCD patients who were routinely treated at King Fahad Hospital in Hofuf, Saudi Arabia. An interview was conducted to assess clinical presentations, and we reviewed patient charts to collect data on blood test parameters for the previous 6 months. Results: Almost half (131 [45. 2 %]) of the sample had abnormal leukocyte counts: low WBC counts 15 (5. 2 %) and high 116 (40 %). <b>High</b> <b>WBC</b> counts were associated with shortness of breath (P= 0. 022), tiredness (P= 0. 039), swelling in hands/feet (P= 0. 020), and back pain (P= 0. 007). The mean hemoglobin was higher in patients with normal WBC counts (P= 0. 024), while the mean hemoglobin S was high in patients with <b>high</b> <b>WBC</b> counts (P= 0. 003). After adjustment for potential confounders, predictors of <b>high</b> <b>WBC</b> counts were male gender (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]= 3. 63) and patients with cough (aOR= 2. 18), low hemoglobin (aOR= 0. 76), and low heart rate (aOR= 0. 97).

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{examine the}} {{association}} between white blood cell (WBC) count and metabolic syndrome (MetS) by growth periods in black versus white individuals in the general population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The study cohort consisted of 4, 184 black and white preadolescents, adolescents, and adults. In this cohort, 743 adults were followed for 8. 1 – 20. 8 years longitudinally. RESULTS — White versus black subjects had a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> count in all agegroups. WBC count was associated with more MetS components in whites than in blacks. Mean values of WBC increased significantly with increasing number of MetS components with adverse levels in adolescents and adults, with a stronger trend in whites. WBC count was longitudinally associated with MetS in whites only (P � 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS — The findings on {{the association between}} <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> count and MetS beginning in childhood, particularly in whites, underscore a potentially mechanistic link between systemic inflammation, MetS, and cardiovascular risk.

We aimed to determine the association of white blood cell (WBC) count with prevalence {{and development of the}} MS and its components in the general population. A cohort of 1, 329 subjects from the local working population aged 41. 3 ± 7. 5 years and recruited since 2000 - 2008 was followed up for 4. 0 ± 1. 2 years. WBC count and MS components were determined at baseline and follow-up. To determine whether WBC predicted incident MS, we used a logistic regression analysis adjusted for demographics, baseline variables that define MS components, smoke, medications, and follow-up duration. Cross-sectionally in the whole population, WBC count increased in parallel with the number of MS components in the same individual, and the presence of each component was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> count. Baseline WBC count was significantly higher in subjects with prevalent MS. Among subjects without MS at baseline, those who developed MS had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> {{than those who did not}} develop MS at follow-up.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{investigated}} the secular trend in {{white blood cell}} (WBC) count {{and the relationship between}} WBC count and mortality between 1958 and 2002. BackgroundThe WBC count is a clinical marker of inflammation and a strong predictor of mortality. Limited data exist on the WBC count secular trend and the relationship between WBC and mortality. MethodsOne thousand eighty-three women and 1, 720 men were evaluated longitudinally in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Blood samples and medical information were collected at the study entry and every 2 years during follow-up visits. The WBC count and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality were assessed. ResultsA downward trend in WBC count was observed from 1958 to 2002. The secular downward trend was independent of age, gender, race, smoking, body mass index, and physical activity. The WBC count was nonlinearly associated with all-cause mortality and almost linearly associated with cardiovascular mortality. Participants with baseline WBC 6, 000 cells/mm 3 had higher mortality than those with 3, 500 to 6, 000 WBC/mm 3. Within each WBC group, age-adjusted mortality rates declined in successive cohorts from the 1960 s to the 1990 s.

However, in spite of this tremendous progress, APL still remains associated with a high incidence of early death due to the frequent occurrence of an abrupt bleeding diathesis.

Whereas a low CSF WBC indicates the presence of sepsis with early meningitis in patients with meningococcal infections, the relation between CSF WBC and outcome in patients with pneumococcal meningitis is not understood. Methods We examined the relation between CSF WBC, bacteraemia and sepsis in a prospective cohort study that included 352 episodes of pneumococcal meningitis, confirmed by CSF culture, occurring in patients aged > 16 years. Results CSF WBC was recorded in 320 of 352 episodes (91 %). Median CSF WBC was 2530 per mm 3 (interquartile range 531 – 6983 per mm 3) and 104 patients (33 %) had a CSF WBC 3.

Covariates associated with such involvement were <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> at diagnosis, prior CNS or other extramedullary disease, and evidence of systemic disease at pre-HCT evaluation. History of prior CNS disease and disease status at pre-HCT evaluation allowed stratification of patients into 3 risk groups: 35 % (20 patients), 16 % (51 patients), and 3 % (256 patients) rates of pre-HCT CNS involvement. Treatment of pre-HCT CNS disease was uniformly successful regardless of whether cranial irradiation therapy was used. Perhaps as a result, presence of CNS pre-HCT had no independent influence on post-HCT outcome, which was primarily influenced by status of systemic disease at time of HCT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Sleep {{deprivation}} {{has been}} shown to be associated with an increase in inflammatory makers such as interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relation between subjective poor sleep and white blood cell (WBC) count, an inflammatory marker. The subjects were 208 male Japanese workers in a synthetic fibermanufacturing plant, who responded to a cross-sectional survey of a questionnaire on basic attributes, life style, and sleep. All male workers in the plant took an annual health checkup. WBC count was also examined in the checkup. The WBC count was greater in shift workers than in daytime workers. Shift workers complained of poor sleep more frequently, though their sleeping hours were longer. Multiple regression analysis showed that poor sleep as well as smoking habit, BMI and age were independent factors for an increase in WBC count, while sleeping hours and work pattern (shift work) were not significant factors. The present finding that poor sleep was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> count in male workers might suggest the importance of quality of sleep, particularly among shift workers...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A low {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) white-blood cell count (WBC) {{has been identified}} as an independent risk factor for adverse outcome in adults with bacterial meningitis. Whereas a low CSF WBC indicates the presence of sepsis with early meningitis in patients with meningococcal infections, the relation between CSF WBC and outcome in patients with pneumococcal meningitis is not understood. METHODS: We examined the relation between CSF WBC, bacteraemia and sepsis in a prospective cohort study that included 352 episodes of pneumococcal meningitis, confirmed by CSF culture, occurring in patients aged > 16 years. RESULTS: CSF WBC was recorded in 320 of 352 episodes (91 %). Median CSF WBC was 2530 per mm 3 (interquartile range 531 - 6983 per mm 3) and 104 patients (33 %) had a CSF WBC < 1000 /mm 3. Patients with a CSF WBC < 1000 /mm 3 {{were more likely to have}} an unfavourable outcome (defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1 - 4) than those with a <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> (74 of 104 [71 %] vs. 87 of 216 [43 %]; P < 0. 001). CSF WBC was significantly associated with blood WBC (Spearman's test 0. 29), CSF protein level (0. 20), thrombocyte count (0. 21), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (- 0. 15), and C-reactive protein levels (- 0. 18). Patients with a CSF WBC < 1000 /mm 3 more often had a positive blood culture (72 of 84 [86 %] vs. 138 of 196 [70 %]; P = 0. 01) and more often developed systemic complications (cardiorespiratory failure, sepsis) than those with a <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> (53 of 104 [51 %] vs. 69 of 216 [32 %]; P = 0. 001). In a multivariate analysis, advanced age (Odds ratio per 10 -year increments 1. 22, 95 %CI 1. 02 - 1. 45), a positive blood culture (Odds ratio 2. 46, 95 %CI 1. 17 - 5. 14), and a low thrombocyte count on admission (Odds ratio per 100, 000 /mm 3 increments 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 47 - 0. 97) were associated with a CSF WBC < 1000 /mm 3. CONCLUSION: A low CSF WBC in adults with pneumococcal meningitis is related to the presence of signs of sepsis and systemic complications. Invasive pneumococcal infections should possibly be regarded as a continuum from meningitis to sepsi...|$|E

40|$|Aberrant {{activation}} of the Wnt pathway plays a pathogenetic role in tumors and {{has been associated with}} adverse outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF 1), a key mediator of Wnt signaling, has been linked to leukemic transformation, and LEF 1 mutations have been identified in T-ALL. Here we found LEF 1 is highly expressed in 25. 0 % adult ALL patients and LEF 1 high expression was associated with high-risk leukemia factors (<b>high</b> <b>WBC,</b> Philadelphia chromosome positive, complex karyotype), shorter event-free survival (EFS), and high relapse rates in patients with B-ALL. LEF 1 high expression is also associated with high mutation rate of Notch 1 and JAK 1 in T-ALL. We identified 2 novel LEF 1 mutations (K 86 E and P 106 L) in 4 of 131 patients with ALL, and those patients with high-risk ALL (<b>high</b> <b>WBC,</b> complex karyotype). These results suggest a role for LEF 1 mutations in leukemogenesis. We further explored the effect of the mutations on cell proliferation and found both mutations significantly promoted the proliferation of ALL cells. We also observed the effect of LEF 1 and its mutations on the transcription of its targets, c-MYC and Cyclin D 1. We found LEF 1 increased the promoter activity of its targets c-MYC and Cyclin D 1, and LEF 1 K 86 E and P 106 L mutants further significantly enhanced this effect. We also observed that the c-MYC and Cyclin D 1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in patients with LEF 1 high expression compared with those with low expression. Taken together, our findings indicate high LEF 1 expression and mutation are associated with high-risk leukemia and our results also revealed that LEF 1 high expression and/or gain-of-function mutations are involved in leukemogenesis of ALL...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} whether soluble fiber (SF) with <b>high</b> {{water-binding capacity}} (<b>WBC),</b> swelling capacity (SC) and fermentability reduces food intake {{and whether it}} does so by promoting satiety or satiation or both, we investigated the effects of different SFs with these properties on the food intake in rats. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to four equal groups and fed the control diet or diet containing 2 % konjac flour (KF), pregelatinized waxy maize starch (PWMS) plus guar gum (PG), and PWMS starch plus xanthan gum (PX) for three weeks, with the measured values of SF, WBC, and SC in the four diets following the order of PG > KF > PX > control. Food intake, body weight, meal pattern, behavioral satiety sequence, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in cecal content were evaluated. KF and PG groups reduced the food intake, mainly due to the decreased feeding behavior and increased satiety, as indicated by decreased meal numbers and increased inter-meal intervals. Additionally, KF and PG groups increased concentrations of acetate acid, propionate acid, and SCFAs in the cecal contents. Our results indicate that SF with <b>high</b> <b>WBC,</b> SC, and fermentability reduces food intake—probably by promoting a feeling of satiety in rats to decrease their feeding behavior...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relationship between the maternal white blood cell (WBC) count at the time of hospital admission in pregnancies complicated by preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) and the presence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) and/or intra-amniotic inflammation (IAI). The second aim was to test WBC diagnostic indices with respect to the presence of MIAC and/or IAI. Four hundred and seventy-nine women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM, between February 2012 and June 2017, were included in this study. Maternal blood and amniotic fluid samples were collected at the time of admission. Maternal WBC count was assessed. Amniotic fluid interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) concentration was measured using a point-of-care test, and IAI was characterized by an IL- 6 concentration of ≥ 745 pg/mL. MIAC was diagnosed based on a positive polymerase chain reaction result for the Ureaplasma species, Mycoplasma hominis, and/or Chlamydia trachomatis and/or for the 16 S rRNA gene. Women with MIAC or IAI had <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> counts than those without (with MIAC: median, 12. 8 × 109 /L vs. without MIAC: median, 11. 9 × 109 /L; p = 0. 0006; with IAI: median, 13. 7 × 109 /L vs. without IAI: median, 11. 9 × 109 /L; p < 0. 0001). When the women were divided into four subgroups based on the presence of MIAC and/or IAI, the women with both MIAC and IAI had a <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> count than those with either IAI or MIAC alone, and those without MIAC and IAI [both MIAC and IAI: median, 14. 0 × 109 /L; IAI alone: 12. 1 × 109 /L (p = 0. 03); MIAC alone: 12. 1 × 109 /L (p = 0. 0001); and without MIAC and IAI: median, 11. 8 × 109 /L (p < 0. 0001) ]. No differences in the WBC counts were found among the women with IAI alone, MIAC alone, and without MIAC and IAI. The women with both MIAC and IAI had a higher maternal WBC count at the time of hospital admission than the remaining women with PPROM. The maternal WBC count at the time of admission showed poor diagnostic indices for the identification of the presence of both MIAC and IAI. Maternal WBC count at the time of admission cannot serve as a non-invasive screening tool for identifying these complications in women with PPROM...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground and aimMany {{risk factors}} that might {{contribute}} to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have been proposed, including chronic inflammation and infection. Furthermore, systemic inflammatory responses to periodontal bacteria have been suggested as a pathogenetic link between periodontal disease and atherosclerosis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate the white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts in chronic periodontitis patients. Materials and methodsFifty patients with chronic periodontitis and 50 patients with healthy periodontium were included in this study. Oral hygiene status, pocket probing depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured. During clinical evaluation, venous blood samples were taken to analyze the WBC and platelet counts. Statistical analysis was utilized to compare differences across groups. ResultsPeriodontitis patients demonstrated a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>WBC</b> count (7. 22 ± 1. 42 × 109 cells/L) than that of control patients (5. 64 ± 1. 56 × 109 cells/L; P< 0. 001). The platelet count of patients with chronic periodontitis (290. 73 ± 56. 56 × 109 cells/L) was also significantly higher compared to the healthy group (223. 37 ± 50. 27 × 109 cells/L; P< 0. 001).
