In this paper, the authors attempt to describe the importance of each growth phase for adult shortness and the effect of growth in one phase on other, subsequent phases. The authors analyzed data from a longitudinal population-based growth study of 2, 850 healthy, full term Swedish children born between 1973 and 1975. The height values were transformed into a centimeter score (CMS) by subtracting the raw values from the reference mean values for a particular age and sex. Subnormal growth in any growth phase, as defined by a decrease of 3 CMS or more during a growth phase, was associated with significant increased risk for final <b>heights</b> <b>below</b> 0, - 6, and - 12 CMS. For children with subnormal growth during one, two, and three phases, the percentages for final <b>height</b> <b>below</b> - 12 CMS (a standard deviation score of approximately - 2) were 0. 5 %, 9. 4 %, and 75 %, respectively. Most children (57 / 62) with a final <b>height</b> <b>below</b> - 12 CMS had subnormal growth in two or three phases. Height gains during the four growth phases were interdependent. The infancy phase was negatively associated with fetal growth (r = - 0. 33, p < 0. 01); the childhood phase was positively associated with infancy growth (r = 0. 21, p < 0. 01); and the puberty phase was negatively associated with childhood growth (r = - 0. 10, p < 0. 01). link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Sedentary lifestyle {{can lead to the}} increasing energy storage as fat deposit and eventually can cause obesity. This study aimed to determine sedentary lifestyle as a risk factor stunted children on obesity in Semarang. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design with two groups, <b>height</b> <b>below</b> the median-obesity (TBBM-O) and <b>height</b> <b>below</b> the median-non obesity (TBBM-NO). Screening was done in 602 children aged 9 - 12 years in urban and suburban areas in Semarang. Measurement of sedentary lifestyle using Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C). Sedentary lifestyle was high if score ≥ 3 and low < 3. Prevalence ratio was obtained by using Chi-Square analysis. Results: The prevalence of stunted was 9. 4 % and stunted obesity was 0. 2 %. The sedentary lifestyle score on TBBM-O was higher (95 %) than TBBM-NO (80 %) with prevalence ratio = 4. 750 (CI = 0. 481 - 46. 906) and (p = 0. 151).

40|$|Early life {{stress is}} {{imprinting}} regulatory properties with life-long consequences. We investigated {{heart rate variability}} {{in a group of}} small children with <b>height</b> <b>below</b> the third percentile, who experienced an episode of early life stress due to heart failure or intra uterine growth retardation. These children appear to develop autonomic dysfunction in later life. Compared to the healthy control group heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced on average in a group of 101 children with short stature. Low HRV correlates to groups of children born small for gestational age (SGA), children with cardiac growth failure and children with congenital syndromes, but not to those with constitutional growth delay (CGD), who had normal HRV. Reduced HRV indicated by lower RMSSD and High Frequency (HF) -Power is indicating reduced vagal activity as a sign of autonomic imbalance. It is not short stature itself, but rather the underlying diseases that are the cause for reduced HRV in children with <b>height</b> <b>below</b> the third percentile. These high risk children-allocated in the groups with an adverse autonomic imprinting in utero or infancy (SGA, congenital heart disease and congenital syndromes) -have the highest risk for 'stress diseases' such as cardiovascular disease in later life.
