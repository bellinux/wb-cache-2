25|$|Tsonga's serve {{is one of}} his fastest, {{strongest and}} most {{dominant}} shots, mixing both slice and speed, so enabling him to create and win easier points, such as an ace or a one-two-punch. Because of the action of his serve, which is dramatically abbreviated, he does very well to create as much power as <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>with</b> speeds of up to 147mph (237km/h).|$|E
25|$|Unlike his {{previous}} tragedy Titus Andronicus, the play avoids graphic demonstrations of physical violence; only Richard and Clarence are shown being stabbed on-stage, {{while the rest}} (the two princes, Hastings, Brackenbury, Grey, Vaughan, Rivers, Anne, Buckingham, and King Edward) all meet their ends off-stage. Despite the villainous nature of the title character and the grim storyline, Shakespeare infuses the action with comic material, as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> most of his tragedies. Much of the humour rises from the dichotomy between how Richard's character is known and how Richard tries to appear.|$|E

25|$|Then, a {{rainstorm}} strikes the city, threatening {{to cancel the}} game for which Juror 7 has tickets. Juror 4 doubts the boy's alibi of being at the movies, {{because he could not}} recall it in much detail. Juror 8 tests how well Juror 4 remembers previous days, which <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>with</b> difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the boy, who was more than half a foot shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound found in the body. Next, Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see whether a shorter person could stab downwards on a taller person. The experiment proves the possibility, but Juror 5 steps up and demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade; revealing that anyone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would be, would always stab underhanded at an upwards angle against an opponent who was taller than they, as the grip of stabbing downwards would be too awkward and the act of changing hands too time-consuming.|$|E

500|$|Rogen had {{roles in}} Donnie Darko (2001) and [...] (2004). Abig career point {{for him was}} {{becoming}} {{a staff writer for}} Sacha Baron Cohen's last season of DaAli G Show in 2004. Along with the show's other writers, Rogen received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He became familiar to audiences as one of the main character's co-workers in Apatow's well-reviewed buddy comedy directorial debut feature The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005). Rogen also co-produced it and improvised all his dialogue. [...] " [...] hadn't done any screen work that indicated he could carry as memorable and convincing a performance as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> the character Cal," [...] MTV's John Constantine wrote. The Boston Globe reviewer Wesley Morris wrote that Rogen, along with co-stars Rudd and Romany Malco, were each hilarious in their own right and Orlando Sentinel Roger Moore believed that Rogen had his moments in the film whereas Moira Macdonald of the Seattle Times said the actor was [...] "droopily deadpan." [...] He followed this with a small role in You, Me and Dupree (2006), a critically panned comedy featuring Matt Dillon, Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson.|$|E
500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph {{stated that}} [...] "Wolverine is an {{artificial}} stimulus package {{of the most}} unsatisfying kind. Aggressively advertised and hyped to the hills, it will no doubt attract full houses at first; after that though, when word-of-mouth buzz-kill goes into overdrive, there’s bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned." [...] Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: [...] "There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying." [...] Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of [...] "D", noting that [...] "Wolverine was the lead character of [...] films, and we've already learned everything {{we need to know}} from the films in said franchise," [...] adding that [...] "the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting." [...] Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that [...] "how the hero acquired his special powers {{turns out to be a}} whole lot less interesting than what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> them", while also being [...] "a mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable), sub-par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing".|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Peter Travers {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out of four and {{particularly}} praised Johansson's performance, stating that she [...] "speaks Samantha in tones sweet, sexy, caring, manipulative and scary" [...] and that her [...] "vocal tour de force is award-worthy". He also went on to call Jonze [...] "a visionary". Richard Corliss of Time applauded Phoenix's performance, comparing his role to Sandra Bullock's in Gravity and Robert Redford's in All Is Lost: [...] "Phoenix must communicate his movie's meaning and feelings virtually on his own. That <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>with</b> subtle grace and depth. [...] Phoenix shows us what it's like when a mourning heart comes alive—because he loves Her." [...] Corliss cited HAL 9000 and S1m0ne as cinematic predecessors to Her and praised Johansson, calling her performance [...] "seductive and winning". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "a probing, inquisitive work of a very high order", although he expressed disappointment that the ending is more conventional {{than the rest of the}} film. McCarthy examined the premise of the story and suggested that the film's central virtual relationship was better than Ryan Gosling's character's relationship with a sex doll in Lars and the Real Girl. McCarthy compares the [...] "tender" [...] and [...] "vulnerable" [...] performance of Phoenix to his [...] "fearsome" [...] performance in The Master. He also praised Jonze's writing for its insights into what people want out of love and relationships, as well as the acting performances that [...] " [...] it all feel spontaneous and urgent".|$|E

[...] The video was positively received from critics, who considered it an enjoyable mini-action film.|$|E
2500|$|In {{parody of}} how people now think in modern terms, Ellis [...] "annoying" [...] lists [...] "the songs that are playing in the background, or even quoting them, as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> Oasis' [...] "Champagne Supernova"; in effect, the novel is {{provided}} with a movie soundtrack. As such, the book feels at times like a movie, and sometimes more specifically, a snuff film. New technology such as photo manipulation software (e.g. [...] "PhotoSoap for Windows 95") are featured in the novel. This creates an ironic situation in which Victor, the character obsessed by appearances, is haunted by fake images that appear real which implicate him in a murder; it becomes {{hard to tell what}} is real in the 'modern' world. As such, [...] "meaningful identity is obliterated"; this furthers the recurring joke from American Psycho wherein [...] "characters are always getting confused by their friends with other people, with no noticeable consequences".|$|E
2500|$|Songs About Fucking was {{released}} {{shortly after the}} band's breakup {{and went on to}} become their most successful record, with an initial pressing of eight thousand copies. Mark Deming of Allmusic calls it [...] "a scabrous masterpiece", while his colleague Andy Kellman states that [...] "each [...] is incisive enough to render a razor as effective as a butter knife. In sum: yowl, ching, thump-thump-screech. Ugly characters line up in the songs like early arrivals at a monster truck rally." [...] Critic Robert Christgau commented that [...] "Anybody who thinks rock and roll {{is alive and well in}} the infinite variety of its garage-boy permutations had better figure out how these Hitler Youth rejects could crush the competition and quit simultaneously. No matter what well-meaning rockers think of Steve Albini's supremacist lies, they lie themselves if they dismiss what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> electric guitars—that Killdozer sound culminates if not finishes off whole generations of punk and metal." [...] Albini himself later considered the album's first side as Big Black's best output.|$|E

2500|$|Andi Prendergast (played by Missy Peregrym in {{the series}} and Nikki Reed in the unaired pilot) is Sam's girlfriend and, for a time, manager. Initially unaware of Sam's Reaper duties, she is let down {{multiple}} times when Sam is called away from dates to capture souls. Chancing to see him on duty, Andi watches Sam behead an escaped soul from a distance, and initially threatens {{to go to the}} police. Sam is warned by the Devil to ensure she remains unaware of his activities, but eventually he receives permission to let her know what <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> <b>With</b> help from Sam's neighbor (and demon) Tony, {{as well as from the}} escaped soul at the time, Sam convinces Andi of his [...] "job". Andi reacts poorly, but eventually accepts Sam's fate and becomes his third assistant in hunting souls, though her assistance seems more focused on research rather than actual confrontation. In season 2, Andi was promoted to manager of the Work Bench when Ted was fired because of harassing a [...] "secret shopper". She was later demoted in [...] "My Brother's Reaper", for allowing the Work Bench to be used for a bachelor party.|$|E
2500|$|Similar acclaim {{was given}} to the five date Seaside Tour of coastal resorts in the south of England which Ant {{undertook}} on 17–22 June 2011. Local Cornish radio station The Source FM cheered 18 June 2011 Falmouth concert on its website: [...] "The audience goes wild. Adam stalks the stage, in control, he already knows he's got us ... he plays songs that a man in his mid fifties shouldn’t really get away with, but <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>with</b> dignity. Here's a man who still has something to say and manages to say it with 30 year old songs...Someone boos, Adam retaliates and we're with him. There’s nothing to boo here... Did that really just happen? Did Adam Ant really just blow us all away with the best gig of the year so far? I think he did." [...] The Seaside Tour served both as a follow-up to the main UK tour and a warm-up to Ant's appearance at Hard Rock Calling 2011 in Hyde Park on 26 June 2011, third on the bill to Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks before an audience of 45,000. The festival's official website lauded his performance, reporting that [...] "Adam Ant returned to London in tip-top shape this afternoon on the Main Stage in Hyde Park ...he left the stage to rapturous applause and cheers, leaving no question as to who was the real Prince Charming this weekend." ...|$|E
