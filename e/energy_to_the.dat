5|$|After {{the five}} heroine's routes are completed, the story shifts to a setting amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where Kotarou {{encounters}} Kagari {{in a world}} after re-evolution, still on the Moon. Kotarou {{at this point is}} a unified entity of all the Kotarous from all timelines where humanity was destroyed and he has memories of these events. The Moon's Kagari is trying to research a way so the Earth and humanity are not destroyed, and Kotarou attempts to buy her time while fighting a hoard of familiars summoned by Sakura Kashima of Gaia whose resolve is to annihilate humanity by killing Kagari. Kotarou and the entire cast rejoin together to protect Kagari, who manages to finish her plan to allow the Earth and humanity to coexist by sending the Moon's life force back to Earth. In the past, the Earth had sent this <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon so life could continue. There is just enough energy and resources left for a final re-evolution.|$|E
5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E

5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E

His work on it gave Jones the foresight to pitch another show he knew the network would want. Initially unsure if {{he was ready to}} pitch AJ's Infinite Summer, the network rejected the pilot the first time he did but approved it on the second, after he had reworked it throughout a few months. Jones contrasted the physical limitations of animating in time and <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> animation of the pilot itself. He cited having the character of AJ run up a wall in one scene as an example of this.|$|E

Posted to The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada as a private soldier, Mercer devoted much time and <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unit and became an excellent soldier and first-rate shot. Mercer rose steadily {{through the ranks of}} the militia, being made an officer in 1885 and a captain in 1891. In 1903 as a brevet major, Mercer led a company to Sault Ste. Marie to calm a riot by striking dock workers, his only deployment before 1914. In 1911, Mercer was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the regiment and in 1913, Mercer was aide-de-camp to Defence Minister Sam Hughes during a military tour of Europe, during which he inspected the German army first-hand and became convinced that war was imminent.|$|E
5|$|On {{the death}} in office of Governor Sir James Harrison in 1971, Dunstan finally {{had the chance}} to appoint the {{governor}} of his choosing: Sir Mark Oliphant, a physicist who had worked on the Manhattan Project. Dunstan had never been happy that governors were usually British ex-servicemen; it was a personal goal of his to see an active and notable South Australian take on the role. Although the post was ceremonial, Oliphant brought <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> role, and he used his stature to decry damage to the environment caused by deforestation, excessive open-cut mining and pollution. Oliphant's tenure was successful and held in high regard, although he did come into conflict with the premier at times as both men were outspoken and strong-willed.|$|E
5|$|The War Department envisaged {{that the}} Manhattan Project would be {{superseded}} by a statutory authority. Legislation {{to create it}} was drafted by two War Department lawyers, Kenneth C. Royall and William L. Marbury. Their draft bill ran into strong opposition, particularly from the influential Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control. Section 10 assigned the patent for any invention related to atomic <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commission.|$|E

5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} working {{very much in the}} shadow of Tennyson, {{producing}} weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work in this vein into {{the early years of the}} 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network in the 19th century, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen, {{and by the end of}} the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. Among the largest private sector employers today are the IT firm BEC (Bankernes EDB Central) and GPI (Glim Plastic Industri), specializing in plastics. The Risø research facility is also becoming a major employer, extending interest in sustainable <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clean technology sphere. The local university, founded in 1972, the historic Cathedral School, and the Danish Meat Trade College, established in 1964, are educational institutions of note. Roskilde has a large local hospital which has been expanded and modernized since it was opened in 1855. It is now increasingly active in the research sphere. The Sankt Hans psychiatric hospital serves the Capital Region with specialized facilities for forensic psychiatry.|$|E

A deeply patriotic work, Cain compares Bulgaria's impending attack on Serbia to the Biblical story of Cain jealously murdering his brother Abel. Upon capturing Niš, the Bulgarians burned every copy of the poem, {{and the only one}} that survived was the one that Bojić carried with him out of the city. Upon leaving Niš, Bojić and his brother Radivoje joined the Serbian Army in its retreat to the Adriatic coast. Their sisters and infant brother went to live with a cousin in occupied Kraljevo. The Bojić brothers' journey took them through Kuršumlija, Mitrovica, Pristina, Prizren, Đakovica, Dečani and Peć, from where they continued to Andrijevica and Podgorica. The two intended to join retreating Montenegrin Army columns and head on to Scutari, where they hoped that Allied ships would evacuate them and other Serbian troops to Italy.|$|E

5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point that they participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ {{and the fact that it}} comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E
5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} Fasciculus Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication was The Way to Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E
