5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was not}} herself, her mother took her to a physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed by the <b>hospital</b> <b>chaplain,</b> Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{that a lot of}} the characters and indeed the town are based on Pemberton's home town of Chorley, with Royston Vasey based on Adlington, a village within Chorley Borough. The character of Herr Lipp is believed to be based on a <b>hospital</b> <b>chaplain</b> Steve Pemberton encountered after suffering a heart attack in Germany and Pauline is primarily based on a restart officer of Reece Shearsmith's. Similarly, Ollie Plimsolls is based on a community theatre actor that Shearsmith had worked with. In the DVD commentary on the second series, Pemberton and Shearsmith state that Papa Lazarou's speech patterns are based on their former landlord, who would phone their flat and insist on speaking only to Steve. Gatiss has said in interview that the local shop was inspired by a shop in the village of Rottingdean and that he was influenced growing up around the former Winterton Hospital asylum near Sedgefield.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} {{importance}} of a multi-disciplinary consideration of religious experience for the training and ministry of <b>hospital</b> <b>chaplains</b> and spiritual directors. The author, a lay Roman Catholic chaplain in a Massachusetts community hospital, discusses selected literature relevant to the study of religious experience—drawing predominantly from texts in spirituality studies and also illustrative works in pastoral care and literature—in dialogue with a concrete context of hospital chaplaincy. This sketch aims to identify important insights about religious experience and begin to demonstrate how multi-disciplinary study of religious experience can enrich the training and practice of <b>hospital</b> <b>chaplains</b> and spiritual directors...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] An {{exploratory}} {{study of the}} attitudes of hospital patients to the service provided by <b>hospital</b> <b>chaplains.</b> DESIGN [...] Questionnaire study of hospital inpatients in December 1992. SETTING [...] One large teaching hospital in London. PATIENTS [...] 180 hospital inpatients in 14 different general wards, 168 (93 %) of whom agreed to take part. MAIN MEASURES [...] Attitudes to chaplains and their role contained in 12 questions developed during a pilot study on hospital inpatients (16) and staff (14) and their relation to patients' age, sex, length of hospital stay, and religious beliefs, according to Kendall rank order correlations. RESULTS [...] Of 168 (93 %) respondents, 72 (43 %) were women; mean age of patients was 63. 1 (SD 16. 8) years. Forty five (27 %) were inpatients of three days or less and 22 (13 %) for one month or more. 136 (81 %) were Christian; 17 (10 %) atheist, agnostic, or had no religion; and 15 (9 %) were of other religions. In general, patients showed positive attitudes towards the role of <b>hospital</b> <b>chaplains</b> and to the services they provided. The correlation analysis showed {{that there was a}} significant tendency for older patients, those who had been inpatients for longer, and those with religious beliefs to be more sympathetic to the role of <b>hospital</b> <b>chaplains.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Hospital</b> <b>chaplains</b> provide a service which is appreciated by patients. This study provides a simple instrument for assessing patients' attitudes to chaplains...|$|R

5000|$|Before {{starting}} work, Westberg {{took six}} months to prepare himself. Like most ministers, Westberg's education had been highly theoretical and classroom-based with little help in developing needed practical skills, such as counseling. So Westberg took hands-on courses with pioneers in the new field of clinical pastoral education, such as Anton Boisen at Elgin State Hospital and Rollin Fairbanks at Massachusetts General Hospital. Russell Dicks, who with physician, Richard Cabot, had written the important book, The Art of Ministering to the Sick, [...] had recently moved to Chicago. Dicks, who was chaplain at a nearby hospital, was Westberg's mentor and quickly became his collaborator and friend. At their hospitals, Dicks and Westberg created popular, intensive courses in pastoral care for ordained ministers, chaplains, and seminarians. Both were part of creating organizations, such as the Association of Protestant <b>Hospital</b> <b>Chaplains</b> (later called the College of Chaplains) that set standards and accreditation policies for <b>hospital</b> <b>chaplains.</b>|$|R
