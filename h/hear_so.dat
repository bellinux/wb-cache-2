Wilson-Claridge was intrigued by his sets, and when he discovered that James was playing tapes of his own music he suggested that they make records. At first, putting Aphex Twin’s recordings on vinyl {{was a way of}} making music the duo's friends wanted to hear; because of their geographic isolation they could not access the music they wanted to <b>hear,</b> <b>so</b> they decided to create their own.|$|E

Ouspensky was reluctant, but after his death (October 1947), his widow advised his remaining pupils to see Gurdjieff in Paris. J. G. Bennett also visited from England, the first meeting for 25 years. Ouspensky's pupils in England had all thought that Gurdjieff was dead. They discovered he was alive only {{after the death of}} Ouspensky, who had not told them that Gurdjieff was still living. They were overjoyed to <b>hear</b> <b>so,</b> and many of Ouspensky's pupils including Rina Hands, Basil Tilley and Catherine Murphy visited Gurdjieff in Paris. Hands and Murphy worked on the typing and retyping of the forthcoming book All and Everything.|$|E
500|$|The Field Spaniel was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel. Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised; {{one of the first}} breeders of the Field Spaniel, Thomas Jacobs, said of the origin; [...] "Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type, and frequent missiles have at me and my dogs from behind the hedge. But where is the pure bred black spaniel we <b>hear</b> <b>so</b> much about? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one (if there ever was one!) has not been forthcoming. Like most sporting dogs, they are the result of different crosses." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Scott-Heron {{received}} top-billing for the release, Jamie xx worked {{solely on}} the remix project. For We're New Here, he remixed 13 of the original album's 15 songs, including its [...] "interlude" [...] cuts, mixing Scott-Heron's vocal tracks from the original recording sessions over his own beats and instrumentals, rather than the original music. Many of the remixes were created by Jamie xx on his laptop, while on tour with The xx. In a March2010 interview, {{he said that the}} label [...] "gave me the parts and let me do whatever I want, so I've been doing it on my laptop on tour. [...] only using [...] vocals, I'm not using any of the original music from it, which is very freeing". On his intentions for the album's music, he explained in an interview for The Irish Times, [...] "I wanted it to sound like everything I had been listening to in London. I wanted it to sound like something you’d hear on pirate radio. You <b>hear</b> <b>so</b> many different genres, and it’s all so convoluted and mixed-up, but it makes sense when you turn on the station".|$|E
500|$|Aspects of Nelson's {{life and}} career were controversial, both during his {{lifetime}} and after his death. His affair with Emma Hamilton was widely remarked upon and disapproved of, {{to the extent that}} Emma was denied permission to attend Nelson's funeral and was subsequently ignored by the government, which awarded money and titles to Nelson's legitimate family. Nelson's actions during the reoccupation of Naples have also been the subject of debate: his approval of the wave of reprisals against the Jacobins who had surrendered under the terms agreed by Cardinal Ruffo, and his personal intervention in securing the execution of Caracciolo, are considered by some biographers, such as Robert Southey, to have been a shameful breach of honour. Prominent contemporary politician Charles James Fox was among those who attacked Nelson for his actions at Naples, declaring in the House of Commons I wish that the atrocities of which we <b>hear</b> <b>so</b> much and which I abhor as much as any man, were indeed unexampled. I fear that they do not belong exclusively to the French– Naples for instance has been what is called [...] "delivered", and yet, if I am rightly informed, it has been stained and polluted by murders so ferocious, and by cruelties of every kind so abhorrent, that the heart shudders at the recital... demanded that a British officer should be brought forward, and to him they capitulated. They made terms with him under the sanction of the British name. Before they sailed their property was confiscated, numbers were thrown into dungeons, and some of them, I understand, notwithstanding the British guarantee, were actually executed. Other pro-republican writers produced books and pamphlets decrying the events in Naples as atrocities. Later assessments, including one by Andrew Lambert, have stressed that the armistice had not been authorised by the King of Naples, and that the retribution meted out by the Neapolitans was not unusual for the time. Lambert also suggests that Nelson in fact acted {{to put an end to}} the bloodshed, using his ships and men to restore order in the city.|$|E
500|$|There {{were several}} reasons the tournament went so badly for El Salvador. First of all, El Salvador took 20 players to the World Cup, leaving behind Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel González. According to Luis Guevara Mora, goalkeeper {{of the team}} by that time, the Salvadoran Football Federation decided to take members of the Federation, {{as well as the}} friends and family of many members of the Federation, and spent so much money they couldn't afford to bring a full 22-man squad. Some fellow players tried to gather money to pay to bring their {{teammates}} but couldn't get enough. Further heightening controversy, the team took many detours and stops throughout Europe {{under the direction of the}} Federation, taking 3 days to arrive in Spain and were the last team to do so. Once arrived, there was more trouble. Adidas sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player, but mysteriously only three white and one blue arrived. The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association. They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, someone stole the balls that the team would train with. The day prior to the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them and trained with them while El Salvador had none and was unable to train. To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play. The only knowledge that they had about the team was a lone outdated video that they had bought. On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by Francisco Jovel's sudden deafness. Jovel had received a heavy blow on the cheek and almost could not <b>hear.</b> <b>So</b> when Guevara Mora cried off to stop a ball, the defender did not hear him. Mora attempted to pass to Jovel, but Jovel wasn't looking and the ball went past him and went straight in front of the net. The Hungarian player only had to tap it in. After the match, the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation. The coach was dismissed immediately and the following matches against Belgium and Argentina were managed by players Jovel, Huezo and Fagoaga. Although the tournament overall was a big disappointment, there were also several bright spots. Jorge [...] "Mágico" [...] González was considered by the national and international press as the best player. [...] "Mágico" [...] González stayed in Spain after the tournament and played for Cádiz CF and Real Valladolid. Ricardo Guevara Mora, the goalkeeper, was the youngest player to play at the 1982 FIFA World Cup at 20 years old.|$|E

Everybody listens to music and knows about it. I think that the lyrics can {{have a lot to}} do with influencing whoever you're singing to. I think that as far as children are concerned, parents should have control over what they listen to. If they don't want them to listen to records that are very sexual or explicit or outrageous, they should have control over that situation. As for adults, they're going to buy whatever kind of music they want to <b>hear,</b> <b>so</b> if they buy music with explicit lyrics, they must like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a child, {{he loved}} {{television}} and {{was fascinated by}} his parents' 8 mm film home movie camera. Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV watcher. [...] "You <b>hear</b> <b>so</b> much about the problems with television," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that it saved my life." [...] Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned {{of the existence of}} film schools on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After seeing Bonnie and Clyde with his father and being heavily influenced by it, Zemeckis decided that {{he wanted to go to}} film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible. My parents would sit there and say, 'Don't you see where you come from? You can't be a movie director.' I guess maybe some of it I felt I had to do in spite of them, too." ...|$|E

Likewise as {{with the previous}} tour, Ant completed the entire schedule and to further hugely positive reviews. [...] The Irish Evening Herald praised his concert of 25 November at Dublin's Vicar Street venue: [...] "He ain't like other performers, this guy. One drum kit could never be {{good enough for the}} likes of Stuart Leslie Goddard ... Plastic Surgery? A terrific opener. Stand and Deliver? Even better now than it was then. Prince Charming? Terrific, as always. And hey, that Marc Bolan tribute at the end more than sealed the deal ... {{there was no time for}} chit chat. [...] Which, incidentally, pretty much sums up Adam's live performance these days: no chit chat and no messing about. A straight-up display of raw, often deafening post-punk, Adam's way of keeping the crowd happy is to play as many tunes as possible. [...] He's well aware of what the people came to <b>hear,</b> <b>so</b> he gives it to them. Better still, his voice remains in fine shape. Oh, and as for the 'Posse'? Let's just say that 'The Good, The Mad and The Lovely' is a more than suitable moniker.". The Southern Daily Echo heaped similar adulation upon the concert of 18 November 2011 at Eastleigh's Concorde Club: [...] "Adam Ant, along with his backing band of The Good, the Mad and the Lovely possee, showed he can still rock, even in his mid-50s now. We wanted to hear the greatest hits, and Adam duly delivered ... The crowd lapped it all up ... It was a brilliant evening." ...|$|E
