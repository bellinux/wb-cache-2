In this paper we analyze the job creation potential of social service–delivery sectors-early childhood development and home-based health care-as compared to other proposed alternatives in infrastructure construction and energy.

The second finding is that these jobs are more effective in reaching disadvantaged workers-those from poor households and with lower levels of educational attainment. Job creation in these sectors can easily be rolled out. States already have mechanisms and implementation capacity in place.

40|$|From a {{theoretical}} {{point of view}} {{active labour market policy}} may improve labour market outcomes. It consists of the types of measures that seem to be suited to deal with the labour market imperfections causing unemployment. However, {{for a number of reasons}} the effects are often relatively poor in practice. One reason is that publicly subsidized employment services may lead to crowding-out of private employment services. Another reason might be that the government is unable to organize implementation efficiently. However, there are no obvious alternatives that are likely to produce better results. OECD data on ALMP expenditure shows that the structure of ALMP expenditure has changed between 1991 and 2003.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} active labour market policies (ALMP) in improving labour market outcomes, especially of low-skilled individuals. The empirical analysis consists of an aggregate impact approach based on a pooled cross country and time-series database for 31 advanced countries during the period 1985 – 2010. A novelty of the paper is that the analysis includes aspects of the delivery system {{to see how the}} performance of ALMP is affected by different implementation characteristics. Among the notable results, the paper finds that ALMP matters at the aggregate level. Training, employment incentives, supported employment and direct <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>measures</b> show the most favourable results, both, in terms of reduced unemployment, but also in terms of increased employment and participation. Interestingly, start-up incentives are more effective in reducing unemployment than other ALMP policies. Moreover, the positive effects seem to be particularly beneficial for the low-skilled. In terms of implementation, the paper finds that the most favourable aspect is the allocation of resources to programme administration. Finally, a disruption of policy continuity is associated with negative effects for all labour market variables analysed. ...|$|E
40|$|While many {{previous}} studies on temporary work have found disadvantages for temporary workers {{as compared to}} workers with a permanent contract, this study compares temporary work to the alternative of unemployment. Specifically, this paper investigates the potential integrative power of taking up a temporary job for unemployed workers {{as compared to the}} counterfactual situation of remaining unemployed and searching for another job. Applying a dynamic propensity-score matching approach based on British, (West and East) German, and Swiss panel data during the period of 1991 - 2009, it is shown that taking up a temporary job increases the employment chances during the subsequent five years in (West and East) Germany and the UK. Moreover, the chances of having a permanent contract remain higher and a persistent wage premium can be found during the subsequent five years of the career. Advantages of taking up a temporary job are slightly stronger in West Germany compared to East Germany, where temporary contracts are often based on public <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>measures</b> with limited integration potential.

Start-up incentives and {{the cluster of}} policies aimed for the most vulnerable (job rotation, supported employment and direct <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>measures)</b> show the most favourable results, {{both in terms of}} reducing unemployment and also in terms of increasing employment. They are also effective in raising participation, but only for the low skilled. Spending in employment incentives is also effective across the board, again with the exception of raising participation for the overall group, where the effect is not statistically significant. Importantly, results show that ALMPs are more effective for the low skilled than for the overall population; something that is noteworthy as we know little from the existing literature on the net effects on these policies on low-skilled individuals. Training, in contrast, seems to be effective mostly for the overall population; however, it has also positive effects for the low skilled through the interaction with implementation variables. In terms of implementation, the analysis finds that the allocation of resources to programme administration has favourable effects and that a disruption of policy continuity is associated with negative effects for all labour market variables analysed. Interestingly, the size of the coefficients arising from policy and implementation variables, once interactions are included, is noticeably higher, demonstrating that a correct implementation of policies enhances their beneficial effect.|$|E

Here, we conducted an experimental study to support the hypotheses that acquisition of sustainability {{information and}} use of decision support methods consistently construct preferences for renewable power generation technologies that use solar power, wind power, small-scale hydroelectric power, geothermal power, wood biomass, or biogas as energy sources. The sustainability information was prepared using a renewable energy-focused input-output model of Japan and contained life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, electricity generation costs, and <b>job</b> <b>creation.</b> We <b>measured</b> rank-ordered preferences in the following four steps in experimental workshops conducted for municipal officials: provision of (1) energy-source names; (2) sustainability information; (3) additional explanation of public value; and (4) knowledge and techniques about multi-attribute value functions. The degree of changes in preference orders was evaluated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. The consistency of rank-ordered preferences among participants was determined by using the maximum eigenvalue for the coefficient matrix. The results show: (1) the individual preferences evolved drastically in response to the sustainability information and the decision support method; and (2) the rank-ordered preferences were more consistent during the preference construction processes.

40|$|Economists {{have long}} been {{interested}} in the determinants and components of <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> and destruction. In many countries administrative datasets provide an excellent source for detailed analysis on a fine and disaggregate level. However, administrative datasets are not without problems: restructuring and relabeling of firms is often poorly measured and can potentially create large biases. We provide evidence {{of the extent of}} this bias and provide a new solution to deal with it using the German Establishment History Panel (BHP). While previous research has relied on the first and last appearance of the establishment identifier (EID) to identify openings and closings, we improve on this approach using a new dataset containing all worker flows between establishments in Germany. This allows us to credibly identify establishment births and deaths from 1975 to 2004. We show that the misclassification bias of using only the EID is very severe: Only about 35 to 40 percent of new and disappearing EIDs with more than 3 employees correspond unambiguously to real establishment entries and exits. Among larger establishments misclassification is even more common. We show that many new establishment IDs appear to be 'Spin-Offs' and these have become increasingly more common over time. We then demonstrate that using only EID entries and exits may dramatically overstate, by as much as 100 percent, the role of establishment turnover for <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> and destruction. Furthermore correcting <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> and destruction <b>measures</b> for spurious EID entries and exits reduces these measures and aligns them closer with the business cycle.

The interventions of the French state in industrial relations affect many areas which are regulated in other European countries by means of contracts between the two sides of industry. This report selects two particularly current areas, these are the introduc-tion of the 35 -hour working week and the subsidisation of certain employment profiles, in par-ticular the arrangement of jobs for young unemployed people. The French government, which favours the redistribution of labour more than deregulation in order to combat unemployment, is reducing the statutory working week for companies with more than 20 employees to 35 hours a week as from January 2000. This measure, which is accompanied by substantial financial support, is regarded as an essential stimulus to promote negotiations at industry or company level. Although the attitude of the public and the two sides of industry towards the 35 -hour working week is somewhere between hesitant and negative, the <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>measures</b> for problem groups, in particular the creation of 35, 000 jobs for young jobseekers in the public service is regarded more with approval, as French society sees it as the task of the state to protect its weaker members.

Vocational rehabilitation for people with disabilities is supporting the restoring of labour market inclusion and to ensure it in the long run. But the effects of vocational rehabilitation on labour market integration for people with disabilities are relatively unknown. Contrary to evaluation in the field of medical rehabilitation there is only marginal research here. That applies to participation in measurements or appraisal of the rehabilitants as well as occupational integration after measurements. This article aims to fill in the blank. A survey of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) is used that covers data on vocational rehabilitants with disabilities, who completed a measurement within the German Federal Employment Agency in the year 2006. Thereby the article is focusing on three main measurement groups: 'orientation and training', 'further training and qualification' and 'job creation measures'. The probability of participating on one of these measures is depending on several factors: Age, schooling, vocational education and cumulated unemployment duration as well as regional employment situation. The cumulate duration of illness and the point in time when the disability occurred are also important. Due to their disability the participants appraise their personal benefit differently, regarding on occupational capability or strategies to cope with their disability: Further training and qualification are rated positively, orientation and training are valued more reluctantly and <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>measures</b> were rated lowest. Six months after the measurement the risk of unemployment is higher for those with no school leaving certificate or longer periods of unemployment duration. Besides this, regional aspects play a significant role. Gainful employment is depending on the point in time when disability occurred: rehabilitants whose disability occurred in younger adulthood have a higher chance to be in employment than those with congenital diseases. Living in urban regions and having been employed at least once before rehabilitation also helps getting employed again.

40|$|Over 400 {{employment}} {{companies are}} presently operating in eastern Germany. They were founded to influence socially acceptable employment reductions {{brought about by}} transformation process and to provide support {{for the creation of}} new jobs. After a blanket agreement between the Treuhandanstalt (THA), employers' associations, unions and the eastern German states in July of 1991, they in many cases received the programatic name 'company for employment promotion, employment and structural development (ABS) '. They were widely networked with each other via supporting bodies, which had primarily been given service and counseling tasks, and supplemented by so-called municipal employment companies. At the beginning of 1995 approximately 150, 000 employees were employed, primarily with funds from the AFG (Employment Promotion Act). This was an increase of around 25 % in comparison to the previous year. A slight decrease in employment {{during the first half of}} 1995 could be an indication of a trend change. Regular quarterly surveys of the supporting bodies by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) show that full-time qualification measures hardly play a role anymore in the companies. The expansion of employment is primarily the result of an increase in <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>measures</b> (which often contain qualification measures of up to 20 % of work time). In conjunction with the measures pursuant to § 249 h AFG, over 90 % of all employment contracts in the companies can be attributed to these two categories of support. Almost half of all the participants affected by these measures are employed in employment companies in eastern Germany. However, huge differences exist between the individual states. Based on the surveys of the supporting bodies, further information on the quantitative employment development in the ABS companies is described. On the basis of results from more recent case studies this information was expanded by the description of current problems. Accordingly, it can be expected that finance problems in particular will be augmented in 1996. Employment companies have contributed decisively to absorbing the shock of job layoffs. Assessments differ in regard to the effectiveness of structural policy. They are considered to be encouraging signs of hope and in many regions as an indispensable element of the infrastructure of labour market policy. The development, function and functional transformation as well as the problems linked with the employment companies should continue to be researched.

To increase the growth and development of the country, the importance of SMEs in the region can not be ignored. SMEs development is the process of gradually becoming a major driving force of the global economy. With the help of SMEs introduction, Pakistan’s economy continues to post an impressive growth rate for the last few years. From this recent growth, SMEs has been declared an engine of the economic growth of the country. Sustainable economic development plays a pivotal role in bringing about prosperity and reducing poverty. Small and Medium Enterprises are often found at the heart of local and regional economies. Enterprises create jobs, wealth and feel good factor for local communities, encouraging further investment. Greater relevance must be given to the role that small and medium enterprises can play in generating wealth and eradicating poverty. Communities are responsible themselves for identifying the need for SMEs growth and skill development training. The culture of enterprise development exists with the objectives set against a number of performance indicators namely, enhanced business and technical skills, good govern improved access to product markets, reliable taxation structure and finally access to credit facilities to support business initiatives and support by local government is a symbol of their commitment to local development and empowerment. Pakistan being a developing country needs attention in most of the potential areas, where efforts have been made from the last few decades. SMEs are the backbone of Pakistan’s economy. It’s represent 901 per cent of all enterprises in the country, providing millions of jobs and is essential source for entrepreneurial spirit and innovation.

But this region has a fertile approach for SMEs establishments. NWFP possesses a potential structure for promoting SMEs sector, so as to bring at par with other provinces of the country. For this purpose proper strategic planning is needed. The research conducted in this field highlights number of problems and the status of SMEs in the region. This study has examines the present structure of SMEs and its problems through primary and secondary data collected. Further, the study gives the possible direction for evaluating the prospects of SMEs in the region. These problems are pushed with a sustainable recommendation for future development. SMEs are the most sensitive of all to changes in the business environment. They are the first to suffer if weighed down with excessive number of bureaucracy. They are first to flourish from initiatives to cut down red tapeism and reward success system. SMEs must be considered as a main driver of innovation, employment, poverty reduction and social integration. This research study having a theoretical background for determining different hypotheses, in the name of i. e. failure of SMEs is the result of lack of managerial knowledge, marketing effectiveness leads to the success of SMEs, Ineffective HRD is the basic cause of SMEs failure, non-availability of legal framework is a problem for SMEs, in-sufficient financial support is another setback for SMEs and finally, lack of communication with the venders. These hypotheses were tested in the light of information collected by a written questionnaire distributed among different business units in the region. Then these responses were analyzed by using different statistical tools like frequency distribution, Chi-Square, Cross Correlation and ANOVA techniques, to obtain the desired results for the support of the problems faced by the SMEs sector in the region. The results obtained from the different analysis regarding the various problems in the realm of SMEs are in the command of an ordinary entrepreneurs in the region, while some of the problems not come in the direct command of the entrepreneur that need facilitation from the government. The problems faced by SMEs are conformed by the results obtained from data regarding them are the following: Depending on the old and cultural style management in SMEs region is the basic root cause of backwardness. Lack of marketing techniques and its adjustment with the current change in the market is another flaw on the part of SMEs, where they can not afford these commercial expenditures. HR application in SMEs are not of acquired standard nor sufficient to meet the requirement of the sector. Legality and growth of SMEs rotate around the Government legal structure enforceability in the region. Funds are the life blood of SMEs, if it is properly managed. Lack of funding and access to the source of funding is the basic issues for SMEs development.

There also seems to be a positive indirect effect on <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> in domestically owned firms, presumably caused by spillovers...|$|R

(2011) show that {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) tend {{to be the most important}} contributors to net <b>job</b> <b>creation.</b> By contrast, Haltiwanger et al. (2013) highlight the important role of business start-ups and young firms for <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> in the USA. Huber et al.

In this paper we formulate an empirical equation for net <b>job</b> <b>creation,</b> which encompasses search-matching theory and a standard labor demand model.

We contrast the gradualist Czech and the rapid Estonian approach {{to the destruction of}} the communist economy and assess their experience in light of selected theories of reallocation with frictions. We find that gradual job destruction combined with <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> support allows extensive reallocation to concur with low unemployment. Drastic job destruction, on the other hand, need not slow down <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> as long as unemployment benefits are kept very low. <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> <b>job</b> destruction transition Czech Republic Estonia Eastern Europe...|$|R
