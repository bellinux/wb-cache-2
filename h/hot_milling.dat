40|$|Abstract — In this article, {{a robust}} <b>hot</b> strip <b>mill</b> {{steering}} control is proposed {{in order to}} guarantee the system stability and to improve its performances. The rolling process consists in crushing a metal strip between some rolls for obtaining a product with constant and desired thickness. The quality of the rolled products {{and the safety of}} the production process are linked to the lateral movement of the strip in the line. Then, the main task of the steering control consists in reducing this displacement. A <b>hot</b> strip <b>mill</b> treats products with very different characteristics. Then, the products are divided into several families, with reference to their physical characteristics, and the stabilisation problem is formulated as a convex problem. Finally, for each family, a different robust controller is designed.
