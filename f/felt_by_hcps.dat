30|$|This study {{achieved}} {{its main}} objective of evolving {{an understanding of}} how HCPs perceive ethics and ethical challenges, and the impact that these issues have on them. Understanding moral distress as related <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> is the first step to understanding how the negative reactions can be alleviated. Being able to identify the ethical challenges experienced <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> and the impact they feel from them will assist organizations to plan suitable frameworks for training and guidance in ethical challenges. This will offer improved support for their HCPs and in turn improve public healthcare provision in the time of HCs. However, first humanitarian aid organizations must recognize the role they play in creating issues surrounding ethical decision making, in order to ever be able to fully support their workers. To build on this study, the next step would be to discuss these issues with a larger cohort of participants in order to gain an understanding of a wider range of experiences and perceptions in these topics.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Electronic {{documentation}} handling {{may facilitate}} information flows {{in health care}} settings to support better coordination of care among Health Care Providers (HCPs), but evidence is limited. Methods that accurately depict changes to the workflows of HCPs are needed to assess whether {{the introduction of a}} Critical Care clinical Information System (CCIS) to two Intensive Care Units (ICUs) represents a positive step for patient care. To evaluate a previously described method of quantifying amounts of time spent and interruptions encountered <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> working in two ICUs. Methods Observers used PDAs running the Work Observation Method By Activity Timing (WOMBAT) software to record the tasks performed <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> in advance of the introduction of a Critical Care clinical Information System (CCIS) to quantify amounts of time spent on tasks and interruptions encountered <b>by</b> <b>HCPs</b> in ICUs. Results We report the percentages of time spent on each task category, and the rates of interruptions observed for physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and unit clerks. Compared with previously published data from Australian hospital wards, interdisciplinary information sharing and communication in ICUs explain higher proportions of time spent on professional communication and documentation by nurses and physicians, as well as more frequent interruptions which are often followed by professional communication tasks. Conclusions Critical care workloads include requirements for timely information sharing and communication and explain the differences we observed between the two datasets. The data presented here further validate the WOMBAT method, and support plans to compare workflows before and after the introduction of electronic documentation methods in ICUs. </p...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundEffective case {{management}} of malaria requires prompt {{diagnosis and treatment}} within 24 hours. Home-based management of malaria (HMM) improves access to treatment for populations with limited access to health facilities. In Senegal, an HMM pilot study in 2008 demonstrated the feasibility of integrated use of RDTs and ACT in remote villages by volunteer Home Care Providers (HCP). Scale-up of the strategy began in 2009, reaching 408 villages in 2009 and 861 villages in 2010.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{perceptions}} of multidisciplinary health care professionals (HCPs) and patients of the pharmaceutical care issues (PCIs) relating to rheumatoid arthritis (RA.). Design: Qualitative study using semistructured one to one interviews and focus groups to explore patient perceptions. Interviews and focus groups were taped and transcribed verbatim, then described and coded for meaning to produce 'invivo' codes, which were then grouped to form themes. Nominal group methodology was used to generate and rank a list of HCP perceptions of the key PCIs of RA patients. The PCIs were ranked according to clinical importance and order of occurrence from admission as perceived <b>by</b> the <b>HCP</b> group. Setting: Rheumatology ward and outpatient clinic in a teaching hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Generation and ranking of PCIs, generation of themes from patient interviews. Results: Optimisation of pain control was identified by the nominal group as being the primary aim for patients on admission and was also the most commonly described symptom by patients. Two PCIs not predicted by the HCPs' nominal group was the frequency of infections and the associated discharge and patients described experiencing 'overeducation' <b>by</b> <b>HCPs,</b> {{which could lead to}} anxiety. Complementary medicine in conjunction with traditional therapy was raised as a significant health benefit by patients. Conclusion: Many patients' views mirrored the PCIs identified <b>by</b> <b>HCPs,</b> but some were not anticipated; the value of patient interviews to ensure appropriate service development was demonstrated. Several PCIs emerged for future incorporation by the multidisciplinary team into standardised models of pharmaceutical care for use in secondary care and at the secondary/primary care interface for improvement of seamless care. There is a need to target educational interventions and to identify those who will benefit from advice on complementary medicine. Further work is required to develop a tool to identify the educational needs of RA patients and targeting of the information provided. This will help ensure the delivery of pharmaceutical care is designed to match the needs of individual patients...|$|R
