In this study, we tested the feasibility of applying Arnetz and colleagues’ resilience promotion training that was developed for patrol officers to SWAT team officers (n = 18). The resilience promotion training program included psychoeducation focused on police stress and resilience, {{and the practice of}} resilience promotion techniques (controlled breathing and imagery) while listening to audio-recorded critical <b>incident</b> <b>scenarios.</b> The aims of this study were to (a) examine if a resilience training program was relevant and accepted by SWAT team officers and (b) assess participants’ physiological stress responses (heart rate, respiration) during the resilience training sessions to note if there were improvements in stress responding over time. Our findings revealed that participants were able to significantly reduce their average heart rate and improve their ability to engage in controlled respiration (i. e., breathing) during simulated critical incidents {{over the course of the}} 5 -day training. Improvements in stress responding were observed even when the critical <b>incident</b> <b>scenarios</b> became more graphic.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Safety {{issues are}} usually of primary {{importance}} in industries as accidents can have extremely severe {{consequences for the}} human, environment and the property. To provide a safe and efficient operation of an industrial complex, some demands should be fulfilled. These are: 1. Hazards and <b>incident</b> <b>scenarios</b> should be identified and eliminated, 2. Protective tools should be designed to minimise {{the effect of the}} accident, 3. Operators and personnel should be trained, and 4. A more effective rescue organisation should be provided. In this study which is focused on the first demands a safety model is presented to assess the risks in industry and minimise them to an acceptable level by applying an analytical procedure at semi quantitative level. It was found from the literature that analytical method accompanied by risk ranking matrix could be capable to identify the <b>incident</b> <b>scenarios</b> and level of risk in relation with each scenario. The reduction of the risk level could be achieved by providing appropriate safeguards and control. These efforts should be performed in the frame of a system safety. Copyright © SHO 200...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Post {{incident}} {{traffic management}} on a freeway network depends {{mainly on the}} decisions of traffic managers that surface from their individual exposure to similar conditions. This manual approach to tackle a dynamic scenario induces uncertainty, inconsistency and inefficient use of rescue resources. This paper suggests a decision support scheme known as Freeway Incident Analysis System, (FIAS). The novel idea presented here {{is the use of}} real time data from the Toll Collection System (TCS) and Vehicle Detection System (VDS). This data is conjugated with the historical data on a microscopic simulation platform to predict traffic flows in a post-incident scenario. The system employs Cellular Automata for the microscopic simulation of vehicle movement, and we also suggest two additional rules in the modified version of the conventional model. This has enabled us to model the dynamic flow parameters in a post <b>incident</b> <b>scenario</b> more realistically. The evaluation of FIAS indicates that it yields significantly accurate post incident information about traffic flows for the use of traffic managers...|$|E

A retrospective review of 36 consecutive months of data from the hospital electronic database of critical incidents was conducted. Main Outcome Measures. Number of incidents reported, characterization of handover incidents according to clinical setting, severity and type of incidents. Results. We identified 334 handover incidents. The number of reported incidents increased over the 3 years. The transfer of patient care within the same speciality accounted for 51 % (170) of incidents of which 75 % (143) occurred during a change of shift.

40|$|Passenger railway {{operations}} {{are based on}} an extensive planning process for generating the timetable, the rolling stock circulation, and the crew duties for train drivers and conductors. In particular, crew scheduling is a complex process. After the planning process has been completed, the plans are {{carried out in the}} real-time operations. Preferably, the plans are carried out as scheduled. However, in case of delays of trains or large disruptions of the railway system, the timetable, the rolling stock circulation and the crew duties may not be feasible anymore and must be rescheduled. This paper presents a method based on multi-agent techniques to solve the train driver rescheduling problem in case of a large disruption. It assumes that the timetable and the rolling stock have been rescheduled already based on an <b>incident</b> <b>scenario.</b> In the crew rescheduling model, each train driver is represented by a driver-agent. A driver-agent whose duty has become infeasible by the disruption starts a recursive task exchange process with the other driver-agents in order to solve this infeasibility. The task exchange process is supported by a route-analyzer-agent, which determines whether a proposed task exchange is feasible, conditionally feasible, or not feasible. The task exchange process is guided by several cost parameters, and the aim is to find a feasible set of duties at minimal total cost. The train driver rescheduling method was tested on several realistic disruption instances of Netherlands Railways (NS), the main operator of passenger trains in the Netherlands. In general the rescheduling method finds an appropriate set of rescheduled duties in a short amount of time. This research was carried out in close cooperation by NS and the D-CIS Lab...|$|E
40|$|Scope: This {{two-phase}} study presents both {{a method}} for recording the potential incident scenarios and the danger sources they originate from {{as well as a}} model for calculating the incident scenarios likelihood coefficient L, thus limiting the assessor’s subjectivity influence on the results. Method: In phase A, the associated risk assessment terminology is clarified. Tables of potential danger sources, their associated dangers and the resulting potential incident scenarios are presented. All scenarios were linked to three categories of managerial root causes and namely lack of (a) health and safety system, (b) communication and (c) enforcement. In phase B, the tools were used to acquire incident field data from actual facilities. The recorded total potential incident scenarios were linked to the immediate, basic and managerial root causes responsible for triggering the incident chain mechanism. Statistical data processing revealed a strong linear relationship between the managerial causes present, the remaining (active) potential incident scenarios and the likelihood of their occurrence, which allows the calculation of both the likelihood coefficient L used in the quantitative risk assessment models as well as the residual risk. Results: The potential <b>incident</b> <b>scenario</b> table and the questionnaire provided can be used to obtain field data results and an accurate identification {{of the total number of}} potential incidents in the great majority of operations. Equations are provided allowing assessors to calculate rather than speculate on the incident likelihood of occurrence directly from the number of total and active incident scenarios identified by the assessor, as well as an estimate on the minimum (non-zero) residual risk. Tables of the most frequent immediate, basic and managerial causes are also provided. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{unexpected}} congestion {{occurs on}} a freeway, diverting vehicles from the freeway {{to a less}} congested arterial is a common solution for mitigating the problem. However, diverting traffic without appropriately modifying traffic control on the alternate routes simply transfers the congestion problem from the freeway to these routes, which often are local streets. ^ This study investigates the impact of diverted freeway traffic on a typical local street network under different incident scenarios and {{to learn how to}} select optimal control strategies. New timing plans are developed for the arterial network using PASSER-II to optimize signals on the alternate route for both one-way and two-way progression schemes with various levels of proposed diverted freeway traffic to explicitly serve traffic diverting around a freeway incident. Evaluation of these timing plans including measurements of delay and progression bandwidth are compared for various control strategies. ^ Operations in the network are then simulated with above developed timing plans and various incident scenarios to investigate how these plans affect corridor performance during different types of incidents at various freeway traffic demand levels. The integrated network simulation program INTEGRATION is used for this analysis. Measures of effectiveness (MOE 2 ̆ 7 s) including the average network speed for the entire corridor (the freeway system and the surrounding street network), the link speed for selected links and the travel time for two diversion routes on the arterial network are compared with respect to operation for each timing plan and <b>incident</b> <b>scenario.</b> The results of additional intermediates freeway traffic demand levels are examined for the most sensitive range of above design variables. ^ This research into mitigating congestion during freeway incidents addresses performance in an entire corridor under different freeway diversion and arterial signal coordination strategies, not just on the freeway. It also identifies relationships among traffic network characteristics, traffic control plans, and incident characteristics, thus providing important insights into optimizing the trade-off between congestion on freeways and surface streets. ...|$|E
