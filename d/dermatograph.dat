It was acquired by the Schwanh√§usser family in 1865. Taking the first part from the family name, the company was renamed Schwan Bleistift Fabrik and started using the swan logo {{as one of the}} earliest trademarks. In 1909 the <b>Dermatograph</b> cosmestic pen was created which was primarily used by surgeons for marking skin. During the Great Depression, Schwan had three brands; Stabilo premium pencils for the most demanding users, Othello pencils for mass markets and Swano non-toxic pencils for children.|$|E

A dermatographical {{study was conducted to}} specimens from Indonesia Archipelago on genera Hylobates and Symphalangus, which are deposited in Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense-LIPI. A total of 101 specimens of Hylobates (78 specimens) and Symphalangus (23 specimens) were examined on palm and sole dermatographic traits. The discriminant canonical analyses showed that the Indonesian gibbon has two differences in function space of <b>dermatograph</b> types. By plotting these data, the percentage of the two groups that correctly classified was calculated to be 90. 63 %. Only nine specimens of Hylobates and Symphalangus were incorrectly classified, seven (9. 5 %) specimens Hylobates were classified as Symphalangus, and two specimens Symphalangus (9. 1 %) were classified as Hylobates. The majority of loops type <b>dermatograph</b> in this study indicated that the traits direction to ulnar, radial, and proximal between Hylobates and Symphalangus are significantly different (X 2 > 0. 05, df= 3; X 2 = 13. 58, 10. 03 and 7. 91 respectively) ...|$|E
