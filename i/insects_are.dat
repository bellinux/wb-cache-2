5|$|Many <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> parasites {{of other}} insects {{such as the}} {{parasitoid}} wasps. These <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> known as entomophagous parasites. They can be beneficial due to their devastation of pests that can destroy crops and other resources. Many insects have a parasitic relationship with humans such as the mosquito. These <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> known to spread diseases such as malaria and yellow fever and because of such, mosquitoes indirectly cause more deaths of humans than any other animal.|$|E

5|$|Unlike birds, {{many small}} <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> swept {{along by the}} {{prevailing}} winds {{although many of the}} larger <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> known to make migrations. Aphids are known to be transported long distances by low-level jet streams. As such, fine line patterns associated with converging winds within weather radar imagery, like the WSR-88D radar network, often represent large groups of insects.|$|E

5|$|<b>Insects</b> <b>are</b> prey for {{a variety}} of organisms, {{including}} terrestrial vertebrates. The earliest vertebrates on land existed 400 million years ago and were large amphibious piscivores. Through gradual evolutionary change, insectivory was the next diet type to evolve.|$|E

5|$|Solomon Creek was {{devoid of}} fish in the 1970s. However, since then several fish species, {{including}} brook trout, have inhabited the creek and its tributaries. A number of varieties of aquatic <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> also present.|$|E
5|$|Some hemipterans {{are used}} to produce dyestuffs such as carmine (also called cochineal). The scale insect Dactylopius coccus {{produces}} the brilliant red-coloured carminic acid to deter predators.

5|$|Due to the {{abundance}} of insects and a worldwide concern of food shortages, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations considers that the world may have to, in the future, regard the prospects of eating insects as a food staple. <b>Insects</b> <b>are</b> noted for their nutrients, having a high content of protein, minerals and fats and are eaten by one-third of the global population.|$|E
5|$|Eurasian rock pipits {{construct}} a cup nest under coastal vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay {{four to six}} speckled pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 16days to fledging. Although <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> occasionally caught in flight, the pipits feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the rocks or from shallow water.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fruit and seeds, {{a number of}} other food items are taken by many species. Some, particularly the ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms. One species, the atoll fruit dove, is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey. Snails, moths, and other <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit doves, and ruddy ground doves.|$|E

5|$|Insect life-histories show {{adaptations to}} {{withstand}} cold and dry conditions. Some temperate region <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> capable of activity during winter, while some others migrate to a warmer climate or {{go into a}} state of torpor. Still other insects have evolved mechanisms of diapause that allow eggs or pupae to survive these conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Insects</b> <b>are</b> a {{major factor}} in the low yields of African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental stage of the plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Insects</b> <b>are</b> {{also used}} in medicine, for example fly larvae (maggots) were {{formerly}} used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene, as they would only consume dead flesh. This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals. Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances. Adult insects, such as crickets and insect larvae of various kinds, are also commonly used as fishing bait.|$|E

5|$|<b>Insects</b> <b>are</b> mostly soft bodied, {{fragile and}} almost defenseless {{compared}} to other, larger lifeforms. The immature stages are small, move slowly or are immobile, {{and so all}} stages are exposed to predation and parasitism. Insects then {{have a variety of}} defense strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity and active defense.|$|E
5|$|Japanese tempura is {{a popular}} deep-fried food that {{generally}} consists of battered and fried seafood and vegetables. Japanese deep-fried dishes, or Agemono, include other styles besides tempura, such as Karaage, Korokke, Kushikatsu, and Tonkatsu. In areas of south-east Asia such as Thailand, <b>insects</b> <b>are</b> commonly deep-fried for human consumption. Western-style fast food items such as donuts, deep-fried chicken, and deep-fried potatoes are also becoming popular in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, {{like those}} of other <b>insects,</b> <b>are</b> centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the chorion protects the egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E
