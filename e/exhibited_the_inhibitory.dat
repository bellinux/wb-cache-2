Exohemagglutinin was {{purified}} 3, 150 -fold from culture fluid by ultracentrifugation followed by gel filtration on Sepharose CL- 4 B and by affinity chromatography on arginine-agarose. Examination of the final preparation of exohemagglutinin by biochemical analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the isolated exohemagglutinin contained three major proteins but not a detectable lipopolysaccharide.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{adenosine}} 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) on glutamatergic synaptic transmission in hippocampus was examined by {{an indicator of}} intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations. These oscillations were postsynaptic responses by glutamate released from presynaptic sites. ATP completely inhibited the oscillations in a concentration-dependent manner. The ATP-induced inhibition was mediated via P 2 -purinoceptors since ATP <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> <b>inhibitory</b> action even {{in the presence of}} P 1 -purinoceptor antagonists. Also non-hydrolysable ATP analogues and uridine 5 ′-triphosphate (UTP) inhibited the oscillation.

These inhibitory effects were insensitive to suramin. Judging from this rank order of potency, the inhibitory P 2 -purinoceptor could be assigned to a subclass of GTP-binding protein coupled-type receptors. The site of action of ATP was thought to be presynaptic since ATP did not affect the postsynaptic Ca 2 + responses by glutamate.

Because aberrant angiogenesis is a significant pathogenic component of tumour growth and chronic inflammation, we investigated the effect of IL- 4 on the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by synovial fibroblasts derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were prepared from synovial tissues of RA and incubated with different concentrations of IL- 4 in {{the presence or absence}} of transforming growth factor (TGF) -β. VEGF level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and semiquantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Treatment of FLS with IL- 4 alone caused a dose-dependent increase in VEGF levels. In contrast, IL- 4 <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on VEGF production when FLS were stimulated with TGF-β. Combined treatment of IL- 4 and IL- 10 inhibited TGF-β-induced VEGF production in an additive fashion. TGF-β increased the induction of cyclooxygenase- 2 mRNA, which was inhibited significantly by the treatment of IL- 4. NS- 398, a COX- 2 inhibitor, inhibited TGF-β-induced VEGF production in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, exogenous addition of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) restored IL- 4 inhibition on TGF-β induced VEGF production.

Methods Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was added to the culture medium of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) to induce an inflammatory response. A cell adhesion assay was used to determine the effect of the P. notoginseng saponin fractions on endothelial-monocyte interaction. The cell adhesion molecule (CAMs) expression, including ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1, in the protein level on the surface of endothelial cells were measured by cellular ELISA. CAMs expression in mRNA level was also assayed by qRT-PCR in the HCAECs and the aorta of rat fed with high cholesterol diet (HCD). Western blotting was used to detect effect of the saponin fractions on CAMs protein expression in HCAECs.

In the present work, we describe an inhibitory reflex evoked in human masseter muscles by stimulation of non-nociceptive fibres travelling in the median and radial nerves (MED and RAD, respectively). Eighteen healthy volunteers participated in the study. Subjects were seated on a comfortable chair, with the complex head-mandible-neck-trunk and the limbs securely fixed to the chair. Attempts were made to minimize possible interferences due to the activation of afferents other than the stimulated ones. The subjects were instructed to contract masseter muscles at a submaximal level and to maintain a stable level of muscle contraction during all trials. EMG voluntary activity was recorded from both masseter muscles by means of coaxial needle electrodes {{before and after the}} electrical stimulation of MED and/or RAD at intensities below pain threshold. In all subjects, MED stimulation induced bilaterally a marked depression of masseter EMG activity, which occurred at a latency of 23. 6 ± 2. 1 ms and lasted 27. 8 ± 6. 6 ms. RAD stimulation also induced a marked reduction in masseter EMG activity, but this effect was clearly observed in 9 out of 18 subjects, and it showed latency (30. 2 ± 7. 5 ms) and duration (44. 9 ± 5. 4 ms) significantly longer in comparison with the MED-induced effect. All subjects <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> <b>inhibitory</b> period in masseter EMG following the simultaneous stimulation of both nerves; this one appeared at a latency not significantly different (25. 3 ± 5. 9 ms) and lasted much more (37. 4 ± 8. 2 ms) than EMG depression evoked by MED stimulation. The duration of masseter muscle inhibition, induced by MED and/or RAD stimulation, was inversely related to the level of EMG activity, while latency was not related to it. Significant increases in the inhibitory period duration were also observed by increasing stimulus intensity, within a subthreshold range for the activation of nociceptive fibres. In all cases, the inhibitory period was followed by a later excitatory rebound activity, whose latency and duration depended on the duration of the preceding EMG inhibition and on the background level of masseter activation. In conclusion, results evidenced that the activation of arm somatosensory fibres modulates masseter muscle activity in normal man. This might lead to a coordination between limb and masticatory muscle activity, which is required in several complex motor acts...|$|E

Their caries prevalence was 89 % and 49 % of the children had carious tooth with pulp involvement. The mean (SD) dmft score was 7. 0 (5. 3). Higher dmft scores were found among children who were girls, were currently bottle-fed, took daily sweet snacks, had higher VPI scores, and had visited a dentist within the last year. CONCLUSIONS: The caries prevalence and experience of the five-year-old Dai children in Yunnan, China was high, and almost half had severe caries. The caries experience was associated with gender, snack habits, dental visit habits, and oral hygiene status. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

The compounds {{were tested}} in vitro against eleven Candida species and compared with standard drug ketoconazole. Among these compounds, the compounds bearing p-chlorophenyl 5 e, p-methoxyphenyl 5 c, phenyl 5 a, and p-sulphonamidophenyl 5 g substituents on triazolothiadiazine system {{were found to be}} the most effective derivatives against Candida species. Compound 5 e was the most effective compound against C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), C. albicans (ATCC 66027), C. specie [blood] 12810, and C. specie [urine] 300 with MIC value of 6. 25 [*]μg/mL, whereas ketoconazole <b>exhibits</b> <b>the</b> <b>inhibitory</b> activity with MIC value of 3 – 30 [*]μg/mL against all tested strains. It was clear that there is a positive correlation between anti-Candidal activity and p-chlorophenyl substitution on triazolothiadiazine ring. All the synthesized compounds were also investigated for their potential cytotoxicity on noncancer cell line (MCF- 12) using WST- 1 assay. Three compounds 5 d, 5 a, and 5 h were found to have the same IC 50 value as that of standard drug ketoconazole against noncancer cell line MCF- 12 (IC 50 ≥ 1. 0 × 105 [*]μg/mL) ...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxamic acids, {{with the}} two {{bioactive}} representatives aspergillic acid (naturally occurring) and vorinostat (synthetic), are well known for their strong binding ability with many metal ions. This explains their potential to inhibit specific metal-containing enzymes involved in e. g. human immunodeficiency virus and cancer progression. Our group has previously {{been working on the}} design and synthesis of highly functionalized pyrazinones. Therefore, it was of interest to us to combine these two classes of compounds into new compounds resembling integrase inhibitor diketoacid-based structures and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Functionalization of C- 3 of N-hydroxypyrazinones has been thoroughly investigated in this thesis resulting in the successful synthesis of a library containing three series of novel compounds, including 3 -alkyl-/carboxamide-/ureidoalkyl- 1 -hydroxypyrazinones. With the implemention of flow chemistry technology and catalytic transfer hydrogenation, we have succeeded in delivering a reproducible methodology for the selective debenzylation of O-benzyl protected N-hydroxypyrazinones, with a potential for scaling up to gram scale on suitable flow apparatus. Numerous N-hydroxypyrazinones have been synthesized with HIV inhibitory activity in mind. However, in vitro evaluation of anti-HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 replication on human T-lymphocyte cells using an MTT assay showed that none of <b>the</b> synthesized compounds <b>exhibits</b> <b>the</b> <b>inhibitory</b> activity.

Macrophage cell line B 6 MP 102 and murine peritoneal macrophages killed targets incubated with supernatants taken from sensitive cells but poorly killed cells incubated in supernatants isolated from resistant cells. Membranes from cells resistant to macrophage killing, F 5 m, were fused into F 5 b cells. The fused F 5 b cells were killed {{significantly less than}} F 5 b cells fused with F 5 b cell membranes or untreated F 5 b cells. The decreased killing of F 5 b cells corresponded to increased concentrations of gp 70 (a) molecules on F 5 b cells. Affinity purified gp 70 (a) was added to cytotoxicity assays but failed to inhibit macrophage cytotoxicity. P 15 E molecules were detectable on both F 5 b and F 5 m cells. In addition, a synthetic peptide found to <b>exhibit</b> <b>the</b> <b>inhibitory</b> properties of p 15 E was added to cytotoxicity assays. P 15 E synthetic peptide also did not inhibit macrophage cytotoxicity. Therefore, env gene proteins of murine leukemia virus do not appear responsible for inducing tumor cell resistance to activated macrophage contact-dependent cytotoxicity...|$|R

The inhibition of ChEs is considered to be involved in increasing acetylcholine level in the brain and thus has been implicated in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. We have designed and synthesized a series of novel indole derivatives and screened them for inhibi-tion of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Most of <b>the</b> tested compounds <b>exhibited</b> <b>inhibitory</b> activity against AChE and BChE. Among them 4 f and 6 e showed <b>the</b> highest AChE <b>inhibitory</b> activity with IC 50 91. 21 ± 0. 06 and 68. 52 ± 0. 04 µM, respectively.

40|$|AbstractRecently, much {{attention}} has been given to chitosan and its hydrolyzed products due to their diverse biological activities. For the first time here we report <b>the</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect of chitooligosaccharides (COS) on activation and expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). COS with 3 – 5 kDa <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> highest <b>inhibitory</b> effect on MMP- 2 activity in HDFs assessed by gelatin zymography. Interestingly, protein expression of MMP- 2 was also inhibited by COS with same molecular weight. This inhibition was caused by the decrease of the gene expression and transcriptional activity of MMP- 2. Furthermore, it was found that COS repressed the gene expression of c-fos, a part of AP- 1 transcription factor. These results suggest that COS may {{play an important role in}} the prevention and treatment of MMP- 2 mediated several health problems such as metastasis and wrinkle formation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the chemical composition and anti-biofilm activity of burdock leaf fractions against Staphylococcus aureus Methods: The anti-biofilm activity of burdock leaf fractions obtained by column chromatography against S. aureus {{was determined by}} minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Scanning electron microscopy was employed to further investigate <b>the</b> <b>inhibitory</b> activity. Analysis of the chemical composition of the fractions was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Results: The 20 and 34 % ethanol fractions each inhibited the formation of biofilm by S. aureus, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) ranging from 110 to 150 μg/ml. The 70 % ethanol elution fraction <b>exhibited</b> <b>the</b> strongest <b>inhibitory</b> activity against biofilm formation with IC 50 of 13 μg/ml. <b>The</b> minimum <b>inhibitory</b> concentration of <b>the</b> 70 % ethanol fraction completely inhibited the formation of biofilm at a concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml, which was lower than the MIC {{for the growth of}} the test bacterium (1. 25 mg/ml). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that there was no biofilm formation for cultures treated with burdock leaf fraction, thus confirming <b>the</b> <b>inhibitory</b> efficiency of burdock leaf fraction against biofilm formation.
