50|$|The most <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{prevent the}} spread of C. parvum is to avoid contact with {{contaminated}} feces. Avoiding this contact, especially with young children, is important, as {{they are more likely to}} come into oral contact and have the parasite transferred into the body.

25|$|As many {{electromagnetic}} attacks, especially SEMA attacks, rely on asymmetric implementations of cryptographic algorithms, {{an effective}} countermeasure {{is to ensure}} that a given operation performed at a given step of the algorithm gives no information on the value of that bit. Randomization of the order of bit encryption, process interrupts, and clock cycle randomization, are all <b>effective</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> make attacks more difficult.|$|E

25|$|Still more pacifists {{would argue}} that a nonviolent {{reaction}} may not save lives immediately but would in the long run. The acceptance of violence for any reason {{makes it easier to}} use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message that violence is, in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people to think more creatively and find more <b>effective</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> stop violence without more violence.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} <b>effective</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> prevent {{electromagnetic}} attacks {{is to make it}} difficult for an attacker to collect an electromagnetic signal at the physical level. Broadly, the hardware designer could design the encryption hardware to reduce signal strength or to protect the chip. Circuit and wire shielding, such as a Faraday cage, are effective in reducing the signal, as well as filtering the signal or introducing extraneous noise to mask the signal. Additionally, most electromagnetic attacks require attacking equipment to be very close to the target, so distance is an effective countermeasure. Circuit designers can also use certain glues or design components {{in order to make it}} difficult or impossible to depackage the chip without destroying it.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most <b>effective</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost.|$|E

500|$|Western analysts {{generally}} see the Eurasian Economic Union {{as a way}} {{to reunite}} many of the former Soviet republics. For example, Washington Post author Abigail Hauslohner wrote the treaty was intended [...] "to further bolster 's ties to former Soviet republics." [...] The United States expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is [...] "an attempt" [...] to re-establish a USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics. In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed [...] "It's not going to be called that [...] It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let's make no mistake about it. We know what the goal is and we {{are trying to figure out}} <b>effective</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> slow down or prevent it".|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the Social Gospel movement, which {{stressed}} social {{as well as}} individual salvation, had found support within the Presbyterian Church. Important figures such as Henry Sloane Coffin, president of New York's Union Seminary and a leading liberal, backed the movement. The most important promoter of the Social Gospel among Presbyterians was Charles Stelzle, the first head of the Workingmen's Department of the PCUSA. The department, created in 1903 to minister to working class immigrants, was the first official denominational agency to pursue a Social Gospel agenda. According to church historian Bradley Longfield, Stelzle [...] "advocated for child-labor laws, workers' compensation, adequate housing, and more <b>effective</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> address vice and crime in order to advance the kingdom of God." [...] After a reorganization in 1908, the work of the department was split between the newly created Department of Church and Labor and the Department of Immigration.|$|E

Cleaning up micro-plastics could also accidentally take out plankton, which are the main lower level food group for the marine food chain and {{over half of the}} photosynthesis on earth. [...] One of the most efficient and cost <b>effective</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> help reduce the amount of plastic entering our oceans is to not participate in using single use plastics, avoid plastic bottled drinks such as water bottles, use reusable shopping bags, and to buy products with reusable packaging.|$|E
2500|$|Language {{production}} concerns {{how people}} produce language, either in written or spoken form, {{in a way}} that conveys meanings comprehensible to others. One of the most <b>effective</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> explain the way people represent meanings using rule-governed languages is by observing and analyzing instances of speech errors. They include speech dysfluencies like false starts, repetition, reformulation and constant pauses in between words or sentences; also, slips of tongue, like blendings, substitutions, exchanges (e.g. Spoonerism), and various pronunciation errors. These speech errors yield significant implication on language production, in that they reflect that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Poe {{advances}} {{the idea}} that new media are developed by inventors and tinkerers, but are not [...] "pulled" [...] into broad use until [...] "organized interests" [...] recognize their need for these new communications tools. He argues, for example, that audiovisual media such as radio, telephone, television and film were developed well before they were taken up by industrial capitalists who needed more <b>effective</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> market the goods they produced. Audiovisual media also served the interests of bureaucrats and politicians who gained popularity by giving citizens access to modern conveniences.
