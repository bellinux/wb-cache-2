In the wrist acceleration signal we detect char-acteristic swim events such as wall push-offs, wall-strikes and strokes. Based on this information we com-pute the distance <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> and the swimming veloc-ity. The upper error bounds of our automatic method are 1. 67 % for the velocity and 1. 33 % for the time <b>per</b> <b>stroke.</b> The velocity measurement accuracy is of com-parable order to the manual accuracy. The automatic method clearly outperforms the manual measurement for the time <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> extraction. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for evaluation of speed and distance <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> (SD) at various stroke rates during aquatic locomotion. The method is based on equation Fd = k V 2, which describes dependence of hydrodynamic drag force Fd on velocity V in water. Equality of the mechanical work <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> at various stroke rates was taken as a crite-rion for SD evaluation. Two equations were developed for calculation of “prognostic” speed Vp = V 0 (R 1 /R 0) 1 / 3 and SDp = SD 0 (R 0 /R 1) 2 / 3. Ratio of the actual values to “prognos-tic ” was used for evaluation of the consistency of work <b>per</b> <b>stroke.</b> The method was veri-fied using the data of biomechanical measurements in rowing, when mechanical work <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> was measured directly. Then the method was used for race analysis in swimming. The method can be useful tool for coaches in swimming, rowing and canoeing...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{determine}} the effects of a taper period on stroke rate and distance <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> in competitive swimmers, ten highly trained Ball State University swimmers were involved in three separate trials of 300 yards (274. 4 m) at 80 percent of their best time for that distance. The trials took place during the pre-taper phase of training, post taper phase of training, and the post removal of body hair phase of training. The stroke rate and distance <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> were judged using Sportline stopwatches. The swimmers' were timed every fourth arm cycle at the 175 yard and 275 yard mark of the 300 yard distance. The results of this study suggest that at submaximal effort (80 percent), there is no significant (p< 0. 05) change in stroke rate and distance <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> due to a taper period or removal of body hair. The lack of decreased stroke rate and increased distance <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> may be attributed to the intensity of the trials. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|During daily 3 -hr sessions, 5 rhesus monkeys drank drug {{solutions}} and water that were concurrently available. The drug solutions were: 1 milligram per milliliter (mg/mL) pentobarbital (2 monkeys), 1 mg/mL pentobarbital plus 0. 5 % ethanol (1 monkey), 1 mg/mL pentobarbital plus 1 % ethanol (1 monkey), and 8 % ethanol (1 monkey). The drug solution and water were available under identical two-component tandem fixed-ratio continuous-reinforcement N schedules. Two variables were manipulated: {{the size of}} the fixed-ratio component and the number of liquid deliveries (N) in the second component. Deliveries of the drug solution maintained higher rates of responding than did deliveries of the drug vehicle, water. The number of drug <b>deliveries</b> <b>per</b> session increased with increases in the number of <b>deliveries</b> <b>per</b> fixed ratio and decreased with increases in fixed-ratio size. Analysis of the results in terms of the proportion of deliveries to responses showed that the number of drug <b>deliveries</b> <b>per</b> session was directly related to the size of this quotient. Finally, when fixed-ratio size was repeatedly doubled, the following orderly relationship emerged: The greater the number of available drug <b>deliveries</b> <b>per</b> fixed ratio, the less was the percent {{decrease in the number of}} fixed ratios completed per session.

With reference to an operating condition using E 21 (21 % ethanol, 79 % gasoline) as a fuel, the experimental performance of the engine are firstly introduced, and the brake power, the specific fuel consumption, the total efficiency, the heating combustion power and the injected mass <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> dependency on shaft speed are introduced.

Kleshnev (2006) developed a method to evaluate the relationship between speedand stroke rate during rowing- the effective work <b>per</b> <b>stroke.</b> In this case study, the effective work <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> was determinedfor a male world-class 100 -m breaststroke swimmer for seven races in major championships and compared between: each ofthe seven races; each quarter within each race; and the best swims of this case study and seven other world-class swimmers. The effective work <b>per</b> <b>stroke</b> was related to race performance, with the fastest race having the highest effective work perstroke and lowest stroke rate, with slower races having low effectiveness and high stroke rate (R²= 0. 85). The effective workper stroke was reduced in a race as the swimmer fatigued. The within-race standard deviation of effectiveness was lower infast swims (R²= 0. 84). This analysis has identified some characteristics of fast swimming: high effectiveness, optimal strokerate, and a flat effectiveness profile.
