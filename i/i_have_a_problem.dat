Henderson explained, [...] "I don't {{have a problem}} with religion. What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with is religion posing as science. If there is a god and he's intelligent, then I would guess he has a sense of humor." ...|$|E
500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about [...] "certain things about music": [...] "There {{are a lot}} of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." [...] Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a [...] "sex-positive" [...] person, elaborating:People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I have nothing against anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better. It's not like <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with dancing around in undies—I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E

5000|$|Vocalist Jacoby Shaddix {{said that}} [...] "Broken Home" [...] was {{about his family}} [...] "falling to pieces, pretty much, and being {{stuck in the middle}} of two parents...

[...] He attributed this to his father's time in the military, noting, [...] "When he was 18 or so, my biological father went to the Vietnam War to be a killer for the U.S. government, and it really put a tax on his life... That war set up a lot of broken homes." ...|$|R

2500|$|Before Perverted-Justice {{began working}} {{primarily}} with law enforcement, child safety advocate Julie Posey described Perverted-Justice's tactics as [...] "a gross invasion of privacy." [...] Posey indicated {{that she did}} not feel the methods employed by Perverted-Justice were completely effective. [...] "What it does is embarrass them for the moment... but then they'll go and get a different screen name and know to check things out a little more thoroughly next time." [...] Posey and Perverted-Justice founder Xavier Von Erck appeared on Fox News Channel shortly thereafter, where Posey remarked, [...] "It’s more of an entertainment site, actually. You go there, you click on a link of a picture that takes you to that person’s chat-log and that person has a scale—a sliminess scale as he calls it—and you can rate the pervert from, I think it’s, one to five. To me, that kind of gives a sense of entertainment. Anybody that finds entertainment value in exploiting children, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with it." ...|$|E

The first series actually won an International Emmy Award for best non-scripted program.

He sealed Switzerland's {{qualification}} for the World Group with a victory over Potito Starace. Following the match, Federer was quoted as saying [...] "I was able to play very well.

500|$|Araya held {{concern about}} the lyrics that King penned to [...] "In the Name of God", voicing his opinion to guitarist Hanneman. King's {{viewpoint}} was; [...] "It's like, 'C'mon, man, you're in Slayer. You're the antichrist — you said it yourself on the first album!' You can't draw the line like that. Whether he agrees with it or not, he didn't write it — I wrote it. So you have to say, 'Well, it's {{just a part of}} being in this band.' Now Jeff and I, we don't give a fuck. If Jeff wrote something <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with, <b>I</b> would never even raise a fucking finger. I'd be like, 'Fuck yeah, let's do it! Gonna piss someone off? Alright!'" ...|$|R

If you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> when a sitting {{secretary of state and}} a foundation run by her husband collects many millions of dollars from foreign governments, governments which are dictatorships -- you don't have a lot of civil liberties or democratic rights in Saudi Arabia.

[...] In September 2016, Sanders told NBC's Chuck Todd that if Clinton becomes president of the United States, she should cease all contact with the Foundation, but stopped short of agreeing it should be closed, noting, [...] "I don't know enough.

500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Maurice Hurley thought that [...] "Heart of Glory" [...] was the closest experience he had on the show to directly place his own personal philosophy into a script. He later credited fellow executive producer Rick Berman with helping to write the script for [...] "Heart of Glory", saying [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>I</b> could go in and we could sit there, close the door, yell and scream. I'd pace, he'd make suggestions. The two of us made stories work in that room {{that had to be}} shot within a couple of days. We were under enormous time pressure, and we were working hand in glove. We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wonderful time, on that show, especially." [...] Hurley wrote the screenplay in two days from a story created by Herbert Wright and D. C. Fontana. Because of the delays, the Klingon language portions of the script didn't make any actual sense in translation and were simply Klingon sounding words created by Hurley.|$|R
