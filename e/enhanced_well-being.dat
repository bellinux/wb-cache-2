40|$|Walking is {{a common}} {{recreational}} activity enjoyed by {{people of all ages}} and fitness levels. The body of knowledge stresses the importance of physical and social environmental influences on individual decisions to walk, which benefit health and well-being. The socio-ecological approach chosen as the theoretical framework for this study provides a comprehensive understanding of how multiple psychological, social and environmental factors influence engagement in leisure walking. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to compare Nordic walking with rambling, as examples of leisure walking activities, in terms of socio-environmental influences, which produce unique leisure experiences in order to determine how these leisure experiences benefit mental well-being. The study used mixed-method approach. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected between April 2013 and August 2014. Quantitative data were gathered from 220 Nordic walking practitioners and 288 ramblers who completed close-ended online surveys. Qualitative data were obtained from the interviews with 13 ramblers and 12 Nordic walking practitioners. The comparison of the quantitative findings revealed that Nordic walking and rambling groups scored high on mental well-being scales. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in WEMWBS scores between the groups, which suggests that in general recreational walking benefits mental well-being. The comparative qualitative analyses revealed that the walking activities <b>enhanced</b> <b>well-being</b> in different ways. Nordic walking promoted a sense of achievement through opportunities for the commitment to personal health goals and skills development. Rambling <b>enhanced</b> <b>well-being</b> by offering positive experiences of social interactions with like-minded people in aesthetically pleasing natural environments. This study is the first step to bridge the gap in knowledge by offering a broad understanding of benefits of Nordic walking, in comparison to rambling, towards mental well-being...|$|E

We hypothesized that (a) respite increases resource level and well-being and (b) individual differences and respite features moderate respite effects. A sample of 129 faculty members on sabbatical and 129 matched controls completed measures of resource gain, resource loss, and well-being before, during, and after the sabbatical. Among the sabbatees, resource loss declined and resource gain and well-being rose during the sabbatical. The comparison group showed no change. Moderation analysis revealed that those who reported higher respite self-efficacy and greater control, were more detached, had a more positive sabbatical experience, and spent their sabbatical outside their home country enjoyed more <b>enhanced</b> <b>well-being</b> than others...|$|E

40|$|Psychological {{science has}} usually {{approached}} {{the treatment of}} disorder through research on individual combinations of risk and protective factors (including life experiences, thinking styles, behaviors, social relationships and genes) {{and the application of}} interventions that focus on improvements in the individual. However, we can do better than this. Not only should we be aiming to <b>enhance</b> <b>well-being</b> rather than merely reducing disorder, but we should also be doing so for the majority of people rather than the few who have a disorder. In this article, I focus on the mental health spectrum and make the case for a broad population-based approach. I argue that a very small shift in the population mean of the underlying symptoms or risk factors can do more to <b>enhance</b> <b>well-being</b> and reduce disorder than would any amount of intervention with individuals who need help. Examples from research on alcohol abuse and psychological distress are presented to illustrate the value of a population-based approach...|$|R
40|$|Do {{positive}} psychology interventions - that is, {{treatment methods}} or intentional activities aimed at cultivating positive feelings, positive behaviors, or positive cognitions - <b>enhance</b> <b>well-being</b> and ameliorate depressive symptoms? A meta-analysis of 51 such interventions with 4, 266 individuals {{was conducted to}} address this question and to provide practical guidance to clinicians. The results revealed that positive psychology interventions do indeed significantly <b>enhance</b> <b>well-being</b> (mean r=. 29) and decrease depressive symptoms (mean r=. 31). In addition, several factors were found to impact the effectiveness of positive psychology interventions, including the depression status, self-selection, and age of participants, as well as the format and duration of the interventions. Accordingly, clinicians should be encouraged to incorporate positive psychology techniques into their clinical work, particularly for treating clients who are depressed, relatively older, or highly motivated to improve. Our findings also suggest that clinicians would do well to deliver positive psychology interventions as individual (versus group) therapy and for relatively longer periods of time. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Background: Humans are {{involved}} {{in every aspect of}} fashion including design, manufacture, retail, consumption and disposal. Fashion affects us as individuals, in relationships, groups, societies and communities at home, work and leisure. What we wear influences our own and others’ perceptions, our emotions, self-esteem, body-image and confidence. Fashion is powerful and its addictive appeal can lead to economic and environmental problems. However, the potential for harnessing its power to <b>enhance</b> <b>well-being,</b> through applying psychological principles and theories, has not been attempted. Aim: To consider how psychology can be applied in the fashion industries to <b>enhance</b> <b>well-being.</b> Expected outcomes for participants: Participants will discuss the application of psychology to fashion, discuss existing problems, contribute to an action plan and be invited to join a network to work towards promoting well-being through fashion. Key points: Fashion matters! The fashion industry employs almost one million people in the UK and contributes more than £ 25 billion to the British economy annually. It influences and is influenced by psychological factors of individuals, groups and communities, yet traditionally, psychology has been ignored in fashion studies. Existing problems related to fashion include, but are not limited to, social and beauty ideals lacking diversity, unregulated cosmetic treatment and surgery, unethical fashion production, consumption and disposal leading to environmental problems, issues of self-esteem, dysmorphia, eating disorders, and so on. Conclusions: The workshop will identify and discuss existing problems, develop action plans and establish a network of psychologists who wish to apply psychological theory to <b>enhance</b> <b>well-being</b> in fashion...|$|R

40|$|Research {{shows that}} people achieve {{satisfaction}} and <b>enhanced</b> <b>well-being</b> {{when they are}} successful in domains {{that allow them to}} satisfy their implicit motives (Baumann, Kaschel, & Kuhl, 2005; Brunstein, Schultheiss, & Grässmann, 1998; Hofer & Chasiotis, 2003). According to this research, an implicit power motive typically predicts well-being in the context of power-goal striving (such as a work setting), whereas an implicit affiliation motive typically predicts well-being in the context of affiliation-goal striving (typi-cally in relationship contexts). Thus, most commonly, a given motive is seen as suggesting a domain of endeavor in which a person can reach satisfaction. In this view, a person with a high power motive who pursues an affiliation goal, like spending more time with a romantic partner, should experience less pleasure and satisfaction, even when he o...|$|E
30|$|Previous {{research}} has emphasized the positive role {{and benefits of}} employees’ SOC use on favourable individual outcomes like competence maintenance (Abraham and Hansson 1995), performance (Bajor and Baltes 2003; Yeung and Fung 2009), work ability (Müller et al. 2012; Weigl et al. 2013), focus on opportunities at work (Zacher and Frese 2011), and emotional well-being (Wiese et al. 2002). In regard to our study, we argue that employees who apply SOC strategies at work use their individual resources more efficiently and cope more effective with losses in individual functioning. SOC use helps employees to adapt to individual or environmental changes and allocate individual resources effectively, particularly {{in the face of}} dwindling individual resources, e.g., physical strengths, information processing (Riediger et al. 2006).

To establish that it is prosocial behavior itself, and not only an increased sense of social relatedness to the recipient that improves well-being, participants (n = 76) were invited to play a simple computer game, where half were made aware of a chance to have an anonymous prosocial impact through gameplay. As compared to the control condition, this group experienced more positive affect, meaningfulness and marginally more vitality. Going beyond self-reported outcomes, they also demonstrated better post-game performance on a subsequent Stroop task, providing behavioral evidence for the positive effects of prosocial behavior. Also supported was the hypothesis that these positive effects of prosocial behavior on well-being were mediated by subjectively assessed autonomy and competence need satisfactions...|$|E
40|$|Online {{positive}} psychology <b>enhances</b> <b>well-being</b> {{and reduces}} mental health symptoms Positive psychological interventions, and online positive psychological interventions in particular, {{can be effective}} in <b>enhancing</b> <b>well-being</b> and reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, according to the dissertation of Linda Bolier. Also, well-being is positively related to long-term functioning and prognosis while being physically diseased. Positive psychological interventions (PPIs) can be of value in public mental health, as first-step interventions in a stepped care approach. Online application of these interventions are in potential suitable to reach and engage large groups of people. In two meta-analyses, respectively {{the positive effect of}} well-being on recovery and survival while being diseased and the effects of PPIs on well-being and depression were explored. A chapter on online PPIs (oPPIs) reviews the advantages, challenges and evidence so far of online positive psychology. After that, two randomized controlled trials were conducted. An online intervention was developed: 'Psyfit – online mental fitness' {{that for the most part}} was based on principles that stem or are related to positive psychology, such as optimistic thinking, positive relationships and mindfulness. Psyfit was found to be effective in helping the mildly depressed participants to <b>enhance</b> their <b>well-being,</b> vitality and general health in the short-term and to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms in both the short and long-term. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention remained inconclusive. In the second trial, Psyfit was offered to nurses in a large academic hospital within a package of other online interventions tailored to a screening profile. Although there was hardly any adherence to the online interventions, positive effects were found for well-being, but not on other outcomes such as mental symptoms and work functioning. It was concluded that PPIs and oPPIs have potential to <b>enhance</b> <b>well-being</b> and to reduce disease in adult populations. In the dissertation, several recommendations were made to improve practice and research in intervention research in positive psychology. More knowledge is needed on how to successfully embed these interventions in various delivery systems, such as healthcare, schools, companies and the World Wide Web...|$|R
