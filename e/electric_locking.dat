It is also possible to manipulate the power to the lock either by removing or adding current, although most Access Control systems incorporate battery back-up systems and the locks are almost always located on the secure side of the door.|$|E

5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a {{locking device}} {{that consists of}} an electromagnet and an armature plate. There are two main types of <b>electric</b> <b>locking</b> devices. Locking devices can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure locking device remains locked when power is lost. Fail-safe locking devices are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|E

Of course this will add to expenses per month. Often we see the incidence of theft of home or office entrance through doors and windows, to track the window can be treated using iron trailis, while for the door track a bit difficult because of the width of the door is too big and is the main access entrance and exit of people. It required an automatic door system and can be monitored remotely using the Android app. In pengaplikasianya the system uses Finggerprint as the door lock which will give access to people who are already registered fingerprints. The system is run by using arduino based applications that will work to open the door with the reading of the fingerprint data has been registered, as well as Android devices that will receive notifications if the door has been opened. Given such a security system homeowners will feel safe as any people can get into the house. With the implementation of these security systems do not require a key user manual or <b>electric</b> <b>locking</b> bermedia remote to conduct open the door.

40|$|Purpose. Development and {{investigation}} of a dynamic model of electric drive {{on the base of}} the rolling rotor motor (RRM) which reflects the positioning of the actuator of the locking and regulating equipment in time. Methodology. Analytical description of electromagnetic and mechanical processes in the electric drive during the RRM shaft movement by using a system of differential equations. Numerical imitation modeling with the processes visualization in the Matlab environment of the RRM rotor displacement with mechanical load in time. Results. It is shown that the degree of influence {{of the value of the}} load inertia on the dynamics of the object obtained by the waveform changes the rotation angle of the rotor and motor speed in time. The degree of influence of the value of the electromagnetic time constant of the dynamics of the positioning of the actuator, and the nature of transients during acceleration and fixing position of the rotor with a predetermined moment of inertia for different values of inductance. The effect of the ratio of electromechanical and electromagnetic time constants of the nature of the transition processes accompanying jog mode angular displacement of the drive shaft on the base of RRM. Originality. The lack of technical means to ensure acceptable accuracy time measurement of angular displacement shaft of the actuator in jog mode offset by using a laser meter which gives the opportunity to assess the adequacy of the dynamic model of the RRM. Practical value. The results of investigations allow to create a tool for optimization of structural, technical and hardware and software solutions for the improvement and modernization of the projected <b>electric</b> <b>locking</b> and regulating equipment. The direction for improving the dynamics of the drive on the basis of RRM is indicated providing for an increase in its torque characteristics of the motor by reducing the influence of the parameters of transients...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 46 - 47). The growing technology associated with petroleum equipment has lead to an increase in electrical components used to measure, adjust and control many aspects of the petroleum extraction process. This increase in electrical use has lead to the conversion of many components from hydraulic operation to electric. Therefore, it is the purpose of this report to detail and propose an engineering solution to the electrical conversion of a surface controlled subsea safety valve (SCSSV). Preliminary analysis has resulted in the following important functional requirements that the SCSSV should operate within: Temperatures up to 350 F. Estimated operational life of 20 years. Peak available power of 4300 W (actual value will be much lower than this due to other power system drains). The three conceptual designs presented in this report are the following: Electric motor actuator with a solenoid latching detent. Linear actuation with a fluid reservoir locking valve. Rotational engagement with an <b>electric</b> <b>locking</b> clutch. After reviewing and comparing these concepts, the last concept was chosen to be further developed. This concept will have the least temperature sensitive components and fewer leak path problem areas. Upon completion of the detailed design phase an electric SCSSV solution has been proposed. The following is a brief list of the performance claims: Power requirement to open: 0. 5 W. Time required to open valve: 10 minutes. Installable inline with 4 - 1 / 2 tubing. Operating temperature range: 20 - 350 F. H?S service certified. Hold open energy requirements 0 ~ 0. 2 W. There are however practical issues that must be addressed to ensure reliable and satisfactory performance of the SCSSV. The actual efficiency of the cylindrical cam mechanism and reliability of the torque overload clutch must be empirically determined due to the number of theoretical assumptions used. Thus these items should be thoroughly tested in order to produce a reliable and satisfactory SCSSV. It is with these claims and working issue that this electrically converted SCSSV be fully developed and installed for electrical petroleum production systems...|$|E

At the accident aircraft {{was found that the}} <b>electric</b> magnetic <b>lock</b> system (Power Lever lock) was on open position. With power lever lock on open position, the solenoid of the <b>electric</b> magnetic <b>lock</b> system disengage and allow the power lever moves to ground idle in flight whenever the mechanical power lever stop slots lifted. Based on simulator test conducted by the NTSC, if the engine entered this condition, the aircraft would lose lift and eventually descended rapidly. The movement of power lever to ground idle will result to the propeller pitch angle changes to low pitch angle which produces significant drag. The NTSC stated that because it happened on 112 ft, it was impossible to not crash.|$|R

40|$|Physical keys {{made from}} metal or woods {{have been used}} for centuries to operate locks. The {{routines}} for operating a lock did not change significantly by the time. Keys have been carried, stored, lost, searched, lent, and copied. The main intent of locking is making sure that the belongings are kept safe. Hence, security has always been main consideration. Although mechanical Lock Access Control Systems are easy and cost effective to implement, they are insecure and expensive to maintain. Traditional Digital Lock Access Control systems may decrease the problems of mechanical lock access control systems. However, they are still vulnerable to attacks and the costs are usually high. Smart Lock Access Control Systems decrease the security risks and costs caused by fetching, storing, and carrying the physical keys. They also enable distribution of access rights and monitoring activities online. Smart lock solutions are cost effective to implement since they use existing wireless Internet structure (such as home WiFi) and <b>electric</b> <b>locks.</b> A typical Smart Lock Access Control System includes three components: a lock controller which is a microcontroller for operating the <b>electric</b> <b>lock,</b> cloud servers for granting access to the users and monitor activities, and finally a mobile phone which is used as a gateway between the cloud servers and lock controller.
