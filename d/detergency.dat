40|$|Abstract. <b>Detergency</b> {{process of}} oily soil removal from fabrics is of {{interest}} and the mechanisms of oily soil removal are very complicated involving several factors: interfacial tension, oil loading and surfactant adsorption. In this study, the effects of oil loading and the surfactant adsorption on the <b>detergency</b> performance of oily soil removal were investigated. Mixed surfactant systems of branched alcohol propoxylate sulfate sodium salt (Alfoterra 145 - 3 PO), an extended anionic surfactant, and secondary alcohol ethoxylate (Tergitol 15 -S- 5), a nonionic surfactant, were used to form microemulsions with motor oil. The CMC and CµC values of the mixed surfactants were 0. 015 and 0. 04 % total active mixed surfactants concentration, respectively. A polyester/cotton blend [65 / 35] was selected {{to use as a}} testing fabric in <b>detergency</b> experiments. The results showed that the oil loading and fabric weight did not affect the efficiency of oil removal. Furthermore, with the selected formulation (0. 1 wt. % Alfoterra 145 - 3 PO and 5 wt. % Tergitol 15 -S- 5), the oil detachment time was investigated at different temperatures (30 - 50 °C) and different total surfactant concentrations (0. 04 - 0. 5 %). The results showed that increasing temperature and surfactant concentration were found to decrease the oil detachment time, leading to increasing oil removal...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} <b>Detergency</b> in liquid Carbon Dioxide. <b>Detergency</b> is the cleaning performance of additives, surfactants in particular, in washing fluids. Liquid CO 2 is under consideration, for environmental and toxicological reasons, to replace perchloro-ethylene as the solvent in textile dry cleaning technology. Inherent problems {{of such a}} transition were confronted with the methodology of chemical engineering design. The Basic Cycle of Design (BCD) approach {{was used as a}} pathway for designing a detergent. The BCD also establishes the structural framework of the thesis, which can, therefore, be read as records from a successful product engineering project, in which an effective detergent has been designed for a new dry cleaning solvent. The Dynamic <b>Detergency</b> Model (DDM), which succeeds to explain the role of surfactants in the washing operation, is used as a rational starting point for the design of a detergent in liquid CO 2. According to this model, such a surfactant must be: sparingly soluble in the solvent, surface-active and able to form micelles in the solution. The different experiments carried out (solubility, interfacial-tension and dye solubilisation measurements), show that a number of molecules of the homologous polyoxyethylene/alkane series, generally described by the shorthand formula CiEj did indeed behave as surfactants and can be then considered detergents for liquid CO 2. In the technical evaluation of the detergents, at laboratory as well as at semi-pilot scale, high washing performances were obtained. They are, indeed, as good for dry cleaning textiles as the present perchloro-ethylene (Perc) technology. Applied Science...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Evaluation of anti-greasiness {{properties}} of oat extract and oil in shampoos. Methodology: Seborrhea can cause greasiness in scalp and hair. There are few compounds currently in use to reduce sebaceous gland secretions. Avena sativa or oat is a plant containing saponins as active ingredients with cleansing activity. In a double blinded, randomized, placebo clinical study, we investigated anti-grease and cleansing effects of oat by comparing shampoos formulated from oat extract and oil with control shampoo. Sixty {{male and female}} volunteers aged 19 to 30 years old randomly received either oat oil/extract or placebo to the scalp for 5 minutes, twice per week for four weeks. Signs and symptoms such as scaling, greasiness and itching were assessed every week.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{mechanism}} of <b>detergency</b> under various conditions has thus far been built up from laboratory studies. It {{is well known that}} the laboratory methods for determing <b>detergency</b> are on the whole not able to give results which agree with those obtained in practice, probably because the actual scouring conditions cannot be duplicated exactly in the laboratory. <b>Detergency</b> testing on a full industrial scale is virtually impossible in view of the high cost and the production losses involved. In commercial raw wool scouring, which is an extremely complex system, {{it would be very difficult}} to exercise proper and complete control. The study described here was carried out on a specially constructed pilot plant which is similar to a fullscale plant in that the lengths of the bowls are of the same order as those of industrial plants, but they are considerably narrower. The trials were carried out under strictly controlled conditions in which the effects to be studied were created by the necessary changes while all other factors were kept constant, The pilot plant experiments were planned from indications of laboratory studies and the results were expected to be more comparable with those obtained in industrial practice, The effect of several factors on the scouring of raw wool was studied from the detergent efficiency aspect. The factors investigated were: mechanical action, backflow, temperature and <b>detergency</b> builders. A number of detergents which were selected from the large range which is available were compared with regard to efficiency and economy of scouring. A difficulty which hinders quantitative laboratory work on nonionic detergents is the fact that there is no rapid, accurate method for the estimation of nonionic detergents. The analytical methods which are employed at present are interfered with by virtually all the impurities which are normally present in scouring liquors. Some of the existing methods have been investigated and tested for precision and reproducibility and an attempt was made at establishing a new method. The sorption of nonionic detergents by various substrates has not been fully investigated because of the above reason and also because the amounts of detergent sorbed by most substrates are very small and difficult to determine. Attempts were made at determining the sorption of nonionic detergents onto wool and impurities which are normally found in scouring liquors. A new method for the investigation of "inactivation" of detergent by contaminants present in scouring liquors, which may be regarded as an indirect indication of detergent sorption, was investigated...|$|E

40|$|A new {{laundering}} {{method was}} {{presented by the}} author, which may be named provisionally as "Polymer-coated Laundering Method", and by this method, a higher <b>detergency</b> than ordinal laundering methods, i. e. immersion of soiled fabrics in a solution of detergent, was attained. And this method have projected many interesting problems to the physical chemistry of <b>detergency,</b> and have broken the common and fixed idea about laundery and washing. This laundering method was constructed from the following chief process; soiled fabrics were coated with a solution of high-polymer or the mixture of high-polymer and surfactant, then dried, and laundered in merely water. There were also many variations, for instance, laundering in a solution of detergent and the omission of the drying. Fundamental conditions for this method, such {{as the amount of}} used high-polymer, laundering temperature, laundering time and the effect of surfactant were discussed with the soiled cotton fabrics. The effect of drying and its types was also discussed. Then the effect of this laundering method for hydrophobic fibers was compared with hydrophilic cell ulosic fibers. The obtained results of this method have driven off the fixed idea that soiled fabrics and garments must be laundered by the immersion of it in a solution of detergent or organic solvents, and it seems that there might be more variations of laundering method when high-polymers were effectively used...|$|E
