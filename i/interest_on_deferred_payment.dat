The problem here is that this includes linking two transactions in one which is forbidden in Islam.

This bachelor thesis compares two completely different systems of financing tertiary education in Australia and Slovak republic. Slovak education system is financed by public sector subsidies in comparison to Australian education system which is based <b>on</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>payment</b> of tuition fees. The special focus is on advantages and disadvantages of successful financing of tertiary education in Australia. The main goal is to provide suitable recommendations for implementation of advantageous features of higher education financing in Australia for Slovak republic. The key advantages are considered to be: reducing the burden on public budgets with higher focus on private sector, better education quality and reducing the deliberate prolongation of study stay. Implementation of some features from Australia in Slovakia could mean high administrative costs and it requires proper understanding of current economic situation in Slovakia. Helping tools for successful university reform consist of optimization of university tuition fees and decreased amount of field of studies, which require paying university tuition fees...|$|R

40|$|Hadits is {{one source}} of Islamic Law. There are {{contracts}} which are forbidden is Islamic Law. One of that forbidden contracts is two sales in one contract (bay’atayn fi bay’ahor s}afqatayn fi s}afqah). There are narrations of the Ahadith which forbids this type of contract. The paper discusses the authenticity of these narrations and its legal meaning. According to the science of Hadits that daif (weak) Hadith could not be considered as valid source of law. There are three narrations related to this topic i. e. through Abu Hurayrah, Amru ibn Shuaib and Ibn Mas’ud. The Prophet (pbh) has forbidden two sales in one contract. This Hadits is generally considered as Sahih hence some transactions which come under this type are deemed as void. Muslim scholars have different opinion {{with regard to the}} meaning of this Hadits. There are some forms of contract which are forbidden is Islamic Law such as 1.   Bay’ al-ienah, 2.

50|$|Pakistan {{also played}} a leading role in Japan's postwar {{economic}} revival in the 1950s by exporting cotton and jute to Japan as textile was the only industry allowed to revive under the Occupation. SCAP-Japan sent its first trade mission to Pakistan in May 1948, headed by R. Eaton. Two months later, Japan signed a trade agreement with Pakistan in July 1948, which was also the first trade agreement signed by Japan with any country after the war. Much of Pakistan’s export was <b>on</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>payment</b> as Japan was short of foreign exchange. In exchange of cotton and jute, Pakistan imported textile machinery from Japan. Therefore, a mutually beneficial trade relationship emerged between them. Furthermore, a Japanese trading liaison agency was established in Karachi in 1948, which was also a diplomatic source for Japan after the war. Pakistan sent its first trade mission to Japan under Mirza Abul Isphahani in September 1948 to review Japanese textile industry for Pakistan’s benefit. Another SCAP-Japan trade mission, headed by E.B. Blatcheley, visited Pakistan in February 1949 and two more trade missions led by B.W. Adams and A.B. Snell respectively visited Pakistan to negotiate cotton and jute for Japanese industry. These visits paved the way for many other trade delegations to Pakistan to enhance trade and to promote other economic activities between the two countries.|$|R
40|$|Major bubble episodes {{are rare}} events. In this paper, we examine what factors might cause some asset price bubbles to become very large. We recreate, in a {{laboratory}} setting, some of the specific institutional features investors in the South Sea Company faced in 1720. Several factors have been proposed as potentially contributing {{to one of the}} greatest periods of asset overvaluation in history: an intricate debt-for-equity swap, <b>deferred</b> <b>payment</b> for these shares, and the possibility of default <b>on</b> the <b>deferred</b> <b>payments.</b> We consider which aspect might have had the most impact in creating the South Sea bubble. The results of the experiment suggest that the company s attempt to exchange its shares for government debt was the single biggest contributor to the stock price explosion, because of {{the manner in which the}} swap affected fundamental value. Issuing new shares with only partial payments required, in conjunction with the debt-equity swap, also had a significant effect on the size of the bubble. Limited contract enforcement, on the other hand, does not appear to have contributed significantly...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine trade credit terms in Italy {{on the basis}} of two {{original}} surveys carried out by the Bank of Italy. The surveys show that 80 - 90 per cents of sales are paid <b>on</b> a <b>deferred</b> <b>payment</b> basis of 90 days on average and a delay of 11 days. 83 per cent of trade credit is extended on net terms (with no discount offered for prompt payment). When two-part terms are offered, the cost of trade credit is normally very high and well above market interest rates. These results point to the importance of marketing determinants for the extension of trade credit (product quality guarantee, customer relationships) more than financial motives. Most of suppliers (80 per cent) differentiate customers by means of price and payment terms in favor of older and bigger firms and longstanding customers; they apply stricter terms to late payers, while being indulgent with those in temporary distress. Regressions on a sample of bilateral transactions suggest that cash payments are required when information asymmetry is relatively low and the risk of customer default relatively high. Two-part terms, on the other hand, are offered to not well-known customers and are aimed at extracting information on their creditworthiness. More generally, the analysis shows that two-part and net terms respond to very different aims. Contrary to the presumption of most of the literature, generalizing the characteristics of two-part terms contract as pertaining to the whole of credit transactions is unwarranted. Price and payment terms are a flexible and many-faceted device extensively used by firms for building customer relationships, acquiring information on buyers creditworthiness, and exploiting market power. trade credit...|$|R
