40|$|Constitutional {{amendment}} ordinarily channels {{public deliberation}} through formal, transparent and predictable procedures designed {{to express the}} informed aggregated choices of political, popular and institutional actors. Yet the Government of Canada’s proposed senator selection reforms concealed a democratically problematic strategy to innovate an informal, obscure and irregular method of constitutional amendment: constitutional amendment by stealth. There are three distinguishing features of constitutional amendment by stealth—distinctions that make stealth amendment stand apart from other types of informal constitutional change: the circumvention of formal amendment rules, the intentional creation of a convention, and the twinned consequences of both promoting and weakening democracy. Constitutional amendment by stealth occurs where political actors consciously establish a new democratic practice whose repetition is <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>compel</b> their successors into compliance. Over time, this practice matures into an unwritten constitutional convention, and consequently becomes informally entrenched in the constitution, though without the democratic legitimacy we commonly associate with an amendment.

40|$|This primer is an {{introduction}} to the basic laws of employee benefits. It is often assumed that there are legal impediments to employers providing benefits to phased retirees, part-time workers and the contingent workforce. From a benefits law perspective, this is really not true. By statute, self-employed workers are sometimes excluded from plans required to be employee-only but employers face few other prohibitions when designing their plans. From an employer’s perspective, there are far more impediments to excluding these workers from their benefit plans than including them. Tax law provides incentives to employers who sponsor plans and to workers who participate in them. But tax law also insists that this special treatment should not be available only to high-paid workers. So today’s regulatory structure is <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>compel</b> employers <b>to</b> include a substantial number of rank-and-file and lower-paid workers in their plans in exchange for favorable tax treatment for high-paid workers. This primer illustrates this regulatory structure by focusing on the basic rules for eligibility and participation in the most common plans. It is in part an exercise in mapping the employee benefits universe. It is written from the perspective of an employer and highlights questions that an employer must answer when designing a particular plan. Those questions range from “who is an employee” to “how many low-paid workers must I include” to “what benefits may I offer and to whom?...|$|R
5000|$|From 2006 to 2014, {{the country}} {{operated}} under a military-led government {{and had no}} constitution or functioning parliament from 2009. A new constitution was introduced in 2013, and multi-party elections in 2014 restored a parliamentary form of government. During the interim military regime, a series of decrees were issued, including the Public Order Amendment Decree (POAD), the Media Decree, and the Crime Decree. The POAD gives the government the power to detain persons on suspicion of [...] "endangering public safety or {{the preservation of the}} peace"; defines terrorism as any act designed to advance a political, religious, or ideological cause that could [...] "reasonably be regarded" [...] as <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>compel</b> a government <b>to</b> do or refrain from doing any act or to intimidate the public or a section thereof; and makes religious vilification and attempts to sabotage or undermine the economy offenses punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. The POAD also permits military personnel to search persons and premises without a warrant from a court and to take photographs, fingerprints, and measurements of any person. Police and military officers may enter private premises to break up any meeting considered unlawful. The Media Decree prohibits [...] "irresponsible reporting" [...] and provides for government censorship of the media. The Crimes Decree includes criticism of the government in its definition of the crime of sedition, including statements made in other countries by any person.

40|$|This thesis {{sheds light}} on the causes and {{consequences}} of ethnic cleansing in the 20 th century Balkans with particular reference to the former Yugoslavia in the 1990 s. It suggests that although {{the causes of the}} expulsion of targeted ethnic minorities may be thought to be multifarious in so far as they may be traced inductively in past history, fear, security dilemmas, and ethnic nationalism - these correlations were not necessarily deterministic. This thesis argues that ethnic cleansing in the region was primarily a top down phenomenon and that it occurred when political leaders espoused it as a strategy of nation-state building. The politics of ethnic cleansing at the national level were intrinsically linked with the delineation of borders, control of territory and other resources, national security and the political organisation of the state with the view to granting rights and protections exclusively {{to the members of the}} dominant nation. Wars of ethnic cleansing were not autonomous but instead an instrument of policy - the state being central in their organisation and execution. Their central feature was coercion. Hence, military operations relied not on direct combat with opponents but on the demonstrative capacity of violence, which was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>compel</b> the targeted peoples to leave. Although the Western powers' reaction to the expulsion of ethno-national minorities in the course of the 20 th century has been inconsistent, the use of military means by the Western Alliance to reverse ethnic cleansing in Kosovo suggests that the policy of ethnic cleansing may no longer be countenanced, at least, in the European state system. In questioning the feasibility of creating states based on ethnic affinity as well as the validity of 'population transfers' and the partition of territory as viable tools of conflict resolution, the thesis establishes an agenda for policy making and future research...|$|R
