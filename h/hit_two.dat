Chelsea then travelled to face local rivals Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in the Fourth Round, where a controversial Mata penalty was enough to see them through.|$|E

5|$|Burrell hit a leadoff walk-off {{home run}} on April 7, 2002, in the 11th inning of a 3–2 {{victory over the}} Florida Marlins. Three days later, on April 10, Burrell hit a two-run walk-off {{home run in the}} 11th inning to give the Phillies a 7–5 victory over the Braves. He was the first player in the major leagues to <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> such home runs in a four-day period since Albert Belle did it in 1995, and he was the first Phillie to <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> such in a season since Von Hayes <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> in 1989. In May, he hit eight home runs, the most by a Phillie in May since {{teammate}} Mike Lieberthal hit eight in 1999. From June 2 through June 16, he had an 11-game hitting streak, his longest of the season. During the streak, on June 2, he tied a career-high with five RBI in an 18–3 victory over the Montreal Expos. Burrell had 22 home runs by the All-Star break, the most by a Phillie since Mike Schmidt had 31 by the 1979 All-Star break. On July 15, he hit a game-winning three-run home run against Matt Herges in an 11–8 victory over Montreal. He had two home runs, five RBI, and a grand slam in a 7–6 loss to the Dodgers on August 9. On August 30, Burrell had three RBI (including the game-winner) in a 7–5 victory over the Mets. He had his one hundredth RBI that day, becoming the first Phillie with 100 RBI by August 31 since Greg Luzinski did it in 1977. Burrell finished the season with career highs in almost every offensive category, including runs (96), batting average (.286), and games (157). He was the 12th Phillie with 30 home runs and 100 RBI in a season. His 37 home runs were seventh in the NL, and his 116 RBI were third, behind only Lance Berkman (128) and Albert Pujols (127). He was 14th in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting.|$|E

The Phillies ended the unofficial first half of their season with another loss, bowing to the Nationals 10–3 in the series' rubber match.|$|E

5|$|An {{isolated}} severe thunderstorm in {{the outer}} bands of Allison produced an F1 tornado in Worcester and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts, impacting over 100trees and damaging one house and one small camper. A microburst in Leominster and another in Shirley damaged several trees. Lightning from the storm <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> houses, causing significant damage there but little elsewhere. Allison also produced moderate rainfall in the state, mainly ranging from 3 to 5inches (75 to 125mm). The rainfall caused drainage and traffic problems. Damage in Massachusetts totaled to $400,000 (2001USD, $520,000 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|Harvey's {{departure}} at 5/294 {{meant that}} {{the first of the}} bowlers, Johnson, entered the ground. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting him into the crowd for four more sixes. Loxton <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 6/329. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93. Loxton appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Lindwall then made 77 to propel Australia to 458 on the fourth day, just 38 runs in arrears.|$|E

5|$|In an August 16 contest {{against the}} Marlins, Heyward <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> home runs {{for his first}} multi-home run game with the Cardinals. An {{important}} defensive play was on September 20 against the Cubs. With the bases loaded and no outs in the eighth inning, Addison Russell hit a fly ball that Heyward caught running and threw home to catcher Yadier Molina to tag out Anthony Rizzo by two steps, preserving a 4–3 win. In the second game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30, Heyward hit his second career grand slam in an 11–1 win, giving the Cardinals their 100th victory of the season while clinching their third consecutive National League Central division title. He also robbed both Francisco Cervelli and Michael Morse of hits in this game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ODI at the venue, Haynes scored 116 from 138 balls against New Zealand in 1985—the only {{century in the}} match. He {{is also one of}} only two players to <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> centuries in ODIs at the ground; scoring 117 not out from 132 balls against India in 1989. West Indian Brian Lara is the other batsman, with scores of 110 from 106 {{deliveries}} against England in 1998 and 116 from 106 balls against Sri Lanka in 2003. Australian Geoff Marsh became the first touring batsman to score an ODI century at the Kensington Oval, scoring 113 from 136 balls against the West Indies. Fellow countryman Adam Gilchrist holds the record for the highest ODI score with 149 from 104 deliveries, hit during the 2007 Cricket World Cup final against Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{came in at}} {{the start}} of the second day's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added, before falling at 7/86, part of a {{collapse}} of 5/27. He <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> sixes in his innings, including one from the first ball that he faced, feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost impossible in the difficult conditions. Australia ended at 101, and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury. Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire, 6/51. Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings, which followed a similar pattern to their first effort. Wickets fell steadily as Johnston (6/18) and Miller (3/49) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs.|$|E

He finished the English summer with 1,433runs at 51.17, the second highest average behind Harvey among batsmen with over 200runs. He was the only Australian to <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> double centuries and also took 45wickets at 22.51.

This {{was the first time}} a Major League pitcher had that combination of stats in a single game since Jack Coombs of the Philadelphia Athletics during the 1911 season. He was placed on the disabled list on May 19 with a lower back strain and returned from the injury on July 23. On September 16, he recorded his 1,000th strikeout {{as a member of the}} Red Sox against Tampa Bay's Ben Zobrist in the sixth inning. In 21 starts in 2010, he was 6–6 with a 5.78 ERA.|$|E

In May, Hanigan, plagued for nearly two weeks by a {{strained}} hamstring, was finally placed on the 15-day DL on May 28.

5|$|The only success the British {{managed to}} achieve was to damage both the Gneisenau and Scharnhorst (the latter seriously). Scharnhorst <b>hit</b> <b>two</b> mines, one at 14:31 GMT, and a further one at 21:34 GMT. Gneisenau also struck a mine at 18:55 GMT. Both ships {{recovered}} and steamed on. Scharnhost had been {{stopped dead in}} the water with engine damage after the first hit. The failure to alert Bomber Command earlier meant a chance was missed to deliver an attack on Scharnhorst when it was most vulnerable. The second and third mine hits came after nightfall, which enabled both vessels to avoid further attacks. The last RAF sighting of the ships had occurred at 18:00 GMT.|$|E
