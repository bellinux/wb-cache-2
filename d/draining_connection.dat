The proposed INA features a PMOS-NMOS complimentary transistor input pair biased in sub-threshold region to effectively boost the transconductance of the input pair and reduce the input referred noise. There are two embedded common-mode feedback circuits which help to establish the common-mode voltages without consuming extra power. One is at {{the output of the}} first stage (i. e. at the <b>drain</b> <b>connection</b> of the complimentary transistors) and the other at the final output stage. The INA provides a measured gain of 40 dB and a bandwidth of 11 kHz. The measured integrated noise is 0. 78 mu V-rms (50 mHz to 11 kHz) with measured CMRR of greater than 100 dB. The proposed amplifier is versatile and hence capable of conditioning various bio-potential signals like Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG) and Electrooculogram (EOG) as well as signals produced from sensors. A prototype chip has been fabricated in UMC 180 nm mixed-mode CMOS technology operating at 1. 8 V power supply and occupying an area of 415 x 230 mu m(2). The simulation and experimentally measured results are presented in this paper. NEF (noise efficiency factor) of 1. 88 is obtained from measurement results.

Therefore, Annular Centrifugal Contactors (ACCs) are destined to play a more important role for such future processing schemes. Previous efforts defined and characterized the performance of commercial 5 cm and 12. 5 cm single-stage ACCs in a “cold” environment. The next logical step, the design and evaluation of remote capable pilot scale ACCs in a “hot” or radioactive environment was reported earlier. This report includes the development of remote designs for ACCs that can process the large throughput rates needed in future nuclear fuel recycling plants. Novel designs were developed for the remote interconnection of contactor units, clean-in-place and <b>drain</b> <b>connections,</b> and a new solids removal collection chamber. A three stage, 12. 5 cm diameter rotor module has been constructed and evaluated for operational function and remote handling in highly radioactive environments. This design is scalable to commercial CINC ACC models from V- 05 to V- 20 with total throughput rates ranging from 20 to 650 liters per minute. The V- 05 R three stage prototype was manufactured by the commercial vendor for ACCs in the U. S., CINC mfg.

Hydraulic testing and functional checks were successfully conducted and then the prototype was evaluated for remote handling and maintenance suitability. Removal and replacement of the center position V- 05 R ACC unit in the three stage prototype was demonstrated using an overhead rail mounted PaR manipulator.

40|$|To {{obtain the}} power levels {{required}} from high RF power transistors, {{the size of}} the chip has often to be made so large that inductance of electrical connections inside the package cannot be neglected. This may have the effect that various parts of the transistor chip are not connected exactly parallel, i. e. drain and gate voltages and currents densities will not be the same on different parts of the chip. This may result in degraded output power and efficiency. The same effect may occur when more than one chip are connected in parallel in a transistor package to obtain even higher output power. Often the connections to the transistor package are approximated as a number of electrical point connections (normally three: gate, drain, source); meaning that each of them can be described by a single electrical potential and current. In reality, they may be large enough that voltage and current distributions have to be considered. These distributions will be affected by different mountings of the transistor and other connected components. In this work, the LDMOS power transistor MRF 6 S 21140 HR 3 was modeled using the segmentation method in high frequency signal simulation HFSS which is a 3 D Full-Wave Electromagnetic Field Simulation, and utilized the advanced design system ADS to find a parameterized lumped model. Both the electromagnetic and lumped models showed consistent results. Non-ideal parallel connection of sub-transistors on chip is very important, but further studies are needed for definite conclusion. It was verified through modeling that non ideal parallel connection of different chips in the package does have an effect; the effect however is quiet small which proves that the signal is slightly non-uniformly distributed between the three chips in the package. External <b>connection</b> to PCB (<b>drain</b> <b>connection</b> is considered in this work) can effectively be taken as a point connection to some approximation. The electrical behavior of the modeled transistor was studied through the design of a class B power amplifier in order to estimate the importance of performance degradation due to non-ideal parallel connections and how these non ideal connections degrade efficiency and output power. The modeled transistor can deliver a maximum output power of 147 watts and efficiency of 65 %. We have also studied the current distribution between the three chips in a three stage class B power amplifier. Again, the difference in the current distribution between the three chips turned out to be quiet small. All these results are presented through this work. The final conclusion regarding the current distribution between multichips cannot be made just based on these simulation results. The next step should be aimed at considering other effects, the thermal effect for example, in order to know exactly whether it is uniformly or not uniformly distributed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAgricultural tile {{drainage}} {{lines have been}} implicated {{as a source of}} pesticide contamination of surface waters. Field experiments were conducted and a simple model was developed to examine preferential transport of applied chemicals to agricultural tile lines. The conceptual model consists of two linear reservoirs, one near the soil surface and one near the tile <b>drain.</b> The <b>connection</b> between the two reservoirs is via preferential flow paths with very little interaction with the soil matrix. The model assumes that only part of the field contributes solutes to the tile drain. The model was evaluated with data from the field experiments in which chloride, 2, 4 -D, and atrazine concentrations were measured on eight tile-drained plots that were irrigated twice. Atrazine was applied two months prior to the experiment, 2, 4 -D was sprayed just before the first irrigation, and chloride before the second irrigation. All three chemicals were found in the tile effluent shortly after the rainfall began. Generally, the concentration increased with increased flow rates and decreased exponentially after the rainfall ceased. Although the simple model could simulate the observed chloride concentration patterns in the tile outflow for six of the eight plots, strict validation was not possible because of the difficulty with independent measurement of the data needed for a preferential flow model applied to field conditions. The results show that, to simulate pesticide concentration in tile lines, methods that can measure field averaged preferential flow characteristics need to be developed...|$|R

During normal development, the posterior portion of the median prosencephalic vein persists as the vein of Galen, while its anterior portion regresses in parallel {{with the formation of}} the internal cerebral veins (ICV). It has been traditionally thought that, in children with a VGAM, the deep venous system does not connect to and, a fortiori, does not drain into the ectatic median prosencephalic vein/vein of Galen. This report describes a case of successfully treated VGAM in which the drainage of an ICV into the vein of Galen was only demonstrated by follow-up MR imaging and venography.

A finite element model (FEM) was thus developed, using the vessel’s actual dimensions, its compliance Measurement and the diaphragmatic tissue’s elastic module.

40|$|Increased summer ice {{velocities}} on the Greenland {{ice sheet}} {{are driven by}} meltwater input to the subglacial environment. However, spatial patterns of surface input and partitioning of meltwater between different pathways to the base remain poorly understood. To further our understanding of surface drainage, we apply a supraglacial hydrology model to the Paakitsoq region, West Greenland for three contrasting melt seasons. During an average melt season, crevasses drain ~ 47 % of surface runoff, lake hydrofracture drains ~ 3 % during the hydrofracturing events themselves, while the subsequent surface-to-bed <b>connections</b> <b>drain</b> ~ 21 % and moulins outside of lake basins drain ~ 15 %. Lake hydrofracture forms the primary drainage pathway at higher elevations (above ~ 850 m) while crevasses drain {{a significant proportion of}} meltwater at lower elevations. During the two higher intensity melt seasons, model results show an increase (~ 5 and ~ 6 % of total surface runoff) in the proportion of runoff drained above ~ 1300 m relative to the melt season of average intensity.

Finally the high electric field breakdown and Johnson’s figure of merit suggest its use for devices with high power requirements, thus overcoming in many areas gallium arsenide technology. For many applications, such as MMIC (monolithic microwave integrated circuits) structures, gallium arsenide is preferable, mainly as a consequence of excellent charge transport properties and low loss at microwave and millimetre-wave frequencies. Furthermore, especially for commercial purposes, gallium arsenide is more used due to the well-established technology. Although the significant intrinsic properties, both gallium arsenide and gallium nitride HEMT technology are still affected by reliability issues which limit their performances in common applications. The purpose of this thesis is to study reliability topics which limit HEMT technology on the basis of materials used, namely GaAs, GaN, InAlN, in order to define corresponding limits and performances. With the aim of providing for a more complete perspective the analysis will focus not only on discrete transistors but it will be extended also on complete structures such as power amplifiers. Within this work we present a detailed study of two main degradation mechanisms which still affect GaAs technology and limit its performances both in discrete pHEMTs and in commercial complete structures: thermal degradation and electrostatic discharge failure. Thermal degradation analysis has been firstly studied on discrete structures, namely pseudomorphic HEMTs. A first purpose is to define main failure mechanisms and modes by means of a long term thermal stress with no bias applied. Several analysis (DC, pulsed, end resistances and barrier height evaluation) has been proposed to monitor devices behaviour. Degradation appears to be non-monotonic, i. e. drain current first decreases, then increases again, following the corresponding shifts in the threshold voltage. Although the initial decrease of drain current could be attributed to gate metal interdiffusion, or "gate sinking", leading to a positive shift of threshold voltage, it is accompanied by a variation of the maximum value of transconductance and an increase of end resistances, that suggest a concurrent degradation of ohmic contacts. A third mechanism, represented by the Schottky barrier height, counteracts the effect of gate interdiffusion and eventually prevails, leading to an opposite shift of the threshold voltage. Devices used for high power applications can reach high junction temperatures as a consequence of the power dissipation, demonstrating the importance of accurately defining the thermal resistance, i. e. the channel temperature variation as a function of power dissipated. A second purpose of this chapter is to provide for a detailed description of different techniques (namely DC, pulsed and infrared thermal camera) to estimate channel temperature of HEMTs and to present a critical comparison among them. Differently from DC and pulsed evaluation, analysis with IR thermal camera strongly underestimates the results. With the aim of understanding the impact of inaccuracies on a high frequency application the analysis has been extended to a four stage MMIC power amplifier. The strong underestimation of IR method has been confirmed; furthermore the thermal interaction among different stages and its impact on the structure has been studied. By means of a deep analysis of thermal resistance a HTOL test has been proposed on power amplifiers, submitting the devices both to an electrical and thermal stress and confirming that no significant effect is noticed if a junction temperature lower or equal to 250 °C is reached. Comparison between VTH shift in HTOL and thermal stress suggests that the junction temperature has been slightly underestimated. Electrostatic discharge robustness has been studied on a four stage MMIC power amplifier based on GaAs pHEMT technology used in commercial point to point microwave systems. The structure is characterized by a ESD protection circuit mainly defined by Schottky diodes protection structures at the gate terminals and resonant circuit protection structure at the RF input and output pads. Robustness has been analysed with a 100 ns TDR-TLP. Results have been confirmed with HBM and MM tests. No failures are observed in the RF-IN, RF-OUT and <b>Drain</b> <b>connections</b> vs. GND up to ± 2 kV and ± 200 V HBM and MM respectively. RF pads failed with TLP analysis at about 6. 5 - 7 A, resulting in an open circuit at the inductor and a short at the capacitor of the resonant structure. Gate connections fail in correspondence of the negative HBM pre-charge value starting from - 1. 0 kV; MM stresses lead to the failure of the Gate connections from - 50 V. Failures are due to the damage of anti-parallel Schottky diodes acting as ESD protection structures. The auxiliary connections reveal to be the most sensitive I/Os of the entire PA, failing at 250 V and 25 V, respectively HBM and MM, due to the failure of integrated resistors. A second part of the thesis mainly focuses on AlGaN/GaN devices. One of the main aspects which limit devices RF and power performances is the so-called current collapse and trapping effects. Therefore a detailed analysis has been proposed on devices characterized by a different iron doping in the buffer layer aimed at preventing parasitic effects and punch through phenomenon. The aim is to define a correlation between the trapping behaviour and iron doping in the buffer layer. A further purpose is to study the correlation between several degradation phenomena when a reliability stress is imposed, both in terms of DC characterization, trapping effects and light emission analysis. A comparison of the correlation between different degradation phenomena in devices with several iron doping quantities is finally proposed. Results are consistent with further investigations reported in literature which correlate the use of iron doping to a trap level with activation energy of 0. 57 - 0. 7 eV. The analysis firstly demonstrates that iron doping determines a measurable current collapse, which is related to the presence of a trap (T 1) located in the buffer with time constant of 3. 2 ms at T= 40 °C. Trapping location is consistent with the amplitude significant increase with Fe-concentration in the buffer. Furthermore trap T 1 reveals a lower activation energy in devices with no iron doping. The amplitude of trap T 1 in devices with different structures and comparison with works reported in literature suggest that the trap is due to an intrinsic defect in the buffer layer characteristic of GaN, although its concentration strongly depends on buffer doping quantity. Results of current transients with different filling pulses applied suggest that trapping is due to line defects or point defects clustering around dislocations. A second trap, T 2, is detected. According to comparison of devices with different iron doping and comparison with gm(f) analysis we can suppose that T 2, characterized by a time constant of 0. 25 s at T= 40 °C, is probably located in the AlGaN layer. Results of an electrical stress applied to the gate terminal of Fe doped devices indicate that the main consequences of the stress experiments are (i) an increase in the leakage gate current, which is strongly correlated to light emission and – beyond the critical voltage – to an increase in the current collapse and (ii) the increase in the transient signal associated with the pre-existing trap levels, without the generation of new traps. Discussion about different results related to the Fe doping buffer layer demonstrates that, when submitted to step-stress, all the devices show a significant and permanent increase in gate leakage current. Furthermore stress induces also an increase in current collapse, which is not correlated to the generation of new trap levels but originates from the increase in the signal associated with the pre-existing trap levels T 1 and T 2. The change in the signal of T 2 (which is supposed to be located in the AlGaN barrier) may be due to an increase in the concentration of a defect (T 2); the change of T 1, (probably located in the buffer layer) can be explained by the generation of defect-related conductive paths between the gate and the channel which enhance transfer electrons toward the trap states. In the last part new materials to improve GaN technology performances are studied. InAlN/GaN structures are becoming very important as a consequence of the higher carrier density in the 2 DEG and the possible achievement of a lattice matched structure, thus significantly improving device electrical and thermal stability. Further improvements, especially at the contacts, will be presented within this thesis. A first analysis consists of the use of a different material for the Schottky gate contact. A comparison of InAlN/GaN HEMTs with analogous structure but different gate, namely Mo/Au and Ni/Pt/Au, is studied. Despite no significant variation is noticed during DC analysis, pulsed evaluation demonstrates that the use of a Mo/Au gate contact leads to an improvement of trapping characteristics, mainly due to the process used for contact deposition. By means of a three terminals step stress it is finally proved that Mo/Au does not significantly affect device stability. A second analysis consists of the definition of a recess before the deposition of ohmic contacts to reduce parasitic resistances. The comparison is proposed for two different wafer, characterized by a similar but not analogous structure and different Carbon doping quantity to avoid parasitic leakage current. DC analysis shows that a significant variation is noticed in IDSS value, showing that a lower value corresponds to structures with recess at the ohmic contacts. This aspect is mainly due to the fact that a lower on resistance measured in linear zone is not obtained. Pulsed analysis states a high current collapse value with no significant correlation with device structure or presence of recess at the ohmic contacts. Drain current transient reveals two main traps, labelled T 1 and T 2. Activation energy, differently from the cross section value, is not influenced by device structure or by recess at the ohmic contacs. On the basis of drain current transients, gm(f) analysis and previous works reported in literature we can speculate that trap T 2 is located in the buffer layer, differently from trap T 1 which is probably in the AlGaN layer. Filling time measurements indicate that both the traps are mainly due to line defects. ...|$|R
