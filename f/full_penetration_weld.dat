The failure mode was local buckling in the flange edge between beam flange and steel tube because of local stress concentration. When the joint was damaged, the stress of weld (including full penetration, partial penetration, and twin fillet weld) between steel tube and interior strengthening ring is smaller than yield strength.

40|$|After {{the central}} {{calorimeter}} was {{installed on the}} center beam a cracked weld {{was found on the}} bridge. The weld was a partial penetration between the top rail plate and the T- 1 steel nose section. The crack is fully across the width of the rail plate and the rail is depressed in a concave shape. That is, the depression is deeper in the center and feathers out to zero {{at the end of the}} rail. Upon close inspection it was obvious that there was no penetration of weld metal into the T- 1 material. The assumption is that the T- 1 was not properly pre-heated before welding. The reason for the concave depression comes from the fact that the rail plate rests on the flanges of the 'S' beams and that during welding the plate pulled off the beams. This weld failure can not propagate to any other welds and therefore, will not start a chain of failures. Clearly the failure of this weld did not hinder the installation of the central calorimeters. This weld failure occurred on both sides of the bridge. This failure did, however, alert us to check the critical weld on the bridge, S-beam webs to T- 1 nose section, to assure us we had a sound weldment. (Note: it must be used again for both EC's).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Weld quality features are difficult or impossible to directly measure and control during welding, therefore indirect methods are necessary. Penetration {{is the most important}} geometric feature since in most applications it is the most significant factor affecting joint strength. Observation of penetration is only possible from the back face of the <b>full</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>weld.</b> In all other cases, since direct measurement of depth of penetration is not possible, real time control of penetration in the Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process by sensing conditions at the top surface of the joint is necessary. This continues to be a major area of interest for automation of the process. The objective of this research has been to develop an on-line intelligent process control model for GMAW, which can monitor and control the welding process. The model uses measurement of the temperature at a point {{on the surface of the}} workpiece to predict the depth of penetration being achieved, and to provide feedback for corrective adjustment of welding variables. Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic technologies have been used to achieve a reliable Neuro-Fuzzy control model for GMAW of a typical closed butt joint having 60 ° Vee edge preparation. The neural network model predicts the surface temperature expected for a set of fixed and adjustable welding variables when a prescribed level of penetration is achieved. This predicted temperature is compared with the actual surface temperature occurring during welding, as measured by an infrared sensor. If there is a difference between the measured temperature and the temperature predicted by the neural network, a fuzzy logic model will recommend changes to the adjustable welding variables necessary to achieve the desired weld penetration. Large scale experiments to obtain data for modelling and for model validation, and various other modelling studies are described. The results are used to establish the relationships between the output surface temperature measurement, welding variables and the corresponding achieved weld quality criteria. The effectiveness of the modelling methodology in dealing with fixed or variable root gap has also been tested. The result shows that the Neuro-fuzzy models are capable of providing control of penetration to an acceptable degree of accuracy, and a potential control response time, using modestly powerful computing hardware, of the order of one hundred milliseconds. This is more than adequate for real time control of GMAW. The application potential for control using these models is significant since, unlike many other top surface monitoring methods, it does not require sensing of the highly transient weld pool shape or surface...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{functional}} requirement of a structural detail brackets {{with and without}} scallop are frequently used in bridges, decks, ships and offshore structure. Scallops are designed to serve as passage way for fluids, to reduce weld length and plate distortions. Moreover, scallops are used to avoid intersection {{of two or more}} welds for {{the fact that there is}} the presence of inventible inherent initial crack except for full penetrated weld and the formation of multi-axial stress state at the weld intersection. Welding all around the scallop corner increase the possibility of brittle fracture even for the case the bracket is not loaded by primary load. Avoiding of scallop will establish an initial crack in the corner if bracket is welded by fillet welds. If the two weld run pass had crossed, this would have given a 3 D residual stress situation. Therefore the presences and absence of scallop necessitates the 3 D FEA fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using effective notch stress approach (). FEMAP 10. 1 with NX NASTRAN was used for the 3 D FEA. The first and main objective of this research was to investigate and compare the fatigue resistance of brackets with and without scallop. The secondary goal was the fatigue design of scallops in case they cannot be avoided for some reason. The fatigue resistance for both types of brackets was determined based on approach using 1 mm fictitiously rounded radius based on IIW recommendation. Identical geometrical, boundary and loading conditions were used for the determination and comparison of fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using linear 3 D FEA. Moreover the size effect of bracket length was also studied using 2 D SHELL element FEA. In the case of brackets with scallop the flange plate weld toe at the corner of the scallop was found to exhibit the highest and made the flange plate weld toe critical for fatigue failure. Whereas weld root and weld toe at the weld intersections were the highly stressed location for brackets without scallop. Thus weld toe for brackets with scallop, and weld root and weld toe for brackets without scallop were found to be the critical area for fatigue failure. Employing identical parameters on both types of brackets, brackets without scallop had the highest except for full penetrated weld. Furthermore the fatigue resistance of brackets without scallop was highly affected by the lack of weld penetration length and it was found out that decreased as the weld penetration was increased. Despite the fact that the very presence of scallop reduces the stiffness and also same time induce stress concentration, based on the 3 D FEA it is worth concluding that using scallop provided better fatigue resistance when both types of brackets were fillet welded. However brackets without scallop had the highest fatigue resistance when <b>full</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>weld</b> was used. This thesis also showed that weld toe for brackets with scallop was the only highly stressed area unlike brackets without scallop in which both weld toe and weld root were the critical locations for fatigue failure when different types of boundary conditions were used. Weld throat thickness, plate thickness, scallop radius, lack of weld penetration length, boundary condition and weld quality affected the fatigue resistance of both types of brackets. And as a result, bracket design procedure, especially welding quality and post weld treatment techniques significantly affect the fatigue resistance of both type of brackets...|$|E

In this way, {{it was possible to}} quantify the minimum crack size that shall be detected by a structural health monitoring system, {{in order to maintain the}} structure within a reasonable time interval...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using Tandem Gas Metal Arc Welding (T-GMAW) to produce <b>full</b> <b>penetration</b> butt <b>welds</b> in 5 mm ship panel steel plates has been assessed and {{compared to the}} current Submerged Arc Welding (SAW) process. Experiments conducted show that the T-GMAW process is feasible and demonstrated a significant improvement over the SAW process in several areas including higher travel speed, a reduction in filler material, significantly lower post weld distortion, and a smaller Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), while maintaining similar microstructure and mechanical properties in the weld metal and HAZ...|$|R
50|$|Spiral welding is {{a process}} where a {{continuous}} <b>full</b> <b>penetration</b> MIG <b>weld</b> overlay is used to rebuild damage from wear, erosion, corrosion or cracking, or to increase the dimensions of a component to match an increased dimension on a mating part. Using the Spiral weld process eliminates the possible distortion of the component due to unbalanced stresses from normal welding processes. Spiral welding is a low energy input process, during which individual layers of weld and their associated heat affected zones are tempered and the grain structures refined by subsequent and overlapping temper beads.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model was developed to numerically analyse the temperature and fluid flow during laser butt welding, and a heat source model was proposed, which, with adjustment, was suitable for both partial and <b>full</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>welds</b> {{over a wide range}} of conditions. The models were then used to study the laser welding of a 4 mm thickness aluminum alloy (AA 5083), and the results predicted were analysed to better understand the formation of porosity in aluminium laser welds. The flow patterns predicted in the melt pool are essentially the same for various welding parameters: vortices can be found close to the surfaces of the weld pool (top surface only for partial penetration; both top and bottom surfaces for <b>full</b> <b>penetration).</b> The dimensions of the weld pool are predicted to increase with increasing laser power and decreasing welding speed, and the maximum velocity to increase with increasing laser power and welding speed. In partial penetration cases, there are no simple relations between porosity levels and laser power and welding speed. A sharp decrease in porosity content, when changing from partial to <b>full</b> <b>penetration,</b> was thought to be a result of an extra driving force from the outwards fluid flow at the weld pool bottom for the pores to escape out of the melt pool. In <b>full</b> <b>penetration</b> cases, the lower porosity content when using higher laser power and/or lower welding speed was attributed to the longer time for pores to escape before the weld pool solidifies...|$|R
