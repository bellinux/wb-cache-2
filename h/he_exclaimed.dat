25|$|When Mar Ukba {{was about}} to die, he asked to see his charity accounts. Finding gifts worth 7,000 Sijan gold denarii {{recorded}} therein, <b>he</b> <b>exclaimed</b> that the provisions were scanty and the road was long, and he forthwith distributed half of his wealth to charity. The Gemara asked how Mar Ukba could have given away so much, when Rabbi Elai taught that when the Sanhedrin sat at Usha, it ordained that if a person wishes to give liberally the person should not give more than {{a fifth of the}} person's wealth. The Gemara explained that this limitation applies only during a person's lifetime, as the person might thereby be impoverished, but the limitation does not apply to gifts at death.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack for Monaco was {{composed}} by Grammy-nominated Austin Wintory, {{who had previously}} worked as the composer for games such as flOw and Journey. The original soundtrack and a remixed album called Gentleman's Private Collection were released on April 24, 2013.

The Gentleman's Private Collection contains remixes of the original soundtrack by other notable composers, including Peter Hollens, Tina Guo who played the violin in the Journey soundtrack, and Chipzel who composed the soundtrack for Super Hexagon. When Wintory was approached by Schatz, he was excited by the request because it involved using humorous [...] "old-timey piano". [...] "When else am I {{ever going to be}} asked to write anything remotely like this?", <b>he</b> <b>exclaimed.</b> Schatz originally wanted to use licensed music thinking that the project was too small to warrant its own soundtrack, but after discussions, Wintory persuaded him that an original soundtrack was warranted.

His students and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing: hypnotic in private interaction, but often frigid in more public settings. His associates fell into two camps: one that saw him as an aloof and impressive genius and aesthete, the other that saw him as a pretentious and insecure poseur. His students almost always fell into the former category, adopting his walk, speech, and other mannerisms, and even his inclination for reading entire texts in their original languages.

After the trial painting was finished, he was transferred to the fortress prison Blauwkapel. Van Meegeren was released from prison in January or February 1946.|$|E

Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times exclaimed the track [...] "has a swooning charm, with a chimes-studded texture that suggests the sweeping light-points of a disco ball." [...] Mikael Wood of Baltimore City Paper gave a similar critique, saying the [...] "luscious slow jam" [...] ultimately [...] "shimmers with the sweet lovesickness Karen Carpenter {{had to fight}} through a scrim of suburban sang-froid to express." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared the song [...] "on the slower side", containing [...] "a verse that's memorable." [...] Plugged In observed subtle sexuality within its lyrics, commenting that Jackson is insatiable. The song's production from West also received acclaim. Music critic Kevin Nottingham ranked it as West's second best production, classifying it as a [...] "gorgeous piece of work."

Klepacki scored {{the game with}} a Korg TR Rack, Novation Nova desktop, and Roland XV-5080. Red Alert 2 {{included}} a remix of [...] "Hell March". The return to high-energy songs was owed in part to fan criticism of Tiberian Sun. Klepacki maintained the energetic style in Red Alert 2s expansion pack Yuri's Revenge. For —the next entry in the series—Klepacki tried to update the style of the original Command & Conquer by making it [...] "hipper and more elaborate." [...] Several Command & Conquer mainstays appear as reworked versions, including Target (Mechanical Man), Industrial, Act on Instinct, and No Mercy.

Klepacki's last contribution to Westwood Studios was the music of Earth & Beyond, comprising four albums of material. Acquired by Electronic Arts in 1998, Westwood was liquidated in 2002 and the remaining employees were relocated to EA Los Angeles. Several Westwood founders left the company.
