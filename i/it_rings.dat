Not one {{to want to}} be typecast Tytla {{requested}} as {{his next}} assignment Dumbo (namesake star of the 1941 film), the baby elephant ridiculed and rejected because of his big ears. This time his reference was his own infant son, Peter. The intent was to do something nontheatrical and sincere, to try to put the personality of a human child into that of an elephant so that <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> true. His son, Peter Tytla, has grown up to become a collage artist focusing on images made from photographs of junk cars.|$|E
500|$|... 2002–03: A bell in {{the center}} of the screen reveals the seconds which then zoom out as <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> along two other bells at the side. This {{countdown}} was also based on the 2000 version. After 20 seconds, the screen did not show the remaining time due to an error thus forcing it to shut off. This caused some people to count down off time. However, the screens placed at the bottom still showed the countdown clock from 1999.|$|E

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three-and-a-half stars, calling it [...] "one of the year's best" [...] and saying that it [...] "doesn't ring cartoonish, <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> true."

Many complimented the song's piano-driven melody, {{as well as}} Carey's vocals, while some felt it was too similar to her previous single, [...] "We Belong Together" [...] (2005). In his review of E=MC², Kevin O'Hare of The Republican wrote that Carey [...] "shines" [...] on the song, while Fox News' Roger Friedman described it as [...] "a killer ballad." [...] Peoples Chuck Arnold named it the best ballad on the album, calling it [...] "pretty". The Houston Chronicles writer Joey Guerra described the single as a [...] "gently grooving ballad that Janet Jackson should be recording instead of wasting her time on tired sex clichés", while commenting, [...] "It's doubtful, however, that Jackson could reach the notes Carey effortlessly hits {{at the end of}} the song". Richard Cromelin from the Los Angeles Times highlighted Carey's raw form of singing on the track, writing, [...] "its unadorned, and her voice is almost leathery in the lower notes. It's not flattering, but <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> true emotionally." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy called [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] a [...] "fairly modern Mariah track" [...] and that although he believed it was a [...] "retread" [...] of one of Carey's previous singles [...] "We Belong Together" [...] (2005), it is not an [...] "unpleasant retread".|$|E

2500|$|Three months later, Texarkana Gazette {{reporter}} Lucille Holland {{was flown}} to Frederick {{by a man}} named Paul Burns to interview her. By the time of the interview, officers had not publicly linked Larey's attack with the recent murders. The report appeared in the May 10 edition of the Texarkana Gazette. Larey said [...] "I would know his voice anywhere. <b>It</b> <b>rings</b> always in my ears. Why didn't he kill me too? He killed so many others." [...] She described her attacker as a light-skinned black man, which was different from Hollis' belief that he was a dark-tanned white man. After the first double murder, Larey went to Texarkana to talk to the police in hopes they would connect the incidents and help identify the murderer, but the Rangers questioned her and insisted she knew who her attacker was. After the second double murder, a Texas Ranger went to Frederick to question her again. Larey, native to Oklahoma, died in Billings, Montana of cancer in 1965 at the age of 38.|$|E

When the wound was made, & the instrument was withdrawn, the pain seemed undiminished, for the air that suddenly rushed into those delicate parts felt like a mass of minute but sharp & forked poniards, that were tearing the edges of the wound. I concluded the operation was over – Oh no! presently the terrible cutting was renewed – & worse than ever, to separate the bottom, the foundation of this dreadful gland from the parts to which it adhered – Again all description would be baffled – yet again all was not over, – Dr. Larry rested but his own hand, & – Oh heaven! – I then felt the knife (rack)ling against the breast bone – scraping it! ...|$|E
