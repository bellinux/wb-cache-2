50|$|Equally {{significant}} in IBM's revival was its successful reentry into the popular mindset. Part of this revival {{was based on}} IBM technology. On October 5, 1992, at the COMDEX computer expo, IBM announced the first ThinkPad laptop computer, the 700c. The ThinkPad, a premium machine which then cost US$4350, included a 25 MHz Intel 80486SL processor, a 10.4-inch active matrix display, removable 120 MB hard drive, 4 MB RAM (expandable to 16 MB) and a TrackPoint II pointing device. The striking black design by noted designer Richard Sapper made the ThinkPad an immediate hit with the <b>digerati,</b> and the cool factor of the ThinkPad brought {{back some of the}} cachet to the IBM brand that was lost in the PC wars of the 1980s. Instrumental to this popular resurgence was the 1997 chess match between IBM's chess-playing computer system Deep Blue and reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov. Deep Blue's victory was a historic first for a computer over a reigning world champion. Also helping the company reclaim its position as a technology leader was its annual domination of supercomputer rankings and patent leadership statistics. Ironically, a serendipitous contributor in reviving the company's reputation was the Dot-com bubble collapse in 2000, where many of the edgy technology high flyers of the 1990s failed to survive the downturn. These collapses discredited some of the more fashionable Internet-driven business models that stodgy IBM was previously compared against.|$|E

In the run-up to Obama 2 ̆ 7 s inauguration as the forty-fourth President of the United States (POTUS), there was considerable coverage in the global media concerning the fate of his beloved BlackBerry.

40|$|The {{roots of}} digital {{creativity}} Despite {{the claims of}} the <b>digerati,</b> the idea of "digital culture " is quite young, and continues to be contested. There remains a deep-rooted aversion and rift between the reality of computers and {{what used to be called}} "cultural life". Partly this is a question of cultural heritage, of different domains and distance. Computers and information technology have traditionally been tools for administration and scientific calculation. Yet, there have been efforts to bring technology into close contact with the pursuit and tradition of humanism and the creative spirit. The utopian impulse to increase and qualitatively improve human life and society with information technology dates mainly to the 1960 s. This short paper is a quick look into the landscape of digital culture, mainly from a cultural studies perspective. As anyone familiar with the history of hypermedia knows, an article by Vannevar Bush, published in The Atlantic Monthly already in July 1945, is heralded as the first exposition of the field's key ideas. "Memex", as Bush called it, was conceived as an "intimate supplement " to an individual's memory; the key idea was the process of tying together two items from the increasingly overwhelming store of information. This concept of "associative indexing " was later explored an...|$|E
40|$|In The Virtual, Rob Shields puts {{virtuality}} in {{with the}} key categories of contemporary social theory such as subjectivity, agency, structure, and the spaces and temporalities between the modern and the postmodern. Shields has rescued the term {{and the idea of}} the virtual from utopian futurists like Howard Rheingold and Nicholas Negroponte who use it to hype emergent technologies and forms of culture as the magical vehicles and entry points to new worlds and identities. The works of these <b>digerati,</b> ideologues for multimedia technology and culture, now appear ideological, outdated, and no more than huckstering of the new when confronted with the current state of affairs in the technoculture and its attendant war- and terrorism-torn world. Dreams of total sensory immersion and dildonics never materialized, and in fact may be both unlikely and undesirable. Thus the virtual now often appears as a fantasy and ideology but, as Shields argues, may well be a salient category for social theory and contemporary culture. Shields, along with Pierre Lévy (1998, 2002), avoids and deflates the virtual reality hype and provides a much-needed historical scrutiny, conceptual analysis and empirical exploration of the various domains of the virtual in the worlds of work, play, youth and a multitude of dimensions of everyday life. Yet, although Shields usefully contextualizes the virtual within previous form...|$|E
40|$|Our essay historicises {{the term}} “podcast” and offers some new {{contexts}} {{for understanding the}} history of the term, the practices it designates and its relation to broadcasting. [4] [4] The paper proceeds in four sections. We first analyse the origins and emergence of the word podcasting among the press and the <b>digerati.</b> We dispute the standard argument that podcasting’s main innovation is a marriage of RSS and Apple’s iPod by presenting podcasting as a practice that arose from a network of actors, technologies and behaviours. In the second section, we discuss how podcasting works and why we need to look beyond distribution to understand its historical emergence. In the third section of the essay, we connect podcasting with the development of affordable and easytouse consumer audio production software and hardware, technologies that are necessary (though not sufficient) preconditions for podcasting to offer greater access for audiences and producers than traditional models of broadcasting. We conclude by examining the implicit contrast between “podcasting” and “broadcasting” in order to trouble the commonsensical definition of broadcasting and thereby reopen some basic questions about who is entitled to communicate and by which techniques. While podcasting is neither a complete break from broadcasting nor part of any kind of revolution, it is the realisation of an alternate cultural model of broadcasting. The practice of podcasting thus offers us an opportunity to rethink the connections between broadcasting and other kinds of media practices and to reexamine the political and cultural questions broadcasting presents...|$|E
