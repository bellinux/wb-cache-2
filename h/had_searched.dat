Disillusioned with the Qing Dynasty's heavy handed approach against the Boxer Rebellion where Chinese Christians were specially targeted for murder, Wong Nai Siong decided {{to search for}} a new settlement overseas, focusing on areas in South East Asia. Previously, in September 1899, he <b>had</b> <b>searched</b> fruitlessly in Malaya and Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police <b>had</b> <b>searched</b> the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E

5|$|The marine {{engineer}} and amateur historian Anders Franzén <b>had</b> <b>searched</b> for old Swedish wrecks in the Baltic since the 1940s and became nationally renowned after he located Vasa in 1956. Kronan {{was one of}} several famous shipwrecks on a list of potential wreck sites that he had compiled. For almost 30 years Franzén and others scoured archives and probed the seabed off the west coast of Öland. During the 1950s and 1960s the team searched off Hulterstad by dragging, and later followed up with sonar scans. In 1971 planks believed to belong to Kronan were located, but the lead could not be followed up properly at the time. Later in the 1970s the search area was narrowed down with a sidescan sonar and a magnometer, an instrument that detects the presence of iron. With the two instruments the team pinned down a likely location, and in early August 1980, sent down underwater cameras to reveal the first pictures of Kronan.|$|E

Other reports reveal that her family also neglected to report her missing, as some of the family members, including Margarita, were apparently illegal immigrants. They feared that if it was discovered that some were in the country illegally during the course of an investigation, they would be deported.|$|E
25|$|In September 1918, Haarmann is {{believed}} to have killed a 14-year-old named Hermann Koch; a youth who disappeared just weeks prior to Friedel Rothe, his first confirmed victim. Haarmann is known to have kept company with Koch; he is also known to have written a letter to Koch's school providing an explanation for the youth's prolonged absence. As had been the case in the disappearance of Friedel Rothe, police <b>had</b> <b>searched</b> Haarmann's Cellerstraße apartment in search of the youth, although no trace of Koch was found and charges against Haarmann in relation to the disappearance were dropped. Koch's father had petitioned in 1921 for Haarmann to be tried for his son's murder; however, his requests were officially rejected.|$|E

25|$|This air {{of mystery}} was {{increased}} when CRASH magazine published a reader's photograph of Lunar Jetman featuring Jetman's moon rover pulling a trailer. The possible {{existence of a}} trailer (as depicted on the game's cover art and loading screen) had been speculated on since the game's release, and many fans <b>had</b> <b>searched</b> fruitlessly for it. The Stampers shrugged off questions about whether this screen shot was genuine, but stopped short of actually denying it. There have even been suggestions that Ultimate themselves may have created the screen shot to generate more interest in the game. It has since been proven that Lunar Jetman's 48K of code does not contain graphics for a trailer.|$|E
25|$|On 7 July 2000, Michael Rutland and Gordon Heritage were metal {{detecting}} in a {{field in}} Monkston, Milton Keynes {{at the invitation of}} local archaeologists who were closing a nearby dig, when they discovered the hoard. They immediately informed the archaeologists (Brian Giggins and Paul and Charmian Woodfield) an action which was later cited as imperative in preserving the historical context of the find. Hayley Bullock of the British Museum was also praised for acting quickly to preserve the site and expedite excavation. The metal detectorists who found the hoard were rewarded with 60% of the value after the authorities decided that the landowners' claim that the finders <b>had</b> <b>searched</b> without permission was unfounded.|$|E

Also on June 27, the defense called two private investigators who, in November 2008, <b>had</b> <b>searched</b> the area where the body was later found. The search was videotaped, but nothing was found. On June28, the defense called a Texas EquuSearch team leader who did two searches of the area and found no body. The defense then called Roy Kronk, who recounted the same basic story he told police about his discovery of Caylee Anthony's remains in December 2008. He acknowledged receiving $5,000 after the remains were identified, but denied that he told his son that finding the body would make him rich and famous. The next day, his son testified he had made such statements.|$|E

25|$|While {{he was in}} Erzurum, Pietschmann was {{witness to}} the Armenian Genocide {{carried out by the}} local {{government}} authorities. When the Germans and Austrians withdrew their forces from the front, Pietschmann was forced to leave Erzurum on 18 June 1915 by the German consul of Erzurum, Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter. Pietschmann was accompanied by Carl Schlimme, an assistant of Scheubner-Richter. They were told by the consul to take an Armenian family along and help them find refuge. In Bayburt, they were stopped by Turkish soldiers and ordered to surrender the Armenian family. When they refused, the caravan drivers were apprehended. Consequently, Pietschmann and Schlimme were forced to drive the caravans themselves. When Turkish soldiers demanded the Armenian family once more, Pietschmann and Schlimme confronted them with guns and thus secured a passage for themselves out of Bayburt, headed towards Erzincan. Upon arrival in Erzincan, the Armenian family was apprehended and stationed in a local prison under the pretext of concealing weapons in their belongings. According to Schlimme, this was a false accusation since he <b>had</b> <b>searched</b> their belongings for any sort of weapon himself.|$|E
