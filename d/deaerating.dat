5000|$|... ==Deaeration of feed water== Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide {{are removed}} from the feed water by deaeration. Deaeration can be {{accomplished}} by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In <b>deaerating</b> heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) <b>Deaerating</b> heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two <b>deaerating</b> heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type <b>deaerating</b> heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type <b>deaerating</b> heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|E

Swelling of 110 to 120 % of soybeans was obtained 10 and 15 to 16 hours in <b>deaerated</b> and distilled water, respectively. This means that swelling time using <b>deaerated</b> water was {{about two-thirds of}} that of distilled water. Changes in weights and hardness of soybeans during soaking showed the same tendency to that of moisture contents in both water. The average lipid contents and its composition {{were not significantly different}} between two kinds of water. The proportion of phospholipids of soybeans soaked in <b>deaerated</b> water for up to 12 hours was greater than that soaked in distilled water, whereas there were no differences in the amounts of free fatty acids and fatty acid compositions between two kinds of water. Among peroxide value (POV), carbonyl value (COV) and 2 -thiobarbituric acid value (TBAV), POV showed a significant difference between <b>deaerated</b> and distilled water (p< 0. 05). These results show that lipid oxidation rather than hydrolysis occurred during swelling process of soybeans at 20 ℃.

The cathodic reaction of AZ 31 Mg alloy {{depends on the}} hydrogen evolution and the oxygen reduction in nondeaerated media, while that is dominanted by the hydrogen evolution in <b>deaerated</b> media. In the potentiostatic measurements in <b>deaerated</b> media, the current density reached a peak during the initial immersion and then showed a stepwise decrease getting into the passivation state by a homogeneous distribution of the Mg(OH) 2 product with increasing polarization time. It revealed that AZ 31 alloy has a better corrosion resistance in <b>deaerated</b> media after long immersion. In the 0. 01 mol/L solution, passivation zone was observed in <b>deaerated</b> media polarization up to 1 : 35 V (vs. SCE) while the corrosion and passivation zones were occurred in nondeaerated media. Potentiodynamic measurements in the 0. 01 mol/L NaCl solution containing various concentrations NaHCO 3 showed that the corrosion behavior of AZ 31 alloy depends on the NaHCO 3 concentration.

The influence of impurity, alloying element, and oxygen on corrosion potential, rate, and pitting was examined in alkaline media saturated with Mg(OH) 2 at pH 9 and 25 °C.

40|$|The wear {{behavior}} of a forged Co- 29 Cr- 6 Mo alloy without any Ni and C added has been investigated by using a tribosystem consisting of a pin-on-disc type wear testing machine in distilled water containing different dissolved oxygen content. Dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water was controlled by aerating with oxygen or by <b>deaerating</b> with argon. Wear volume in the distilled water containing high oxygen content is approximately two times larger than in that containing low oxygen content. Accordingly, it is deduced that the overall wear volume is significantly affected by the dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water surrounding the tribosystem. Although abrasive wear, caused by wear debris, is operative as a wear mechanism in the present tribosystem irrespective of oxygen content, {{the transfer of the}} wear debris to sliding surfaces, as well as the aggregation of the wear debris on the sliding surfaces, is more prone to occur during the wear process with the lower oxygen content. Therefore, in the present tribosystem with the lower oxygen content, since the transfer of the wear debris to the disc or the pin readily occurs, the generation of the wear debris does not directly contribute to the wear volume, leading to the apparently lower wear volume in the tribosystem with lower oxygen content than in that with higher oxygen content; the transfer of the wear debris is not counted as wear loss because the wear volume is estimated based on the loss in disc and pin weight that occurs during the wear test.

40|$|The Rankine cycles for {{commercial}} parabolic trough solar projects range in capacity from 13. 5 MWe at the Solar Electric Generating Station I (SEGS I) plant, {{to a maximum}} of 89 MWe at the SEGS VIII/IX plants. The series of SEGS projects showed a consistent reduction in the levelized energy cost due to a combination of improvements in collector field technology and economies of scale in both the Rankine cycle and the operation and maintenance costs. Nonetheless, the question of the optimum Rankine cycle capacity remains an open issue. The capacities of the SEGS VIII/IX plants were limited by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act requirements to a maximum net output of 80 MWe. Further improvements in the Rankine cycle efficiency, and economies of scale in both the capital and the operating cost, should be available at larger plant sizes. An analysis was conducted to determine the effect of Rankine cycle capacities greater than 80 MWe on the levelized energy cost. The study was conducted through the following steps: (1) Three gross cycle capacities of 88 MWe, 165 MWe, and 220 MWe were selected. (2) Three Rankine cycle models were developed using the GateCycle program. The models were based on single reheat turbine cycles, with main steam conditions of 1, 450 lb{sub f}/in{sup 2 } and 703 F, and reheat steam conditions of 239 lb{sub f}/in{sup 2 } and 703 F.
