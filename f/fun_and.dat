5|$|The attacks {{influenced}} Hamasaki's lyrical {{and musical}} direction, {{and had made}} her decide to create more worldly-inspired music. The EP utilizes dance and pop music, with each song being influenced by pop rock, electronica, and trip hop music. Like Rainbow, it contains ambient-influenced sounds such as handclaps and cheering. The lyrical content deals with freedom, <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> sadness, continuing themes seen on her previous album.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E

5|$|Developments in the New York {{new school}} {{continuum}} {{in this climate}} were represented by the Native Tongues groups—The Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah and Monie Love—along with fellow travellers like Leaders of the New School, KMD and Brand Nubian. They moved away from aggressive, macho posturing, towards ambiguity, <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> Afrocentricity. Their music was sample-crowded, more open and accessible than their new school predecessors. De La Soul's debut sampled everyone from The Turtles to Steely Dan, while A Tribe Called Quest matched tough beats to mellow jazz samples and playful, thoughtful raps.|$|E
5|$|Jones had {{previously}} developed a gruesome game called Go to Hell. In an interview Jones {{stated that he}} developed the game for his own amusement; he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game. The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics. Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> akin to a horror movie by others.|$|E
5|$|Krishna's {{childhood}} {{illustrates the}} Hindu concept of lila, playing for <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> enjoyment {{and not for}} sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to {{the banks of the}} Yamuna River, and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{idea for}} the game was {{inspired}} by , a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix half-jokingly by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, {{some aspects of the}} music, and a weak and confusing plot. Despite these flaws, in general they found the game to be <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> addictive, and to {{have a great deal of}} replay value.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} component was criticized, with Polygon {{calling it}} one of the least necessary multiplayer additions to a typically single-player experience. The gameplay was described as a mediocre shooter, incapable of supporting the necessary use of guns by its villains and with poor control of movement. GameSpot noted that poor weapon accuracy and movement controls made the thugs seem weak and inept, while playing as the heroes lacked empowerment because of more restrictive combat ability and less resistance to damage. Other reviewers called the experience <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> hectic, but lacking sufficient depth to retain long-term interest.|$|E
5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E

5|$|Allgame gave {{positive}} {{reviews of}} the game. It said that game includes everything from hidden items, simplistic gameplay, <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> replay value, and basic but good-looking graphics. Defunct Games called Wonder Boy in Monster Land the most challenging game in the Wonder Boy series, noting the lack of passwords or continues in the Master System version, the relatively few chances to earn extra lives, and a time limit. The review said {{that the ability to}} earn gold and upgrade equipment which are laid out in the status screen tremendously adds to the replay value. It praised the responsive, though sometimes not precise, controls and the tight hit detection. Moreover, it said that the graphics were colorful and that it complemented the music and its simplistic sound effects well. Overall, the review said that the game is recommended for Master System and platforming fans alike.|$|E
