5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than the others to indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> a hammer representing industry and a female <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E

5|$|Other folklore, first {{recorded}} in the Victorian era, associates the <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> fertility. In the past locals would erect a maypole on the earthwork, around which childless couples would dance to promote fertility. According to folk belief, a woman who sleeps on the figure will be blessed with fecundity, and infertility may be cured through sexual intercourse {{on top of the}} figure, especially the phallus.|$|E
5|$|Recently, he {{has become}} a less obscure <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> the {{publication}} of several book-length biographies on him, as well as anthologies of his writings. In 2007 a literary critic for New Yorker magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000. There has also been a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship.|$|E

5|$|The {{star of the}} Order was an eight-pointed <b>figure,</b> <b>with</b> {{the four}} {{cardinal}} points longer than the intermediate points. Each point was shown as a cluster of rays.

5|$|A {{favourite}} of {{the ruling}} Ngô family, Đính received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as more capable. He converted to Roman Catholicism to curry favour with Diệm, and headed the military wing of the Cần Lao party, a secret Catholic organisation that maintained the Ngôs' grip on power. At the age of 32, Đính became the youngest ever ARVN general and {{the commander of the}} II Corps, but he was regarded as a dangerous, egotistical and impetuous <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> a weakness for alcohol and partying.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E

5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per year was a realistic <b>figure,</b> <b>with</b> bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E

Louis barely escapes through the dog door where he runs into Mulder, informing him of the creature's whereabouts in the house.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing magnetotail, which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of Saturn. The structure of Jupiter's magnetotail is similar to Earth's. It consists of two lobes (blue areas in the <b>figure),</b> <b>with</b> the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter, and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it. The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail current sheet (orange layer in the middle). Like Earth's, the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere, where it is heated and forms the radiation belts at distances closer than 10RJ from Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Duquesne {{was unable}} to extend its streak on the road against St. Louis, as they lost 59–69. Bill Clark led the team with 17points and Saunders grabbed four steals, enough to raise his per-game average to 2.9, a nation-leading <b>figure.</b> <b>With</b> this, Saunders had at one point {{led the nation in}} double-doubles, rebounds, and steals. The Dukes lost again, 80–92, in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure. The loss put a damper on Duquesne's hopes for a home game {{in the first round of}} the Atlantic 10 tournament, as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position.|$|E
5|$|If {{traditional}} {{practices were}} adhered to, feasting would have continued for two days, while guests {{would have given}} gifts, mainly of money, to the newlyweds. The wedding ceremony would have culminated with the guests entering the bridal chamber, where they would have made various sexual references and innuendos, led by a <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> his face painted black. In Chinese rural tradition, the bride was expected to show the bloodstains on the bed sheets from her wedding night to prove that her hymen had been broken during sexual intercourse, {{and that she had}} therefore been a virgin.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, {{and was a}} part of the Gilded Age New York {{literary}} {{scene for}} the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was careful to avoid the city's rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a public <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, local artists also {{supplemented}} the <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> items such as radishes, pretzels, laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins. The symbol diversely appears in numerous places such as on manhole covers, beer steins and the top of the tower of the town hall. While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation is that it is simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth Armitage (1916–2002) made {{a series}} of sculptures and {{drawings}} of oak trees in Richmond Park between 1975 and 1986.

5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> a hood and fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E
