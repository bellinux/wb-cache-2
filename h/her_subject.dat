5|$|Noether {{showed a}} devotion to <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> and her {{students}} that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when {{the building was}} closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house. Later, after she had been dismissed by the Third Reich, she invited students into her home to discuss their {{plans for the future}} and mathematical concepts.|$|E
25|$|McCartney’s {{talent for}} {{encapsulating}} the inspirations, histories and personalities of her subjects, such as Tracey Emin dressed as Frida Kahlo, is {{most evident in}} her previous exhibition Developing (The Lowry, Manchester, 2013). Showcasing her distinctive style in portraying visually vulnerable, off-guard portraits that seem unlikely without McCartney’s affinity with <b>her</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|E
25|$|In many ways, Migrant Mother is {{not typical}} of Lange's careful method of {{interacting}} with <b>her</b> <b>subject.</b> Exhausted {{after a long}} road-trip, she did not talk much to the migrant woman, Florence Thompson, and didn't record her information accurately. Although Thompson became a famous symbol of White motherhood, her heritage is Native American. The photograph's fame caused distress for Thompson and her children and raised ethical concerns about turning individuals into symbols.|$|E
5000|$|Razia was {{reportedly}} {{devoted to the}} cause of her empire and to <b>her</b> <b>subjects.</b> There is no record that she made any attempt to remain aloof from <b>her</b> <b>subjects,</b> rather it appears she preferred to mingle among them. She especially protected and preserved the indigenous cultures of <b>her</b> Hindu <b>subjects</b> during <b>her</b> reign.|$|R

25|$|The {{associations}} between Cleopatra {{and a black}} Africa were so profound that… any depiction of the ancient Egyptian queen {{had to contend with}} the issue of her race and the potential expectation of her blackness. Lewis’ white queen gained the aura of historical accuracy through primary research without sacrificing its symbolic links to abolitionism, black Africa, or black diaspora. But what it refused to facilitate was the racial objectification of the artist’s body. Lewis could not so readily become the subject of her own representation if <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> was corporeally white.|$|E
25|$|As a writer, Hall contributed many {{articles}} upon health topics to {{the best}} magazines and other periodicals of the day. Her writings were characterized by a strength of thought, knowledge of <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> and a certain vividness of expression which held {{the attention of the}} reader. Some of her most important articles were: “Unsanitary Condition of Country Houses” (Journal of Social Science, December, 1888); “Inebriety in Women” (Quarterly Journal for Inebriety, October, 1883); “Prison Experiences” (Medico Legal Journal, March, 1888); “Physical Training for Girls” (Popular Science Monthly, February, 1885); “Wherewithal Shall We Be Clothed” (American Woman's Journal, May, 1895).|$|E
25|$|Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College has {{its share}} of ghostly and urban legends. The most famous is the Faceless Nun. It is said that one of the Sisters had a talent for {{painting}} portraits. Her method of painting was to always paint every detail of the portrait, taking her time for days and weeks, and saving the face for last. She always insisted that the face was the most important part and required the most attention. She would spend countless hours working on every detail of the face of <b>her</b> <b>subject.</b> Once she started on the portrait's face, she would devote her entire time to it until perfection was reached.|$|E

25|$|Lilian Whiting's {{biography}} (Louise Chandler Moulton, Poet and Friend. Illustrated. Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1910) was {{direct and}} clear in its method, chronological and narrative rather than critical, compiled {{largely from the}} letters of Moulton and from the journal that was kept faithfully from age eight to {{the last days of}} failing health. With due acknowledgment of Moulton's gifts of personal charm and poetic sentiment and refinement, few discriminating readers ascribed to her verses that quality of genius. So it was considered unfortunate that Whiting began her biography with this word, as one of the implied characteristics of <b>her</b> <b>subject.</b> In her general treatment of Moulton's poetry, however, Whiting showed justice and reserve as well as sympathetic appreciation.|$|E
25|$|The second painting, Red Houses, bears general {{similarity}} to landscapes by Cézanne and Braque. Both paintings are Cubist in style. However, with them Weinrich did not announce an abrupt conversion to Cubism, but rather marked a turning toward greater experimentation. In her later work {{she would not}} adopt a single style or stylistic tendency, but would produce both representative pictures and ones that were entirely abstract, always showing {{a strong sense of}} the two-dimensional plane of the picture's surface. After she made these two paintings neither <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> matter nor the media she used would dramatically change. She continued to employ subjects available to her in her Provincetown studio and the surrounding area to produce still lifes, village and pastoral scenes, portraits, and abstractions in oil on canvas and board; watercolor, pastel, crayon and graphite on paper; and woodblock prints.|$|E
25|$|Although Cather {{began her}} writing {{career as a}} journalist, she made a {{distinction}} between journalism, which she saw as being primarily informative, and literature, which she saw as an art form. Cather's work is often marked by its nostalgic tone, <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> matter and themes drawn from memories of her early years on the American plains. Some critics have charged Cather with being {{out of touch with}} her times and failing to use more experimental techniques, such as stream of consciousness, in her writing. However, others have pointed out that Cather could follow no other literary path but her own: She had formed and matured her ideas on art before she wrote a novel. She had no more reason to follow Gertrude Stein and James Joyce, whose work she respected, than they did to follow her. Her style solves the problems in which she was interested. She wanted to stand midway between the journalists whose omniscient objectivity accumulate more fact than any character could notice and the psychological novelist whose use of subjective point of view stories distorts objective reality. She developed her theory on a middle ground, selecting facts from experience on the basis of feeling and then presenting the experience in a lucid, objective style. Cather's style is not the accumulative cataloguing of the journalists, nor the fragmentary atomism of psychological associations.|$|E

500|$|Love's candidness {{concerning}} her {{struggles with}} drug addiction {{and legal issues}} has made <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> to significant media interest {{over the course of}} her career, and Rolling Stone once referred to her as the [...] "most controversial woman in the history of rock." [...] She has openly discussed the substance abuse problems she has had throughout her life.|$|E
500|$|The Sunday Times, {{reviewing}} the seventh {{edition of the}} book, wrote [...] "For food scholarship at its best see Dorothy Hartley's robust, idiosyncratic, irresistible Food in England... As packed with diverse and fascinating information as a Scotch bun with fruit, this untidy bundle of erudition is held together by the writer's huge enjoyment of <b>her</b> <b>subject,</b> her immense curiosity about {{everything to do with}} the growth, preparation, preservation and eating of food in this country since the Middle Ages." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{wants to}} know Phantasma and see its {{condition}} and its people for herself personally, {{and would like to}} make political, economical and educational reforms for <b>her</b> <b>subjects.</b> She does this by escaping the palace with her Guardian Knights (minus an injured Ehren) {{in the middle of the}} night disguised as traveling friends. She also commissions to build schools and hospitals in order to improve the living conditions of <b>her</b> <b>subjects.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} stanza Elizabeth means that she hides strong {{unhappiness}} and love (of Anjou) {{in favour of}} an appearance of cool and dislike. This show may be meant to please <b>her</b> <b>subjects</b> or save <b>her</b> pride because the idea of her marriage with Anjou was very unpopular amongst <b>her</b> <b>subjects.</b> In any case, she has turned (or is turning) from her former (and more natural) self (or behavior) to something different.|$|R
500|$|Toronto-based author Margaret Atwood {{was asked}} {{several times over}} {{numerous}} years to deliver a Massey Lecture, which would be broadcast over the radio on CBC Radio One's Ideas and published by the House of Anansi Press. When she finally agreed, she chose <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> to be sociobiology of literary criticism, and specifically how an author's gender and age affects critical reception. However, after delivering lectures at Oxford University and Cambridge University on similar topics she re-considered her choice. She began thinking of 'debt' as a topic after writing [...] "Letter to America" [...] for The Globe and Mail in March 2003 (later reprinted in The Nation) regarding the pending invasion of Iraq and asking whether Americans understood the debt {{to which they were}} committing.|$|E
500|$|There {{was in any}} case, as art {{historian}} Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed, [...] "no market for post-impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s". Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits, while her approach to <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> matter became [...] "more and more didactic". Women were frequently portrayed, both as rural workers (as in The Fair Musterer) and in domestic or family scenes (as in On The Hilltop). Several images, such as On the Hilltop and Spring Afternoon, Knockalong portray women caring for a young son in a rural setting. Her most [...] "stereotypically feminine" [...] work was The Summer House, which shows two of Rix Nicholas's friends with some freshly cut flowers, in a setting that, unlike most of her works of the period, screened out the surrounding landscape. It was a picture about which Rix Nicholas was never convinced and which she never publicly displayed. Yet it {{has become one of}} her best known works, its easy acceptance consistent with the way reviewers in the 1930s pigeon-holed her work in terms of conventional gender roles.|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{indicates}} Potter {{was particularly}} {{sensitive to the}} openings and closings of her books (she insisted Benjamin Bunny end with the term [...] "rabbit-tobacco", for example), and, in the Flopsy Bunnies, the opening reflects her flair for the elevated diction sometimes encountered in her other books: [...] "It is said the effect of eating too much lettuce is 'soporific'." [...] Though the word 'soporific' is not generally encountered in literature for young children, Potter is aware of her audience's limitations and not only defines the word immediately but places it in context: [...] "I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit." [...] She not only defines the word, but introduces rabbits as <b>her</b> <b>subject.</b> The line does not draw attention to itself (though Potter is intruding herself into the narrative), but rather gives the tale a conversational tone or {{a sense of the}} story being told aloud by a narrator. Because she immediately brings the audience's attention back to the rabbits, there is no danger she will become a character in the tale, and she is invisible through the remainder of the tale.|$|E

500|$|Other reviewers were {{positive}} towards the way Boys Don't Cry portrayed its subject matter. and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times listed Boys Don't Cry {{as one of}} the five best films of 1999, saying, [...] "this could have been a clinical movie of the week, but instead it's a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame". Janet Maslin of The New York Times said the film was [...] "stunning" [...] and gave it four stars out of four stars. Maslin said, [...] "unlike most films about mind-numbing tragedy, this one manages to be full of hope". Kenneth Turan of The Los Angeles Times praised the lack of romanticization and dramatization of the characters, and wrote, [...] "Peirce and Bienen and the expert cast engage us in the actuality of these rootless, hopeless, stoned-out lives without sentimentalizing or romanticizing them" [...] and that [...] "Boys Don't Cry is an exceptional—and exceptionally disturbing film". Mike Clarke of USA Today commended Peirce's depth of knowledge of the case and the subject matter, writing, [...] "Peirce seems to have researched <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> with grad-school-thesis intensity".|$|E
500|$|Eric Stokes died {{unexpectedly}} in 1962, {{an experience}} which left Constance bereft; a long-time friend {{said that she}} never really recovered. Faced with a substantial mortgage to service, Stokes returned to work: painting. Two years later, she opened her first one-woman show in over thirty years. It comprised 43 works, with the 27 paintings priced dearly, at upwards of 150 guineas. The exhibition was a success both financially and critically: Stokes earned over 4000 guineas, and the exhibition attracted praise from art historian and critic Bernard William Smith. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, she painted and held shows; this later phase of her work {{was based on a}} stronger, if lighter, colour palette and reflected the influence of the art of Henri Matisse, whom Stokes admired. There was also a change in <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> matter, from [...] "classically conceived" [...] still lifes, groups of figures and nudes, to more decorative themes. Stokes' works continued to be well received, having been included in the 1975 exhibition Australian women artists at the University of Melbourne, and the Regional Galleries Association of Victoria's 1977 touring exhibition The heroic years of Australian painting, 1940–1965. Stokes' last painting was Alice Tumbling Down the Rabbit Hole, painted around 1989; she died in Melbourne in 1991.|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Salon.com and The Scotsman. Louis Bayard of Salon.com {{disagreed}} with the delivery of the final chapter, on ecological debt, writing that Atwood [...] "forsakes artistic engagement for ideological reflex". William Skidelsky in The Guardian agreed that the chapter was [...] "by no means {{the highlight of the}} book". [...] He also wrote: [...] "Because Atwood constantly veers off in new directions she doesn't always give herself time to sink her claws deep into a topic. The result is that, although Payback is packed with information, it can seem oddly thin... Still, Atwood's enthusiasm for <b>her</b> <b>subject</b> and lively style {{go a long way toward}} making up for these flaws. She can be a brilliant phrase-maker, and has a gift for summing up an idea with a single vivid image." [...] Allan Massie, reviewing for The Scotsman, could not find a coherent argument being presented and found her writing style [...] "veering uncomfortably between the academic and the jokily colloquial, [...] tiresome, [...] some of her writing is pretentious, much obvious and platitudinous". The reviewers in Salon.com and The Scotsman, as well as The Economist, were all uncomfortable with Atwood not distinguishing or contrasting 'good' and 'bad' debt.|$|E

50|$|In {{her work}} Bot has often chosen those socio-political themes {{which are a}} taboo. She {{researched}} and studies <b>her</b> <b>subjects</b> at length before she presented <b>her</b> work. <b>Subjects</b> she pictures have been massive pilgrimages in Europe in 1984, mentally handicapped in 1988, and multicultural funeral and mourning rituals in the Netherlands in 1998.|$|R
50|$|Formerly when Karma {{first took}} {{possession}} of someone, {{she could only}} move <b>her</b> <b>subject's</b> body awkwardly until she acclimated herself to her new host. If she remained {{in possession of a}} host for too long she would begin to think and act as her host would, and eventually her own personality would become subordinate to one identical to the host's. Although Karma can possess multiple <b>subjects</b> simultaneously, <b>her</b> control over <b>her</b> <b>subjects</b> is fragmented as she shifts her attention from one to another.|$|R
