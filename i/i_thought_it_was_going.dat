5|$|Reflecting on his {{stint in}} first season of Indian Super League, Chopra {{admitted}} that ISL {{turned out to}} be much more intense and competitive than he had anticipated. He said“I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.|$|E

25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

500|$|This {{species is}} often listed in field guides as inedible, or not {{recommended}} for consumption due to its tough texture. Michael Kuo, in his 2007 book on edible mushrooms, lists the taste as [...] "mediocre", and comments [...] "the devil's urn is {{not as bad as}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be. It's not good, mind you, but {{it would be possible to}} eat it with a forced smile if your Aunt Wanda served it to you." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Green Day {{released}} Insomniac, {{which did}} not perform as well commercially as the band's breakthrough major-label debut Dookie (1994). Speaking of Insomniac, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong noted, [...] "It did {{a lot better than}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do...From the sound of it, we knew it wasn't going to sell as much as Dookie." [...] The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote Insomniac in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. [...] The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, [...] "We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas. [...] It was beginning to be not fun anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The puzzle was {{simplified}} in The Shadow of the Templars 2009 [...] by, {{according to}} Cecil, adding a more logical solution. This {{version of the}} game includes a diary, in which the character takes notes; After completing the goat puzzle, George's diary reads: [...] "So the 'ghost of Lochmarne' {{is no more than}} a fierce Billy goat. For a moment <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be incredibly awkward to get past, but in the end it was surprisingly simple. Who would have known?", as a reference to the original puzzle's reputation. An easter egg involving a talking goat was included in The Shadow of the Templars sequel, [...] (1997). A goat puzzle was featured in , in the beginning and ending of 2014 second and final episode of the title, as part of the achieved $800,000 Kickstarter [...] "stretch goal".|$|E

500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later {{than the rest of the}} cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, [...] "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming." [...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation does not mean that they will leave the show. Falchuk insisted that [...] "it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E
2500|$|At age 14, Wainwright {{was sexually}} {{assaulted}} in London's Hyde Park after {{picking up a}} man at a bar. [...] In an interview years later, he described the event: [...] "I said I {{wanted to go to}} the park and see where this big concert was going on. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be a romantic walk in the park, but he raped me and robbed me afterwards and tried to strangle me". Wainwright states that he survived only by pretending to be an epileptic and faking a seizure. He has been reported to have stated that he remained celibate for five or seven years after the incident, and eventually became promiscuous.|$|E
