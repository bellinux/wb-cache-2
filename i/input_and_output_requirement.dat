40|$|Typical {{approaches}} to service composition seek to realize a goal service specification, described using a labeled transition system (LTS) {{provided by a}} service developer, by constructing a structurally equivalent LTS using a set of available component services (also described using LTSs) that match the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>requirements</b> of the transitions. As such, existing composition approaches fail to realize the goal LTS whenever available component service LTSs cannot be used to “mimic ” {{the structure of the}} goal LTS. This failure requires that the service developer formulates an alternate goal LTS and re-iterates the composition step. However, the process of manual reformulation of goal LTS is both laborious and error prone. In this setting, we describe an efficient data structure and algorithms for analyzing data and control flow dependencies implicit in a user-supplied goal LTS specification to automatically generate alternate LTS specifications that capture the same overall functionality with respect to the data and control dependencies, and determine whether any of the alternatives can lead to a feasible composition. The result is a significant reduction in the need for the tedious manual intervention in reformulating LTS specifications of the goal. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{complete}} {{design of}} many electromagnetic devices requires {{the solution of}} a coupled problem. Typically, the coupling {{is in the form}} of magnetic/thermal, magnetic/structural, magnetic/electronic, or possibly a combination of several disciplines. Computer based tools exist for many of these engineering specializations but they are usually "stand-alone" and each requires an experienced designer to use it effectively. This requirement for an expert user places a major constraint on the design cycle, and a lack of communication between the various experts can result in major design errors. This thesis proposes a software architecture that is capable of providing loose coupling between currently available design tools and of absorbing new tools in the future. The structure provides an integration environment for a suite of design programs. The environment automatically allows the iterative solution of coupled problems by loosely coupling individual tools through a comprehensive database and organizing their execution via a rule-based control program. In order to effectively integrate a diverse set of tools and to define the kind of coupling between the various analyses, it is necessary that the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>requirements</b> of each tool be carefully defined. The BlackBoard for Computational Analysis and Design (BBCAD) is a hybrid knowledge-based system which uses the blackboard architecture, and generates a systematic method of integrating the "stand-alone" design tools, together with an automatic method of ensuring that, if a change is made to the design, all the relevant design tools are re-run...|$|R

Projects to realise engineering products are often fraught with delays, budget overruns and unsatisfied clients.

Selected concepts and business processes of each domain are studied to arrive at an understanding of the objectives and scopes of those processes. This understanding enables the integration of these business processes and concepts by utilising the widely-used plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle.

40|$|Engineering design plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{development}} of artifacts that in one way or another are linked to people's life. Traditionally the design task used to be carried out by human designers from the start to the end. In the effort to improve the efficiency of human designers, computers have been introduced to perform some of the activities. The commercially available computer design tools do not offer designers the means to start design at the concept stage. Using artificial intelligence techniques, a new software has been developed based on the system approach to provide intelligent help to mechanical engineering designers. The software allows designers to define their design framework in the form of schematic layouts <b>and</b> <b>input</b> specifications. It has the ability to evaluate the inputs from the designer and continue with the design process to the final stage. Using object oriented programming methods and production rules, suitable knowledge representation and application strategies have been developed and used to develop the software. To give the flexibility required in general design, the design component's structures are designed to exist as independent systems. They are capable of identifying their association with other components and adjust their design status according to the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>requirements.</b> To cope with the different requirements, the software implementation is in two phases: the concept creation which is equipped with the knowledge to capture designer's ideas and evaluate them accordingly; the embodiment design phase with the knowledge to design components to their working size and assemble them to produce the final design. A convenient user interface for the design activity has also been developed as part of the software. To demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach on a design problem, the software model was equipped with the necessary design knowledge to design a gearbox.

40|$|Abstract—A novel soft-switching {{topology}} for dc–dc converters is proposed. It is {{well suited}} for applications {{in the range of}} a few hundred watts to a few kilowatts. It is essentially a hybrid com-bination of an uncontrolled half-bridge section and a phase-shift controlled full-bridge section, realized with just four switches. The main features of the proposed topology are zero-voltage-switching down to no-load without serious conduction loss penalty, constant frequency operation and near-ideal filter waveforms. The im-proved filter waveforms result in significant savings in the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> filter <b>requirement,</b> resulting in high power-density. The new topology requires two transformers and two dc-bypass ca-pacitors. The combined VA rating of the two transformers is more than that of the single transformer of conventional full-bridge converters, for variable-input applications. In Part I of the paper, the converter operation is analyzed for typical switch-mode power supply applications, where the input voltage varies widely but the output voltage is fixed and is well regulated. Experimental results obtained from a 100 -W/ 200 -kHz proof-of-concept prototype con-firm the superior features of the proposed hybrid configuration.
