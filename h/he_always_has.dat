Dalzell stated 'Sir H. B. E. Frere, {{not only as a}} mark of esteem and respect, but also because <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> been the enlightened encourager and promoter of scientific researches in India, and is himself a close observer of nature.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to force checkmate with a king and two knights, although checkmate positions are possible (see the first diagram). In the second diagram, if Black plays 1... Ka8? White can checkmate with 2. Nbc7#, but Black can play 1... Kc8 and escape the threat. The defender's task is easy — he simply has to avoid moving into a position in which he can be checkmated on the next move, and <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> another move available in such situations.|$|E
25|$|Hastings's {{appearances}} in Poirot's later novels {{are restricted to}} a few cases in which he participates on his periodic returns to England from Argentina. Poirot comments in The ABC Murders that he enjoys Hastings's visits because <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> his most interesting cases when Hastings is with him. In the course of The Big Four, Dulcie's life is threatened by members of an international conspiracy. Hastings is forced to risk Poirot's life in return for her promised safety. In other respects {{there is very little}} personal detail regarding Hastings in these novels, until , which takes place after World War II: With his wife now dead, Hastings rejoins Poirot at Styles to help tackle one last case. The novel culminates with Poirot dying of a heart attack, leaving Hastings a confession explaining his role in events as he tracked a criminal who manipulated others to commit murder for him. Poirot's friendship with Hastings is further referenced when the murderer's attempt to manipulate Hastings in such a manner leaves Poirot resolved to kill his adversary, despite his disapproval of murder, as he knew that his friend would normally never do such a thing.|$|E

Cates explained his decision to hire Rock for the telecast in a press release saying, [...] "I am a huge fan of Chris Rock. He always makes me laugh and <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> something interesting to say. Chris represents the best of the new generation of comics. Having him host the Oscars is terrific. I can't wait." [...] By virtue of his selection, Rock became the first African American man to solo host the gala.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his career, Henry signed with sportswear giant Nike. In the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Henry featured in Nike's [...] "Secret Tournament" [...] advertisement, directed by Terry Gilliam, along with 24 superstar football players including Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo, Francesco Totti, Roberto Carlos and Japanese star Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament [...] "referee." [...] In a 2004 advertisement, Henry pits his wits against football stars such as Claude Makélélé, Edgar Davids and Freddie Ljungberg in locations such as his bedroom and living room, which was partly inspired by Henry himself, who revealed that <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> a football nearby, even at home. In tandem with the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Henry also featured in Nike's Joga Bonito campaign, Portuguese for [...] "beautiful game." ...|$|E
500|$|Seizing an axe, Batman hacks {{down the}} front door of the asylum, proclaiming that the inmates are now free. The Joker offers to put him out of his misery. Batman {{retrieves}} Two-Face's coin from Adams and returns it to him, stating that it should be up to Two-Face to decide Batman's fate. Two-Face declares that they will kill Batman if the coin lands scratched side up, but let him go if the unscarred side appears. Two-Face flips the coin and declares Batman free. The Joker bids Batman good-bye, taunting him by saying that should life ever become too much for him in [...] "the asylum" [...] (the outside world) then <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> a place in Arkham. As Batman disappears into the night, Two-Face stands looking at the coin and it is revealed that it actually landed scratched side up; Two-Face chose to free Batman with his own will. He then turns to the stack of tarot cards and recites a passage from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: [...] "Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards." ...|$|E

500|$|Sorkin's nearly decade-long {{collaboration}} in television with director Thomas Schlamme began in early 1998 {{when they found}} they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced Sports Night. Their successful partnership in television {{is one in which}} Sorkin focuses on writing the scripts while Schlamme executive produces and occasionally directs; they have worked together on Sports Night, The West Wing, and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing. In response to what he perceived as unfair criticism of The Newsroom, Jacob Drum of Digital Americana wrote, [...] "The essential truth that the critics miss is that The Newsroom is Sorkin being Sorkin as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> been and always will be: one part pioneer; one part self-conscious romantic; two parts actual Lewis & Clark-style pioneer, trapping his way across an old, old idea of an America that can always stand to raise its game—but most importantly, spinning a good yarn while he does so." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben's unclear motives {{have led}} to {{speculation}} about his possible status as a villain. Ben Rawson-Jones from Digital Spy describes Ben as a [...] "supposed villain", pondering [...] "Could he really have been the good guy all along" [...] following the fourth-season episode [...] "The Shape of Things to Come". Actor Michael Emerson suspects where Ben's loyalties lie will always be ambiguous, making this a [...] "wonderful role". He is rarely shown losing control of his emotions, but when he does, it is done in a big and childish way. Emerson explains [...] "He's cold because any trace of warmth makes him vulnerable to his enemies". Ben is also known for {{his commitment to the}} island and doing whatever is necessary to protect it. He has no qualms with Locke attempting to kill Naomi (Marsha Thomason) and even Jack after the survivors begin to call the freighter. He undertakes the risky and unpredictable step of moving the Island to prevent the freighter crew, and thus Charles Widmore, from finding it. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> a plan and is described by Kevin Thompson from The Palm Beach Post as a [...] "know-it-all", which another reviewer thinks is because [...] " [...] talks quietly, in a menacingly measured drawl... with lots of pauses and emphases".|$|E
2500|$|The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures observed, [...] "Paul Lukas {{here has}} a chance to be indisputably the fine actor <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> shown plenty signs of being. Bette Davis subdues herself to a {{secondary}} role almost with an air of gratitude for being able to at last be uncomplicatedly decent and admirable. It is not a very colorful performance, but quiet loyalty and restrained heroism do not furnish many outlets for histrionic show, and Miss Davis is artist enough not to throw any extra bits of it to prove {{she is one of the}} stars." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regan {{was driven}} {{around in a}} Ford Consul Granada MK1 GT, {{which was one of}} the most {{recognisable}} sights on television during the 1970s and still had cult status some 35 years later. Although he is seen driving various cars himself in the series, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> a driver - usually 'Bill' (an uncredited role played by Tony Allen) - when using the Consul Granada (and the similar Ford Granada models used in later stories), which served as a Squad car: when the Squad travelled they always went [...] "mob handed" [...] (in considerable numbers). Regan did have his own car outside of the squad, in the series.|$|E
2500|$|The two are an {{airtight}} team until Hastings meets and marries Dulcie Duveen, a beautiful music hall performer half his age, after investigating the Murder on the Links. They later emigrate to Argentina, leaving Poirot behind as a [...] "very unhappy old man". However, Poirot and Hastings reunite during the novels The Big Four, Peril at End House, The ABC Murders, Lord Edgware Dies and Dumb Witness when Hastings arrives in England for business, with Poirot noting in ABC Murders that he enjoys having Hastings over because {{he feels that}} <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> his most interesting cases with Hastings. The two collaborate for the final time in Curtain: Poirot's Last Case, when the seemingly-crippled Poirot asks Hastings to assist him in his final case. When the killer they are tracking nearly manipulates Hastings into committing murder, Poirot describes this in his final farewell letter to Hastings as the catalyst that prompted him to eliminate the man himself, as Poirot knew that his friend was not a murderer and refused to let a man capable of manipulating Hastings {{in such a manner}} go on.|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao often praised Xun You and said, [...] "Gongda is {{intelligent}} but appears foolish; he is courageous but appears cowardly; he is resilient but appears weak. He neither flaunts {{his talents}} nor brags about his achievements. You {{can be as}} intelligent as him, but you can't pretend to be foolish {{as well as he}} does. Even Master Yan and Dou Wu cannot be compared to him." [...] When Cao Pi was still Cao Cao's heir apparent, his father told him, [...] "Xun Gongda is a role model for people. You should treat him courteously and respectfully." [...] When Xun You was ill, Cao Pi visited him and knelt down beside his bed; such was Cao Pi's level of respect for Xun You. Zhong Yao also once said, [...] "Every time I plan something, I'll carefully think through it again and again until I'm certain that I can't make any more changes. However, after consulting Gongda, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> new insights to offer." [...] Xun You created 12 strategies for Zhong Yao. Zhong Yao died before he managed to finish writing a book about the 12 strategies, hence some of them were lost. The historian Pei Songzhi thought it was a huge pity that Xun You's strategies were lost because Zhong Yao {{died at the age of}} 79 – some 16 years after Xun You's death – so he probably should have had ample time to finish writing the book.|$|E
