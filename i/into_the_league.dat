Merry immediately made changes to the club, including the hiring of former manager Jim Smith in his second spell. Despite signing five new players {{on his first day}} in charge, Smith was unable to prevent relegation {{at the end of the}} 2005–06 season. After 44 years in English league football, Oxford were relegated to the Conference National after finishing in 23rd place, becoming the first former winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the league. Coincidentally, Accrington Stanley, the club whose bankruptcy in 1962 allowed United to be elected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>League,</b> was one of the two clubs promoted to replace them.|$|E

5|$|Central Coast Mariners' {{bid for a}} {{franchise}} in the Football Federation Australia's new A-League competition was aimed at filling the one spot for a regional team that was designated by the FFA. Media speculation prior to {{the announcement of the}} franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners' bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former Australian international player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan—who would act as inaugural club chairman—also strengthened its proposal. As the only regional bidder, Central Coast was expected to make it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> by default. Following a reported signed deal with the FFA, the club signed former Northern Spirit coach Lawrie McKinna as manager and Ian Ferguson, a former Rangers and Northern Spirit player, as coach. To aid the FFA's goals of building the profile of the sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United. On 1 November 2004, after much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of FFA's domestic competition, the A-League. The decision made Central Coast Mariners the first Gosford-based professional sports team to play in a national competition.|$|E

The organization {{as a whole was}} fined $20,000 per league rules, head coach Josep Clarós was fined $10,000 and assistant coach Pedro Monteiro was fined $5,000. Both coaches received lifetime bans from the NBL Canada as well. A $5,000 fine was imposed on every player on the team's roster, excluding Douglas Appiah, Jr. who was injured {{at the time of the}} brawl. They were also suspended indefinitely during the investigation. Later on, the league allowed the Rainmen's players to apply for reinstatement <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>league,</b> although the coaches remained banned for life. Halifax's fines totaled $90,000. The Rainmen were not notified of their fines and suspensions through e-mail or a phone call. Instead they learned of it through Twitter. Clarós officially received his termination letter on May 5, after his contract had already been renewed for one more month. In an effort to give the players and coaches their final paychecks, he contacted the Canadian labour board. After one month, Clarós won the decision, but Levingston declared bankruptcy on July 6, the following day. According to bankruptcy documents, the Rainmen were about $700,000 in debt.|$|E
