40|$|The {{paradox of}} {{secondary}} metabolites, toxic defence compounds produced by plants, in nectar and fruits is well known. Deterrence of feeding by nectarivorous and frugivorous birds is better understood than {{the effect of}} these chemicals on the digestive performance of birds. Digestive parameters such as transit time and sugar assimilation are important in assessing nutrient utilization and deterrence may be related to post-ingestive effects involving these parameters. Nectar andmany fruits contain mainly sugars andwater, and avian consumers compensate for lowsugar content in their diet by increasing food intake: thismay also increase their intake of secondary metabolites. We investigated howthe alkaloid nicotine, naturally present in nectar of Nicotiana species, influences compensatory feeding and digestive performance of nectar-feeding birds. High nicotine concentration negatively affected compensatory feeding and apparent assimilation efficiency of white-bellied sunbirds Cinnyris talatala and Cape white-eyes Zosterops virens; but nicotine slowed gut transit time only in the latter species. In contrast, food intake and digestive performance of <b>dark-capped</b> <b>bulbuls</b> Pycnonotus tricolor was unaffected by nicotine up to a concentration of 50 μM. Bulbuls are primarily frugivorous; hence, they are more exposed to secondary metabolites than sunbirds and possibly white-eyes. Because their diet is richer in toxins, frugivorous birds may have evolved more efficient detoxification strategies than those of specialist nectar-feeding birds.

40|$|Secondary {{compounds}} in nectar {{may play a}} decisive {{role in determining the}} spectrum of floral visitors on plants. Flowers of the African coral tree Erythrina caffra are visited mainly by generalist passerine nectarivores, such as weavers and bulbuls. As the nectar of this species tastes very bitter to humans, it was hypothesized that secondary compounds may repel sunbirds and honeybees which are common in the same habitats yet seldom consume the nectar. We conducted choice tests using fresh nectar and both sucrose and hexose (glucose/fructose) solutions of the same concentration as the nectar. Whitebellied Sunbirds (Cinnyris talatala) were repelled by nectar of both E. caffra and a related species Erythrina lysistemon, but <b>Dark-capped</b> <b>Bulbuls</b> (Pycnonotus tricolor) did not discriminate between the Erythrina nectar and control sugar solution in terms of amounts consumed. Honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) probed exposed droplets of E. caffra nectar and a control sugar solution at the same rate, suggesting that there is no volatile deterrent, but they immediately withdrew their proboscis far more often from the droplets of Erythrina nectar than they did from the sugar solution, suggesting that they find Erythrina nectar distasteful. These results contribute to a growing awareness that non-sugar components of nectar can play important functional roles in plant pollination systems.

40|$|Although the {{function}} of nectar is to attract and reward pollinators, secondary metabolites produced by plants as anti-herbivore defences are frequently present in floral nectars. Greater understanding is needed {{of the effects of}} secondary metabolites in nectar on the foraging behaviour and performance of pollinators, and on plant–pollinator interactions. We investigated how nectar-feeding birds, both specialist (white-bellied sunbirds Cinnyris talatala) and generalist (<b>dark-capped</b> <b>bulbuls</b> Pycnonotus tricolor and Cape white-eyes Zosterops virens), respond to artificial nectar containing the alkaloid nicotine, present in nectar of Nicotiana species. Preference tests were carried out with a range of nicotine concentrations (0. 1 – 300 μM) in two sucrose concentrations (0. 25 and 1 M), and for bulbuls also in two sugars (sucrose and hexose). In addition, we measured short-term feeding patterns in white-bellied sunbirds that were offered nicotine (0 – 50 μM) in 0. 63 M sucrose. Both nicotine and sugar concentrations influenced the response of bird pollinators to nicotine. The birds showed dose-dependent responses to nicotine; and their tolerance of high nicotine concentrations was reduced on the dilute 0. 25 M sucrose diet, on which they increased consumption to maintain energy intake. White-bellied sunbirds decreased both feeding frequency and feeding duration as the nicotine concentration in artificial nectar increased. Of the three species, bulbuls showed the highest tolerance for nicotine, and sugar type (sucrose or hexose) had no effect. The indifference of bulbuls to nicotine may be related to their primarily frugivorous diet. However, the response of white-eyes to nicotine in the dilute sucrose solution was very similar to that of sunbirds, even though white-eyes are generalist nectar-feeders. Additional testing of other avian nectarivores and different secondary metabolites is required to further elucidate whether generalist bird pollinators, which utilise dilute nectars in which secondary metabolites have stronger deterrent effects, are more tolerant of ‘toxic’ nectar.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that fruit features such as nutrient content, size and colour have co-evolved with dispersal agent behaviour, physiology and morphology. Avian nectarivore feeding ecology is relatively well studied; however, less is known about fruit selection in avian frugivores. Previous work highlights the importance of individual factors that contribute towards fruit preferences, but few studies bring these factors together. Consequently the aim of this dissertation was to attempt this in terms of frugivory by investigating behavioural, physiological and morphological aspects of fruit selection in generalist avian dispersers. This was achieved by manipulating the nutritional content, size and colour of fruits (artificial fruits) under controlled conditions. The first part of the dissertation addresses physiological aspects of fruit selection in Red-winged Starling Onychognathus morio, Speckled Mousebird Colius striatus and <b>Dark-Capped</b> <b>Bulbul</b> Pycnonotus tricolor.

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigated}} the reproductive biology and pollination ecology of Aloe peglerae, an endangered endemic succulent {{species of the}} Magaliesberg Mountain Range in South Africa. The aim {{was to determine the}} pollination system of A. peglerae, the effects of flowering plant density on plant reproduction and the suitable microhabitat conditions for this species. Aloe peglerae possesses floral traits that typically conform to the bird-pollination syndrome. Pollinator exclusion experiments showed that reproduction is enhanced by opportunistic avian nectar-feeders, mainly the Cape Rock-Thrush (Monticola rupestris) and the <b>Dark-capped</b> <b>Bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus tricolor). Insect pollinators did not contribute significantly to reproductive output. Small-mammals were observed visiting flowers at night, however, the importance of these visitors as pollinators was not quantified in this study. Interannual variation in flowering patterns dictated annual flowering plant densities in the population. The first flowering season represented a typical mass flowering event resulting in high seed production, followed by a second low flowering year of low seed production. Reproductive success was significantly related to flowering plant densities at a spatial scale of 30. 0 - 35. 0 m in 2011, corresponding to the scale at which flowering plant density influenced diurnal (bird) visitation rates (25. 0 - 40. 0 m). In the second flowering season, neither plant reproduction nor diurnal visitation rates were related to flowering plant densities. Nocturnal (small-mammal) visitation rates were not related to flowering plant densities in both years and this is perceived to be a reflection of the smaller home/forage range of small-mammals. However, further investigation is required to confirm the hypothesis that small-mammal visitations contribute to reproductive success in A. peglerae. Aloe occupancy was generally associated with “safe site” microhabitat conditions (i. e. high rock cover, low grass cover and biomass). This {{is expected to be a}} fire-survival strategy of A. peglerae, where the persistence of individual plants in less vulnerable microsites over time is favoured. However, plant morphology might also confer adaptations, such as vegetative recovery at the apical meristem, to tolerate the harsh effects of fire...|$|E
