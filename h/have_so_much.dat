Jhonny is crazy and fell in love for April and sent her his car to pick her up but she used his car to go to movies with her friends. Meanwhile, Leslie tells the Venezuelans that she is seeking to raise $35,000 to fill in a pit to make a park. Raul and his colleagues start to laugh, telling her they <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money from oil, they can build {{whatever}} they want. Leslie, who is growing increasingly annoyed with the Venezuelans, decides to take them to Pawnee's nicest park with hopes of impressing them. Instead, they are disgusted, and Raul mistakes the park for the aforementioned pit. Leslie later takes them to a public meeting to show them democracy in action, but all of the citizens shout angry and annoyed questions at Leslie. An unimpressed Raul wonders where are the armed guards to take the protestors to jail. When Raul tells Leslie they live like kings in Venezuela and answer to nobody, she explodes in anger, insulting their uniforms and Hugo Chavez. The Venezuelans storm out.|$|E

25|$|The polywell {{attempts}} to confine the ions and electrons through two different means, borrowed from fusors and magnetic mirrors. The electrons {{are easier to}} confine magnetically because they <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> less mass than the ions.

25|$|Fiona {{stops by}} the pawn shop to see Gideon, now that Emma has regained her memories, where {{it turns out}} that Fiona had {{reclaimed}} Gideon's heart with Curse. Then, she uses him to recover her own wand, which she uses to decipher the mysterious writings that Henry had scribbled in the page. Fiona then reads the inscriptions, which details the birth of Light and Darkness, their battle throughout the ages waged via their emissaries, the deaths of the previous Saviors and their enemies at each others' hands, and how the Final Battle will begin after the Emma's birth. After Gideon leaves to find Emma, Gold arrives in the shop, but Fiona fails to trick Gold into thinking that she had only come for her watch. When Gold confronts Fiona about her plans, she tells her son that once the Final Battle is over, the Curse will be lifted and they can be a family again. She also tells Gold that after she destroys all Light Magic, she will <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> power that she will be able to break the Laws of Magic at will, and she will even be able to bring back the dead. She tells him that she can bring back his first-born son, Baelfire, for him. She {{goes on to say that}} with her new powers, she will be able to make his family love him as the Dark One, so that he can keep his power. However, Gold knows that is will come with a steep price and tells her that he refuses to pay the price of magic anymore slipping Fiona's wand into his hand. He forces her onto the ground with magic vowing to make her pay for what she did to Belle. Fiona tells Gold that she had deciphered Henry's writing. She learned that Darkness cannot destroy Light since Darkness isn't strong enough. However, Light can destroy Light. She explains she gave Gideon one final command; to kill Emma, and that even if she dies, Gideon will still be forced to carry out her command. Gold decides to test this and kills Fiona with her own wand, breaking the Dark Curse. This causes Snow, David, Regina, Hook, and Zelena to be transported back to Storybrooke from the Enchanted Forest while Emma and the other residents of Storybrooke regain their memories. Soon afterward Belle returns to Gold and comforts him over his actions, while Gideon arrives at the office with his own enchanted sword in hand. As expected, Gideon confronts Emma and is ready to face off against her.|$|E
