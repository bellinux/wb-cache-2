5|$|The <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> (also {{known as}} the Golgi body and the Golgi complex) is {{composed}} of separate sacs called cisternae. Its shape {{is similar to a}} stack of pancakes. The number of these stacks varies with the specific function of the cell. The <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> is used by the cell for further protein modification. The section of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> that receives the vesicles from the ER is {{known as the}} cis face, and is usually near the ER. The opposite end of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> is called the trans face, this is where the modified compounds leave. The trans face is usually facing the plasma membrane, which is where most of the substances the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> modifies are sent.|$|E
5|$|Vesicles {{are small}} membrane-enclosed {{transport}} units that can transfer molecules between different compartments. Most vesicles transfer the membranes {{assembled in the}} endoplasmic reticulum to the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and then from the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> to various locations.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{modification}} {{process is}} completed, the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> sorts {{the products of}} its processing and sends them to {{various parts of the}} cell. Molecular identification labels or tags are added by the Golgi enzymes to help with this. After everything is organized, the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> sends off its products by budding vesicles from its trans face.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} well known types of vesicles. They are clathrin-coated, COPI-coated, and COPII-coated vesicles. Each {{performs}} different {{functions in the}} cell. For example, clathrin-coated vesicles transport substances between the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> and the plasma membrane. COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles are frequently used for transportation between the ER and the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Class II: LDLR is not {{properly}} transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> for expression {{on the cell}} surface.|$|E
5|$|Vesicles {{sent off}} by the ER {{containing}} proteins are further altered at the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> and then prepared for secretion from the cell or transport {{to other parts of}} the cell. Various things can happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered space of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing. The <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> removes and substitutes sugar monomers, producing a large variety of oligosaccharides. In addition to modifying proteins, the Golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself. In plant cells, the Golgi produces pectins and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure.|$|E
5|$|Most {{living things}} that are {{visible to the naked}} eye in their adult form are eukaryotes, {{including}} humans. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus, the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> and mitochondria in their cells. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the DNA that makes up a cell's genome. DNA (Deoxyribonuclaic acid) itself is arranged in complex chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|The ER has {{a central}} role in producing, processing, and {{transporting}} biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell. Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the ER itself, the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus,</b> lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus,</b> or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle. An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperon protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the great}} {{majority}} of cells, smooth ER regions are scarce and are often partly smooth and partly rough. They are sometimes called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus.</b> In certain specialized cells, however, the smooth ER is abundant and has additional functions. The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} cells export {{proteins}} produced by ribosomes {{attached to the}} rough ER. The ribosomes assemble amino acids into protein units, which are carried into the rough ER for further adjustments. These proteins may be either transmembrane proteins, which become embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, or water-soluble proteins, which are able {{to pass through the}} membrane into the lumen. Those that reach the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum are folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation. Chemicals, such as carbohydrates or sugars, are added, then the endoplasmic reticulum either transports the completed proteins, called secretory proteins, to areas of the cell where they are needed, or they are sent to the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> for further processing and modification.|$|E
5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|As {{the sole}} viral protein {{on the surface}} of the virus, the Envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric {{envelope}} spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the underlying viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus,</b> the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{membrane}} contains a lipid bilayer that encompass {{the contents of}} the nucleus. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a synthesis and transport organelle that branches into the cytoplasm in plant and animal cells. The <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from the cell. Vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. A vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. The cell membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. There is also an organelle known as the Spitzenk√∂rper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the lipid bilayer in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating ‚Äúself‚Äù from ‚Äúnon-self,‚Äù {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> and lysosomes). See Organelle.|$|E
25|$|The {{subcellular}} localization of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> varies among eukaryotes. In mammals, {{a single}} <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> is usually {{located near the}} cell nucleus, close to the centrosome. Tubular connections are responsible for linking the stacks together. Localization and tubular connections of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> are dependent on microtubules. If microtubules are experimentally depolymerized, then the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> loses connections and becomes individual stacks throughout the cytoplasm. In yeast, multiple Golgi apparatuses are scattered throughout the cytoplasm (as observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In plants, Golgi stacks are not concentrated at the centrosomal region and do not form Golgi ribbons. Organization of the plant Golgi depends on actin cables and not microtubules. The common feature among Golgi {{is that they are}} adjacent to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.|$|E
25|$|There are {{structural}} and organizational {{differences in the}} <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> among eukaryotes. In some yeasts, Golgi stacking is not observed. Pichia pastoris does have stacked Golgi, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not. In plants, the individual stacks of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> seem to operate independently.|$|E
25|$|The {{key role}} of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> in protein glycosylation, as shown by {{autoradiography}} with labeled hexoses.|$|E
25|$|Part of the endomembrane {{system in}} the cytoplasm, the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{packages}} proteins into membrane-bound vesicles inside the cell before the vesicles are sent to their destination. The <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> resides {{at the intersection of}} the secretory, lysosomal, and endocytic pathways. It is of particular importance in processing proteins for secretion, containing a set of glycosylation enzymes that attach various sugar monomers to proteins as the proteins move through the apparatus.|$|E
25|$|O-linked {{glycosylation}} {{is a form}} of glycosylation {{that occurs}} in eukaryotes in the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus,</b> but also occurs in archaea and bacteria.|$|E
25|$|This {{discovery}} had {{a tremendous}} impact on the scientific community, being the first evidence for a functional role of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> in the synthetic process.|$|E
25|$|The {{ependymal cell}} bodies present a clear zonation, {{specially}} marked in certain species: the perinuclear region - the most distinct ultrastructural feature off virtually all species {{is the presence}} of large and dilated cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER); intermediate region ‚Äì constituted mainly by the RER and the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> (it is not certain the involvement of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> in the secretary process of the subcommissural organ); subapical region ‚Äì short region, with microtubules, mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum; and an apical region ‚Äì projecting a large protrusion into the ventricle.|$|E
25|$|Golgi apparatus: The primary {{function}} of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> is to process and package the macromolecules such as proteins and lipids that are synthesized by the cell.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} non-templated (unlike DNA {{transcription}} or protein translation); instead, the cell relies on segregating enzymes into different cellular compartments (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, cisternae in <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus).</b> Therefore, glycosylation is a site-specific modification.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{tends to}} be larger and more {{numerous}} in cells that synthesize and secrete large amounts of substances; for example, the antibody-secreting plasma B cells {{of the immune system}} have prominent Golgi complexes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus,</b> {{also known}} as the Golgi complex, Golgi body, or simply the Golgi, is an {{organelle}} found in most eukaryotic cells. It was identified in 1897 by the Italian scientist Camillo Golgi and named after him in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{synthesis}} {{begins with}} a reaction between UDP-galactose and 2-hydroxylated or non-hydroxylated ceramide. This reaction is catalyzed by galactosyltransferase (CGT), where galactose is transferred to 2-hydroxylated, or non-hydroxylated ceramide, from UDP-galactose. This reaction occurs in the luminal leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum, and its final product is GalCer, or galactocerebroside, which is then transported to the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Here, GalCer reacts with 3‚Äô-phosphoadenosine-5‚Äô-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to make sulfatide. This reaction is catalyzed by cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST). CST is a homodimeric protein that {{is found in the}} <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus.</b> It has been demonstrated that mice models lacking CST, CGT, or both are incapable of producing sulfatide indicating that CST and CGT are necessary components of sulfatide synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{classics}} include: {{identification of}} how skeletal bones grow through osteoblast deposition and osteoclast remodeling, early {{discovery of the}} biogenesis and metabolism of thyroxine and detection of triiodothyronine, early prediction of DNA semiconservative replication published days after the Watson and Crick Nature article, the discovery of axonal transport, the Warshawsky et al. finding that nascent proteins are processed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum through the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> into pancreatic zymogen granules (made in hot competition with the Palade lab at Rockefeller University), the first realization that the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{is the site of}} terminal glycosylation, the discovery of the cell coat, the cellular biogenesis of collagen, and new insights into the ultrastructure of basement membrane.|$|E
25|$|In this respect, the Golgi can {{be thought}} of as similar to a post office: it {{packages}} and labels items which it then sends to different parts of the cell or to the extracellular space. The <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> is also involved in lipid transport and lysosome formation.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E
25|$|Monomers are {{subsequently}} N-glycosylated, arranged into dimers in the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} and into multimers in the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> by crosslinking of cysteine residues via disulfide bonds. With {{respect to the}} glycosylation, vWF {{is one of only}} a few proteins that carry ABO blood group system antigens.|$|E
25|$|The vesicles {{that leave}} the rough {{endoplasmic}} reticulum are transported to the cis face of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus,</b> where they fuse with the Golgi membrane and empty their contents into the lumen. Once inside the lumen, the molecules are modified, then sorted for transport to their next destinations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the nucleus and <b>golgi</b> <b>apparatus)</b> are {{typically}} solitary, while others (such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, peroxisomes and lysosomes) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The cytosol is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{proteins}} {{remain within}} the cell {{and many are}} exported, for example, digestive enzymes, hormones and extracellular matrix proteins. In eukaryotes the export pathway is well developed and the main mechanism for the export of these proteins is translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by transport via the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Weaknesses: This model {{does not}} explain {{morphological}} variations in the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus,</b> nor define a role for COPI vesicles. This model does not apply well for plants, algae, and fungi in which individual Golgi stacks are observed (transfer of domains between stacks is not likely). Additionally, megavesicles are not established to be intra-Golgi transporters.|$|E
25|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and {{the transport of}} synthesized proteins in vesicles to the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several {{endoplasmic reticulum}} chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the <b>Golgi</b> <b>apparatus</b> ‚Äì unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a stress response in the ER. Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection or the over-expression of proteins can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading {{to an increase in}} unfolded proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.|$|E
