5000|$|Temporary casing completion: the MLS is {{inserted}} down {{the inside of}} temporary <b>drill</b> <b>casing</b> or core rods extending {{to the bottom of}} the borehole and, the seals are emplaced from the bottom as the casing/core rod string is slowly retracted. Hence, the drill casing/core rods acts as the temporary protective shield during the installation. This type of installation is most common when the drilling is done by sonic methods in overburden or in unstable bedrock. Installations using rotary wireline coring tools and air-rotary casing hammer (ARCH) methods are also of this type.|$|E

30|$|There are no {{reliable}} {{data for the}} kinetics of R 1 without the involvement of microbial AOM. However, the sudden and rapid progression of R 1 after drilling would require some catalytic effects associated with the <b>drilling,</b> <b>casing,</b> and CORK installation operations, other than the introduction of AOM populations. A possible catalyst introduced by <b>drilling</b> and <b>casing</b> the borehole is native iron and other metals used in the casing pipe and the CORK structure. Transition metals such as iron and nickel generally exhibit catalytic function for redox reactions due to their multiple valences. In addition to catalytic reactions occurring locally on the metal surface, high electron conductivity of the elongate casing pipe allows remotely located reducing and oxidizing molecules to be reacted through electron transfer, similar to how a battery functions. Nevertheless, {{the extent to which}} <b>drilling</b> and <b>casing</b> operations promoted abiotic sulfate reduction coupled with CH 4 oxidation is still not entirely clear.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} presented advances {{the understanding}} of the accurate prediction of burst strength in the <b>drill</b> <b>casings</b> used in the offshore oil and gas industry. The derived predictive equations involve a Limit-State-Design methodology, a methodology common in building structures, but novel in its application to <b>drill</b> <b>casings.</b> The potential exploitation of the software algorithms is currently being evaluated. Accurately predicting the burst strength is very important in the casing design for the oil and gas industry. In this paper, finite element analysis is performed for an infinitely long thick walled casing with geometrical imperfections subjected to internal pressure. A comparison with a series of full-scale experiments was conducted to verify the accuracy and reliability of the finite element analysis. Furthermore, three predictive equations were evaluated using the test data, and the Klever equation was concluded to give the most accurate prediction of burst strength. The finite element analysis was then extended to study the effects of major factors on the casing burst strength. Results showed that the initial eccentricity and material hardening parameter had important effects on the burst strength, while the effect of the initial ovality was small. (ASME...|$|R

40|$|A deep {{bore-hole}} 5 G at Vostok Station (East Antarctica) {{from the}} depth of 2755 m was drilled by electromechanical drill KEMS- 132. During wintering of the 40 th (1995) Russian Antarctic Expedition and summer seasons of the 41 st (1995 / 1996), 42 nd (1996 / 1997) and 43 rd (1997 / 1998) RAE the bore-hole was deepened from 2755 to 3623 m. At present the bore-hole 5 G has a complicated stepwise structure. The casing with an inner diameter of 165 mm insulates the upper 120 m of the hole from permeable firn. From 120 m to 2200 m {{the diameter of the}} hole is 153 mm. In the deeper sections of the hole its diameter decreases to 139 mm (between 2200 and 3095 m). 138. 4 mm (3095 - 3321 m), 137. 9 mm (3321 - 3500 m) - 136. 2 mm (3500 - 3570 m), and 135 mm (3570 - 3623 m). The drilling fluid, a mixture of kerosene and Forane F- 141 b as densifier, has an average density of 928 kg/m^ 3. Its level in the hole is maintained at a depth of 95 m. The difference between the overburden pressure of ice and the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid {{at the bottom of the}} hole is estimated to be about 0. 1 MPa.

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} has encountered significant problems in the production of oil and gas from weak rocks (such as chalks and limestones) and from unconsolidated sand formations. Problems include subsidence, compaction, sand production, and catastrophic shallow water sand flows during deep water drilling. Together these cost the petroleum industry {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} annually. The goals of this first quarterly report is to document the progress on the project to provide data on the acoustic imaging and mechanical properties of soft rock and marine sediments. The project is intended to determine the geophysical (acoustic velocities) rock properties of weak, poorly cemented rocks and unconsolidated sands. In some cases these weak formations can create problems for reservoir engineers. For example, it cost Phillips Petroleum 1 billion dollars to repair of offshore production facilities damaged during the unexpected subsidence and compaction of the Ekofisk Field in the North Sea (Sulak 1991). Another example is the problem of shallow water flows (SWF) occurring in sands just below the seafloor encountered during deep water drilling operations. In these cases the unconsolidated sands uncontrollably flow up around the annulus of the borehole resulting in loss of the <b>drill</b> <b>casing.</b> The $ 150 million dollar loss of the Ursa development project in the U. S. Gulf Coast resulted from an uncontrolled SWF (Furlow 1998 a,b; 1999 a,b). The first three tasks outlined in the work plan are: (1) obtain rock samples, (2) construct new acoustic platens, (3) calibrate and test the equipment. These have been completed as scheduled. Rock Mechanics Institute researchers at the University of Oklahoma have obtained eight different types of samples for the experimental program. These include: (a) Danian Chalk, (b) Cordoba Cream Limestone, (c) Indiana Limestone, (d) Ekofisk Chalk, (e) Oil Creek Sandstone, (f) unconsolidated Oil Creek sand, and (g) unconsolidated Brazos river sand. These weak rocks and sands are intended to represent analogs to the formations that present oil and gas engineers with problems during oil and gas production and drilling operations. A series of new axial acoustic sensors have been constructed (and tested) to allow measurement of compressional and shear wave velocities during high pressure triaxial tests on these weak rock and sand samples. In addition, equipment to be utilized over the next 18 months of the project have tested and calibrated. These include the load frames, triaxial pressure cells, pressure sensors, load cells, extensometers, and oscilloscopes have been calibrated and tested. The multichannel acoustic emission and acoustic pulse transmission systems have also been tested. Graduate research assistant, research faculty, and the laboratory technician have begun Tasks 4 and 5 which involve preparing the sand samples and rock samples for testing. The construction of the lateral acoustic sensors has also been started during this quarter as outlined in the project timeline. With the equipment having been tested and calibrated, and the samples now being prepared, the experiments are on schedule to be started in April, 2001...|$|E

30|$|The discussions above {{suggest that}} {{abundant}} CH 4 and SO 4 coexist {{in the native}} SCS formation fluid and is consistent with {{their presence in the}} DPW (Mottl et al. 2003). This coexistence is unusual in the subseafloor environment because sulfate reduction coupled with methane oxidation is thermodynamically favorable and usually promoted by ubiquitous microbial consortia of methanotrophic archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria, known as AOM (Orphan et al. 2001). In other words, both abundant CH 4 and SO 4 in the native SCS formation fluid point to unusually slow kinetics of the sulfate reduction (R 1) within the native SCS body. In fact, SO 4 reduction coupled with CH 4 oxidation (R 1) likely occurs in the post-drilling CORK fluids, derived from subseafloor regions affected by the Hole 1200 C <b>drilling,</b> <b>casing,</b> and/or CORK installation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Casing {{drilling}} can be {{an effective}} method of reducing drilling costs and minimising drilling problems but its uptake around the world has been slow with only a few wells drilled so far with casing. Complex geological features like the high overburden on top of shallow unconsolidated reservoirs characteristic of offshore West Africa can benefit from <b>casing</b> <b>drilling</b> when effectively combined with Managed Pressure Drilling technique. For the industry to develop a managed pressure drilling capability that will allow today’s generation of complex wells to be <b>drilled</b> safely with <b>casing,</b> it is necessary to develop models that include the effect of eccentricity, rotation and fluid rheology at bottom hole conditions on flow and pressure regimes, and to embed these models within an easy to use, intuitive well design package for pre planning and as a real time tool to monitor and provide forward simulations based on real time rig and downhole data. The paper presents new results of the theoretical predictions of the wellbore pressure regimes incurred when different types of drilling fluid flows in concentric and eccentric horizontal annuli.

30|$|Some probabilistic-based {{approaches}} {{have been adopted}} in studies of wellbore stability. One of such methods is quantitative risk assessment (QRA) (e.g. Ottesen et al. 1999; McLellan and Hawkes 1998), which was employed by Moos et al. (2003) {{to determine the effect}} of uncertainties in input parameters (rock and reservoir properties) on well stability and optimal mud weight windows. Ottesen et al. (1999) had earlier introduced a QRA-based statistical technique—specifically for wellbore stability analyses—to measure uncertainties in input data and the probabilities of their effect in relation to mud pressures. An approach akin to this was applied by McLellan and Hawkes (1998) in modelling sand production. The input parameters used in Moos et al. (2003) are uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), pore pressure and in situ principal stresses (the vertical and two horizontal components). The response surfaces, typifying the wellbore behaviour, were calculated as quadratic polynomial functions of each input parameter. Monte Carlo simulations were used to compute uncertainties in wellbore collapse and lost circulation pressures. Quantitative risk assessment, based on the Monte Carlo method, was also applied by Moos et al. (2003) to assess uncertainties in seismic velocities and velocity transforms (velocity-density functions and velocity-effective stress functions), as they impact estimations of density, effective stresses and pore pressure. This information can be applied in determining the sealing pressure of rocks (reservoir), the mud pressure window, and the required number of <b>drilling</b> <b>casings.</b> This method of probabilistic technique often requires an extensive and densely populated sample size.|$|R
