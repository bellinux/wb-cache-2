40|$|Background – Antioxidants are {{compounds}} that help prevent oxidation. Information on {{their presence in}} foods and their uses as neutralizers of oxidants or free radical compounds {{in the prevention of}} chronic non-communicable diseases has attracted scientists in various fields. Hence information related to their analytical determination is crucial. Objectives – To discuss the major analytical methods in the determination of antioxidants in foods. Discussion – The choice of analytical methods in the determination of antioxidants depends on the types of antioxidants of interest. Antioxidants in foods could be analysed either as a <b>functional</b> <b>group,</b> <b>antioxidant</b> <b>groups</b> or as individual <b>antioxidants.</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>group</b> could be measured by the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the use of any of the following major assays; trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) decolourization (1), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (2) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) (3). The major <b>antioxidant</b> <b>group</b> assays include the determination of total polyphenol (TPP) performed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, total carotenoids, total anthocyanins and total flavonoids (4). The determinations of individual antioxidants such as carotenoid and flavonoid profiles include the use of HPLC and LC-MS and other complex assays (5). Conclusion – Attempts are made to validate the antioxidant assays in the Pacific region for use as a routine analysis in regional laboratories...|$|R

The antioxidant capacity of SFG showed interesting DPPH radical-scavenging capacity (IC 50 SFG = 2. 5 mg·mL− 1), strong ABTS radical scavenging activity (% inhibition ABTS = 75. 6 % ± 2. 6 % at 40 mg·mL− 1), high reducing power capacity (RPSFG = 5 mg·mL− 1), and potent β-carotene bleaching inhibition activity (IC 50 SFG = 10 mg·mL− 1).

40|$|In {{this study}} samples of plant species Pergularia tomentosa; family Asclepiadaceae were {{collected}} from the Sultanate of Oman and extracted with organic solvents. These extracts were screened for their relative total phenol content, total antioxidant and anti-microbial properties. This species of plants has been traditionally used in Oman {{and much of the}} Middle East for the treatment of skin diseases, as abortive agents and as a laxative. The ethanolic extract of the plant was shown to possess anti-oxidant activity (inhibition of DPPH• radical), which is related to their phenolic content and also anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. Partial purification of these extracts (and associated anti-oxidant activity) has also been achieved by a combination of column chromatography and HPLC. Although complete structural elucidation of the compounds present within the extracts has not been possible, NMR analysis has indicated the presence of certain <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>Antioxidant</b> activities of the extracts have been determined by using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH•) assay and phospho-molybdate method. Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to determine total phenolic contents. In order to detect anti-bacterial activities of extracts a preliminary screening study was performed by using Varioskan spectrophotometer (Transgalactic Ltd). The second objective of this thesis describes the overall phenotypic relationships of the mint species and their interspecific hybrids and to provide some additional vision as {{to the development of the}} cultivated mint plants. Protocols for the extraction (microwave) and analysis (GC-MS) of the essential oil content within fresh and historical (dried) mint leave samples have been developed. By applying these methods to samples from both parental and hybrid mint species and carrying out a Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) analysis we have been able to determine the relationship between essential oil composition and parental genus.

This study {{has been designed to}} explore the protective effect of C. citratus (lemon grass) against modified LDL (OxLDL and H 2 O 2 LDL) induced cytotoxicity in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). The essential oil extracted from C. citratus (EOC) was subjected to FT-IR spectroscopic analysis for the identification of <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> In vitro <b>antioxidant</b> assays were carried out to assess the electron donating capability of EOC as compared with a known standard L-ascorbic acid.

40|$|Much {{attention}} of preventive medicine research {{is focused on}} natural antioxidants. This interest refers not only to isolation and identification of new biologically active molecules for the pharmaceutical industry, {{but also because of}} the emergent public interest in using crude plant extracts, such as infusions for self-medication (Krishnaiah et al., 2011). The use of antioxidants, such as the well-known polyphenolic compounds, to prevent genetic damage induced by physical or chemical agents is of considerable interest. This bioactivity might be related to their anticlastogenic effect, due to the presence of specific <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> Other <b>antioxidant</b> compounds, such as vitamins C and D, were reported for their DNA-damage decreasing effect, suggesting that reactive oxygen species may be involved in this activity (Benavente-García et al., 2004). Evaluating the antioxidant activity of natural matrices represents one of our primary research challenges (Ferreira et al., 2009). Among hundreds of studied species, Crataegus monogyna Jacq. stood out as being {{one of the most promising}} plants due to its high bioactivity. Besides the antioxidant activity, C. monogyna was also studied for the human tumour cells growth inhibitory capacity of its phenolic extracts; furthermore, individual phenolic compounds were fully characterized by high performance liquid chromatography-photo diode array detection-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI/ MS), revealing high levels of flavonols, flavones, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and anthocyanins (Rodrigues et al., 2012).

Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the effects of a major environmental stressor (a decrease in water volume) on diversity-abundance and diversity-stability relations in laboratory microcosms composed of temperate multitrophic rock pool communities to identify differences in community and <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> responses to increasing <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> richness along a gradient of environmental stress (low, medium, and high water volume).

40|$|Plant {{diversity}} {{has been}} shown to increase community biomass in experimental communities, but the mechanisms resulting in such positive biodiversity effects have remained largely unknown. We used a large-scale six-year biodiversity experiment near Jena, Germany, to examine how aboveground community biomass in grasslands is affected by different components of plant diversity and thereby infer the mechanisms that may underlie positive biodiversity effects. As components of diversity we defined the number of species (1 – 16), number of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> (1 – 4), presence of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> (legumes, tall herbs, small herbs, and grasses) and proportional abundance of <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> Using linear models, replacement series on the level of <b>functional</b> <b>groups,</b> and additive partitioning on the level of species, we explored whether the observed biodiversity effects originated from disproportionate effects of single <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> or species or from positive interactions between them. Aboveground community biomass was positively related to the number of species measured across <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> {{as well as to the}} number of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> measured across different levels of species richness. Furthermore, increasing the number of species within <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> increased aboveground community biomass, indicating that species within <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> were not redundant with respect to biomass production. A positive relationship between the number of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> and aboveground community biomass within a particular level of species richness suggested that complementarity was larger between species belonging to different rather than to the same <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> The presence of legumes or tall herbs had a strong positive impact on aboveground community biomass whereas the presence of small herbs or grasses had on average no significant effect. Two- and three-way interactions between <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> presences were weak, suggesting that their main effects were largely additive. Replacement series analyses on the level of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> revealed strong transgressive overyielding and relative yields. 1, indicating facilitation. On the species level, we found strong complementarity effects that increased over time while selection effects due to disproportionate contributions of particular species decreased over time.

These fractions include fossil fuel combustion emissions, biomass burning emissions and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Results clearly highlight the differences between <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> fingerprints of primary and secondary OA fractions. OA emitted from primary sources {{is found to be}} moderately functionalized, as about 20 carbons per 1000 bear one of the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> determined here, whereas SOA is much more functionalized, as in average 94 carbons per 1000 bear a <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> under study. Aging processes appear to increase both RCOOH and RCOR' <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> contents by nearly one order of magnitude. Conversely, RNO 2 content is found to decrease with photochemical processes. Finally, our results also suggest that other <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> significantly contribute to biomass smoke and SOA. In particular, for SOA, the overall oxygen content, assessed using aerosol mass spectrometer measurements by an 0 :C ratio of 0. 63, is significantly higher than the apparent 0 :C* ratio of 0. 17 estimated based on <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> measured here. A thorough examination of our data suggests that this remaining unexplained oxygen content can be most probably assigned to alcohol (ROH), organic peroxides (ROOH), organonitrates (RONO 2) and/or organosulfates (ROSO 3 H).

In a {{previous}} report [21], IR-PA spectra indicated that charcoal manufactured at 600  °C contained {{a significant amount}} of <b>functional</b> <b>groups,</b> but few <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> remained in the charcoal when the processing temperature was 700  °C. Accordingly, the remaining amount of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> plays a role in the adsorption of cesium ions.|$|R
50|$|Compounds {{with the}} same <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> will all absorb certain {{wavelengths}} of infrared light because of the vibrations associated with those groups. In fact, the infrared spectrum {{is divided into two}} regions. The first part is called the <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> region. Dimethyl ether and ethanol would have dissimilar infrared spectra in the <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> region.|$|R
50|$|Tethered Intramolecular 2+2 {{reactions}} entail {{the formation}} of four-membered rings from two <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in the same molecule, each <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> contributes two atoms. These two <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> are tethered by a carbon chain, hence the intramolecular 2+2 reaction usually forms a multi-cyclic system, which is an important carbon skeleton structure in organic chemistry.|$|R
40|$|Oxygen <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} subjects in the study of electrochemical properties of carbon materials which can change the wettability, conductivity and pore size distributions of carbon materials, and can occur redox reactions. In the electrode materials of carbon-based supercapacitors, the oxygen <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> have widely been used to improve the capacitive performance. In this paper, we not only analyzed the reasons for the increase of the capacity that promoted by oxygen <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in the charge-discharge cycling tests, but also analyzed the mechanism how the pseudocapacitance was provided by the oxygen <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in the acid/alkaline aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, we also discussed the effect of the oxygen <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy...|$|R

5000|$|Much {{effort is}} {{directed}} at functionalization of the corannulene ring with novel <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> such as ethynyl groups, ether groups, thioether <b>groups,</b> platinum <b>functional</b> <b>groups,</b> aryl groups, phenalenyl fused [...] and indeno extensions. and ferrocene groups.|$|R
50|$|A <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> is a moiety that {{participates in}} similar {{chemical}} reactions in most molecules that contain it. In turn {{the parts of}} the group are termed moieties. For example, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate contains a phenol <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> within the acyl moiety, which in turn is part of the paraben moiety. Larger moieties are often <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Complexation and {{solvation}} is {{also caused}} by specific interactions of <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> In the common {{rule of thumb}} [...] "like dissolves like", it is the shared or mutually well-interacting <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> which give rise to solubility. For example, sugar dissolves in water because both share the hydroxyl <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> (-OH) and hydroxyls interact strongly with each other.|$|R
