Nevertheless, for specialized domains these standards are insufficient to fully describe all the assets, {{especially when they}} are used as input for other eLearning services.

In this paper, the first objective is to understand the general trends in educational use of the cloud, particularly the provision of large scale education opportunities, use of open and free services, and interoperability of learning objects. A review of current literature reveals the opportunities and issues around managing learning and teaching related knowledge in the cloud. The educational use of the cloud {{will continue to grow}} as the services, pedagogies, personalization, and standardization of learning are refined and adopted. Secondly, the paper presents an example of how the cloud can support learning opportunities using SCORM <b>interoperable</b> <b>learning</b> objects. The case study findings show that, while the use of SCORM enables a variety of trackable learning opportunities, the constraints of maintaining the currency of the learning also need to be considered. It is recommended that the SCORM content are combined with cloud based student activities.

40|$|International audienceSerious games {{development}} has increased remarkably in recent years. Serious games provide motivation, dynamism and attractiveness {{so they have}} been more and more integrated into e-learning environments. This integration involves the creation of adapted and entertaining scenarios resulting from gamification of learning processes and eventually industrial processes. These playful scenarios are generally executed thanks to a serious game environment but they should also be integrated more broadly in the global learning paths. The creation and integration of serious games represents an expensive process {{in terms of time}} and funding. A conventionally simplified approach consisted in using standards. A lot of standards exists for the pedagogical scenarios. Unfortunately there is almost none defined for gamification and/or playful scenario integration in order to reuse its elements. In this article, we propose a contribution that offers a suitable design and smooth integration of playful scenarios into learning environments by (re) using existing standards and an engineering model driven approach. Specifically, we use the methodology proposed by the OMG MDA. Several e-learning standards have been proposed such as LOM, SCORM and IMS-LD. LOM is a standard used for describing <b>interoperable</b> and reusable <b>learning</b> objects to be able to exchange information. These standards are not capable of representing all of the serious game aspects as they neglect the fun aspects such as the type of the game, motivation and integration aspect of the games in e-learning environments. However, several studies propose metadata schemes based on the LOM standard to describe serious games (LOMFR-SG, SG-LOM). From these two approaches, we propose a generic enriched description of metadata for serious games in order to characterize a generic meta-model. This meta-model is then another design level independent from any implementation (level CIM MDA). Then, according to MDA, we propose a meta-model for our generic platform Learning Adventure and Claroline Connect platform. This meta-model is thus the level of implementation of our scenarios (PSM). Finally, we propose some transformation rules (ATL) and some constraints (OCL) to transform a generic scenario in accordance with the proposed meta model CIM, into a specific model that can be implemented in the Adventure Learning platforms and Claroline Connect...|$|R

Many major research and development projects have been carried out and developers now have a clear understanding of what is possible with which amount of effort. From the technical point of view the implementation of E-Learning functionality has been quite successful. However, from experience we have also learned that conceptual and didactical considerations are very important for the effective employment of E-Learning tools. From the didactical point of view constructionist learning theory fits most of the E-Learning demands. As a consequence action-orientated approaches should be implemented which require high proportions of interaction functionalities. In our case we think of a Virtual Learning Landscape as a data-based interaction environment.
