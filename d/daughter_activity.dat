40|$|A current {{emphasis}} in nuclear medicine is to better match the physical lifetime of the radionuclides used in vivo for {{diagnosis and treatment}} to the biological lifetime of the diagnostic procedure or to minimize radiation dose to areas other than those to be treated. In many cases the biological lifetime is {{on the order of}} minutes. Since the direct production of radionuclides with half lives of minutes requires the user to be near a suitable reactor or accelerator, this study was undertaken to produce short-lived radionuclides indirectly. If a long-lived radionuclide decays into a short-lived radionuclide, quick separation of the <b>daughter</b> <b>activity</b> from the parent enables the user to have a short-lived daughter while freeing him from the constraint of proximity to a cyclotron. Systems where a short-lived daughter is separated from a long-lived parent are called radionuclide generators. Two generator systems were developed for use in nuclear medicine, one in diagnostic work and the other for therapeutic work. The yield and breakthrough characteristics were within the limits required to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure in patients. Two parent radionuclides were produced using the beams available from medium energy cyclotrons. The yield was high enough to produce generators that would be useful in clinical applications...|$|E

40|$|Almost {{a quarter}} of women {{experience}} some kind of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Although CSA is associated with subsequent difficulties in women’s sexual well-being and parenting, {{few studies have examined}} whether maternal CSA history impacts how parents navigate the sexual development of their children. Using a cross-sectional sample of 194 low-income adolescents girls (Mean age = 15. 4), the goal of this study was to: 1) test whether maternal CSA is predictive of adolescent sexual risk behaviors (SRBs), and 2) identify parenting/family characteristics (sexual communication, sexual beliefs, parental monitoring and autonomy granting, and mother-daughter relationship quality) that may mediate this relationship. Maternal CSA history was not directly related to adolescent SRBs, but was predictive of a number of parenting/family characteristics related to SRBs. In families with maternal CSA, daughters reported more frequent and less embarrassing communication, endorsed more open beliefs about sex, perceived more of their peers as sexually active, and felt more autonomy in making decisions about dating. Mothers with a CSA history perceived their daughters as more embarrassed talking about sex and reported less monitoring of their <b>daughters</b> <b>activities.</b> Maternal CSA history was indirectly related to SRBs through several of these characteristics. Although the magnitude of most effects was small, these differences may become more pronounced as girls grow older and engage in a broader range of sexual activity. The findings suggest that maternal CSA may have intergenerational effects on sexual development that should be considered in interventions aimed at promoting adolescent sexual health...|$|R
40|$|A monitor for {{continuous}} {{observations of the}} atmospheric 222 Rn <b>daughter</b> <b>activity</b> has been improved and successfully implemented in a field study at a Russian site (Fyodorovskoye Forest Reserve). The alpha-activity of the short-lived 222 Rn and 220 Rn (212 Pb) decay products, which are attached to aerosols, is accumulated on a quartz aerosol filter and assayed on-line by alpha-spectroscopy. The alpha-activity from the 212 Pb daughters is determined by spectroscopy and corrected for. This monitor is suitable to measure 222 Rn activities at hourly resolution down to 0. 5 Bq m- 3 with an uncertainty well below ± 20 %. The prototype of this monitor is run in Heidelberg {{on the roof of}} the Institute’s building about 20 m above ground. For this site, the atmospheric radioactive disequilibrium was determined between the 222 Rn daughter 214 Po and 222 Rn, which has to be known to derive the atmospheric 222 Rn activity with the static filter method. We derived a mean disequilibrium 214 Po/ 222 Rn = 0. 704 ± 0. 081 for various meteorological conditions through parallel 222 Rn gas measurements with a slow pulse ionisation chamber. At the Russian field site, continuous activity observations were performed from July 1998 until July 2000 with half a year interruption in summer/fall 1999. During intensive campaigns, a second monitor was installed at Fyodorovskoye at 15. 6 m (July/August 1998), and at 1. 8 m (July/August 1999 and October 1999) above ground. Pronounced diurnal cycles of the 222 Rn <b>daughter</b> <b>activity</b> were observed at all sites, particularly during summer when the vertical mixing conditions in the atmospheric surface layer vary strongly between day and night. The lower envelope of the continuous measurements at Fyodorovskoye and at Heidelberg changes on synoptic time scales by a factor of 4 to 10 due to long-range transport changes between continental to more maritime situations. Generally, the 222 Rn activity at 26. 3 m height at Fyodorovskoye is lower by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to Heidelberg at 20 m above ground. This unexpected result is due to considerably lower 222 Rn exhalation rates from the soils measured in the footprint of the Fyodorovskoye Forest tower compared to Heidelberg. With the inverted chamber technique 222 Rn exhalation rates in the range of 3. 3 to 7. 9 Bq m- 2 h- 1 were determined at Fyodorovskoye for summer 1998 and autumn 1999 (wet conditions with water table depths between 5 and 70 cm). Only during the very dry summer in 1999 the mean 222 Rn exhalation rate increased by about a factor of five. All measured exhalation rates at the Fyodorovskoye Forest are considerably smaller by a factor of 2 - 10 compared to what we observe in the vicinity of Heidelberg (ca. 50 to 60 Bq m- 2 h- 1) and generally in Western Europe...|$|E

In additon, SiO 2 recovered from four surface particulate composites (64 °N to 61 ° S) were also analyzed for 32 Si. 32 Si measurements were made by milking and counting the <b>daughter</b> <b>activity,</b> 32 p. The net 32 p activities range from 0. 7 to 6. 8 cph; typical errors in measurements of the 32 p activities are 20 - 30 %. The 32 Si concentrations vary from 0. 6 dpm/ 106 kg {{of water in the}} North Atlantic surface waters to 235 dpm/ 106 kg at 400 m depth in the circumpolar waters. The vertical profiles of 32 Si at the five Atlantic stations approximately follow the Si profiles but the depth gradients are different. This would be expected also considering the in-situ release mechanisms due to dissolution and advection/diffusion from the bottom waters. Except for the circumpolar station 89, where the Si and 32 Si profiles show the effect of marked vertical mixing (nearly depth independent profiles), the profiles show the following features: (1) specific activities of 32 Si (32 Si/SiO 2 ratios) are lowest at intermediate depths, and (2) on an average the surface specific activities are higher, by 2 - 4 times, than the bottom water values. These data are consistent with generation of the highest specific activity 32 Si waters at the surface, where Si concentrations are lowest and precipitation adds cosmogenic 32 Si scavenged from the troposphere.

The word 'absolute' here means independence on environmental conditions like ventilation, electrostatic fields, size distribution of aerosols, etc. Up to now the usefulness of calibration factors was restricted to environmental conditions equal (or very close) to those worthing during their determinations. This fact is consequence of the difficulties related {{to the understanding of the}} plate-out properties of radon <b>daughters</b> <b>activity</b> in the air. So we devoted some time studying the plate-out effects on radon daughters monitoring performed by SSNTDs [Bi(88); Bi(89) -see chapter 5].

Being succeeded in the employment of CR- 39 as an a-spectrometer we concluded that some important information?s (like the radon daughters deposition sates on the walls of an environment) can be achieved [Had(91) ]. The knowledge about the behavior of plate-out (which is precisely what obstructs the accomplishment of absolute calibration factors) made possible the determination of the ranges in zenital angle and energy where CR- 39 can detect a-particle with efficiency of ~ 100 %, at out conditions of track observation. In this way, we obtained calibration factors for CR- 39 that are weakly dependent on environmental conditions (see chapters 9 and 10).

One {{reason for this is that}} GD washout models imply zero initial drug volume with no initial mixing [33]. Thus, a GD convolution (GDC) should better fit an organ TAC than Eq. (1), as both the organ delivery and organ washout are more realistically modelled using GDs than EDs. The b[*]=[*]β solution to Bateman Eq. (1) can be written as a gamma density; GD(2,[*]b;[*]t) and its n [...]...|$|R
40|$|Cerium bromide (CeBr 3) has {{recently}} been shown to exhibit several properties making it a suitable material as a scintillation detector in nuclear physics applications. The intrinsic activity of gamma-ray emitting radionuclides in a 38. 1 mm x 38. 1 mm (diameter x height) crystal of CeBr 3 was investigated. The measurements were {{carried out in the}} HADES underground laboratory located 225 m underground. Two primordial radionuclides were detected; 227 Ac (and its <b>daughters)</b> with massic <b>activity</b> of 0. 30 +/- 0. 02 Bq/kg and 138 La with massic activity of 7. 4 +/- 1. 0 mBq/kg. Two activation products were also detected; 139 Ce and 82 Br. Their massic activities (assuming a homogeneous distribution in the crystal) just before taking the CeBr 3 crystal underground were 4. 3 +/- 0. 3 mBq/kg and 18 +/- 4 mBq/kg correspondingly. None of the other common primordial radionuclides (40 K, 226 Ra, 228 Ra, 228 Th,and 235 U) were detected and their detection limits were below 2 mBq/kg except for 238 U for which the upper limit was 135 mBq/kg and 210 Pb with an upper limit of 600 mBq/kg.

40|$|This study explores {{barriers}} to and facilitators {{of breast cancer}} screening and how people in a woman's social network influence these screening behaviors. A total of 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in rural Washington State (USA) among Mexican women aged 50 and over. Eligible women reported either having had a mammogram within the last two years, over two years ago, or never. We found that lack of health insurance, {{the perception that the}} mammogram is painful, and fear of finding cancer were cited as {{barriers to}} participation in mammography screening. Women who had lived in the US for a shorter period {{were more likely to report}} never having had a mammogram than women who had lived in the US for a longer period. Women often cited daughters and female friends as those from whom they received advice or encouragement to receive a mammogram. Few differences were found related to network size and mammography use among the groups. These findings may be useful in designing interventions to promote mammography use. Including <b>daughters</b> in intervention <b>activities</b> may help facilitate mammography use among Mexican women.

40|$|Although the {{prevalence}} of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is currently 1 in 68 (Centers for Disease Control, 2015) and {{research in this area}} is growing, high-functioning individuals on the spectrum are often overlooked. This is because of their relatively milder symptoms. The recent collapse of Asperger Syndrome (AS) with autism in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM- 5; APA, 2013) also has obscured the differences that may exist between those with higher vs. lower levels of functioning. Among youth with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFASD), girls are a particularly understudied and potentially vulnerable group. Previous research has suggested that girls with HFASD may be more affected by their differences from typically developing peers during adolescence than are boys (Solomon, Miller, Taylor, Hinshaw, 2 ̆ 6 Carter, 2012). Other recent findings suggest that girls with HFASD receive less support than boys with HFASD in school (May, Cornish, 2 ̆ 6 Rinehart, 2014). The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the social and school experiences of adolescent females with HFASD from both the girls’ and their mothers’ perspectives. The results of the study yielded six themes that emerged from the interviews with four adolescent girls with HFASD and their mothers. Four of the themes were voiced by both the girls and their mothers. Specifically, they both discussed the girls’ high levels of interest in imaginary characters, experiences with teachers and peers at school who did not understand them, the need for kind and flexible teachers, and the girls’ reluctance to initiate in social interactions. Mothers also discussed two themes that were not mentioned by the girls. All of the mothers expressed frustration with motivating their <b>daughters</b> in <b>activities</b> unrelated to their interests and described their role as their daughters’ protectors. These ideas were not mentioned by the girls. Although results are not expected to generalize to all females with HFASD, the current study adds to the scant literature on this population and offers some insight into the experiences that these girls may face during adolescence...|$|R
