40|$|With the {{increase}} of heat flux densities generated by electronics, manufacturers are facing tremendous new challenges in which component heat flux might reach 100 W/cmÂ². This scenario is pushing the research efforts towards the development of alternative solutions, which {{will be able to}} ensure the needed cooling demands of high-integrated electronics. Furthermore, when considering the aeronautical applications, the reliability, compactness, and lightness of the cooling systems represent essential and mandatory characteristics. With the continuous miniaturization of the components, passive and active two-phase cooling devices can now be applied to electronics systems while maintaining the fundamental compactness and lightness of the whole system. This paper presents the experimental assessment of an electronic cooling prototype especially designed for <b>helicopter</b> <b>avionics</b> thermal management in the framework of 7 th FP EU project TOICA (Thermal Overall Integrated Conception of Aircraft, www. toica-fp 7. eu). The prototype consists of a set of compact Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) especially designed for the hot spot treatment at blade level and an air cooled mini-Vapor Cycle System (mini-VCS), which is devoted to the overall heat rejection. One innovative concept of this system design lies {{in the presence of a}} thermal connector, named thermal plug, which acts as the evaporator of the mini-VCS, that cools down the LHP condenser. The experimental results are carried out at different hot spot heat loads, from 10 W to 50 W. The effect of different heat sink temperatures on the LHP thermal resistance is investigated. Furthermore, for a fixed evaporating temperature of the mini-VCS, the effects of vapor superheating at the outlet of the plug evaporator on the LHP thermal resistance is investigated. The proposed preliminary results allow to exploit the potentiality to use the proposed cooling technology in a typical airborne scenario...|$|E

40|$|This {{project was}} created on {{base of a}} need to replace a model helicopter's GPS system, with a {{solution}} that didn't rely on any type of GPS signal. A helicopter competition amongst international universities dictated some regulations on use of a model helicopter and prohibited the use of GPS or GPS-assisted location finding systems. As an important subsystem to the <b>helicopter's</b> <b>avionics</b> system and flight computer, this project was started right away to develop a solution that could replace the GPS unit onboard of the helicopter. Part of the initial extensive research was {{to come up with}} a quick and implementable design which could be tested prior to vehicle integration. Limitations were enforced by the helicopter which had already been purchased, limiting the amount of electrical power available to such solution, and the weight of this subsystem, allowing for proper liftoff. Three different RF solutions were considered, including a RF phase measurement, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and RF signal roundtrip travel time. These methods were studied in detail, keeping in mind the project budget and short schedule allotted for this development. The decision was made to construct a system using a SoftCore microprocessor in an FPGA to control the modems and perform calculations necessary for triangulations. Various RF modems were also studied and researched for a technology suitable for this effort. This paper discusses all the phases of the design, its capabilities as well as the limitations. Recommendations are also made for improving the system as future work. The mathematical Methods are discussed as well, demonstrating the triangulation method which was used...|$|R

50|$|The {{separation}} saw a large {{reduction in}} types, numbers and bases. In 1994, 3rd Corps of Tactical Aviation was created. The newest fighter in the Czechoslovak Air Force arsenal was the MiG-29 (Izdelie 9.12). As {{there was only}} one general maintenance kit, which was given to newly created Slovak Republic, and all the material was split 1:1 with Slovakia, maintenance costs for the Czech Fulcrums would be too high. Along with the unreasonably high costs, speculative costs for spare parts imported from Russia, which were realised through third-party companies (Mil Mi-24 rotor blades acquisitions were over-priced by 400%), led to exchange of 10 MiG-29s with Poland for PZL W-3A Sokół rescue <b>helicopters</b> with <b>avionics</b> and ground support. Therefore, 10 air superiority fighters were exchanged for 11 light helicopters and this acquisition became a strongly discussed affair around a half of 90s. The burden of readiness squadron passed to the MiG-23s. Those participated in air exercises with western air forces, where MiG-23MLs were capable of outperforming Mirage III, F1C, and 2000 and F-4F in vertical manoeuvering and acceleration and Mirage III, F1C and Phantom even in horizontal manoeuvering, while being outperformed by F-16A in all aspects and by Mirage 2000 in horizontal manoeuvering.|$|R

Behavior-based model architecture is used, with each behavior implemented as a hybrid neurofuzzy model. The neural network structure learns {{the parameters of the}} fuzzy membership functions and finally the fuzzy-based model works alone. The neuro-fuzzy architecture and the helicopter hardware system used to measure the sensors and command data are also described.

25|$|In {{terms of}} cockpit {{equipment}} and avionics, the EC225 {{is equipped with}} a full glass cockpit with active-matrix liquid crystal displays; these include four 6-inch by 8-inch multi-functional displays as the predominant instrumentation for key flight information, two 4-inch by 5-inch monitors for displaying aircraft parameters, and a 3-inch screen for backup. The advanced <b>helicopter</b> cockpit and <b>avionics</b> system is described as serving to reduce pilot and crew workload, being used to display flight management and sub-systems information and is complete with a four-axis digital autopilot. During a typical flight, the pilot programs the route into the aircraft and then monitors it, as opposed to direct continuous control of the flight; the need for paper charts has been eliminated by these systems. Under autopilot, the automatic flight control system acts to prevent pilot actions from exceeding the established flight envelope; the EC225 remains flyable with all automatic systems disabled. From initiating the startup sequence to being ready to takeoff only takes three minutes, however if the authorised Airbus checklist is used it take approximately 7 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The Naval Postgraduate School {{has developed a}} successful Rapid Flight Test Prototyping System (RFTPS) {{for the development of}} software for remote computer control of fixed wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This thesis reviews the work accomplished to mount sensors on a small remote controlled helicopter with instrumentation compatible with the RFTPS: an inertial measurement unit, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an altitude sensor and associated power supply and telemetry equipment. A helicopter with sufficient lift capability was selected and a lightweight aluminum structure was built to serve as both an avionics platform for the necessary equipment and also as a landing skid. Since the altitude sensors used for fixed wing UAV's, such as barometric sensors and GPS, do not provide sufficient accuracy for low altitude hover control, a lightweight, precision altimeter was developed using ultrasound technology. Circuitry was developed to drive a Polaroid 6500 Series Ranging Module and process the output data in a form compatible with the RFTPS avionics architecture.
