It is a sanctuary for giant sea turtles that lay their eggs on the island all year round.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the drying effect on the {{reproducibility}} of DIAGNOdent (Dd) devices to detect caries-like lesions. Three areas were created in each of the 34 bovine incisors: sound (S), demineralized (DE) and remineralized (RE). One examiner measured each area with two Dd devices (denominated X and Y), twice under humid, and twice under dry condition. Intra-rater agreement according each device and inter-device agreement were estimated by kappa statistics (k). Intra-rater agreement for device Y was substantial under humid (k DE= 0. 68 and k RE+S= 0. 68) and dry condition (k DE= 0. 64 and k RE+S= 0. 67). For device X, it was substantial under <b>humid</b> <b>condition</b> (k DE= 0. 57 and k RE+S= 0. 49), and it was almost perfect after air drying (k DE= 1. 0 and kRE+S= 1. 0). Inter-device agreement was slight (k = 0. 17) under <b>humid</b> <b>condition,</b> and it was substantial under dry condition (k = 0. 62). As reproducibility increased under dry condition, drying is advised to detect caries-like lesions on free smooth surfaces when different devices are used...|$|E

40|$|On behalf the CINERGY project, a 675 m-long {{borehole}} was cored {{through the}} sedimentary column (405 m) and the basement (270 m). The studied interval encompasses 3 lithostratigraphic units, from 66 m to 405 m depth. The chronostratigraphic {{framework of the}} sedimentary series relies on benthic foraminifera and palynology. Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction is based on sedimentology, pollen analysis and clay mineralogy. 95 % of the series deposited continuously from the Early-Middle Bartonian to the Rupelian, including 290 m-thick lacustrine shaly organic deposits, alternating open and closed system depending on the floatting vegetal mats extension. Climate evolution is illustrated by palynological content. The Eocene climate evolves from a from warm and <b>humid</b> <b>condition</b> to a more contrasted seasons. the EOT {{is marked by a}} short drier and fresher period, the Rupelian is characterized by disappearance of megathermic taxa but back to more <b>humid</b> <b>condition.</b> Clay mineralogy changes more abruptly at the E/O boundary (~ 200 m depth), from an almost pure kaolinitic content to a kaolinite-smectite dominated assemblage. Whether the sudden mineralogical change across de E/O boundary is related to a change in source material or to a change in the hydrolysis in soil clay production, a climatic origin is very likely...|$|E

Our objective in this research is to investigate {{the effects of the}} proposed aging condition, to assess the degradation rate of the panel products, and to distinguish degradation behaviors induced by our mild aging test. Degradation behaviors can provide practical information on the durability of a panel product, which is especially relevant for commercial panel products in Japan.|$|E

30|$|On {{the basis}} of sedimentological studies, Sisodia and Singh (2000) believe that the Akli Formation was formed over a flood plain which {{suffered}} marine incursion. Habib et al. (1994) suggested its formation close to the paleoshoreline on {{the basis of}} terrestrial organic matter and dinoflagellate cysts recovered from the black shales and gray clay. Tripathi et al. (2009) speculated that the Akli Formation was formed in a paleoshoreline having extensive swamps which were fringed by abundant mangrove Nypa palms. They have reported the abundance of tropical flora such as pteridophytic spores. Further, the presence of Microthyriaceous fungal fruits indicates warm and <b>humid</b> <b>condition</b> and high precipitation.|$|E
30|$|The {{proportion}} {{of organic matter}} preserved depends on the total sediment accumulation rate (Heath et al. 1977; Müller and Suess 1979). High accumulation rates imply high organic carbon burial rates. In our cores, the most prominent feature of sediment accumulation rates (Figure  7 B) is the wide contrast between glacial and interglacial times. The Holocene time shows highest values ranging from 23, 86  cm/ky in Geob 9064 to 47, 44  cm/ky in Geob 9065 and lower values during glacial time (15 – 27 kyr). The change of sedimentation patterns documents the impact of climatic change to more <b>humid</b> <b>condition</b> during the interglacial times where terrigenous supply was related to fluvial input.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} various reliability {{concerns of}} the newly developed INGRID detector. This radiation detector is fabricated by waferscale CMOS post-processing; fresh detectors show excellent performance. Since the microsystems will be used unpackaged they are susceptible {{to all kinds of}} environmental conditions. The device passed tests of micro-ESD, radiation hardness, dielectric strength; but humidity tests show one weakness of SU- 8 as a structural material. Already after 1 day of exposure to a <b>humid</b> <b>condition</b> the structural integrity, as measured by a shear stress test, is dramatically lowered. Dry storage of these devices is therefore a necessity. KMPR photoresist shows promising results as an alternative structural material. ...|$|E
