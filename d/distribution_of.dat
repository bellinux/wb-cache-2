The observed <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> area and width for fields of 10 crops grown in 13 states of the United States and Canada were compared with best-fit inverse Gaussian distributions and with log-normal distributions. For 28 <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> area and 16 <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> width there {{was found to be}} a probability of greater than. 01 of their being inverse Gaussian.

5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
