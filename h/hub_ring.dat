In {{the case of a}} neural network with <b>hub</b> and <b>ring</b> structure, the stability of the equilibrium state is investigated by analyzing the eigenvalue of the corresponding characteristic matrix for the <b>hub</b> and <b>ring</b> structured fractional-order time delay models using a Laplace transformation for the Caputo-fractional derivatives. Some sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the uniqueness of the equilibrium point. In addition, conditions for the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation are also presented. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived results.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{the class}} of fractional-order CVHNNs with <b>hub</b> and <b>ring</b> {{structured}} system is considered in a time delay sense. In this paper we use the Laplace transforms to the system of linearized equation to get the characteristic matrix for further stability analysis of the equilibrium which has been completely characterized. The critical frequency of the fractional-order α for which the corresponding bifurcation point may occur has been identified and the transversality condition is verified for the corresponding ω_ 0 and γ_ 0. Moreover, the obtained conditions are simple, precise, effective and easy to verify. Numerical examples are given to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} theoretical results. Future work will focus on the analysis of stability and Hopf bifurcation of high-dimensional fractional-order ring structure CVHNNs with multiple delays.|$|R

30|$|NNs contain {{several types}} of {{structures}} such as <b>hub</b> structure, <b>ring</b> structure and so on. In NNs, for appropriate neuronal wiring, {{it is necessary to}} have coordinated activation of neuronal assemblies. Hypothetically a few highly linked neurons with long ranging connectivity, the ‘hub neurons’, would be the most effective manner to organize network-wide synchronicity. Therefore, it is significant to consider the hub structure in neural networks to realize better performance. Moreover, ring architectures {{can be found in a}} number of neural structures from neurons in the mind and other sciences. The factual cortical bonding prototype is tremendously sparse. Almost all connections among adjacent cells and long range links became very rare. Thus, ring NNs can be analyzed to gain better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the performance of NNs. Many authors have discussed global stability, Lyapunov stability for the fractional-order NNs, see [2, 14, 27, 29, 33 – 37], and for finite-time stability results are discussed in [26] and bifurcation of a delayed fractional systems is considered in [5, 38 – 40].|$|R

We present the necessary modelling and algorithmic concepts for the configuration of such a ring. From our numerical results, we can conclude the following {{with respect to the}} attainable ring filling.

30|$|Stability {{theory is}} one of the most {{important}} and rapidly developing fields of applied mathematics and mechanics. In the design of a dynamical neural network it is always of interest to study the stability properties of the network. The stability studies in NNs have been developed finding the conditions which ensure that each trajectory of the network converges to an equilibrium point depending on the initial conditions. These completely stable NNs have been used as computing and cognitive machines. Moreover, it is well known that the dynamic behaviors such as periodic phenomenon, bifurcation and chaos are also of great interest. In general, in a dynamical system, if a parameter is allowed to vary, then the behavior of the whole dynamical system may change. The value of the parameter at which these changes occur is known as the bifurcation value and the parameter that is varied is known as the bifurcation parameter. In delay differential equations, Hopf bifurcation occurs in systems of differential equations consisting of two or more equations. Even though there is an extensive literature on bifurcation analysis of some special NNs, most of them deal only with the two-equation models and there were only few papers on the bifurcations of the high-dimensional models [41 – 46]. However, all above mentioned works are on the bifurcation analysis of integer-order NNs. Nevertheless, most results on the integer-order NNs cannot be simply extended to the case of the fractional-order one. To the best of our knowledge, no work on the Hopf bifurcation analysis of fractional-order CVHNNs with <b>hub</b> structure and <b>ring</b> structure has been proposed in the literature. Therefore, this paper aims at fulfilling such a gap by investigating the stability and Hopf bifurcation of a class of delayed fractional-order CVHNNs with <b>hub</b> structure and <b>ring</b> structure.|$|R

5000|$|The smaller {{diameter}} thread on {{the fixed}} side has reverse/left hand threads {{to accept a}} lockring. The lockring is reverse threaded to prevent the cog from coming loose when applying reverse/braking power to the pedals. There are also different sized threads for the left hand lockring (English/ISO 1.29" [...] x 24 TPI), Campagnolo/Phil Wood (1.32" [...] x 24 TPI) and Old French (33 mm x 1.0 mm). The first two are the most common, with the French threading being older, and a little less common. It is advisable to check with the manufacturer of the <b>hub</b> for lock <b>ring</b> compatibility. Wrong thread type lockrings may easily thread onto the wrong hub, but over time, the poorly-mating thread interface will cause the threads on the hub to become damaged or destroyed.|$|R
40|$|Resumo: Este trabalho tem como objetivo a aplicação da técnica conhecida como Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL), para a avaliação do comportamento dinâmico de dois sistemas mecânicos não-lineares e assim verificar o desempenho da técnica nestes casos. O primeiro estudo {{consiste}} na avaliação de um componente, no caso uma engrenagem bi-partida, sujeito a contatos dinâmicos e impactos os quais são difíceis de serem modelados matematicamente. O segundo caso estudado consiste na avaliação de um amortecedor de vibrações torcionais do tipo elastomérico utilizado em motores de combustão interna, o qual apresenta não-linearidades de material, cujas propriedades variam em função da temperatura da borracha. Bancadas de testes distintas foram elaboradas para a avaliação dos dois componentes, tendo como entrada sinais de torques ou deslocamentos angulares gerados em tempo real por um código desenvolvido em ambiente MATLAB/SIMULINK e compilados para a simulação dos componentes através de uma placa controladora dSPACE. Nos estudos de HIL da engrenagem bi-partida, compararam-se os sinais de deslocamento angular medidos em um motor Diesel e na bancada de testes. Como conclusão verificou-se que os sinais obtidos na bancada foram muito próximos aos observados no motor. Já no caso do amortecedor, foram medidas as amplitudes das vibrações no cubo e anel do damper. Os deslocamentos angulares do cubo e anel foram comparados às amplitudes reais medidas em um motor no dinamômetro e, ao término do trabalho, verificou-se que as amplitudes obtidas do ensaio de HIL apresentaram boa correlação com os valores medidos no motor, alcançando-se dessa forma os objetivos propostos para esse trabalho. Abstract: The {{objective of}} this work is to apply the technique known as Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL), to assess the dynamic behavior of two non-linear mechanical systems and to verify {{the performance of the}} technique in these cases. The first study is the evaluation of a component, in this case a pre-tensioned gear, subjected to dynamic contacts and impacts which are difficult to be modeled mathematically. The second study is to evaluate an elastomeric torsional vibration damper (TVD) used in internal combustion engines, which has non-linear material properties that depend on the rubber temperature. Different test benches were developed for the evaluation of these two components, with the input signals of torques or angular displacements in real time, generated by a code developed in MATLAB / SIMULINK and compiled for the simulation of the components via dSPACE controller board. In the study of the pre-tensioned gear, we compared the signals of angular displacements in a Diesel engine with the test bench values. In conclusion {{it was found that the}} signals from the tests were very similar to those observed in the engine. In the case of the damper, were measured the amplitude of vibration at the <b>hub</b> and <b>ring</b> of the TVD. The angular displacements of the <b>hub</b> and <b>ring</b> were compared to actual measurements on an engine in the dynamometer. At the end of this work, it was found that the obtained amplitudes from the HIL test showed good correlation with the values measured in the engine, achieving that way the proposed goals of this work...|$|R

40|$|Stress {{concentrations}} at {{the ends}} of a flat contact including frictional sliding are analyzed in this article by using the finite element (FE) method. The numerical studies are conducted with a shaft coupled to the <b>hub</b> by conical <b>rings.</b> The applied mesh refinement at the contact ends assures the reliability of the FE results, which show significantly higher stress peaks than those obtained from the conventional analytical solution recommended in the design guidelines of the frictional conical joints. These notch stresses result in low cycle fatigue (LCF) failures of the shaft-hub connection in service, since the yield point of the shaft material can be locally exceeded. The effect of clearances among the joint components and magnitudes of the friction coefficient on variations of the maximum stress in the contact are considered as well.

5000|$|Most modern manual-transmission {{vehicles}} are {{fitted with a}} synchronized gear box. Transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but gears on one shaft can freely rotate or be locked to the shaft. The locking mechanism for a gear consists of a collar (or dog collar) on the shaft which is able to slide sideways so that teeth (or dogs) on its inner surface bridge two circular rings with teeth on their outer circumference: one attached to the gear, one to the shaft <b>hub.</b> When the <b>rings</b> are bridged by the collar, that particular gear is rotationally locked to the shaft and determines the output speed of the transmission. The gearshift lever manipulates the collars using a set of linkages, so arranged so that one collar may be permitted to lock only one gear at any one time; when [...] "shifting gears", the locking collar from one gear is disengaged before that of another is engaged. One collar often serves for two gears; sliding in one direction selects one transmission speed, {{in the other direction}} selects another.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe pulleys of an {{automotive}} {{front engine}} accessory drive are driven in rotation by a poly-V belt itself {{driven by the}} crankshaft pulley. This driving pulley is often used as a torsional vibration damper (TVD) for the crankshaft. Three elements compose the pulley: the <b>hub,</b> a rubber <b>ring</b> and an inertia steel ring with v-ribs on its outer diameter. Although the crankshaft torsional vibrations are dampen, they are transmitted to the belt transmission and therefore to the driven accessories. Hence, recent developments have conducted to add a decoupling function to these pulleys. The decoupling is realized by an other rubber ring. The TVD pulley components are designed in order to dampen crankshaft vibrations over a given frequency range, i. e. stiffness and damping characteristics are determined for the rubber ring. These expected characteristics have to be checked after manufacturing for product certification but also to give some real measured data input for simulation models. An experimental characterization method is presented and discussed for {{the determination of the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of the rubber rings used in such pulley. The test rig developed is temperature controlled in order to show the influence of the temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of model Francis runner {{to be used}} in the Waterpower laboratory at NTNU is a length and costly process. Due to the production cost there are years between each time a new Francis model is bought. The Tokke Francis model at Waterpower laboratory, was given from the industry after they had run model tests in the laboratory when design- ing the Tokke prototype. In order to give the students at the Waterpower laboratory an opportunity to design their own turbines and test, the production cost must be significantly reduced. To be able to do that, new designs need to be developed and new production method used. The objective of this thesis is to carry out a new mechanical design of a Francis model runner and evaluate different mechanical designs of guide vanes and stay vanes. The new alternative designs were made with a combination of standard production methods and material, and new plastic materials from rapid prototyping such as selective laser sintering (SLS) and rapid CNC machining. To carry out the new mechanical runner design, the MATLAB design software Khoj was used. From Khoj two sets of streamlines were generated, one set for the sucction side and one for the pressure side. Then the streamlines were imported into the CAD program PTC Creo Parametric and a 3 D-model of the design was made. Two test pieces in a polyamide material was made using selective laser sintering. One of the test pieces was tested for pull-out strength using some self tapping thread inserts, the results showed that the pull-out strength was more than good enough. The threaded insert could be used to attach the runner vanes to the <b>hub</b> and <b>ring.</b> The main focus of this thesis has been the new mechanical design of a model runner and runner vanes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this final project is to design and {{calculate}} a piston for a large two-stroke diesel engine. They are used in railroad, marine or stationary services. They are very big and heavy, all the parts {{have to be very}} well studied and calculated. Modelling process has different parts {{but it has to be}} understood what we want to achieve, the optimal shape of the piston to obtain maximum performance. The piston itself has four different main parts that should be taken into account: the crown, piston <b>rings,</b> <b>hubs</b> and the skirt. The crown takes a very important part in the whole process. It is the part that supports most of the loads and heat. As a consequence is the one that suffers the hardest deformation. The piston object of study is very large, it has to be thought a refrigeration system inside the crown to relief some of the heat stresses. As the object is to see under certain conditions how the piston works, at first it has to be understood how work the different parts mentioned before. So that we can get the optimal and correct results we are looking for. When working, the piston is subjected to a treatment of thermal stresses and force stresses. Both of them acting against the piston and causing a deformation on it. At first, the working conditions have to be very well defined. That way the results obtained will be the most accurate to reality as possible. The materials used for the construction of it also play a very important role in the whole process. Given different materials the deformations and the heat flow will be, of course, different. In the modelling process has to be chosen the one that gives better results taking into account different factors...|$|R
40|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} brake {{has been}} designed as a more energy-efficient alternative to a magnetic fail-safe brake in a robot. (In the specific application, failsafe signifies that the brake is normally engaged; that is, power must be supplied to allow free rotation.) The magnetic failsafe brake must be supplied with about 8 W of electric power to initiate and maintain disengagement. In contrast, the magnetostrictive brake, which would have about the same dimensions and the same torque rating {{as those of the}} magnetic fail-safe brake, would demand only about 2 W of power for disengagement. The brake (see figure) would include a stationary base plate and a hub mounted on the base plate. Two solenoid assemblies would be mounted in diametrically opposed recesses in the hub. The cores of the solenoids would be made of the magnetostrictive alloy Terfenol-D or equivalent. The rotating part of the brake would be a ring-and spring- disk subassembly. By means of leaf springs not shown in the figure, this subassembly would be coupled with the shaft that the brake is meant to restrain. With no power supplied to the solenoids, a permanent magnet would pull axially on a stepped disk and on a shelf in the <b>hub,</b> causing the <b>ring</b> to be squeezed axially between the stepped disk and the hub. The friction associated with this axial squeeze would effect the braking action. Supplying electric power to the solenoids would cause the magnetostrictive cylinders to push radially inward against a set of wedges that would be in axial contact with the stepped disk. The wedges would convert the radial magnetostrictive strain to a multiplied axial displacement of the stepped disk. This axial displacement would be just large enough to lift the stepped disk, against the permanent magnetic force, out of contact with the ring. The ring would then be free to turn because it would no longer be squeezed axially between the stepped disk and the hub...|$|R
