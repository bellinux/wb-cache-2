Season 2 shows Sofie's attempts to leave her former job, which is repeatedly interrupted by tarot cards reappearing. Another of her readings sets Ben on a journey to Scudder, the man he has been looking for {{since the beginning of}} the series.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro is a {{widespread}} hilly geological area covering large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium, and {{is thought to be}} composed of ejecta from the impact which formed Imbrium. The area is primarily composed of relatively low ridges and hills, between which exist undulating valleys. Much of the ejecta blanket from the Imbrium impact is covered with debris from younger impacts and material churned up by possible moonquakes. Debris found in the formation may have originated from deep beneath the original crust, and samples collected there could <b>give</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the geologic history of the Moon. The petrology of the formation, based on data obtained on Apollo 14, indicates a history of impact and ejection possibly spanning over approximately 500 million years.|$|E

25|$|Most of Coleridge's juvenalia was posthumously published. Those written {{while he}} {{attended}} Christ's Hospitals were imitations of conventional models of poetry {{during the late}} 18th-century. In particular, he focused on John Milton's L'Allegro, Il Penseroso, and his Lycidas, along with the poems of Collins, Gray, and Thomson. In terms of form, Coleridge relied on many abstract nouns that he would mark with capitalisation, and his nouns were constantly modified {{with a set of}} two adjectives. He did not start working with his own poetic form until 1794. Although they don't provide a sense of where Coleridge developed his poetry later, the school-age poems do <b>give</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> Coleridge's thoughts and feelings during those years.|$|E

25|$|Walter {{made many}} highly {{acclaimed}} recordings of other great Germanic composers, such as Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Johann Strauss Jr., and Anton Bruckner, {{as well as}} of Bach, Wagner, Schumann, Dvorak, Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Smetana, and others. Walter was a leading conductor of opera, particularly known for his Mozart performance, and recordings of some from the Metropolitan Opera and the Salzburg Festival are now available on CD. So are performances of Wagner, Verdi, and Beethoven's Fidelio. Also of great interest are recordings from the 1950s of his rehearsals of Mozart, Mahler and Brahms, which <b>give</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> his musical priorities and into the warm and non-tyrannical manner—as contrasted with some of his colleagues—with which he related to orchestras.|$|E
25|$|Today in medicine, it {{is common}} that {{physicians}} often use a trial and error strategy until they find the treatment therapy that is most effective for their patient. With personalised medicine, these treatments can be more specifically tailored to an individual and <b>give</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> how their body will respond to the drug and if that drug will work based on their genome. The personal genotype can allow physicians to have more detailed information that will guide them in their decision in treatment prescriptions, which will be more cost-effective and accurate. As quoted from the article Pharmacogenomics: The Promise of Personalised Medicine, “therapy with the right drug at the right dose in the right patient” is a description of how personalized medicine will affect the future of treatment. For instance, tamoxifen {{used to be a}} drug commonly prescribed to women with ER+ breast cancer, but 65% of women initially taking it developed resistance. After some research by people such as David Flockhart, it was discovered that women with certain mutation in their CYP2D6 gene, a gene that encodes the metabolizing enzyme, were not able to efficiently break down Tamoxifen, making it an ineffective treatment for their cancer. Since then, women are now genotyped for those specific mutations, so that immediately these women can have the most effective treatment therapy.|$|E

500|$|She {{continued}} to write prose {{during the period}} of her marriage. During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title An Emigrant's Notebook, but this plan was abandoned. She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called Over the River, in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in Southwark, south London. She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park; there she edited her husband's autobiography, which she published in 1894. She was to write later, [...] "If I had not married I should not have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; had I not been widowed I should not have found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to <b>give</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me rich—'full', as Bacon says." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer David Wolstencroft {{decided that}} Tom Quinn would use IT as his cover story for Ellie Simm, because IT has, {{according}} to Wolstencroft, [...] "something {{that has an}} enormous amount of thought and technical fact behind it that nobody would really understand," [...] and according to series producer Jane Featherstone, has people reluctant to be asking questions about. A scene where a cat escaped during Zoe's operation to bug Kane's cottage, and the ensuing search in the rain mirrored an experience during Wolstencroft's early career. It was also intended that the episode established that although spies plan heavily before operations, things can go wrong. Among the main cast, Peter Firth was attracted to appearing on Spooks after hearing of Howard Brenton's involvement in the series. The cast were advised by ex-MI5 officers in order to help <b>give</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> how the characters operate in the spy world and how their personal lives would be affected by it. The character Maisie Simm (Heather Cave), Ellie's daughter, was created because Featherstone believed that [...] "children are the best spies of all"; Maisie is often seen [...] "spying" [...] on Tom throughout the episode and first series. Megan Dodds guest starred as Christine Dale; the producers were sufficiently impressed with her performance that she would later return as Dale in the second series.|$|E
500|$|First he {{does not}} tell the story himself, but has one of his in-story characters, Orpheus, sing it; second, Ovid tells his {{audience}} not even to believe the story (cf. quote in [...] "Ovid's version"); third, he has Orpheus congratulate Rome, Ovid's home town, for its being {{far away from the}} land where this story took place (Cyprus). By distancing himself, Doll writes, Ovid lures his audience to keep listening. First then does Ovid begin telling the story describing Myrrha, her father and their relationship, which Doll compares to the mating of Cupid and Psyche: here the lovemaking occurs in complete darkness and only the initiator (Cupid) knows the identity of the other as well. Myrrha's metamorphosing into a tree is read by Doll as a metaphor where the tree incarnates the secret. As a side effect, Doll notes, the metamorphosis also alters the idea of incest into something natural for the imagination to think about. Commenting on a Freudian analysis of the myth stating that Ovid [...] "disconcertingly suggests that [...] might be an unspoken universal of human experience" [...] Doll notes that Ovid's stories work like metaphors: they are meant to <b>give</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> the human psyche. Doll states that the moments when people experience moments like those of father-lust are repressed and unconscious, which means that they are a natural part of growing and that most grow out of it sometime. She concludes about Ovid and his version of Myrrha that: [...] "What is perverted, for Ovid, is the use of sex as a power tool and the blind acceptance of sexual male power as a cultural norm." ...|$|E

500|$|Up! Live from Chicago {{received}} favorable critic reviews. Matt Bjorke of About.com {{reviewed the}} home release of Up! Close and Personal. He had not attended a Shania concert, nor seen the television special, {{and was surprised}} by the singer's stage presence. He believed that the video would make the singer's naysayers realize Shania's vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd. Bjorke concluded, [...] "Up! Live in Chicago is a dynamic DVD experience that is sure to please fans for years to come." [...] Chris Jones of BBC noted the band's differed from most country bands and wanted a more country-influenced sound. However, Jones complimented the singer's incorporation of the audience, naming it her [...] "inimitable style". He added that the video was [...] "far from [...] sterile experience" [...] because of the live setting and crowd ambiance. However, he suspected Shania's [...] "photocopy-perfect" [...] vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post-production work. [...] "Overall, you know exactly what you're getting with Shania, and for her fans this is bound {{to be a very good}} thing indeed." [...] Bobby Reed of the Chicago Sun Times believed Shania failed to <b>give</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> her identity or personality, noting she never mentioned her relocation to Switzerland or her then-new son, Eja. He complimented the band's strong, yet rote efforts of bringing the dense production to life. However, he claimed Shania's vocal delivery was at times frail. Reed also noted the absence of guest stars, in contrast to her two previous concert specials, and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave the concert a country-fair vibe. Mark Guarino of Arlington Heights' Daily Herald believed the concert was evidently tailored for television and that Shania played the proper host. He continued, [...] "As the night wore on, Shania tried different ways, with varying degrees of success, to make the magnitude of such a large event work for the small screen. Her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things, but it often backfired." ...|$|E
500|$|Flashback was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Johnathan Widran of Allmusic praised the album giving it a three out of five stars. He started off the reviewing by stating that through the album, Ivy Queen can <b>give</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> reggaeton {{to a person who}} is unknown to the genre. While noting that [...] "In The Zone" [...] with Wyclef Jean was missing from the album, he stated the it [...] "has more than enough driving grooves, chunky beats, symphonic atmospheres, and infectious raps to compensate". He noted that the songs [...] "Te He Querido, Te He Llorado, [...] "Yo Soy La Queen", and [...] "Reggae Respect" [...] capture Queen's [...] "irrepressible inspirations, spirit, and vibe". Lastly, he praised [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] and [...] "En La Disco" [...] as tracks that get the party and people going. An editor for the Star Tribune called the album a [...] "retrospective that also has a few new tunes", later claiming that Queen knows how to [...] "take shots at men". An editor for Newsday said the album [...] "cements her status as the Queen of Reggaetón and Latin hip hop". Wayne Marshall writing for The Phoenix opinionated that the [...] "retrospective of recent hits and career standouts, is a crucial primer on the reigning Queen of reggaeton". Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News saw the release of Flashback, along with Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino En Directo (2005) and Don Omar's The Last Don Live (2004) as releases that combine current hits, remixes, live renditions and previously unreleased material, because the artists haven't had time to produce an all-new album due to the genre's demanding status, at the time. An editor for the Dominican Times claimed the album to be [...] "as strong as she [...] is" [...] and awarded the album four and a half stars out of five. Natasha Washington from NewsOK claimed the album to cover [...] "Queen's 10-year singing career with 16 classic hits familiar in Latin markets, fresh to the United States," [...] while selecting [...] "Cuentale", [...] "Te He Querido, Te He Llorado", [...] "Si Una Vez", [...] "Marroneo" [...] and [...] "Libertad" [...] as the stand out tracks.|$|E
