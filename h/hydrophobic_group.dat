Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse {{in water and}} adsorb at interfaces between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil.

50|$|Polymers on the {{surfaces}} of the colloidal fraction of soils promote steric stabilization of those particles by preventing them from approaching each other and aggregating. This effect is seen {{in a variety of}} aqueous and nonaqueous environments, and is not affected by electrolytes in solution. The degree of steric stabilization depends on the amount of clay surface covered by adsorbed polymers, the strength of the polymer bond, the thickness of the polymer layer, and the favorability of the solvent for the polymer loops and tails. Block and graft copolymers, made up of two different homopolymers with differing solubilities in the suspension medium, are most often used for steric stabilization. When synthesized to have alternating regions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, copolymers can stabilize the suspension because their <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>group</b> adsorbs strongly to the colloid surface while the hydrophilic group is attracted to the solvent. In general, the adsorption of polymers to clay surfaces is entropically favored because one polymer molecule displaces many water molecules which were previously bound to the soil particle.|$|E

This revealed a hydrophobic pocket around the phenyl ring adjacent to the piperazinylmethyl group of imatinib. Attempts to utilize this pocket to increase efficacy led to the addition of various hydrophobic groups including single fluoro, bromo and chloro substituents. Finally a trifluoromethyl group at position 3 was found to give the best results, with approximately 36-fold improvement over imatinib.

Cross-linking was brought about by addition of {{a small amount of}} N,N+-methylenebisacrylamide. The cross-linked homo- and copolymers showed an increase of their reduced viscosity {{in aqueous solution}} upon the controlled introduction of cross-linking agent into their chemical structure. Viscosity measurements revealed that the conformational transition of polysoaps to compact coils in aqueous solution is strongly dependent upon the <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>group</b> content of the polysoaps. The formation of hydrophobic microdomains is akin to intramolecular micelle formation. Depending on the <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>group</b> content and the percentage of cross-linking, intermolecular aggregation was also revealed by viscosity measurements at higher concentrations of polysoap. The hydrophobic microdomains of the non-cross-lined and cross-linked polysoaps were characterized by hypsochromic shifts of the long-wavelength absorption band of Methyl Orange as a solvatochromic probe, non-covalently bound to the macromolecule. Catalysis of the unimolecular decarboxylation of 6 -nitrobenzisoxazole- 3 -carboxylate by the on-cross-linked and crosslinked copolymers was investigated in aqueous solution at pH 11. 3 and 30 Â°C.

The amounts of attached groups have been characterized using NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A range of particles were prepared, with sizes from around 13 to 70 nm in diameter. Hydrophilic functionalization of the silica sols was achieved by attaching methyl poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) silane to the silica particle surface. This provides a reduction of surface charge density, a pH dependent and controllable flocculation behavior and surface activity. The hydrophobic functionalization of the silica sols was accomplished by attaching organosilanes containing mainly propyl and methyl groups. The emulsification abilities were evaluated by preparing Pickering emulsions using particles, with varying degrees and combinations of surface functionalization, as stabilizers and comparing the obtained emulsion droplet size distributions. It was found that colloidal silica functionalized with <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>groups</b> produced emulsions with smaller droplets compared to using unmodified silica.

40|$|Molecular {{aggregation}} equilibria, such as {{the binding}} of ligands to a central solute molecule, are prevalent throughout biological processes and energy storage devices. However, both the sign and magnitude of hydrophobic and ionic interactions remains a subject of theoretical debate, {{and has yet to}} be experimentally determined. Here, Raman vibrational spectroscopy is combined with multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR) to experimentally quantify both the number of hydrophobic contacts between alcohol molecules in water and the affinity of ions for molecular hydrophobic interfaces. Furthermore, a generalized theoretical model is developed based on random statistics in which it is assumed that the concentration of each chemical species is everywhere identical to its bulk concentration. Solute-ligand (direct) and ligand-ligand (cooperative) interactions are incorporated into the RM model and validated against an exact finite lattice (FL) model. ^ Comparison of the Raman-MCR experimental results and random mixing predictions imply that there are no more hydrophobic contacts in aqueous solutions of alcohols ranging from methanol to tertiary butyl alcohol than in random mixtures of the same concentration. This suggests that the interaction between small <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>groups</b> in water is weaker than thermal energy fluctuations. Thus, the corresponding water-mediated hydrophobic interaction must be repulsive, with a magnitude sufficient to negate the attractive direct van der Waals interaction between the <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>groups.</b> ^ Additional Raman-MCR experimental results imply that the interaction between aqueous sodium or fluoride ions and molecular <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>groups</b> is repulsive. In contrast, the sign and magnitude of the interaction energy between iodide ions and molecular <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>groups</b> depends on the methyl group partial charge.
