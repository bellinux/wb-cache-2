50|$|During the 1880s, as {{the company}} became well known, several small {{manufacturers}} in Belgium and Australia attempted to manufacture copies of <b>Greener</b> weapons. In several cases, the name was misleadingly similar: Greenen, Horace <b>Greener,</b> Albert <b>Greener,</b> A. <b>Greener,</b> W.H. <b>Greener,</b> A.H. <b>Greener</b> etc. are several examples of names of spurious weapons. Note that J.H. <b>Greener</b> and Albert <b>Greener</b> were two brothers of W W <b>Greener</b> and both brothers also made guns.

5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a <b>green</b> chair), ett grönt hus (a <b>green</b> house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The definite form of an adjective {{is identical to the}} indefinite plural form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the <b>green</b> chair"), det gröna huset ("the <b>green</b> house"), and de gröna stolarna ("the <b>green</b> chairs").|$|E

50|$|<b>Greener</b> was a {{firm believer}} in the concept of muzzleloaders and refused to make any breechloaders. Hence, his son, William Wellington <b>Greener,</b> struck out a line of his own (the W.W. <b>Greener</b> company) and {{produced}} his first breechloader in 1864. When William <b>Greener</b> died in 1869, the two companies were amalgamated together as the W.W. <b>Greener</b> Company, and carried on by William Wellington <b>Greener.</b> William Wellington <b>Greener</b> was responsible for several innovations, as described in the sections below, and it was on the strength of his inventions that the company became famous.

5|$|Animals {{typically}} use {{the color}} <b>green</b> as camouflage, blending {{in with the}} chlorophyll <b>green</b> of the surrounding environment. <b>Green</b> animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear <b>green</b> because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also {{be affected by the}} surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a <b>green</b> hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display <b>green</b> colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look <b>green</b> as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing <b>green</b> clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the <b>green</b> pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.|$|E

5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, <b>Green</b> Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} <b>Green</b> Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted <b>green,</b> {{with the exception of the}} yellow vertical loop. The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because <b>Green</b> Lantern's enemy is the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the <b>Green</b> Lantern) and the <b>Green</b> Lantern Corps.|$|E

5000|$|The {{party was}} created in 1992 as a split from the Federation of the <b>Greens.</b> The Federalist <b>Greens</b> debuted to the 1992 {{political}} elections however it failed to gain any seats. In the 1994 political elections the party presented its lists only in Lazio, in a uninominal college of the Chamber of Deputies and in all the colleges of the Senate. The result for the Senate, on a regional basis, was a respectable (3,23% of the vote), but insufficient to elect any senators. [...] In the 2004 European elections the Federalist <b>Greens</b> presented a joint list with the <b>Greens</b> <b>Greens</b> in all districts.
