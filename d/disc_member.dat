40|$|We have {{collected}} high-dispersion echelle spectra of red giant {{members in the}} twelve open clusters (OCs) and derived stellar parameters and chemical abundances for 26 species by either line equivalent widths or synthetic spectrum analyses. We confirm {{the lack of an}} age-metallicity relation for OCs but argue that such a lack of trend for OCs arise from the limited coverage in metallicity compared to that of field stars which span a wide range in metallicity and age. We confirm that the radial metallicity gradient of OCs is steeper (flatter) for Rgc 12 kpc). We demonstrate that the sample of clusters constituting a steep radial metallicity gradient of slope - 0. 052 ± 0. 011 dex kpc^- 1 at Rgc 12 kpc are relatively old, thick <b>disc</b> <b>members</b> with a striking spread in age and height above the midplane (0. 5 < |z| < 2. 5 kpc). Our investigation reveals that the OCs and field stars yield consistent radial metallicity gradients if the comparison is limited to samples drawn from the similar vertical heights. We argue via the computation of Galactic orbits that all the outer disc clusters were actually born inward of 12 kpc but the orbital eccentricity has taken them to present locations very far from their birthplaces.

40|$|Resistance {{to death}} receptor–mediated {{apoptosis}} {{is supposed to}} be important for the deregulated growth of B cell lymphoma. Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, the malignant cells of classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL), resist CD 95 -induced apoptosis. Therefore, we analyzed death receptor signaling, in particular the CD 95 pathway, in these cells. High level CD 95 expression allowed a rapid formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) containing Fas-associated death domain–containing protein (FADD), caspase- 8, caspase- 10, and most importantly, cellular FADD-like interleukin 1 �–converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP). The immunohistochemical analysis of the <b>DISC</b> <b>members</b> revealed a strong expression of CD 95 and c-FLIP overexpression in 55 out of 59 cases of cHL. FADD overexpression was detectable in several cases. Triggering of the CD 95 pathway in HRS cells is indicated by the presence of CD 95 L in cells surrounding them as well as confocal microscopy showing c-FLIP predominantly localized at the cell membrane. Elevated c-FLIP expression in HRS cells depends on nuclear factor (NF) -�B. Despite expression of other NF-�B–dependent antiapoptotic proteins, the selective down-regulation of c-FLIP by small interfering RNA oligoribonucleotides was sufficient to sensitize HRS cells to CD 95 and tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand–induced apoptosis. Therefore, c-FLIP is a key regulator of death receptor resistance in HRS cells. Key words: lymphoma • CD 95 antigen • TRAIL protein • NF-�B • siRN...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of ULAS J 131610. 28 + 075553. 0, a sdT 6. 5 dwarf in the UKIDSS Large Area Survey 2 epoch proper motion catalogue. This object displays significant spectral peculiarity, with the largest yet seen deviations from T 6 and T 7 templates in the Y and K bands for this subtype. Its large, ~ 1 arcsec/yr, proper motion suggests a large tangential velocity of Vtan = 240 - 340 km/s, if we assume its MJ lies within the typical range for T 6. 5 dwarfs. This makes it a candidate for membership of the Galactic halo population. However, other metal poor T dwarfs exhibit significant under luminosity both in specific bands and bolometrically.
