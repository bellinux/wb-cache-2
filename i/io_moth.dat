50|$|Sugarberry occurs {{primarily}} along {{streams and}} in moist soils on floodplains. Its fruit are eaten by birds, helping to disperse the seeds. The leaves are eaten {{by a number}} of insects, for example caterpillars of the <b>Io</b> <b>moth</b> (Automeris io).|$|E
50|$|In the wild, eastern redbud is a {{frequent}} native understory tree in mixed forests and hedgerows. It is also much planted as a landscape ornamental plant. The leaves are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, for example the <b>Io</b> <b>moth</b> (Automeris io).|$|E
50|$|This tree {{provides}} {{food for}} moose, American red squirrels, crossbills and chickadees, {{as well as}} shelter for moose, snowshoe hares, white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse and other small mammals and songbirds. The needles are eaten by some lepidopteran caterpillars, for example the <b>Io</b> <b>moth</b> (Automeris io).|$|E
50|$|Rhodanassa <b>io</b> is a <b>moth</b> of the Depressariidae {{family and}} only {{species in the}} Rhodanassa genus. It is found in French Guiana.|$|R
40|$|Nodamura virus multiplied in {{mosquito}} cell lines, {{as determined}} by infectivivity assays in adult honey bees (Apis mellifera) and wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella). Titres of more than Io 7 and io ~ bee LDs 0 /ml were obtained in culture fluids of Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti cells respectively after IO days. Comparable titres were obtained after several months, during which the cultures were subdivided up to six times. Nodamura virus also multiplied in BHK cells and yielded titres of lO 4. 8 to IO 6. 6 mouse LDs 0 /ml and I @ " ~ to <b>io</b> va wax <b>moth</b> LDso/ml in culture fluid I to 4 days after infection. No c. p. e, was observed in infected cells...|$|R
50|$|Comptonia peregrina {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} Bucculatrix paroptila, grey pug, setaceous Hebrew character, <b>Io</b> <b>moth,</b> and several Coleophora case-bearers: C. comptoniella, C. peregrinaevorella (which feeds exclusively on Comptonia), C. persimplexella, C. pruniella and C. serratella. It is also a non-legume nitrogen fixer.|$|E
50|$|Automeris io (<b>Io</b> <b>moth)</b> is a {{colorful}} North American moth {{in the family}} Saturniidae. It ranges from {{the southeast corner of}} Manitoba and in the southern extremes of Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick in Canada, and in the US it is found from Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, east of those states and down to the southern end of Florida.|$|E
50|$|Camouflage {{consists}} {{of not only}} color but also shape and pattern. The background upon which the organism is seen can be both its environment, such as a mantis resembling dead leaves, or other organisms, e.g., the stripes of zebra blending in {{with each other in}} a herd, making it difficult for lions to focus on a single target. In mimicry, an organism has a similar appearance to another species, as in the drone fly, which resembles a bee, yet has no sting. Another example of such Batesian mimicry is the <b>io</b> <b>moth,</b> (Automeris io), which has markings on its wings that resemble an owl's eyes. When an insectivorous predator disturbs the moth, it reveals its hind wings, temporarily startling the predator and giving it time to escape. Predators may also use mimicry to lure their prey, however. Female fireflies of the genus Photuris, for example, copy the light signals of other species, thereby attracting male fireflies, which are then captured and eaten (see aggressive mimicry).|$|E
40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of wing pattern formation in Lepidoptera has advanced significantly {{in recent years}} due to the careful examination of several groups of butterflies. The eyespot is a prominent feature of Lepidoptera wing pattern, especially in the family Saturniidae. The present study examined how sulfated polysaccharides affected the wing pattern formation of the <b>Io</b> <b>moth,</b> Automeris io (Saturniidae).  Prepupae and pupae of this species were subjected to injections of heparin and cold shock. While the cold shock had little to no effect on wing pattern, the aberrations resulting from heparin injections were moderate to profound and depended on the dose and the stage at which injection was made. The changes consisted of expansion of the black ring around the dorsal hindwing eyespots and distortion of discal spots on both dorsal and ventral sides of forewings, suggesting a possible link between genetic controls of these elements. Several different types of scales form the normal color pattern of Automeris io, and heparin-induced changes correspond to changes in shape of scales. The resulting aberrations are dubbed ‘Black Eye’ and ‘Comet Eye. ’ Other known aberrations of Automeris io eyespots are summarized, illustrated, and named...|$|E
