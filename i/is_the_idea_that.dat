5|$|Milton Friedman {{developed}} {{an alternative to}} Keynesian macroeconomics eventually labeled monetarism. Generally monetarism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the supply of money matters for the macroeconomy. When monetarism emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, Keynesians neglected the role money played in inflation and the business cycle, and monetarism directly challenged those points.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} pieces of tornado {{folklore}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> tornadoes do most of their damage due to the lower atmospheric pressure {{at the center of}} a tornado, which causes the house to explode outward. As the theory goes, opening windows helps to equalize the pressure.|$|E
5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely {{based on the}} common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another {{idea is that the}} Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E

5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> certain {{biological systems}} cannot {{be broken down}} into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|New Media {{consultant}} Glen Whitman {{stated in}} an interview that this particular episode contains some recent scientific developments that were part of their inspiration for the creation of Fringe in the first place. Specifically, Whitman is referring to the use of transgenics, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> there are organisms with genes from other species. Whitman concluded that they were partly inspired by scientists Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Y. Tsien and their work on research on isolating genes from jellyfish for the treatment of Huntington's disease; all three won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing {{the path of a}} point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} themes running through McKenna's work, and {{the title of his}} second book, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Western civilization <b>was</b> {{undergoing}} what he called an [...] "archaic revival".|$|R
5|$|At Calakmul's {{peak in the}} 7th century, {{the polity}} was known as Kan. Interesting {{to know is that}} the title Kan was used at another place before Calakmul became a {{regional}} powerhouse. The Preclassic political state in the Mirador Basin also used the title Kan. There <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that,</b> {{after the collapse of the}} Mirador state, its refugees migrated north towards Calakmul, where they founded a new Kan polity. However, epigraphical studies of the monuments at Calakmul show that prior to the 7th century AD the emblem glyph of Calakmul had nothing to do with a snake, but with a bat. It seems that a different polity ruled there. The Kan emblem glyph, before being associated with Calakmul, is found (once) at Dzibanché, a site more towards the east. Perhaps during the late 6th/early 7th century, the polity at Dzibanché moved to Calakmul in order to establish a more strategically placed capital. After Calakmul's power dwindled in the 8th century, after the rule of Yuknoom Took K'awiil, it appears that the bat emblem glyph made its resurgence. Still, many uncertainties remain and new epigraphical studies have to be done to fill the gaps.|$|E
5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> birds evolved from running bird ancestors, {{known as the}} cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed to run up trees or other steep slopes, developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier.|$|E
5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that,</b> where {{a charitable}} trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes {{as close as}} possible to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible ({{as close as possible}}), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{way that}} {{mathematical}} statements are true for mathematical anti-realists. This would typically <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a proposition can be true if it is an entailment of some intuitively appealing axiom—in other words, a priori analytical reasoning.|$|R
5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, Lee D. Ross, a {{professor}} of social psychology at Stanford University, developed a theory of a type of construal that he calls [...] "naïve realism." [...] In a simple experiment, Ross took peace proposals created by Israeli negotiators, labeled them as Palestinian proposals, and told Israeli citizens <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> in <b>the</b> proposal <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> Palestinians wanted <b>the</b> Israeli to adopt. Then, he took the original proposals and told <b>the</b> Israeli subjects <b>that</b> <b>ideas</b> on <b>the</b> proposal <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Israelis wanted the Palestinians to adopt.

In recent times the indigenous position has come to the foreground of the public debate.|$|E
