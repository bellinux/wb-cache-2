5|$|The Dillon <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room,</b> {{which was}} {{originally}} {{known as the}} Lee <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room,</b> was renamed in honor of former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon, who donated its unique wallpaper, a Chinese print from 1770. Dillon's wife Phyllis purchased the wallpaper {{on the recommendation of}} interior designer Eleanor Brown in 1964. The wallpaper was removed and refurbished between 1982 and 1988. The room is furnished with 18th century English pieces, along with Chinese vases from the Ming and Qing (Kangxi reign) dynasties. The Dillon <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> is used by resident heads of state and chiefs of government to formally receive visitors.|$|E

5|$|Designed by Burges for himself, the Zodiac settle was {{originally}} placed in his rooms at 15 Buckingham Street on The Strand in London, and later moved to The Tower House in Holland Park around 1878, when Burges first occupied the house. The Tower House {{was designed by}} Burges by himself. Burges continued to work on Tower House {{until his death in}} 1881, and the Zodiac settle was placed opposite the <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> windows in Tower House. The decoration of the <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> remained unfinished upon Burges's death. The Tower House was subsequently owned by Burges's brother-in-law, Pullan, and then by Colonel T.H. Minshall in the 1920s. Minshall offered the Zodiac settle and other items from Tower House for sale in 1933, but the settle remained unsold.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now the <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room,</b> originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in the <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E

5|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{room in the}} suite is the Mazarin Room. This <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> is lined with Italian gilded and painted polychrome boiseries by craftsmen brought to France by Cardinal Mazarin, who was related by marriage to the Grimaldi. Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above the fireplace.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} state {{rooms on the}} first floor of the east wing {{contains}} the long gallery, library, <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> (great chamber), small <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> and two bedrooms. All date originally from the Jacobean mansion, but are likely to have been significantly altered by John Crewe and then extensively reworked by Blore in neo-Jacobean style. They were restored to Barry's designs, usually with little attempt to reproduce the Jacobean appearance, probably because records of most of the original designs were lacking. Crace performed much of the decoration work in these rooms. All the state rooms contain elaborate plasterwork and stone chimneypieces, often flanked with Corinthian columns or pilasters.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol Limited {{received}} streamlined heavyweight {{sleeping and}} dining cars in 1938. A typical consist included the following: baggage-dormitory, 8-section 1-drawing room 1-compartment sleeping car, dining car, {{three to four}} 8-section 5-double bedroom sleeping cars, 14-section sleeping car, two 12-section 1-drawing room sleeping cars, and a sleeper-buffet-lounge with a <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> and three compartments. In 1941 these cars were augmented by several lightweight 10-roomette 5-bedroom sleeping cars.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} {{was to have}} been a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and his successors. However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> remain or have been re-instated.|$|E
5|$|Under his ownership, the <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> was redecorated in a Renaissance Venetian style, In the process, Crace's {{stencilling}} {{was over}} painted and then covered by damasked silk, the Norton fireplace was removed, the furniture replaced with Edwardian pieces, and the carpet dyed by Sketchleys. In 1917, {{to assist the}} war effort, the ironwork conservatory was razed, and its ironwork melted down for ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1747, Fownes Luttrell made {{numerous}} and significant alterations to Dunster Castle, redecorating and redesigning {{it in the}} Rococo style. He renovated the Great Parlour, converted a bedroom over it into a <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> in 1758, created a Breakfast Room over the Hall in 1772, remodelled {{the southern part of}} the castle, and altered the Great Staircase in 1773. His changes to the décor of the castle are also noteworthy, particularly for his use of newly-fashionable wallpaper.|$|E
5|$|Frank Brittan sold Linwood House to Hiorns in 1889, who {{commissioned}} architect John Whitelaw {{to design}} an extension. This {{resulted in a}} <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> a billiard room and a study {{to be added to}} the house. In 1898, Hiorns leased Linwood House to Sir John Denniston for five years. Hiorns had retired from business and spent some of his time in Sydney. Denniston, the oldest son of Thomas Denniston and married to the daughter of John Bathgate, was a judge at the Supreme Court in Christchurch.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rooms in}} the state suite include the Red Room— so called because its walls are covered in red brocade— a large <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> {{containing}} paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.|$|E

5|$|Pound {{returned}} from America in 1911 and resumed his visits to Olivia and Dorothy, adhering to Olivia's restrictions. That October Pound formally asked to marry Dorothy; her father refused {{on the basis}} of Pound's meagre income. Neither Dorothy nor Pound gave up: he again asked for permission to marry her in March 1912 but was again rejected. In Dorothy's mind they continued to be engaged, although they were only allowed short visits in the Family <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> once a week or every two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Starting in January 2005, {{the mansion}} closed {{for almost three}} years as it {{underwent}} the major restoration project. As part of the 2005–07 renovations, the <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> and two bedchambers were completely refurbished. The drawing room's furnishings were extensively researched to reflect accurately the Mansion in the 1830–60 period. The ornate cupola atop the mansion was restored, including the spherical ornament above the cupola, which was refinished in gold leaf. The Hampton Mansion re-opened to the public on November 30, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered {{from the}} <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room.</b> It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers.|$|E
