40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{three major}} issues: whether predictors of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> differ by age at <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> whether predictors differ by {{first time and}} last time <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> and what variables best predict repeated <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> The 1988 National Survey of Families and Households provides the data set from which respondents age 30 and below are selected. Discriminant analysis and event history are the major methods by which these issues are addressed. Four major categories of variables {{are included in the}} analysis: family structure, family formation, personal characteristics, and control variables. Respondents are divided into three groups according to their ages at first time and last time home leaving: early home leavers (left at age 17 and below), on-time home leavers (left between 18 and 24), and late home leavers (left at 25 and above). ^ It is found that predictors of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> differ according to the group of home leavers under study. Growing up in a non-nuclear household (adoptive, stepfamily, or other) generally affects early <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> Single-parent families are associated with on-time <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> When early marriage is controlled, marital status emerges as a better predictor of late than on-time <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> ^ The predictors of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> vary little by whether we look at first time or last time <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> The effect of family structure is significant but very similar in both cases. The observable changes are largely associated with parenthood, divorce/separation status, and personal income. ^ Repeated <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> is best predicted by respondents 2 ̆ 7 age at first <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> race, and divorce/separation status. Children from non-biological or non-intact families are less likely to repeat <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> In {{spite of the fact that}} the previous literature suggests a high home return rate for those who once lived in barracks or dormitories, military service and student status fail to predict repeated <b>home</b> <b>leaving.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{exploratory}} study, we profile {{variations in}} <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> <b>home</b> returning, and home staying behaviour among four ethnocultural groups in Canada - British, Chinese, Indian, and South European. Data {{collected in a}} 1999 - 2000 survey of 1, 907 young adults (ages 19 - 35) residing in the Vancouver area are used. Our principal foci are ethnocultural and gendered aspects of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> trajectories, specifically: ages at <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> and returning, and reasons for <b>home</b> <b>leaving,</b> <b>home</b> returning and home staying. Special {{attention is paid to}} returners/boomerangers, given an increasing overall trend in home returning in Canada. We find that: (a) both ethnocultural origin and gender are important determinants of <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> trajectory, (b) there is a distinct (but far from tidy) difference between European-origin and Asian-origin groups in <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> trajectory, (c) British-Canadians <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> at the youngest ages and Indo-Canadians at the oldest ages, (d) the main reason for <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> is independence for British-Canadians; schooling for Chinese-Canadians, and marriage for Indo-Canadians, (e) among all four groups, <b>home</b> returners <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> initially at younger ages and, with the exception of Indo-Canadian young men, who typically <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> for school, and (f) gender differences in <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> trajectory are larger among the Chinese and Indo-Canadians than among persons of European origins. Overall, we conclude that the theorized trend of the individualized family life course holds for only some ethnocultural groups in Canada. We conclude with suggestions for future research directions on the topic of ethnicity and the <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> life course transitions...|$|R

40|$|The {{decision}} {{to remain in}} or <b>leave</b> the parental <b>home</b> represents the first housing career choice of young people. In this paper, we examine the parental <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> outcomes for Australian birth cohorts {{in the twentieth century}} using recall questions contained in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. The findings from survival analysis and hazard function modelling is that a continuous, gradual reduction in the age of first <b>leaving</b> the parental <b>home</b> in Australia is evident up to the 1947 - 51 birth cohort, followed by stability and then a rise in age of first <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> for the most recent birth cohorts. Birth cohort effects remain significant even after other measured determinants of parental <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> are taken into account. The paper confirms the strong roles that education, family background, and ethnicity have on parental <b>home</b> <b>leaving</b> outcomes...|$|R

40|$|There is much {{ambiguity}} about consultant <b>leave</b> <b>allowances</b> and {{arrangements for}} {{cover in the}} National Health Service. We analysed job descriptions for 47 consultant posts advertised in mid- 2000. 35 defined a duty rota but only 3 mentioned specific available leave (all different).

When a consultant is absent, colleagues tend to provide cover for emergency cases but not for elective admissions, which are managed largely by junior doctors. This arrangement is particularly hazardous in surgical specialties. If elective surgery is to continue when the consultant is absent, arrangements for leave and cover need to be more clearly defined...|$|R
