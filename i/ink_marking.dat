50|$|Lu Ban {{was born}} in the state of Lu, {{possibly}} at Dunhuang, to family of carpenters or artisans during the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou dynasty. His original name was Gongshu Yizhi. He was also referred to as Gongshu Ban or Pan. He {{was supposed to have been}} an indifferent pupil until his love of learning was kindled by the scholar Zi Xia. He later learned woodworking from Bao Laodong. The great demand for his work supposedly compelled him to invent or improve a number of carpenter's tools—the saw, the square, the planer, the drill, the shovel, and an <b>ink</b> <b>marking</b> tool—to complete his many projects more quickly. His wife was also credited with inventing the umbrella in order to permit him to work in inclement weather.|$|E

To {{reveal the}} jetting of fine drops, model of 2 -phase flow between gas and liquid is offered based on {{volume of fluid}} method. Numerical simulation is launched for the droplet generation through narrow nozzle, and key factors are discussed. Aiming at the <b>ink</b> <b>marking</b> of defective dies in IC production, a jetting inker driven by piezoceramic stacks is developed. The actuation properties are derived; waveform of induced pressure at nozzle entrance is estimated, which coincides the numerical results. Performance of ink dot jetting is evaluated and simulation results are verified...|$|E
30|$|Also of {{interest}} are the insights provided here about marking materials, lacquer and soot-based ink. Lacquer was exploited much earlier in Chinese history than ink, for example for lacquer vessels, as an adhesive agent, for painting, {{and even for}} writing. Historical documents and archaeological evidence both indicate that ink was produced during the late Zhou Dynasty (1050 - 221 bc) to write on bamboo and wooden slips [33, 36, 37], such as the two fragmentary wooden slips found at Qingchuan [34]. In addition, a broken piece of soot for ink-making, 2.1  cm in diameter and 1.2  cm in height, {{was found in the}} Qin tomb of Shuihudi in 1976 [4, 38], while the tomb of Marquis Yi (ca. 475 - 433 bc) of the Zeng State [35] yielded earlier bamboo slips with ink characters. Given the preliminary evidence presented here for soot-based <b>ink</b> <b>marking</b> evidence on the Qin bronze triggers, an important question remains how widespread such painted/inked marking is on the wider assemblage of crossbows from Pit 1 or {{in other parts of the}} rest of the mausoleum complex. There is a much greater likelihood that such inked marks will have faded or disappeared altogether from the trigger surface, and/or further vestiges can probably only be identified with close analytical prospection. We suggest a more comprehensive programme of study involving multispectral imaging and verification by SEM and Raman spectroscopy is worthwhile in future.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether open lumbosacral spina bifida results from an abnormality of neural folding (primary neurulation) or medullary cord canalisation (secondary neurulation). Homozygous curly tail (ct) mouse embryos were studied as a model system for human neural tube defects. The rostral end of the spina bifida was found to lie at the level of somites 27 to 32 in over 90 % of affected ct/ct embryos. Indian <b>ink</b> <b>marking</b> experiments using non-mutant embryos showed that the posterior neuropore closes, and primary neurulation is completed, at the level of somites 32 to 34. Since neurulation in mammals progresses in a craniocaudal sequence, without overlap between regions of primary and secondary neurulation, we conclude that spina bifida in ct/ct embryos arises initially as a defect of primary neurulation. The position of posterior neuropore closure in human embryos is estimated to lie at the level of the future second sacral segment indicating that in humans, as in the ct mouse, lumbosacral spina bifida usually arises as a defect of posterior neuropore closure. Cranial NTD affect females predominantly, whereas lower spinal NTD are more common in males, both in humans and ct mice. We offer an explanation for this phenomenon based on (a) differences in the effect of embryonic growth retardation on the likelihood that an embryo will develop either cranial or lower spinal NTD and (b) differences in the rate of growth and development of male and female embryos at the time of neurulation...|$|E

40|$|Context: The {{indelible}} ink that′s {{used in our}} elections was developed by National Physical Laboratories (NPL), Delhi in 1962, and has been used ever since. Though formulated by NPL, it is manufactured by Mysore Paints and Varnish Ltd. owned by the Karnataka Government. Earlier, the <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> was applied on the cuticle but with effect from February 01, 2006 the ink is applied on the voter′s left index fingernail from the distal end proximally until the cuticle using an applicator. This idea of the <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> applied during elections {{was used as a}} simple tool to measure the rate of nail growth in a busy outpatient department of a Tertiary Hospital in South India. Aims: To assess the feasibility of using the <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> during elections as a method of obtaining data of nail growth across the spectrum of the entire country. Subjects and Methods: In 74 patients presenting to a hospital, the rate of nail growth was measured. The voter′s mark on the left index fingernail of patients during the recent elections was used as a marker for measuring the length of the nail. Results: The average rate of nail growth was 0. 113 mm/day. The rate of nail growth was found to be more in females, younger individuals, pregnancy, patients on nutritional supplementation, psoriasis. Conclusion: This study which was conducted on 74 patients using the election <b>ink</b> <b>mark</b> successfully confirmed the possibility of using it as an efficient tool in measuring the rate of nail growth. The findings revealed the slightly higher rate of nail growth as compared to a study done by Rani et al. However, the limited sample size in this study was the major limitation...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{takes as}} its modest {{starting}} point, a re-investigation of two previously identified <b>ink</b> <b>marks</b> on bronze crossbow triggers from Terracotta Army Pit 1. In contrast to incised marks which are commonplace {{on a variety}} of weapons from the mausoleum [11, 12], <b>ink</b> <b>marks</b> have only very rarely been identified so far. In total, three black-painted marks have so far been identified on the over 200 crossbow triggers recovered from Pit 1 (with the characters Jia 甲 (1 st of the ten Heavenly Stems notation), Wu 武 (martial) and Jiu 九 (the number nine), while a red-painted mark (Sigong, 寺工, referring to the Qin central workshop) has also been found on a lance scabbard [12 – 14]. By applying a range of analytical techniques—multispectral photography, digital microscopy and Raman spectroscopy—we are however able both to shed further light on known instances of <b>ink</b> <b>marks</b> and to identify previously unrecognised, matching marks on other parts of the same triggers and to suggest what substance was used to make the ink. Additional spatial analysis of all known marks on the crossbow triggers in Pit 1, and further attention to crossbow trigger micro-style and Qin documentary sources, extend our previous conclusions about Qin artefact marking practices, imperial workshop organisation and product quality control in this crucial period of early Chinese political consolidation. These insights also fit into a long-term programme of collaborative research on Qin imperial logistics [11, 12, 15 – 20].|$|R
