In the short and medium term, the objectives should be to settle outstanding pension claims, revise early retirement provisions and investment policies, and improve capabilities for administering statutory pension funds. In the long term the objectives should be to convert the Zambia National Provident Fund (ZNPF) into a modest basic pension scheme for private sector employees, and subsequently integrate civil servants and public sector employees into that scheme; establish regulatory provisions to develop and supervise private pension funds; and establish an administrative mechanism to review social protection policy and to supervise and coordinate its application by all agencies.

40|$|The public {{dissatisfaction with}} the Swedish health {{insurance}} system has increased during the latest decade. During the same period, the health insurance system has been heavily debated in Swedish politics regarding new legal frameworks and lowered <b>income</b> <b>ceilings.</b> The highest level of dissatisfaction among the Swedish population was measured during 2012. This paper aims at answering the question What individual characteristics creates {{dissatisfaction with the}} Swedish health insurance system? Using a theory-testing approach, this paper seeks to test for the validity of earlier developed theories on why dissatisfaction with social insurance system increases. Extensive literature is used {{from the field of}} welfare state-research, combined with research on matters like “risk redistribution” and “dependency of social insurance”. The paper also looks at different possible explanations, mainly presented by previous empirical studies performed by scholars and government agencies. The study presents, via a deductive research strategy, a number of hypothesis formulated from a wide scope of previous research.     The hypotheses are being tested thru logistic regression analysis, using data from the 2012 nationwide survey provided by “SOM-institutet”, University of Gothenburg. The main finding is that variables related to objective characteristics among the Swedish population, such as origin and social class, is much less related to the probability of feeling dissatisfied with the Swedish health insurance than expected. Instead, subjective characteristics such as ideological position are more related to the dissatisfaction with the health insurance. The most striking result is however that the evaluation of other public institutions and agencies, e. g. the Swedish unemployment insurance and the Swedish Social Insurance Agency are highly related to dissatisfaction with the health insurance system. ...|$|R

The program, launched in February of 2008, expanded upon BadgerCare (Wisconsin’s Children’s Health Insurance Program- CHIP) and Medicaid.

BadgerCare Plus eliminated the <b>income</b> eligibility <b>ceiling</b> for children. Coverage operates as a single program with two insurance products: the Standard Plan, for enrollees 200 % FPL. The former is the traditional Medicaid plan and requires only minimal cost-sharing, while the latter is comprised of a more limited set of covered services and requires co-payments on non-preventive services, similar to private insurance policies. The premium threshold for children was set at 150 % FPL under BadgerCare and was raised to 200 % FPL under BadgerCare Plus.

25|$|To {{calculate}} the total benefits a retiree is eligible for, the average indexed monthly salary (AIME) is then {{divided into three}} separate salary brackets—each multiplied by a different benefit percentage. The benefits receivable (the so-called Primary Insurance Amount, PIA) are {{the sum of the}} salary in each bracket times the benefit percentages that apply to each bracket. The benefit percentages are set by Congress and so can easily change in the future. The bendpoints, where the brackets change, are adjusted for inflation each year by Social Security. For example, in 2013 the first bracket runs from $1 to $791/month and is multiplied by the benefit percentage of 90%, the second salary bracket extends from $791 to $4,781/month is multiplied by 32%, the third salary bracket of more than $4,781/month is multiplied by 15%. Any higher <b>incomes</b> than the <b>ceiling</b> <b>income</b> are not FICA covered and are not considered in the benefits calculation or in determining the average indexed monthly salary, AIME. At full retirement age the projected retirement income amount (PIA) is the sum of these three brackets of income multiplied by the appropriate benefit percentages—90%, 32% and 15%. Unlike income tax brackets, the Social Security benefits are heavily biased towards lower salaried workers. Social Security has always been primarily a retirement, disability and spousal insurance policy for low wage workers and a very poor retirement plan for higher salaried workers who hopefully have a supplemental retirement plan unless they want to live on significantly less after retirement than they used to earn.|$|R
3000|$|The {{majority}} of Swedish wage earners {{are eligible for}} an income-dependent unemployment benefit administered by unemployment insurance funds. Prior to 2007, the before-tax replacement rate was 80 per cent for those with a wage <b>income</b> below a <b>ceiling</b> and above a floor. From 2007, the replacement rate was made dependent on unemployment duration. An unemployed worker with a previous income between {{the floor and the}} ceiling now faces a before-tax replacement rate of 80 per cent for the first 200  days. After 200  days, the replacement rate drops to 70 per cent for the next 100  days (250  days for parents of minors). After that, an unemployed worker receives 65 per cent of the earlier wage indefinitely within a labour market programme: the job and activity guarantee. The implication is a gradually falling replacement rate over an unemployment spell. Earlier, the maximum benefit level for the first 100  days of unemployment was SEK 730, but it was reduced to SEK 680 from 2007 so that the maximum benefit level is now the same throughout the unemployment spell. Since the maximum benefit levels have been fixed in nominal terms since 2002 (with the exception of the cut described above), there has been a gradual reduction in the replacement rate for high-income earners when their wages have increased. The minimum daily unemployment benefit has also been held constant (at SEK 320) since 2002, so those obtaining it (low-income earners and those who are not members of an insurance fund) have also experienced a gradual fall in the replacement rate. 2 [...]...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{and deep}} changes in society, {{the economy and}} policy over the last decades are having an {{increasing}} impact on the delivery of social housing in North Western Europe. These changes are transforming {{the way in which}} social housing providers perform their task and are reshaping their relationships with the State, communities and with other market actors. The combination of continued State withdrawal from service provision, the deep and persistent effects of the global financial crisis that begun in 2008 and profound changes in the type of demand for social housing across North Western Europe call for a reflection on the implications of these phenomena for social housing providers. Several studies indicate that social housing providers in Europe have begun to adopt new (social) entrepreneurial strategies and are becoming more innovative as a response to these challenges. These strategies imply tackling the tensions between (at times) conflicting drivers, notably those arising from the State, the market and communities. However, research in this topic so far is fragmented, focussing on one country or on specific sub-areas such as asset management and non- housing activities and rarely connects with the relevant wider literature on the third sector and social enterprise. Within this context, this PhD research has sought to widen this discussion by providing new insights through a comparative study {{of the ways in which}} individual social housing providers are relating to (i. e. responding to and influencing) these contextual changes. More specifically, the research sought to better understand the complex process of decision-making these companies undergo to manage their responses to competing drivers. Companies operating in two countries (England and The Netherlands) were studied in-depth. In both countries, the social rental sector has played a prominent role in their respective welfare states for decades. While both are amongst countries with the highest share of social rental housing in Europe, each represents a different type of welfare state and of social housing provision - following Kemeny’s classification, a unitary system (the Netherlands) and a dualist system (England). The broad aim of this PhD was to deepen the understanding of the ways in which contextual drivers impact on the mission, values and activities of social housing organisations. Furthermore, the study sought to understand how these organisations are positioning themselves vis-à-vis the State, market and community. The above aims translate into three research questions: (1) How are contextual developments impacting on the missions, values and activities of social housing organisations? (2) How do these organisations position themselves vis-à-vis the State, the market and community? and (3) How are competing values enacted in the decision-making process exercised by these organisations vis-à-vis these contextual drivers? The universe for this PhD research consists of social purpose organisations, not owned by the State, which operate on a non-profit distribution basis. Together they are part of a wide range of ‘third sector’ actors providing social and affordable housing across most of North Western Europe. The PhD adopted a pluralistic epistemological approach with an interpretivist emphasis, with significant use of qualitative research methods. This approach was deemed useful to give a voice to the subject(s) of study. The research design included a mixed methods approach and a longitudinal, international and inter-organisational case study research design, involving two company-cases. The companies were studied over a four-year period, starting in March 2008. The research design and data analysis draws on elements of grounded theory, and on the work of Eisenhardt on ‘building theory from cases’. Following this approach, a series of ‘theoretical propositions’ were devised from the study’s findings in order to answer each of the three research questions. In relation to the first research question, the study found that contextual developments and the missions, values and activities of social housing organisations are in a two-way relationship. From an initial assumption of unidirectional causality, in the process of the research it became clear that the relationship between contextual developments and organisational change is more often than not one of mutual causality. We qualified this relationship through six propositions. First, we posited that market and State drivers have a relatively stronger impact on social housing organisations as compared to community drivers. Second, we postulated that both market and State drivers have a knock-on effect on community drivers. Third, we established that State drivers pose continuous exogenous shocks to social housing providers by means of constant policy changes. Our fourth proposition stated that in a context of economic crisis the relationship between market drivers and social housing organisations is marked by volatility. Our fifth proposition established that all three types of contextual drivers are reinforcing the long-term trend of deepening residualisation of the social housing sector. The sixth proposition emphasizes the long-term mutually shaping relationship between context and social housing organisations. Findings on the second research question led us to describe the positioning of social housing organisations vis-à-vis their environment as a ‘dynamic balancing act’. In order to understand the way(s) in which social housing organisations position themselves in relation to changes in their environment we drew on theories of social enterprise and hybridity to unpack three ideal-typical strategic orientations that may be at play in this process: State, market and community. We adopted a triangular model to illustrate these orientations and developed a classification model to understand the ‘strategic position’ that these organisations adopt vis-à-vis their environment.  We looked at three different dimensions of this strategic position, namely mission, values and activities, each captured by a different type of variables in the classification: ‘descriptor’ (to capture the formal characteristics of the organisation), ‘motivator’ (as related to the organisation’s mission), and ‘behaviour’ (referring to the organisation’s activities). Upon applying this classification to our case studies, our findings resulted in three propositions. First, it became clear that while descriptor variables confirmed the hybrid formal characteristics of social housing organisations, they do not account on their own for their position in relation to State, market and community. Our second proposition stated that social housing organisations are constantly balancing pressures to (re) define their mission. Our study found that in this process, each company is faced with trade-offs when considering their organisational mission in relation to a changing mandate from the State domain, while at the same time weighing demands from the market and community domain. Third, we posited that social housing organisations exert different degrees of agency in their positioning vis-à-vis the State, market and community. We identified a continuum of actions that these organisations have put in place to respond to key contextual changes, ranging from ‘reactive’ to ‘proactive’ and ‘strategic’. Hence, social housing organisations would have the capacity to shape their environment and / or at least, their position in relation to this environment. On our third research question, we found that enacting competing values in social housing organisations implies multiple rationalities at play in decision-making.  The PhD research used the study of a critical incident in each company to describe the ways in which competing values are enacted in the decision-making process of these organisations in relation to the three types of contextual drivers. In each case, a critical incident was chosen in conjunction with the companies to be studied over a prolonged period of time. Both incidents turned out to be of regulatory nature (i. e. State-driven); in the English case, it was the Comprehensive spending review (CSR) announced in October 2010 and a series of major welfare reforms implemented by the coalition government. In the Netherlands, the Dutch government ruling on the issue of State aid by housing associations implemented in January 2011. The companies’ responses to these critical incidents, respectively, were operationalised through a ‘strategic decision’ made by each of them vis-à-vis these events, defined as a decision recognised as having significant implications for the structure, direction or purpose of an organisation. The English company defined their strategic decision as the impact on the company’s vision, direction, strategy and financial capacity of the October CSR and the shake-up in the welfare benefit system. More specifically, the company’s bid to the HCA for the four-year development programme in the first half of 2011 formed the basis for the study of this critical incident. The strategic decision of the Dutch company was whether to follow the Dutch government’s ruling on <b>income</b> <b>ceilings</b> or not. Furthermore, the company had to decide how to re-organize its financing in order to comply with the required administrative split between activities classified as ‘Services of General Economic Interest’ (SGEI) and ‘non SGEI’. The study of these critical incidents looked at the decision-making process from both a formal and content perspective, distinguishing motivator and behaviour variables in the process. In terms of form, we found that different modes of decision-making co-exist in the process. Participants in each company use a variety of ‘political tactics’ to influence the decision-making process. Taken all together, the existence of these tactics confirms the presence of institutional entrepreneurial behaviour amongst|$|R

50|$|There are {{currently}} 18 different programs that provide property tax {{relief in the}} United States. The programs and their eligibility vary by state. The states with these programs limit eligibility in three ways; whether the tax payer is a renter or a homeowner, whether the tax payer is elderly or disabled, and the income level of the tax payer. Circuit breakers are offered to renters and homeowners in 16 states, only home owners in 1 state and only renters in 1 state; in 8 states the programs are limited to only the elderly or disabled and in all 18 states there is a maximum income level after which a taxpayer no longer qualifies for a refund. Although some states {{have a much more}} generous <b>income</b> <b>ceiling,</b> participation in these programs is limited by a requirement that the property tax liability be a certain percentage of the taxpayers yearly income.

40|$|Excerpt] Since 1950, {{self-employed}} {{individuals have}} been {{covered by the}} Social Security system. In many regards, their obligation to pay Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) taxes into the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Hospital Insurance (HI) trust funds and their entitlement to Social Security and Medicare benefits parallel those of workers who are not self-employed and who thus are covered under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). In both cases, the OASDI tax base is limited to income below a certain threshold, and the HI tax base is not constrained by any <b>income</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The two systems, however, diverge in an important way: The FICA tax is based solely on income from labor, but the SECA tax is based on net business income, which can also include income from capital. Such {{a difference in the}} tax code (say, among businesses providing the same goods and services) can prompt people to make choices that they would not otherwise make about self-employment or the organizational form of a business, thereby reducing the efficient allocation of resources. For this analysis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) decomposed the SECA tax bases for HI and OASDI into their labor and capital components, but the discussion focuses on the HI tax base because it is unconstrained by the <b>income</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the OASDI tax. CBO estimates that approximately 40 percent of the SECA-HI tax base (the amount of self-employment income subject to the HI tax) derives from capital, and the remainder derives from labor. Furthermore, {{more than half of the}} labor income of self-employed people—that is, the portion of their business income that would be subject to the FICA-HI tax if the business was incorporated instead of being a sole proprietorship or a partnership—is not included in the SECA-HI tax base. That occurs because when net income from all of a taxpayer’s businesses is less than the labor income from those businesses, the excess labor income is excluded from the SECA tax base. There is no similar exclusion from the FICA tax base. With both the taxed capital income and the excluded labor income accounted for, the total SECA-HI tax base is roughly three-quarters of the amount of income that would be taxable under the FICA-HI rules. Lawmakers could change the SECA tax base to try to align it more closely with the rules governing the FICA tax base. CBO analyzed three options for alignment that would modify the SECA tax base by either reducing the share of capital income or increasing the share of labor income included in that base. No option by itself would accomplish both of those objectives when applied to both sole proprietorships and partnerships, but one option would do so if applied only to partnerships. Two of the options would reduce the size of the SECA tax base—in one case by more than half—whereas the third option would increase the SECA tax base by a little...|$|E
