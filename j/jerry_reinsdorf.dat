5|$|For the Bears, this {{marked the}} first time that a Chicago sports team not owned by <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> had reached the {{champion}} game/series in their league since the Blackhawks lost in the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|After Jordan retired {{following}} the 1992–93 NBA season, Chicago Bulls owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> sought a sculptor to honor Jordan and requested that Chicago Bulls Vice President Steve Schanwald seek proposals from artists. Twelve artists made proposals. In January 1994, Schanwald hired Omri and Julie Rotblatt-Amrany of Highland Park, Illinois, who erected a statue at the Bulls' new {{home for the}} 1994–95 NBA season, the United Center. Until 1994 when they both moved, the Bulls and Blackhawks had played at Chicago Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Jordan then further {{surprised}} {{the sports world}} by signing a minor league baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994. He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and {{was assigned to the}} team's minor league system on March 31, 1994. Jordan has stated this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player. The White Sox were another team owned by Bulls owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf,</b> who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{bankruptcy}} {{hearing was}} scheduled for May 7, 2009. [...] Court documents submitted by Moyes cite thirty creditors, including Moyes himself for an amount in excess of US$103 million. [...] TSN's Bob McKenzie said that Moyes was very receptive to Balsillie's offer because, as the team's largest unsecured creditor, {{the best chance of}} getting most of his money back was to persuade someone to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The league's position was that it was Moyes' fault that he paid himself so much money and that he was entitled to only $14 million of $103 million loss, which would have been the case if <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf's</b> lower bid was accepted.|$|R
500|$|<b>Jerry</b> M. <b>Reinsdorf</b> (born February 25, 1936) is a CPA, {{lawyer and}} {{an owner of}} the NBA's Chicago Bulls and the MLB's Chicago White Sox. [...] He started his {{professional}} life as a tax attorney with the Internal Revenue Service. He has been {{the head of the}} White Sox and Bulls for over 25 years.|$|R
2500|$|The city of Harrisburg paid $6.7 {{million in}} 1995 {{to acquire the}} team from the {{previous}} owners of the franchise, who were planning to move the team to a new taxpayer-financed ballpark in Springfield, Massachusetts. Instead of appeasing the desires of the ownership group with a new stadium, Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed led the city of Harrisburg to purchase the team instead. The previous owners had bought the team only six months earlier for just $4.1 million. Citing the ballpark as the major link in his downtown revitalization project, when asked how he could afford the hefty price tag, Mayor Reed responded by asking, [...] "how could we not?" [...] For a time, the Senators remained {{one of the only}} sports franchises in the United States to be completely owned by the community it is based in. In 2006, the city put the team up for sale to combat a major budget deficit. Mayor Reed stipulated that the new owner must keep the team in Harrisburg for at least 29 years. The team was eventually bought by Senators Partners, LLC of Northbrook, Illinois, headed by <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf's</b> son Michael, for an Eastern League record $13.25 Million. [...] Mark Butler, CEO of Ollie's Bargain Outlets, became the team's majority owner in March 2015, replacing Michael Reinsdorf who was principal owner and managing partner; the purchase price was not disclosed.|$|R
5|$|Reinsdorf {{was one of}} two bidders for the Phoenix Coyotes {{that would}} commit to not {{relocating}} the team. On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and his group were approved for ownership of the Coyotes for $148 million. In August 2009, it was reported that <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> & Ice Edge LLC had dropped its bid for the Coyotes, leaving only Balsillie and the NHL as bidders for the team. The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however the league stated it wished to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was once again a possible buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes. Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona. As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of Glendale were still in process for the purchase of the Coyotes. However, in 2013, the Coyotes were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that did not include Reinsdorf.|$|E

25|$|Fisk made {{mention of}} the {{fireworks}} between himself and Chicago owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> in his Hall of Fame induction speech. To add insult to injury, Fisk {{was thrown out of}} the White Sox clubhouse later that season when he stopped by to wish his teammates good luck in the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few years}} with Baltimore, Krause worked as a scout with the Phoenix Suns, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Lakers and Chicago Bulls in the 1970s before he left pro {{basketball}} to scout pro baseball instead. He was scouting for the Chicago White Sox when he {{received a call from}} new Chicago Bulls owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> to join the Bulls as their new General Manager and once again work in pro basketball.|$|E
25|$|After Jim Boylan's interim tenure expired, the Bulls {{began the}} process of {{selecting}} a new head coach. They were in talks with former Phoenix head coach Mike D'Antoni, but on May 10, 2008, he signed with the New York Knicks. Other possible options included former Dallas head coach Avery Johnson and former Bulls head coach Doug Collins. Collins resigned from the coaching list on June 4, 2008, reporting {{that he did not}} want to ruin his friendship with <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of the 1984 NBA draft, after Houston and Portland. The Rockets {{selected}} Hakeem Olajuwon, the Blazers picked Sam Bowie and the Bulls chose shooting guard Michael Jordan. The team, with new management in owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> and general manager Jerry Krause, decided to rebuild around Jordan. Jordan set franchise records during his rookie campaign for scoring (third in the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls back to the playoffs, where they lost in four games to the Milwaukee Bucks. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.|$|E
25|$|Northwestern has roughly 225,000 alumni in all {{branches}} of business, government, law, science, education, medicine, media, and the performing arts. Among Northwestern's more notable alumni are U.S. Senator and presidential candidate George McGovern, Nobel Prize–winning economist George J. Stigler, Nobel Prize–winning novelist Saul Bellow, Pulitzer Prize–winning composer and diarist Ned Rorem, the much-decorated composer Howard Hanson, Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey Ali Babacan, the historian and novelist Wilma Dykeman, {{and the founder}} of the presidential prayer breakfast Abraham Vereide. U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, Supreme Court Justice and Ambassador to the United Nations Arthur Joseph Goldberg, and Governor of Illinois and Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson are among the graduates of the Northwestern School of Law. Many Northwestern alumni play or have played important roles in Chicago and Illinois, such as former Illinois governor and convicted felon Rod Blagojevich, Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf,</b> and theater director Mary Zimmerman. Northwestern alumnus David J. Skorton serves as head of The Smithsonian. Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and former White House Chief of Staff, earned a Masters in Speech and Communication in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The {{summer of}} 1998 brought {{an abrupt end}} to the {{championship}} era. Krause felt that the Bulls {{were on the verge}} of being too old and unable to compete. He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space to make a run at several promising free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf,</b> Krause traded Scottie Pippen for Roy Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign Dennis Rodman, and traded Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for other draft picks. He hired a new coach, Tim Floyd, who had run a successful program at Iowa State University. Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown, shooting guard Ron Harper, newcomer Brent Barry at small forward, power forward Toni Kukoč, and center Bill Wennington, the team began the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. Kukoc led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in a game in the shot clock era.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2013, Thome {{joined the}} White Sox {{organization}} as {{special assistant to}} the general manager. In the future, Thome aspires to be a manager, an aspiration that White Sox chairman <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> wholeheartedly supports; Reinsdorf commented, [...] "He can be a batting coach. He'd be a great batting coach, but someday he'll be a manager." [...] In March 2014, Thome clarified that he is not officially retired; while he [...] "loves" [...] his front office job with the White Sox, he would [...] "have to take" [...] a call about him playing again. However, on August 2, 2014, he signed a one-day contract with the Cleveland Indians to retire officially {{as a member of the}} team.|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Bulls are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Chicago, Illinois. They are {{a member of}} the Central Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team is owned by <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> and was most recently coached by Tom Thibodeau. They play their home games in the United Center. The Bulls first joined the NBA in the [...] as an expansion team. Coached by Johnny Kerr, the team finished its first season with a 33–48 record, the best record achieved by an expansion team in its first year of play, and secured a playoff berth. The Bulls won their first NBA championship in the 1991 NBA Finals while coached by Phil Jackson. They won five additional NBA championships in the 1990s under Jackson.|$|E
500|$|For {{a person}} to be {{inducted}} to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor, they must have made [...] "significant contributions to the game of basketball". Of the inaugural Hall of Fame class of 1959, seven individuals were inducted as contributors, including James Naismith, the inventor of basketball. All former NBA commissioners (Maurice Podoloff, Walter Kennedy, Larry O'Brien, and David Stern) have been inducted. Twelve individuals inducted as contributors have won the John Bunn Award, awarded by the Hall annually to a significant contributor: John Bunn (its inaugural recipient), Walter Kennedy, Clifford Fagan, Edward Gottlieb, Daniel Biasone, Larry O'Brien, Dave Gavitt, C. M. Newton, Tex Winter, Meadowlark Lemon, Tom [...] "Satch" [...] Sanders, and George Raveling. Two inductees in this category are women: Senda Berenson Abbott and Bertha Teague (both inducted in 1985). The most recent contributor to be inducted is <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf,</b> who entered the Hall in 2016.|$|E
500|$|Although Bill Veeck took much of {{the public}} {{criticism}} for the fiasco, his son Mike suffered repercussions as the actual front-office promoter behind it. [...] Mike Veeck remained with the White Sox until late 1980, when he resigned; his father sold the team to <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> soon afterward. [...] He was unable to find a job in baseball for some time after that, leading him to claim that he had been blackballed from the game. For several years, he worked for a jai-alai fronton in Florida, battling alcoholism. As Mike Veeck related, [...] "The second that first guy shimmied down the outfield wall, I knew my life was over!" [...] Mike Veeck has since become an owner of minor league baseball teams. In July 2014 the Charleston RiverDogs, of whom Veeck is president, held a promotion involving the destruction of Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus merchandise. Dahl is still a radio personality in Chicago and also reaches his listeners through podcasting.|$|E

2500|$|Toni Kukoč ( [...] ; born September 18, 1968) is a Croatian retired {{professional}} basketball player {{who is currently}} Special Advisor to <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf,</b> {{the owner of the}} Chicago Bulls. After a highly successful period in European basketball, {{he was one of the}} first established European stars to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

2500|$|... "I've {{got a lot}} {{of respect}} for <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf,</b> I do. But I really thought, the {{relationship}} we had over the last 16 years, he would have picked up the phone to say, 'Big guy, we're moving forward. We're going somewhere different. We don't know your situation or what's going to happen.' I can live with that, I really can", Thomas said. [...] "But treating me like some passing-by-player. I've got no respect for that." [...] Thomas said he was not bitter or angry and had joined the A's with an open mind.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{perennial}} offensive {{production and}} established fan base in Chicago, the White Sox elected to release Thomas in 2005. Thomas later expressed disappointment with how his 16-year tenure with the White Sox was ended, saying that chairman <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf</b> {{did not call}} him {{to tell him he}} wasn’t coming back. He also said that he and Kenny Williams did not see eye-to-eye after Williams became general manager following the 2000 season. At the time, Thomas was unhappy that his next-to-last deal with the White Sox contained a [...] "diminished skills" [...] clause. He said the White Sox should have traded him after the playoffs that season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{free agent}} market {{following}} the 1985 season {{was different from}} any since the Seitz decision a decade earlier. [...] Of 35 free agents, only four changed teams—and those four were not wanted by their old teams. Star players, such as Kirk Gibson, Tommy John and Phil Niekro, did not receive offers from other teams. The cover of the December 9, 1985 edition of Sporting News asked, [...] "Why Won't Anyone Sign Kirk Gibson?" [...] George Steinbrenner offered Carlton Fisk a contract, then withdrew the offer after getting a call from Chicago White Sox chairman <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf.</b> Teams also reduced team rosters from 25 to 24 players.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Boras used {{an obscure}} {{provision}} in the major league rules to have draft picks Matt White (seventh overall pick, San Francisco Giants) and Bobby Seay (12th overall pick, Chicago White Sox) declared free agents. White and Seay both then signed with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays, with White receiving a $10.2 million contract and Seay receiving a $3 million bonus, significantly more than {{what they would have}} received via the draft process. The following year, Major League Baseball changed its rules in response to Boras's success in circumventing the draft, which had resulted in at least $25 million in extra money for his clients. For many years, being [...] "outsmarted" [...] by Boras and losing Seay remained a sore spot for White Sox owner <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf,</b> one of Commissioner Bud Selig's closest allies.|$|E
2500|$|The Bulls {{and their}} arena mates, the Chicago Blackhawks, shared an odd {{tradition}} {{dating to the}} opening of Chicago Stadium. Every fall, Feld Entertainment's Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus came to Chicago on its nationwide tour. Since it used large indoor venues rather than tents, it took over the United Center for its entire run and the Bulls were forced, along with the Blackhawks, to take an extended road trip that lasted around two weeks. The start of the [...] "circus trip", as many sportscasters dubbed it, was noted in local newspapers, television and radio sports reports as [...] "the circus trip", along with national programs like SportsCenter. The annual circus trip will no longer take place starting with the 2017-2018 NBA season as Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz, who co-owns the United Center with Bulls chairman <b>Jerry</b> <b>Reinsdorf,</b> would let the contract lapse after the circus's 2016 run, and condensed the formerly two-week local run of Feld's Disney on Ice to a week-long period in February (which had also caused minor complications for scheduling in February) ...|$|E
