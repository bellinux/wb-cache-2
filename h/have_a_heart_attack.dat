5|$|Another {{criticism}} is that outcomes {{are presented in}} terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits of the treatment. For example, he writes, if four people out of 1,000 will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is a reduction of just 0.2 percent.|$|E

The stress of his approaching wedding {{and the arrival of}} his mother prompt Jack to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> While at the hospital, Colleen uses a heart monitor as a lie detector, on Jack, which leads him to revealing that he does not love Phoebe.

5|$|When Tom goes missing, Darren {{is desperate}} to find him. Thinking that Tom has run away, he assumes {{that he will}} come home if Nancy is there and convinces Sienna to change her {{statement}} about Nancy. Nancy is released from the mental institute because of this. However, it is revealed that Sienna actually kidnapped Tom and kept him hostage in a basement. Tom is able to escape and along with Nancy, they expose Sienna for everything. Sienna attacks Nancy causing her to have temporary brain damage and attempts to kill Tom, Charlie and Oscar although they are saved and Nancy recovers. Following Darren's treatment of Nancy, things are hard between them and get even worse when Nancy attempts to get revenge on Darren. However, they eventually reconcile and get engaged again. However, things only get worse when Sienna blackmails Darren to get Tom to change his statement or she'll create even more problems for the Osbornes. Following a heart attack, Darren is given angina spray however Sienna takes this while Darren is on a camping trip and Nancy leaves him on his own on the trip following an argument. Darren starts to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> and Sienna, realizing what she's done, saves him at the last minute.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, it {{has been}} {{estimated}} that if CHD patients adhered to their medication, each year 40,000 to 50,000 fewer people would have a stroke and 25,000 would not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smoking also {{increases}} {{the chance of}} heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease.

25|$|The storyline {{leading up}} to the match was that JBL caused Guerrero's mother to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> at a house show when he {{threatened}} her and grabbed her by the shoulder. At Judgment Day, JBL defeated Guerrero via disqualification in a match for the WWE title. A title cannot change hands by disqualification, so Guerrero retained the title. JBL controversially won his sole world championship, the WWE Championship from Guerrero in a Texas Bull Rope match at The Great American Bash. The initial decision of Guerrero's victory was reversed by then-General Manager Kurt Angle, awarding the match and the title to JBL; the replay showed that JBL touched the fourth corner before Guerrero. JBL won a rematch in a steel cage two weeks later, again with Angle's assistance.|$|E
25|$|People {{with higher}} levels of vitamin D tend to have lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and tend to have lower blood pressure. However, it has been found that vitamin D supplementation does not improve {{cardiovascular}} health or metabolism, so the link with vitamin D must be in part indirect. People who get more sun are generally healthier, and also have higher vitamin D levels. It has been found that ultraviolet radiation (even UVA) produces nitric oxide (NO) in the skin, and nitric oxide can lower blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease. Although long-term exposure to ultraviolet contributes to non-melanoma skin cancers that are rarely fatal, it has been found in a Danish study that those who get these cancers were less likely to die during the study, and were much less likely to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> {{than those who did not}} have these cancers.|$|E

500|$|Josephine made {{landfall}} {{in northwestern}} Florida along Apalachee Bay {{and produced a}} high storm surge of around [...] in Suwannee, causing minor to moderate beach erosion. The storm produced widespread tropical storm force wind gusts in the state, and the highest sustained winds were 45mph (72km/h) along the Sunshine Skyway Bridge; the same location reported a peak gust of 72mph (115km/h). Josephine dropped heavy rainfall in the state, peaking at [...] in Fernandina Beach. The storm also spawned at least 16tornadoes in northern Florida, most of which caused minor tree damage. One [...] wide tornado, rated an F2, remained {{on the ground for}} [...] in Edgewater, which damaged 130houses, 30 of them severely. The tornado caused a woman to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> in Edgewater, and its damage was estimated at $2.4million. In western Florida, the high tides flooded roads and buildings along the coast. Between Levy to Lee county along the gulf coast, Josephine flooded about 3,600homes, mostly west of U.S. Route 19. The heaviest storm surge damage was in Pinellas County, where about 1,400homes were affected, causing $25million in damage. One person was injured in the county when a man was surfing in rough seas. The high tides damaged three fishing piers along the west coast. In Clay County, flooding rains forced about a dozen families to seek shelter elsewhere, and a few roads were washed out. In Jacksonville, high rains flooded hundreds of roads and caused schools countywide to close. Street flooding occurred as far south as the Florida Keys. High winds caused sporadic wind damage across northern Florida, and about 400,000people lost power statewide. Following the storm, President Bill Clinton declared 16counties as disaster areas, which made them eligible for federal assistance in reconstructing.|$|E

In the days following Lawrence's murder, several residents came forward to provide names of suspects and an anonymous note was also left on a police car windscreen and in a telephone box naming a local gang as the five main suspects. [...] The suspects were Gary Dobson, brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight and David Norris. [...] In February 1999, officers investigating the handling of the initial inquiry revealed that a woman who might have been a vital witness had telephoned detectives three times within the first few days after the killing, and appealed for her to contact them again. The five suspects were previously involved in racist knife attacks around the Eltham area. Four weeks before Lawrence's death, Dobson and Neil Acourt were involved in the racist attack of a black teenager, Kevin London, whom they verbally abused and attempted to stab. Neil's brother Jamie was accused of stabbing teenagers Darren Witham in May 1992 and Darren Giles in 1994, causing Giles to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> The stabbing attacks of Gurdeep Bhangal and Stacey Benefield, which both occurred in March 1993, in Eltham, were also linked to Neil and Jamie Acourt, David Norris and Gary Dobson.|$|E
