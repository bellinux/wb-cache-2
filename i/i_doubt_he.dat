6000|$|The instant {{they were}} so, Corrie said, [...] "Now {{we must go}} down {{to the foot of the}} cliff and look for poor Bumpus. Oh! dear me, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> is killed." ...|$|E
60|$|ROBERTS. That's right, sir. We {{have another}} God down here; <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>He</b> is rather {{different}} to Mr. Wilder's. Ask Henry Thomas; {{he will tell}} you whether his God and Mr. Wilder's are the same.|$|E
6000|$|Wade {{shook his}} head. [...] "It would be useless. Wilmington knows {{very well that}} such a girl would never let him be {{anything}} to her now when he had slighted her fancy for him before. Even if he were ever in love with her, which <b>I</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>he</b> couldn't do it." ...|$|E
60|$|Pand. Good boy, {{tell him}} I come instantly: <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he's</b> wounded. Farewell, good niece. But I'll {{be with you}} by and by.|$|R
6000|$|Then Rotherby {{shrugged and}} sneered. [...] "'Tis his bluster," [...] said he. [...] "He'll be a farceur to the end. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he's</b> half-witted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lay hold on him, Jem Rodney," [...] {{said the}} landlord, {{the idea of}} a ghost subsiding; [...] "he's off his head, <b>I</b> <b>doubt.</b> <b>He's</b> wet through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Which looks,' remarked Eugene {{with much}} gravity, 'like NOT knowing me. I hope {{it may not}} be my worthy friend Mr Aaron, for, to tell you the truth, Mortimer, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> may have a prepossession against me. I {{strongly}} suspect him of having had a hand in spiriting away Lizzie.' ...|$|E
60|$|RANKIN (reservedly). No: I cannot say that, Leddy Ceecily. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> {{has imposed}} on your good nature and sweet disposeetion. I had a crack with the Cadi {{as well as}} with Sir Howrrd; and there is little {{question}} in my mind but that Captain Brassbound is no better than a breegand.|$|E
6000|$|He is, if {{they can}} find him, fair [...] 15 [...] And fresh, and {{fragrant}} too; [...] As after rain the summer air, [...] And looks as lilies do, [...] That are this morning blown! [...] Yet, yet <b>I</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>he</b> is not known, [...] 20 [...] Yet, yet I fear to have him fully shewn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait and he may. Let's {{see what}} he will do. [...] Let's see if he will think of her again. [...] But then <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he's</b> {{thinking}} of himself [...] He doesn't look on it as anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|And mony a ane that I could tell, [...] Wha fain wad openly rebel, [...] Forby turn-coats amang oursel', [...] There's Smith^12 for ane; [...] <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he's</b> but a grey nick quill, [...] An' that ye'll fin'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Done the coffin?" [...] said Lisbeth, {{following}} him, and knitting uninterruptedly, {{though she}} looked at her son very anxiously. [...] "Eh, my lad, he went aff to Treddles'on this forenoon, an's niver come back. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he's</b> got to th' 'Waggin Overthrow' again." ...|$|R
6000|$|He is, if {{they can}} find him, fair, [...] 15 [...] And fresh and {{fragrant}} too, [...] As summer's sky or purged air, [...] And looks as lilies do [...] That are this morning blown; [...] Yet, yet <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> is not known, [...] 20 [...] And fear much more, that more of him be shown.|$|E
60|$|Then he went {{to fetch}} that article which had fallen beyond the dais, and quite forgot his {{intention}} of executing Oro {{in the interest of}} testing its mechanism, which proved to be destroyed. To his proposed appointment he made no illusion. If he comprehended what was meant, which <b>I</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>he</b> took it as a joke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Saul, man, Steenie, ye are right! There are few youths have sic true {{judgment}} as you, respecting {{the wisdom of}} their elders; and, as for this fause, traitorous smaik, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> is a hawk of the same nest. Saw ye not something papistical about him? Let them look that he bears not a crucifix, or some sic Roman trinket, about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|If Sergeant Corney {{had really}} {{closed his eyes}} in slumber, which <b>I</b> <b>doubted,</b> <b>he</b> was now awakened by the many noises, and {{a plan of action}} must have been {{presented}} to him in his dreams, for he spoke like one who is determined upon some decided course, as he said to me: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had taken}} up the poker again; without which, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> if <b>he</b> could have {{proceeded}} in his demonstration.|$|R
6000|$|... "'David should hae {{gone to the}} funeral,' {{says the}} minister, 'for <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> not <b>he</b> was only omitted in the invitations by a mistake.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Lady Masham’s eldest boy is very ill: <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> {{will not}} live; and [...] she stays at Kensington to nurse him, which vexes us all. She is so [...] {{excessively}} fond, {{it makes me}} mad. She should never leave the queen, [...] but leave everything, to stick to what is so much the interest of [...] the public, {{as well as her}} own....”—Journal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, so {{much the}} better, it amuses 'em," [...] said Mr. Poyser, who did not easily take an {{irritable}} view of things. [...] "But they're going away now, t' have their dinner, I reckon. Well move about a bit, shall we, and see what Adam Bede's doing. He's got {{to look after the}} drinking and things: <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> hasna had much fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, the General {{would have}} managed them all right. He'd have, soon found {{some way of}} turning them out.' Nor do <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> would, if the fearless {{confidence}} with which he inspired his troops could have protected his life. But the bullet is brutally indiscriminating, and before it the brain of a hero or the quarters of a horse stand exactly the same chance to the vertical square inch.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have heard}} him called a fortune-teller,' said Little Dorrit. 'But <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> if <b>he</b> could tell many people even their {{past or present}} fortunes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But she doesn't want {{to marry}} him, and <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> whether <b>he</b> can be got to marry any one else. There is still a peck of difficulties." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is as ignorant as a babe unborn;--I {{mean about}} that kind of thing. <b>I</b> don't <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> can make things in stone as well as anybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will meet}} this unhappy man," [...] {{she said to}} herself--"unhappy he must be, since <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> has been the cause of poor Effie's misfortune--but I will meet him, be it for good or ill. My mind shall never cast up to me, that, for fear {{of what might be}} said or done to myself, I left that undone that might even yet be the rescue of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} warrant, kinsman," [...] said the freebooter; [...] "you {{come by the}} gowd honestly, and in payment of a just debt--it came from the one king, you may gie it to the other, if ye like; and it will just serve for a {{weakening}} of the enemy, and in the point where puir King James is weakest too, for, God knows, he has hands and hearts eneugh, but <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> wants the siller." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, sir, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> could niver be {{got to do}} it, not if {{the very}} mill stood still to beg and pray of him. For your name's like poison to him, it's so as never was; and he looks upon it as you've been the ruin of him all along, ever since you set the law on him about the road through the meadow,--that's eight year ago, and he's been going on ever since--as I've allays {{told him he was}} wrong----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> whether <b>he</b> {{will make}} any money out of it," [...] went on Porson. [...] "One day the world will benefit; {{probably}} he will not benefit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fortunately, it isn't a great {{distance}} off," [...] answered Gif. [...] "If he had several miles to go, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> if <b>he</b> {{would be able to}} make it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{nice for}} the young man," [...] she said; [...] "and he's a good-looking young fellow; but <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> if <b>he's</b> quite the right lover for dear June." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 13. I dined to-day with Colonel Crowe,(8) late Governor of Barbadoes; he {{is a great}} {{acquaintance}} of your friend Sterne, to whom I trusted the box. Lord Treasurer has refused Sterne's business, and <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> is a rake; Jemmy Leigh stays for him, and nobody knows where to find him. I am so busy now I have hardly time to spare to write to our little MD, but in a fortnight I hope it will be over. I am going now to be busy, etc.|$|E
6000|$|... 11. I am {{setting up}} a new Tatler, little Harrison,(18) whom I have {{mentioned}} to you. Others have put him on it, and I encourage him; and he was with me this morning and evening, showing me his first, which comes out on Saturday. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> will not succeed, for I do not much approve his manner; but the scheme is Mr. Secretary St. John's and mine, and would have done well enough in good hands. I recommended him to a printer,(19) whom I sent for, and settled the matter between them this evening. Harrison has just left me, and I am tired with correcting his trash.|$|E
6000|$|... "Deil hae our saul, neighbour," [...] {{said the}} king, reddening, [...] "but ye are not blate! I gie ye license to speak freely, and, by our saul, ye {{do not let}} the {{privilege}} become lost non utendo--it will suffer no negative prescription in your hands. Is it fit, think ye, that Baby Charles should let his thoughts be publicly seen?--No--no--princes' thoughts are arcana imperii--Qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare. Every liege subject is bound to speak the whole truth to the king, but there is nae reciprocity of obligation--and for Steenie having been whiles a dike-louper at a time, is it for you, who are his goldsmith, and to whom, <b>I</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>he</b> awes an uncomatable sum, to cast that up to him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Faithful {{to their}} {{cut-throat}} trade, <b>I</b> made no <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> meant.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Mr. Tulliver, [...] "I've no {{thoughts}} of his going to Mudport: I mean him {{to set up}} his office at St. Ogg's, close by us, an' live at home. But," [...] continued Mr. Tulliver after a pause, [...] "what I'm a bit afraid on is, as Tom hasn't got the right sort o' brains for a smart fellow. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he's</b> a bit slowish. He takes after your family, Bessy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now is he, Miss?" [...] he said, with a hiccough: [...] "is he? Well, a {{good job}} too, says I; a useless old {{landlubber}} <b>he</b> was. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he's</b> off to a warmer place than this 'ere Kerguelen Land, and I drinks his health, which, by-the-way, I never had the occasion to do before. Here's {{to the health of}} the departed," [...] and he swallowed the shellfull of rum at a draught.|$|R
