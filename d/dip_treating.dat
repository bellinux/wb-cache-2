40|$|The horse conch, Pleuroploca {{trapezium}} is {{a marine}} gastropod that is landed in huge amount as by-catch along Gulf of Mannar. Their beautiful shells and operculum {{are being used}} for ornamental and medicinal purposes. Even though the meat is not being used locally, small quantities are being exported to Southeast Asian countries like Taiwan. These basic data relating to nutritional quality emphasize the need of promotion of this underutilized gastropod meat on par with other sea foods. Normally the sea food is preserved at a low temperature to reduce the post harvest loss and quality deterioration during extended period of storage. The shelf life of frozen stored Pleuroploca meat as such and after <b>dip</b> <b>treated</b> with chemicals was determined.

When moisture management practices fail to adequately control moisture, plant extracts demonstrating antifungal properties may provide protection for these applications. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the antifungal properties of natural plant extracts, such as essential oils, for use on wood. Seven essential oils were evaluated for their ability to inhibit growth of Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma viride, and Penicillium chrysogenum on southern yellow pine (SYP) stakes that were either <b>dip</b> <b>treated</b> or exposed to vapors of the test oils. Thyme and Egyptian geranium oil inhibited growth of all test fungi for 20 weeks. Likewise, dill weed oil vapors inhibited all test fungi for at least 20 weeks. Comparison of two mold test apparatuses—Petri dish test and tank test chambers—gave similar results for thyme oil. These findings support the application of essential oils for surface treatment or vapor exposure of wood to prevent mold infestation...|$|R

Male rat MSC were genetically engineered with adenoviral vectors coexpressing CXCR 4 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (MSCCXCR 4), GFP alone (MSCNull, control), or siRNA-targeted CXCR 4 (MSCsiRNA). Cell sheets were applied over the surface of infarcted left ventricle (LV) in female rats 7 days after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) pretreated with either vehicle (VEH) or diprotin A (DIP). At 28 days after cell sheet implantation, echocardiography was performed. Hearts were harvested for histological analysis 7 days after LAD ligation or 28 days after cell sheet implantation. DPP-IV and stroma-derived factor- 1 α (SDF- 1 α) in the LV were analyzed. Efficacy of engraftment was determined by the presence of Y chromosome in nuclei (Ych+). LV blood vessel density and apoptosis were also analyzed. Myocardial SDF- 1 α was elevated before placement of the cell sheet in the DIP group compared with vehicle group on day 7 after LAD. On day 28 after cell sheet transplantation, the number of Ych+ was increased in the MSCCXCR 4 + VEH group compared with the MSCNull + VEH group and further increased in the MSCCXCR 4 + <b>DIP</b> <b>treated</b> group.

40|$|Hardwood lumber drying in the South {{is subject}} to hot and humid weather that {{promotes}} enzymatic stain in sapwood. Research has long studied the problem and certain remedies have been proposed. Chemical dipping is {{the most commonly used}} method of preventing enzymatic stain. However, its application is only topical and does not prevent stain. A private operator, Danny Elder of Jasper, Texas, developed, through trial and error, a pre-drying treatment method called the Elder Process. The claimed benefits of the Elder Process include prevention of enzymatic stain; darkening sapwood color which more closely match that of heartwood and increases color consistency of lumber; reduce drying degrade; and reduction in air drying time.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] lumber was {{converted}} to flakes, which were <b>dip</b> <b>treated</b> with three concentrations each of copper chrome arsenate Type C (CCA-C), and {{disodium octaborate tetrahydrate}} (TIM-BOR). Azaconazole [1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichloropheny 1) - 1, 3 - dioxolan- 2 -ylmethyl]- 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole] was used as powder. The flakeboard panels (305 x 304 x 13 mm) were made using phenolformaldehyde powdered resin and wax. Distribution of CCA and TIM-BOR in treated flakes and panels was examined using x-ray fluorescence and titration methods. Concentrations were greater in the ends of flakes than in the center. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA) showed that CCA distribution was quite uniform on the surfaces examined. Concentrations of CCA and TIM-BOR in selected panel zones were uniform, indicating that the chemicals did not migrate significantly during panel manufacture. Distribution of azaconazole was not examined because a reliable method was not available. In water leaching test. CCA and azaconazole {{were found to be}} resistant to leaching, while TIM-BOR was not. Samples were tested for decay resistance using the soil block and vermiculite burial tests. Trametes versicolor, a white rot fungus, and Phialophora heteromorpha, a soft rot fungus, caused very low weight losses and did not appear to actively colonize even the untreated controls. Postia placenta, a brown rot fungus, caused substantial weight losses in untreated controls. With the latter fungus, CCA performed better than azaconazole and TIM-BOR, producing the lowest weight loss. The highest weight losses were associated with TIM-BOR, although some of the weight loss may have resulted from leaching during the decay test. The effect of each test chemical on dimensional stability, static bending and internal bond (IB) properties of treated panel was evaluated. When exposed to hot wet conditions, TIM-BOR treated samples had large thickness swell compared to CCA and azaconazole, and often delaminated. Samples placed in hot dry conditions had very small dimensional changes over time. In static bending and internal bond tests, strength reductions for TIM-BOR and CCA treated samples were clearly evident; however, reductions for TIM-BOR treated panels were greater than those for CCA. Azaconazole showed no deleterious effect on strength and generally performed well. A discussion of needs for future research is included. Those include a fundamental understanding of the interaction of preservative chemical within flakes and mats prior to pressing, during pressing, and in service.

Twelve dogs of different breeds and weights were dipped using the recommended guidelines with a commercial, nonprescription chlorpyrifos flea dip for 4 consecutive treatments at 3 -week intervals (nonshampoo protocol) and another 12 dogs were dipped with shampooing between dips (shampoo protocol). The samples collected at 4 hr and 7, 14, and 21 days after treatment in the nonshampoo protocol averaged 971, 157, 70, and 26 µg chlorpyrifos, respectively; in the shampoo protocol the samples averaged 459, 49, 15, and 10 µg, respectively.

Ware yam farmers residing along the eastern bank, upstream of the Niger/Benue confluence, source their planting material from towns such as Ilushi in Edo state, which involves significant travel and expense. The project encouraged 10 ware yam farmers living in Edeke village (Idah local government, Kogi state) to specialize in healthy seed yam production by employing the adapted yam minisett technique (AYMT). This employs a sett size of around 80 – 100 g treated with a joint insecticide and fungicide <b>dip.</b> The <b>treated</b> setts are planted directly into the field, not first planted into a nursery as with the yam minisett technique (YMT). The Edeke farmers received a loan from the Diocesan Development Services (DDS) to employ the AYMT to produce healthy seed yams on a significant scale. However, while sales of seed yam by four of the farmers generated a significant and positive gross margin, six farmers opted to plant their seed yams in the subsequent season (2012) to produce ware yams.

In the present study, outpatients fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and treated with antipsychotics for at least 6 months, were enrolled in order to estimate the prevalence of DIP and, among patients with DIP, the prevalence of [(123) I]FP-CIT SPECT abnormalities. Socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with the presence of DIP and SPECT abnormalities were also assessed. DIP was diagnosed in 149 out of 448 patients with schizophrenia (33 %).

Furthermore, a difference in chromium surface species was established for the dip and CDC processes showing additional SnO and Cr(OH) 3. nH 2 O species for the latter. Complementary to these findings, it was verified that the formation of additional chromium hydroxide species is a function of pH, governed by the applied cathodic current during the CDC process itself.

For different observations, we extract spectra during the peak (spectrally soft) and dip (spectrally hard) intervals of the oscillation, and find that their spectra are phenomenologically complex, requiring at least two distinct spectral components. Besides a thermal Comptonization component, {{we find that the}} disc emission is better modelled by an index-free multicolour disc blackbody component (p-free disc model) rather than that from a standard accretion disc. While the peak and dip spectra are complex, remarkably, their difference spectra constructed by <b>treating</b> <b>dip</b> spectra as the background spectra of the peak spectra, can be modelled as a single p-free disc component. Moreover, the variability at different time-scales and energy bands of the peak flux level is always {{greater than or equal to}} the variability of the dip flux level, which strengthens the possibility that the peak flux level may be due to an independent spectral component added to the dip one. We also verify it using joint spectral analysis of peak and dip spectra with a variable emission component. Our result substantiates the standard hypothesis that the oscillations are due to the limit cycle behaviour of an unstable radiation pressure dominated inner disc. However, in this interpretation, the flux variation of the unstable disc can be several order of magnitudes as expected from some theoretical simulations and need not be fine tuned to match the factor ~ 10 variation seen between the peak and dip levels.

Although {{there is evidence of}} decreased sperm transport in pre-cociously ovulated females, this {{does not appear to be}} the primary cause of infertility. Reduced size and vascularity of corpora lutea (CL) in treated females suggests incomplete or failed CL activation. Control and hCG-treated females were killed by exsanguination under ether anesthesia at intervals for the first 5 days after mating. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone were measured by radioimmunoassay. Luteinizing hormone in treated animals was very high at 2200 h on Day 1 after mating (31 h after the hCG injection), due to endogenous release, and dropped below control levels thereafter. Follicle-stimulating hormone, by contrast, was significantly lower than controls at 2200 h on Day 1 and remained low until 2200 h on Day 3 after mating. Prolactin in treated animals was not different from that in controls, except for 1000 h on Day 4, when it showed a significant <b>dip.</b> Estradiol in <b>treated</b> animals was significantly higher than in controls at 2200 h on Day 1 (when LH was also high and FSH was low), and remained high at 1000 h and 2200 h on Day 2, dropping thereafter to control levels.

Product Z 1069 is a cross-linked sodium polyacrylate. Before producing the gel, a 1 : 1. 5 by mass oil/water (O/W) emulsion was prepared using the phase-inversion route. The water (W) phase comprised 85. 9 % distilled water, 3. 9 % ASP 4 at 20 % dispersion, 8. 6 % sodium carbonate (0. 5 M) and 1. 6 % Emulsogen EL. All concentrations are indicated in mass %. The oil (O) phase consisted of 76. 9 % cypermethrin, 19. 3 % Solvesso S 200 and 3. 8 % Phenyl Sulphonate CA, also by mass. This emulsion was gelled by adding the superabsorbent Product Z 1069 (ca. 37. 5 % by mass relative to the W phase of the emulsion). The superabsorbent strongly absorbed water, depleting it from the emulsion. This resulted in an increase of the effective concentration of ASP 4 in the water phase of the emulsion. This increase of the polymer electrolyte concentration brought about a gel-like state corresponding to the desired solid dosage form. Rheometry confirmed that the dosage form maintained a solid gel-like consistency at 50 °C. The dosage contained 24. 6 % m/m cypermethrin. Thus, the required dosage of 1. 5 g was achieved in pellets weighing ca. 6. 1 g. Such pellets rapidly disintegrated with mild stirring in 10 L of tap water. Complete pellet disintegration and active dispersion occurred within 2. 5 minutes at ambient temperature (25 ± 2 °C). Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.
