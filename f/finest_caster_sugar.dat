50|$|In {{consumer}} marketing, it {{is difficult}} to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as salt and sugar, which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; cooking salt, table salt, sea-salt, rock salt, kosher salt, mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodized salt, salt substitutes and many more. Sugar also comes in many different types - cane sugar, beet sugar, raw sugar, white refined <b>sugar,</b> brown <b>sugar,</b> <b>caster</b> <b>sugar,</b> sugar lumps, icing sugar (also known as milled sugar), sugar syrup, invert sugar and a plethora of sugar substitutes including smart sugar which is essentially a blend of pure sugar and a sugar substitute. Each of these product types is designed {{to meet the needs of}} specific market segments. Invert sugar and sugar syrups, for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate and baked goods. Sugars marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments - refined sugar is primarily for use on the table, while <b>caster</b> <b>sugar</b> and icing sugar are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.|$|R

5000|$|The Victoria sponge, {{also known}} as the Victoria {{sandwich}} or Victorian cake, was named after Queen Victoria, who was known to enjoy a slice of the sponge cake with her afternoon tea. It is often referred to simply as [...] "sponge cake", though it contains additional fat. A typical Victoria sponge consists of raspberry jam and whipped double cream or vanilla cream. The jam and cream are sandwiched between two sponge cakes; the top of the cake is not iced or decorated apart from a dusting of icing sugar. The Women's Institute publishes a variation on the Victoria sandwich that has raspberry jam as the filling and is dusted with <b>caster</b> <b>sugar,</b> not icing sugar.|$|R
40|$|In France, 50 % of {{consumers}} sweeten plain yogurts prior to consumption. This study measured how much sugar consumers added under contextualized testing conditions. Participants (199 French adults who regularly consume plain yogurt adding sugar) {{were given a}} plain yogurt (125 g) {{at the end of}} a full meal and were allowed to sweeten it with their usual sweetener (<b>caster</b> <b>sugar,</b> honey, or jam). The quantities added were measured indirectly by weighing the sweetener containers before and after use; they were then converted into equivalent quantities of sucrose, or "added sugar. " Participants were asked to describe their relative hunger, thirst, and liking for plain yogurt and to estimate the quantity of sweetener they had added. On average, participants added 13. 6 g of sugar to their yogurts, which is higher than the 10. 2 g of sugar contained in pre-sweetened commercial yogurts (125 g). More sugar was added when subjects used jam (24. 4 g/yogurt, n = 36) as opposed to <b>caster</b> <b>sugar</b> (11. 0 g/yogurt, n = 134) or honey (12. 1 g/yogurt, n = 29). Age, socio-professional category, and BMI had a significant influence on added-sugar quantity. Based on behavior and attitude, participants could be separated into three evenly sized groups: "low sugar users" (n = 67, median = 6. 1 g/yogurt), who tended to control their food intake, "medium sugar users" (n = 66, median = 11. 4 g/yogurt), and "heavy sugar users" (n = 66, median = 19. 9 g/yogurt) who sought immediate satisfaction. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide robust data on the amount of sugar consumers add to plain yogurts in contextualized conditions (self preparation during a real meal). Our findings show that consumers underestimated by half the quantity of sweetener they added. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} better dough aeration and in particular to determine how aeration during mixing differs between sugar containing and non-sugar containing dough through modelling and X-ray tomography. Batches of non-yeasted bread dough were mixed using both ‘plain’ and ‘strong’ flours with systematically varying granulated <b>caster</b> <b>sugar</b> formulations. A modified Tweedy 1 -type mixer was used and mixer headspace pressure was controlled at various constant values to determine steady state dough aeration conditions. Pressure step-change experiments were used to determine aeration dynamics. A population balance model was fitted to the data to enable quantitative determination of the gas entrainment rate and disentrainment coefficient. X-ray computed tomography studies and uniaxial extensibility tests were also conducted to explore further the results of the aeration studies. This method enabled the model to be fitted to the aeration step-change response using only one parameter. The main effects of granulated sugar in dough were to increase the disentrainment coefficient and, to a lesser extent, to increase the entrainment rate. The combined effect of these was a reduction in dough gas content as granulated sugar content increased...|$|R
5000|$|Originating in Reims, Biscuit rose de Reims is {{a product}} of the Biscuits Fossier company. It is {{customary}} to dip the biscuit in champagne or red wine. The biscuit was created around 1690 in Reims. A baker wanted to make the most of the heat in the bread oven between the two batches, so he had the idea of creating a special dough; cooking it twice, which is where the name [...] "biscuit" [...] or [...] "bis-cuit" [...] meaning [...] "cooked twice" [...] in French. The biscuit initially was white. In order to add flavor to it, a pod of vanilla was introduced into the recipe. This vanilla left brown traces on the biscuit. In order to hide them, the baker decided to add a natural color based on cochineal, a scarlet dye, to disguise his mistake. From this sequence of events, the Biscuit Rose de Reims was born. The biscuit is oblong in shape, and is lightly sprinkled with <b>caster</b> <b>sugar.</b> Enthusiasts for the biscuit included King Charles X, Leopold II of Belgium, the Russian czar, and the Marquise de Polignac.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{performed on}} a polymer-bonded sugar (PBS) consisting of 66 % <b>caster</b> <b>sugar</b> in a hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) binder The mechanical {{response of the}} PBS and pure HTPB to applied loading at a strain rate of approximately 2000 s - 1 at temperatures from - 80 to + 22 °C is presented. The materials were also characterized using dynamic mechanical analysis, X-ray tomography and quasi-static loading. These measurements are required {{for the development of}} intermediate strain rate constitutive models of polymer-bonded explosives, for which PBSs are a commonly used mechanical simulant. The current constitutive modelling suffers from a lack of experimental data on well-characterized composites and binders, especially at intermediate strain rates. This is particularly important for understanding the effects of mixing two materials. Applications of such modelling include explosive safety and fundamental understanding of the various deformation mechanisms. In this paper, the dependences of strength and deformation mechanism on temperature, and, in particular, the glass transition temperature of the binder, are shown. Physical damage plays an important role; X-ray tomography scans support debonding as the primary form of damage during room-temperature deformation. These results are in agreement with previous investigations and are discussed in this context. © 2008 The Royal Society...|$|R

During his four years in Rome, Cosimo forbad him to work for others, although Queen Christina of Sweden wanted to commission work from him. After his return from Rome, Cosimo sent the artist to work with a famous medallist in Paris. Again in deference to Cosimo, Soldani-Benzi refused overtures from Louis XIV and, cutting short his visit, returned to Florence, where he was made director of the Grand-ducal Mint (Maestro dei Coni), and had a workshop in the Uffizi.
