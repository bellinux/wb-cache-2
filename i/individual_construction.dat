Its continued growth and development into a major urban environment can be traced through several stages limited by certain political events. In {{the first half of the}} 18th century, in the reconstruction phase of the former village of oriental character with a predominantly Christian population, Zemun was re-inhabited and developed in a very subordinate position in relation to Belgrade. This phase was limited by Požarevac and Belgrade Peace. In the second phase, in the second half of the 18th century, the core gradually grew and was formed. This phase ended in the period of the Austro-Turkish and the Napoleonic Wars in the late 18th and early 19th century. In the third phase, during the 19th and early 20th century, Zemun developed within the framework set by changing the construction fund, i.e. the reconstruction of inherited condition, from the First Serbian Uprising to the First World War.The fourth phase from the First World War, to date, is characterized by <b>individual</b> <b>construction</b> in Old Core of Zemun, which ceased to be a border place.|$|E

Taking the Greek-origin adposition κατά (katá) in Coptic as a case study, we show that entire polysemy networks are not borrowed.
