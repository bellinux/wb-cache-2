50|$|Although the {{following}} trends generally hold true, different organizations {{may have different}} numerical specifications for the six <b>fuel</b> <b>grades.</b> The boiling point and carbon chain length of the fuel increases with fuel oil number.

40|$|Plastics wastes from a {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) plant have a high-energy content and are suitable for fuel generation. Thermal cracking {{is one of the}} possible ways to obtain petrochemical feedstock from polymer wastes. Municipal waste plastic of LDPE conversion to kerosene <b>grade</b> <b>fuel</b> experiments were carried out under atmospheric conditions at temperatures between 150 ℃ and 420 ℃. Low density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic waste (Code # 2) was thermally depolymerized in batch process into stainless steel reactor without adding catalyst. The maximum kerosene <b>grade</b> <b>fuel</b> yield is 30 %, other <b>grade</b> <b>fuel</b> 60 %, light gas 6 % and left over residue 4 %. The composition, sulphur and Btu value of liquid products were determined by ASTM method. Produced fuel was analyzed by Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometer and FT-IR. Very high conversions from LDPE waste plastic to kerosene <b>grade</b> <b>fuel</b> (up to 35 %) were obtained while using this technique.

40|$|Subject of investigation: {{automotive}} and stationary diesel engines. Purpose of the work: {{investigation of}} the influence of mixed fuels based on <b>fuel</b> <b>grades</b> UFS and LGKK with additions of synthetic paraffin hydrocarbons on the economic and ecological features of the diesel engine. The work proposes and develops the compositions of mixed fuels based on heavy fuels with additions of synthetic paraffin hydrocarbons. A combination method is proposed for reducing smoking of the diesel engine. The proposed mixed fuels make it possible to replace standard diesel fuel without any reduction in the effectiveness and without readjustments in the fuel equipment with reduction of smoking and toxicity. The developed compositions of mixed fuels are proposed by NIIAT and PETROBANGLA (Bangladesh) for use instead of fuel L- 05 in order to increase the economic and ecological characteristics of diesel enginesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|A neutronic {{feasibility}} study {{was performed to}} determine the uranium densities {{that would be required}} to convert the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) from HEU (93 %) to LEU (< 20 %) fuel. The LEU core that was studied {{is the same as the}} current HEU core, except for potential changes in the design of the fuel plates. The study concludes that conversion of HFIR from HEU to LEU fuel would require an advanced fuel with a uranium density of 6 - 7 gU/cm{sup 3 } in the inner fuel element and 9 - 10 gU/cm{sup 3 } in the outer fuel element to match the cycle length of the HEU core. LEU fuel with uranium density up to 4. 8 gU/cm{sup 3 } is currently qualified for research reactor use.

5000|$|Use of {{residual}} fuel oil was {{more common in the}} past. It powered boilers, railroad steam locomotives, and steamships. Locomotives, however, have become powered by diesel or electric power; steamships are not as common as they were previously due to their higher operating costs (most LNG carriers use steam plants, as [...] "boil-off" [...] gas emitted from the cargo {{can be used as a}} fuel source); and most boilers now use heating oil or natural gas. Some industrial boilers still use it and so do some old buildings, including in New York City. The City estimates that the 1% of its buildings that burn fuel oils No. 4 and No. 6 are responsible for 86% of the soot pollution generated by all buildings in the city.
