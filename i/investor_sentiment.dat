40|$|This {{paper is}} built upon the {{predictions}} of the catering theory of dividends, and examines whether <b>investors?</b> <b>sentiments</b> exert significant influence on corporate dividend policy. To achieve this aim, we propose a dividend model that incorporates a variable at a firm-level proxing for the catering effect. The estimation of the model by using the Generalized Method of Moments provides interesting results. Consistent with {{the predictions of}} the catering theory, we find that companies in eurozone countries cater to their <b>investors?</b> <b>sentiments.</b> Additionally, other relevant findings show an interaction effect between catering and firm characteristics; particularly, liquid assets, investment opportunities and free cash flow. First, we find a catering effect only in firms with high liquid assets. Second, {{the positive effect of}} catering is only found in firms with valuable investment opportunities. Third, companies with higher levels of free cash flow cater more strongly to their <b>investors?</b> <b>sentiments.</b> Catering, <b>investors?</b> <b>sentiment,</b> payout policy. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the role of IMF {{conditions}} in resurrecting <b>investor</b> <b>sentiments</b> following a severe economic crisis. Much of the existing empirical literature on the subject of IMF programs and investment find no effect, or even a negative effect of such arrangements. This thesis argues that IMF programs do not automatically improve <b>investor</b> <b>sentiments</b> for a crisis-ridden country. I argue that what matters for investors is the credible commitment of countries to undertake reform. Crisis-ridden countries can signal this commitment by incurring the political costs associated with accepting a large amount of IMF conditions. Using panel data for 166 countries over a 22 year period, from 1992 - 2013, I find that contrary to what much of the previous literature predicts, there is a positive effect of prior action and performance criteria conditions on Institutional Investor rating following a severe economic crisis...|$|R

The issuer still gains as the offer price capitalizes part of the regulars' expected trading gain.

There are positive effects of past stock market returns on irrational sentiments but not on rational sentiments. The results support the economic fundamentals-based arguments of stock returns. Evidence in favour of irrational sentiments is consistent with the view that investor error is a significant determinant of stock returns. ...|$|R

50|$|Technical {{analysis}} {{is not limited}} to charting, but it always considers price trends. For example, many technicians monitor surveys of <b>investor</b> <b>sentiment.</b> These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are bearish or bullish. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme <b>investor</b> <b>sentiment.</b> Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors are bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of contrarian trading.|$|E
