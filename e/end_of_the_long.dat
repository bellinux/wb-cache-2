5|$|Osorkon IV {{ascended to}} the throne of Tanis in c.730 BC, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> reign of his {{predecessor}} Shoshenq V of the 22nd Dynasty, who was possibly also his father. However, this somewhat traditional collocation was first challenged in 1970 by Karl-Heinz Priese who preferred to place Osorkon IV in a lower–Egyptian branch of the 23rd Dynasty, right after {{the reign of the}} shadowy pharaoh Pedubast II; this placement found the support of a certain number of scholars. Osorkon's mother, named on a electrum aegis of Sekhmet now in the Louvre, was Tadibast III. Osorkon IV's realm was restricted only to the district of Tanis (Rˁ-nfr) and the territory of Bubastis, both in the eastern Nile Delta. His neighbors were Libyan princes and Meshwesh chiefs who ruled their small realms outside of his authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{land for}} the fort was {{appropriated}} from James Roach, a building contractor in Washington who was the second-largest landowner in the county, behind only the Lee family. Soldiers tore up land, dug trenches, and used gardens for latrines. Roach's mansion on Prospect Hill was vandalized by Union forces during the construction of Fort Runyon, but survived the war and was demolished in 1965. Other land for Fort Runyon and Fort Jackson came from the demolition of Jackson City, a collection of gambling establishments, saloons, and a racetrack that were located at the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Bridge.|$|E
5|$|These {{events are}} at the tail <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused {{by the collapse of}} a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
50|$|McVea was on <b>the</b> {{receiving}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> pass play {{completed in}} Houston history - a 99-yard reception against Washington State University on September 23, 1966. That game {{marked the first}} football game ever played on artificial turf.|$|R

5|$|Fort Jackson was an American Civil War-era {{fortification}} in Virginia that {{defended the}} southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Bridge, near Washington, D.C. Long Bridge connected Washington, D.C. to Northern Virginia {{and served as}} a vital transportation artery for the Union Army during the war. Fort Jackson was named for Jackson City, a seedy suburb of Washington that had been established {{on the south side of}} the Long Bridge in 1835. It was built in the days immediately following the Union Army's occupation of Northern Virginia in May 1861. The fort was initially armed with four cannon used to protect the bridge, but these were removed after the completion of the Arlington Line, a line of defenses built to the south. After 1862, the fort lacked weapons except for small arms and consisted of a wooden palisade backed by earthworks. Two cannon were restored to the fort in 1864 following the Battle of Fort Stevens. The garrison consisted of a single company of Union soldiers who inspected traffic crossing the bridge and guarded it from potential saboteurs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 April 1916, the 2nd BCS sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the {{transport}} of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed {{to coincide with the}} Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point {{in the middle of the}} North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Forties. On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog came down. The ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack when Australia collided with sister ship New Zealand twice in three minutes. Australia was damaged badly enough to be put out of action for several months, but New Zealand returned to the fleet on 30 May, a day before the start of the Battle of Jutland, relieving Indefatigable as flagship.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the lake}} was fed by the River Westbourne {{entering}} at the Italian Garden at the north-western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Water. The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834, as the river had become polluted, and so water was then pumped from the Thames. The water is now supplied by three boreholes drilled into the Upper Chalk. The first borehole {{is located at the}} Italian Gardens, the second at the Diana Memorial and the third, drilled in 2012 to a depth of 132m, is within 50m of the Diana Memorial. The Long Water runs south-east from this point to Serpentine Bridge, where the lake curves to the east, following the natural contours of the land. At the eastern end, water flows out of the lake via a sluice in the dam, forming a small ornamental waterfall at the Dell. The outflow has not historically maintained the waterfall, and re-circulation pumps were installed in the Dell, below the dam, to sustain this feature. The restoration work in 2012 restored the flows into the Serpentine and this waterfall is now restored as originally designed. Historically the river flowed due south from this point, marking the boundary between Westminster and Kensington, but since 1850 it has been diverted into a culvert, running underground to reach the Thames near Chelsea Bridge.|$|E
50|$|Eremaea ectadioclada is a {{plant in}} the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to <b>the</b> {{south-west}} <b>of</b> Western Australia.

30|$|The {{long-stroke}} {{pumping units}} {{often have a}} mechanical reversing mechanism that may suffer damage if <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reversal at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroke is too rapid. Therefore, Watson (1993) disclosed a controller that may operate to slow down at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> stroke, to have different speeds on the upstroke or down stroke {{in order to increase}} <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> fluid without increased mechanical wear on the lifting string.|$|R
50|$|Burton had {{inherited}} the lead from Matt Kenseth, who {{was sent to}} <b>the</b> tail <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> line due to speeding on pit road during the break between segments three and four. (During this break, teams had to at least visit the pits, but no service was required. Kenseth decided on the visit.) Kenseth had also won the first segment.

25|$|Xu {{was ordered}} to guard {{the rear of the}} Communist retreat, but he soon lost contact {{with the rest of the}} Red Army after the {{evacuation}} began, and he led his forces northward independently. Xu's forces finally evacuated their own base area in September 1934, and reached the Wei River area, around the city of Xi'an, in June 1935. After arriving in the communist base area of Shaanxi, Xu was named the commander of the 15th Army Corps. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> March, the Nationalists were offering 250,000 silver dollars for Xu's assassination.|$|E
25|$|The British then {{entered and}} burned the capital {{during the most}} notably {{destructive}} raid of the war.

The British, however, spared the Patent Office and the Marine Barracks. Dolley Madison, the first lady, or perhaps members of the house staff, rescued the Lansdowne Portrait, a full-length painting of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart as the British approached the Mansion.|$|E
25|$|T’boli tribe thrive near Lake Sebu {{and has an}} {{interesting}} philosophy of death and life. They believed that death occurs if his/her spirit leave the body permanently by the evil spirit, Busao. So their burial custom starts with laying the corpse on the boat-shaped coffin, which will be celebrated from a week to five months (and even a year for respected people like datu). The tribe often throws feast for commemoration in a positive vibe. This body, together with the wooden boat will be burnt at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> wake, where the liquid extract from burnt woods will be collected for eatery. The tribe believes that the good qualities of the dead will be passed over through that liquid extract.|$|E
25|$|During puberty, bones become {{harder and}} more brittle. At <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> puberty, <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> bones close {{during the process}} called epiphysis. There can be ethnic differences in these skeletal changes. For example, in <b>the</b> United States <b>of</b> America, bone density increases significantly more among black than white adolescents, which might account for decreased likelihood of black women developing osteoporosis and having fewer bone fractures there.|$|R
50|$|B. asiatica {{can grow}} < 7 m tall in the wild. The leaves are usually {{narrowly}} lanceolate to ovoid, < 30 cm long, attached by petioles 15 mm long, to branches round in section. The sweetly scented flowers are usually white, occasionally pale violet, and borne {{in late winter}} at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>long,</b> lax branches in slender panicles, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> which can vary widely according to source.

25|$|The Boundary Commission's {{report was}} not implemented, and despite {{nationalism}} remaining an active {{force in the}} area (an Aughanduff Anti-Partition Club is being reported as active in the area as late as 1939) the political position of the area remained unchanged. The mid-20th century saw the arrival of electricity, mains water and telephones in the area {{as well as the}} closing of the local school in June 1972 as all schools in the parish were amalgamated into two, with one at Mullaghbawn and another at Forkhill. The later years of the 20th century also seem to indicate the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> process of population decline with population figures stabilising and finally beginning to grow {{from the end of the}} 1980s.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, {{the site}} housed a {{research}} group that used radar to scan approaching thunder storms {{as far away}} as western New York State, as part of an inquiry into the causes of lightning. Findings by this group were instrumental {{in the development of the}} US weather radar program. The installation consisted of a steel tower supporting a second-hand military radar set, several Quonset huts and box trailers, surrounded by a chain-link fence. Group members were on call to monitor the radar whenever severe storms could be observed. Data were also collected from a network of amateur co-operative observers who corresponded by mail. This era coincided with the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> career of the famous Director of the Observatory, Dr. Charles Brooks, said to be one of the few who accurately forecast the path of the destructive Hurricane of September, 1938.|$|E
25|$|When the Chinese Red Army's First Front {{began its}} Long March in October 1934, the {{communist}} bank {{was part of}} the retreating force; fourteen bank employees, over a hundred coolies and a company of soldiers escorted them with the money and mint machinery. An important duty of the bank was, when the Chinese Red Army stayed in a location for longer than a day, to have the local populace exchange communist paper bills and copper coins for currency used in the nationalist-controlled regions to avoid prosecution by the nationalists after the communists left. After the Zunyi Conference it was decided that carrying the entire bank on the march was impractical, and on January 29, 1935 at Tucheng (土城) the bank employees burned all communist paper bills and destroyed the mint machinery. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> March in October 1935, only eight of the original fourteen employees were left; the other six had died along the way.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> {{pathophysiology}} <b>of</b> alcoholic polyneuropathy {{is an area}} {{of current}} research. Damage to the nervous system takes place before symptoms appear in individuals, beginning with segmental thinning and loss <b>of</b> myelin on <b>the</b> peripheral <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> nerves. Segmental thinning is <b>the</b> demyelination <b>of</b> axons in small sections at a time. This occurrence increases leakage of an action potential current down the axon, so it is weakest at the peripheral end. Decrease in current causes further thinning of myelin.|$|R
