5|$|There {{are only}} a few species of Rhytismatales known to have anamorphs that do not {{function}} as spermatia (non-motile cells that function as a male <b>gamete).</b> Coccomyces dentatus is one of only two species that are known to have both a spermatial and a non-spermatial state (the other is Ascodichaena rugosa).|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on <b>gamete</b> survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a type}} {{of genetic}} recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA. It is most widely used by cells to accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands of DNA, known as double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination also produces new combinations of DNA sequences during meiosis, the process by which eukaryotes make <b>gamete</b> cells, like sperm and egg cells in animals. These new combinations of DNA represent genetic variation in offspring, which in turn enables populations to adapt during the course of evolution. Homologous recombination is also used in horizontal gene transfer to exchange genetic material between different strains and species of bacteria and viruses.|$|E
50|$|Flagellated {{lifecycle}} stages {{are found}} in many groups, e.g., many green algae (zoospores and male <b>gametes),</b> bryophytes (male <b>gametes),</b> pteridophytes (male <b>gametes),</b> some gymnosperms (cycads and Ginkgo, as male <b>gametes),</b> centric diatoms (male <b>gametes),</b> brown algae (zoospores and <b>gametes),</b> oomycetes (assexual zoospores and <b>gametes),</b> hyphochytrids (zoospores), labyrinthulomycetes (zoospores), some apicomplexans (<b>gametes),</b> some radiolarians (probably <b>gametes),</b> foraminiferans (<b>gametes),</b> plasmodiophoromycetes (zoospores and <b>gametes),</b> myxogastrids (zoospores), metazoans (male <b>gametes),</b> and chytrid fungi (zoospores and <b>gametes).</b>|$|R
2500|$|Male <b>gametes</b> move {{actively}} {{in the stomach}} of mosquitoes in search of female <b>gametes.</b> Male <b>gametes</b> then enter into female <b>gametes</b> through the cone of reception. [...] The complete fusion of 2 <b>gametes</b> results {{in the formation of}} zygote. Here, fusion of 2 dissimilar <b>gametes</b> occurs, known as anisogamy.|$|R
5000|$|Archaeplastida: most {{green algae}} (zoospores and male <b>gametes,</b> except in Zygnematophyceae), bryophytes (male <b>gametes),</b> pteridophytes (male <b>gametes),</b> some {{gymnosperms}} (cycads and Ginkgo, as male <b>gametes)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate {{to display}} to females, has been {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and <b>gamete</b> release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate <b>gamete</b> production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during <b>gamete</b> formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
5000|$|Stramenopiles: centric diatoms (male <b>gametes),</b> {{brown algae}} (zoospores and <b>gametes),</b> oomycetes (assexual zoospores and <b>gametes),</b> hyphochytrids (zoospores), labyrinthulomycetes (zoospores), some chrysophytes, some xanthophytes, eustigmatophytes ...|$|R
50|$|Both <b>gametes</b> are pyriform {{in shape}} (pear form) with two {{laterally}} inserted flagella (the anterior one {{longer than the}} posterior). They each possess one eyespot - and have never been observed to contain two or more. Male and female <b>gametes</b> freely intermingle within a conceptacle, {{but as long as}} female <b>gametes</b> are motile, males are not attracted to them. About 4 h after release, female <b>gametes</b> settle on surrounding Hormosira tissue, and once that has occurred, the male <b>gametes</b> are then attracted to the settled female <b>gametes.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{an example}} of {{independent}} assortment, consider the crossing of the pure-bred homozygote parental strain with genotype AABB with a different pure-bred strain with genotype aabb. A and a and B and b represent the alleles of genes A and B. Crossing these homozygous parental strains will result in F1 generation offspring that are double heterozygotes with genotype AaBb. The F1 offspring AaBb produces <b>gametes</b> that are AB, Ab, aB, and ab with equal frequencies (25%) because the alleles of gene A assort independently of the alleles for gene B during meiosis. Note that 2 of the 4 <b>gametes</b> (50%)—Ab and aB—were not present in the parental generation. These <b>gametes</b> represent recombinant <b>gametes.</b> Recombinant <b>gametes</b> are those <b>gametes</b> that differ from both of the haploid <b>gametes</b> {{that made up the}} original diploid cell. In this example, the recombination frequency is 50% since 2 of the 4 <b>gametes</b> were recombinant <b>gametes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Trisomy 18 (47,XX,+18) {{is caused}} by a meiotic {{nondisjunction}} event. With nondisjunction, a <b>gamete</b> (i.e., a sperm or egg cell) is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 18; the <b>gamete</b> thus has 24 chromosomes. When combined with a normal <b>gamete</b> from the other parent, the embryo has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 18.|$|E
25|$|The form {{of sexual}} {{reproduction}} practiced by most placental mammals is anisogamous, requiring {{two kinds of}} dissimilar gametes, and allogamous, such that each individual only produces {{one of the two}} kinds of gametes. The smaller <b>gamete</b> is the sperm cell and is produced by males of the species. The larger <b>gamete</b> is the ovum and is produced by females of the species. Under this scheme, fertilization requires two gametes, one from an individual of each sex, in order to occur. Immunocontraception targeting the female <b>gamete</b> has focused on the zona pellucida. Immunocontraception targeting the male <b>gamete</b> has involved many different antigens associated with sperm function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gamete</b> production: Organisms that undergo sexual {{reproduction}} must first produce gametes, cells which have half the typical number of chromosomes of the species. Often immunity that prevents <b>gamete</b> production also inhibits {{secondary sexual characteristics}} and so has effects similar to castration.|$|E

5000|$|Artificial <b>gametes,</b> {{also known}} as In vitro derived <b>gametes</b> (IVD), stem cell-derived <b>gametes</b> (SCDGs), and In vitro {{generated}} <b>gametes</b> (IVG), are <b>gametes</b> derived from stem cells. Research shows that artificial <b>gametes</b> may be a reproductive technique for same-sex male couples, although a surrogate mother would still be required for the gestation period. [...] Women who have passed menopause {{may be able to}} produce eggs and bear genetically related children with artificial <b>gametes.</b> Robert Sparrow wrote, in the Journal of Medical Ethics, that embryos derived from artificial <b>gametes</b> could be used to derive new <b>gametes</b> and this process could be repeated to create multiple human generations in the laboratory. This technique could be used to create cell lines for medical applications and for studying the heredity of genetic disorders. [...] Additionally, this technique could be used for human enhancement by selectively breeding for a desired genome or by using recombinant DNA technology to create enhancements that have not arisen in nature.|$|R
25|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} sexual reproduction in eukaryotes {{is the difference between}} the gametes and the binary nature of fertilization. Multiplicity of <b>gamete</b> types within a species would still be considered a form of sexual reproduction. However, no third <b>gamete</b> is known in multicellular animals.|$|E
25|$|During meiosis, when {{germ cells}} divide to create sperm and egg (gametes), each half {{should have the}} same number of {{chromosomes}}. But sometimes, the whole pair of chromosomes will end up in one <b>gamete,</b> and the other <b>gamete</b> will not get that chromosome at all.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gamete</b> function: After gametes are {{produced}} in sexual reproduction, two gametes must combine during fertilization {{to form a}} zygote, which again has the full typical number of chromosomes of the species. Methods that target <b>gamete</b> function prevent this fertilization from occurring and are true contraceptives.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{of similar}} motility.Species of Ulva, the sea lettuce, have <b>gametes</b> which all have two flagella {{and so are}} motile. However they are of two sizes: larger 'female' <b>gametes</b> and smaller 'male' <b>gametes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{creeping}} vole, Microtus oregoni, the females, {{with just}} one X chromosome each, produce X <b>gametes</b> only, and the males, XY, produce Y <b>gametes,</b> or <b>gametes</b> devoid of any sex chromosome, through nondisjunction.|$|R

25|$|A fertilized female <b>gamete</b> (called a zygote) {{develops}} into an embryo.|$|E
25|$|When {{combined}} with a normal <b>gamete</b> from the other parent, the first, fourth and fifth are lethal, leading to spontaneous abortion. The second, {{combined with}} a normal <b>gamete</b> from the other parent, {{gives rise to a}} typical child. The third leads to a translocation Down syndrome child. The last becomes a translocation carrier, like the parent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gamete</b> outcome: Shortly after {{fertilization}} a zygote develops into a multicellular embryo {{that in turn}} develops into {{a larger}} organism. In placental mammals this process of gestation occurs inside the reproductive system of {{the mother of the}} embryo. Immunity that targets <b>gamete</b> outcome induces abortion of an embryo while it is within its mother's reproductive system.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all {{vertebrates}} undergo sexual reproduction. They produce haploid <b>gametes</b> by meiosis. The smaller, motile <b>gametes</b> are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile <b>gametes</b> are ova. These fuse by {{the process}} of fertilisation to form diploid zygotes, which develop into new individuals.|$|R
25|$|In many organisms, the haploid stage {{has been}} reduced to just <b>gametes</b> {{specialized}} to recombine and form a new diploid organism; in others, the <b>gametes</b> are capable of undergoing cell division to produce multicellular haploid organisms. In either case, <b>gametes</b> may be externally similar, particularly in size (isogamy), or may have evolved an asymmetry such that the <b>gametes</b> are different in size and other aspects (anisogamy).|$|R

25|$|By convention, {{the larger}} <b>gamete</b> (called an ovum, or egg cell) is {{considered}} female, while the smaller <b>gamete</b> (called a spermatozoon, or sperm cell) is considered male. An individual that produces exclusively large gametes is female, {{and one that}} produces exclusively small gametes is male. An individual that produces both types of gametes is a hermaphrodite; in some cases hermaphrodites are able to self-fertilize and produce offspring on their own, without a second organism.|$|E
25|$|The male <b>gamete,</b> a {{spermatozoon}} (produced {{within a}} testicle), {{is a small}} cell containing a single long flagellum which propels it.|$|E
25|$|Disregarding intermediates, {{the basic}} {{distinction}} between asexual and sexual reproduction {{is the way}} in which the genetic material is processed. Typically, prior to an asexual division, a cell duplicates its genetic information content, and then divides. This process of cell division is called mitosis. In sexual reproduction, there are special kinds of cells that divide without prior duplication of its genetic material, in a process named meiosis. The resulting cells are called gametes, and contain only half the genetic material of the parent cells. These gametes are the cells that are prepared for the sexual reproduction of the organism. Sex comprises the arrangements that enable sexual reproduction, and has evolved alongside the reproduction system, starting with similar gametes (isogamy) and progressing to systems that have different <b>gamete</b> types, such as those involving a large female <b>gamete</b> (ovum) and a small male <b>gamete</b> (sperm).|$|E
25|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} animals {{spend their}} lives as diploid organisms, with the haploid stage reduced to single cell <b>gametes.</b> The <b>gametes</b> of animals have male and female forms—spermatozoa and egg cells. These <b>gametes</b> combine to form embryos which develop into a new organism.|$|R
50|$|Nearly {{all animals}} undergo {{some form of}} sexual reproduction. They produce haploid <b>gametes</b> by meiosis (see Origin and {{function}} of meiosis).

50|$|Nullisomy {{is caused}} by {{non-disjunction}} during meiosis that causes two of the <b>gametes</b> to have no chromosomal material, leaving the other two <b>gametes</b> to have double the amount of chromosomal material (disomic).
