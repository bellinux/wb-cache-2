40|$|Abstract Background Ruptures of the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) are common injuries to the knee joint. Arthroscopic ACL replacement by autologous tendon grafts has established itself as a standard of care. Data from both experimental and observational studies suggest that surgical reconstruction does not fully restore knee stability. Persisting anterior laxity may lead to recurrent episodes of giving-way and cartilage damage. This might {{at least in part}} depend on the method of graft fixation in the bony tunnels. Whereas resorbable screws are easy to <b>handle,</b> <b>pins</b> may better preserve graft tension. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine whether pinning of ACL grafts reduces residual anterior laxity six months after surgery as compared to screw fixation. Design/ Methods SPOT is a randomised, controlled, patient and investigator blinded trial conducted at a single academic institution. Eligible patients are scheduled to arthroscopic ACL repair with triple-stranded hamstring grafts, conducted by a single, experienced surgeon. Intraoperatively, subjects willing to engage in this study will be randomised to transplant tethering with either resorbable screws or resorbable pins. No other changes apply to locally established treatment protocols. Patients and clinical investigators will remain blinded to the assigned fixation method until the six-month follow-up examination. The primary outcome is the side-to-side (repaired to healthy knee) difference in anterior translation as measured by the KT- 1000 arthrometer at a defined load (89 N) six months after surgery. A sample size of 54 patients will yield a power of 80 % to detect a difference of 1. 0 mm Â± standard deviation 1. 2 mm at a two-sided alpha of 5 % with a t-test for independent samples. Secondary outcomes (generic and disease-specific measures of quality of life, magnetic resonance imaging morphology of transplants and devices) will be handled in an exploratory fashion. Conclusion SPOT aims at showing a reduction in anterior knee laxity after fixing ACL grafts by pins compared to screws. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Handle making {{can be done}} {{in several}} {{different}} ways depending on the tang of the knife.

T-shaped handles are used for many lower-tension instruments such as the harpsichord, harp, and dulcimer. T-shaped handles help keep torque parallel to the shaft of the tuning pin, and thus avoid bending the pin and widening the wooden hole that holds the tuning pin.|$|R
2500|$|When a pin rolls back, {{the smaller}} {{diameter}} of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first. [...] The wheel brings the pin {{to the top and}} drops it into a metal tray, called a [...] "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it drop into the pan base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a conveyor belt lifts the pin up, letting it slide into one of ten spots â nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin â in a rotating metal basket called the [...] "turret" [...] (located just above the deck) with only the deck itself, protected with the attached sheet metal [...] "deck shield", visible to the bowler as it descends to <b>handle</b> the <b>pins.</b> When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or [...] "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute {{in the center of the}} turret being filled last. Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck.|$|R
50|$|The arched, non-cutting top of {{the blade}} is called the back or the spine while the cutting part of the blade {{opposite}} the back is called the cutting edge. Finally the other free end of the blade, {{at the opposite end}} of the tang, is called the point and, sometimes, the head or the nose.There are usually two, but sometimes three, <b>pins</b> in the <b>handle.</b> The middle <b>pin,</b> if present, is plastic coated and is called the centre plug. Its function is to stabilise the sides of the handle so that they cannot be squeezed in the middle and acts as a bridge between them. When folded into the scales, the blade is protected from accidental damage, and the user is protected from accidental injury. During folding, the back of the blade, being thick and normally with a curved cross-section, acts as a natural stopper and prevents further rotation of the blade out of the handle from the other side. The frictional force between the scales and the tang applied about the pivot is called the Tension and it determines how freely the blade rotates about the point of rotation. A proper amount of tension should be present, for safety reasons, to ensure that the blade does not spin freely when opening or closing.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{criticism}} {{has been raised}} against the Swedish fire brigades both from their own staff and from researchers regarding deficiencies in learning and experience feedback within the organizations. Among other things, they {{have been criticized for}} that the documentation is only proliferating paper work because there is no system available for deriving advantage from the experience. A researcher who has studied the area is Anna-Karin Lindberg, who reviewed the learning from the fire brigades operating reports. She concludes, among other things, that the spreading of knowledge and lessons learned from the operating reports do not work particularly well. At the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade there were suspicions that the same problems regarding the operating reports also applied to the fire investigations. We have in this thesis reviewed parts of the process of fire investigations to identify deficiencies, mainly with regard to experience feedback from the suggestions for improvement put forward in fire investigations. The work was conducted in three steps encompassing: 1) analyzing various theoretical models to be used in fire/accident investigations, 2) reviewing fire investigations to examine their coherence with theory, and, 3) reviewing the content, quality and extent of the suggestions for improvement contained in fire investigations. The completed study covers a total of 130 fire investigations, written by Stockholm / the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade in the years 2006 to 2010. Fire investigations have been reviewed and the various suggestions for improvement have then been indexed in a database. From this database, and through interviews and literature studies, we note that there are deficiencies in the process of experience feedback from fire investigations, mainly referring to the suggestions for improvement which only reach out to a small number of people, both internally and externally. The external distribution is more or less exclusive to the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency (MSB) and the suggestions for improvement that primarily should be handled locally may not be carried out. There are also uncertainties regarding whom or what part of the organization that is responsible for passing on the suggestions for improvement and {{there is a lack of}} effective channels for disseminating the information to the most crucial recipients. In conclusion, it is recommended that the Greater Stockholm Fire Brigade: - develops a system for how the suggestions for improvement and experiences best should be <b>handled</b> and <b>pin</b> down which part of the organization that is responsible for communicating them. - customizes the report template so that it aims at concrete suggestions for improvement and introduces a mailing list or something equivalent. - initiate contacts with the most frequent recipients of suggestions for improvement and examines how these should be performed.

40|$|As IC {{technology}} advances, {{the package}} size keeps shrinking while the pin count of a package keeps increasing. A modern IC package {{can have a}} pin count of thousands. As a result, a complex printed circuit board (PCB) can host more than ten thousand signal nets. Such a huge pin count and net count make manual design of packages and PCBs an extremely time-consuming and error-prone task. On the other hand, increasing clock frequency imposes various physical constraints on PCB routing. These constraints make traditional IC and PCB routers not applicable to modern PCB routing. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there is no mature commercial or academic automated router that handles these constraints well. Therefore, automated PCB routers that are tuned to handle such constraints become a necessity in modern design. In this dissertation, we propose novel algorithms for three major aspects of PCB routing: escape routing, area routing and layer assignment. Escape routing for packages and PCBs has been studied extensively in the past. Network flow is pervasively used to model this problem. However, previous studies are incomplete in two senses. First, none of the previous works correctly model the diagonal capacity, which is essential for 45 degree routing in most packages and PCBs. As a result, existing algorithms may either produce routing solutions that violate the diagonal capacity or fail to output a legal routing even though one exists. Second, few works discuss the escape routing problem of differential pairs. In high-performance PCBs, many critical nets use differential pairs to transmit signals. How to escape differential pairs from a pin array is an important issue that has received too little attention in the literature. In this dissertation, we propose a new network flow model that guarantees the correctness when diagonal capacity is taken into consideration. This model leads to the first optimal algorithm for escape routing. We also extend our model to <b>handle</b> missing <b>pins.</b> We then propose two algorithms for the differential pair escape routing problem. The first one computes the optimal routing for a single differential pair while the second one is able to simultaneously route multiple differential pairs considering both routability and wire length. We then propose a two-stage routing scheme based on the two algorithms. In our routing scheme, the second algorithm is used to generate initial routing and the first algorithm is used to perform rip-up and reroute. Length-constrained routing is another very important problem for PCB routing. Previous length-constrained routers all have assumptions on the routing topology. We propose a routing scheme that is free of any restriction on the routing topology. The novelty of our proposed routing scheme is that we view the length-constrained routing problem as an area assignment problem and use a placement structure to help transform the area assignment problem into a mathematical programming problem. Experimental results show that our routing scheme can handle practical designs that previous routers cannot handle. For designs that they could handle, our router runs much faster. Length-constrained routing requires the escaped nets to have matching ordering along the boundaries of the pin arrays. However, in some practical designs, the net ordering might be mismatched. To address this issue, we propose a preprocessing step to untangle such twisted nets. We also introduce a practical routing style, which we call single-detour routing, to simplify the untangling problem. We discover a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of single-detour routing solutions and present a dynamic programming based algorithm that optimally solves the problem. By integrating our algorithm into the bus router in a length-constrained router, we show that many routing problems that cannot be solved previously can now be solved with insignificant increase in runtime. The nets on a PCB are usually grouped into buses. Because of the high pin density of the packages, the buses need to be assigned into multiple routing layers. We propose a layer assignment algorithm to assign a set of buses into multiple layers without causing any conflict. Our algorithm guarantees to produce a layer assignment with minimum number of layers. The key idea is to transform the layer assignment problem into a bipartite matching problem. This research result is an improvement over a previous work, which is optimal for only one layer...|$|R
