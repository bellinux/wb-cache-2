25|$|The {{field of}} ecohydrology is {{concerned}} with the interaction between ecosystems and water cycling, from measuring the small scale drainage of water into soil to tracking the broad movements of water evaporating off from trees. Because deuterium acts as a conservative tracer, <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>well</b> for tracking water movement through plants and ecosystems. Although water movement in single-process phenomena such as evaporation is relatively simple to track, many systems (e.g. cloud forests) in the environment have multiple sources and tracking water movement becomes more complicated. Isotope spiking can also be done to determine water transport through soil and into plants via injection of deuterated water directly into the ground.|$|E

While some ectopic pregnancies will resolve without treatment, this approach has not been well studied as of 2014. The use of the medication methotrexate works as well as surgery in some cases. Specifically <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>well</b> when the beta-HCG is low {{and the size of}} the ectopic is small. Surgery is still typically recommended if the tube has ruptured, there is a fetal heartbeat, or the person's vital signs are unstable. The surgery may be laparoscopic or through a larger incision, known as a laparotomy. Outcomes are generally good with treatment.|$|E

25|$|In British 00 scale (similar to H0 scale) models the 'tension lock' coupler {{developed}} by Tri-ang is standard. This {{is similar in}} operation to the meatchopper type of coupling. Remote uncoupling is possible by using a sprung ramp between the rails. The design of the hooks is such that the couplings will not uncouple when under tension (instead depressing the ramp). When the train is pushed over the ramp, it will lift the coupling hooks as the train passes over. By halting the train over the ramp, it is split at this point. While <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>well,</b> it is often seen as ugly and obtrusive (although smaller designs are available, these are not always fully compatible with other models) and many British modellers prefer to retrofit either Kadee types or working hook and chain couplings.|$|E

With the exploration, Ivy began crafting [...] "stronger" [...] songs, that were less atmospheric than those on their previous studio album, Apartment Life (1997), but contained more [...] "infectious melodies".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was divided, as reviews ranged from largely positive to negative. In the book The End and the Beginning: The Official Guide to The X-Files, Vol. 5, author Andy Meisler {{noted that some}} fans and critics responded positively to [...] "The Beginning," [...] most notably because the episode functioned as [...] "a particularly artful and effective way to launch the series's new season—and era." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying [...] "'The Beginning' {{was a pretty good}} premiere episode. I was quite pleased to see how Chris Carter took last season's finale and the movie and tied things together to get Season 6 off to a fresh start." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B. He praised the performance of Chris Owens, noting that he was [...] "acting the shit out of Spender". Despite this, however he called the episode [...] "lackluster" [...] and noted that it [...] "isn’t a great episode of the show, but <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>well</b> enough". VanDerWerff's main issue with the entry was that it chose to close off the events of the fifth season finale, but did little to expand upon the revelations of the series' feature film. VanDerWerff also criticized the fact that Scully was, once again, a skeptic in the paranormal after all she saw.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was moderately positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of Scully's portrayal, noting [...] "Really, this works best as a Scully episode. I prefer Darin Morgan's {{version of the}} character , but I doubt that version could support a full episode about God {{in the same way}} that this more searching, and lost, Scully does." [...] However, Handlen was critical of some of the religious aspects of the episode, noting that [...] "If there's a Christian God in the X-Files universe, doesn't that trump just about everything else that Mulder and Scully have spent their time on?... There are too many implications here for the show to support, and while it doesn't destroy the episode, it does make it difficult for me to back it as fully as I'd like to." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, noting [...] "Overall, this episode highlights Scully and her faith, and in the process, manages to presage many of the future plot developments for the series and her character. The spiritual war at the foundation of the series mythology is reflected in a situation that speaks directly to Scully and her upbringing, and though some of the religious metaphors are heavy-handed, <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>well</b> enough." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of the episode's [...] "inventiveness," [...] which [...] "derives from its choice of the most mainstream paranormality of all—Christianity." [...] The review also wrote positively of the Mulder-Scully role reversal, calling the change [...] "always welcome". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. She noted that [...] "Scully's search to reconcile her religious beliefs and her scientific training makes for powerful drama, and Gillian Anderson is up to the challenge." [...] Vitaris, however, criticized elements of the plot, most notably the [...] "un-saintly" [...] quality of Kevin and Kevin's lack of emotion after his mother is killed. Furthermore, she called the ending [...] "a real mess". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, and called it a [...] "peculiarly bloodless episode". The two wrote that many of the traits possessed by Kevin were only helpful in certain isolated scenes, such as the ability to bilocate. Shearman and Pearson concluded that the show should [...] "take a serious subject by all means, but then take the subject seriously." ...|$|E

According to the band, they wrote 30 songs while recording the album, but were unable to complete all of them. Carney spent about three-to-four days sequencing the album at his studio before soliciting Auerbach's input. The only change made to the running order was the addition of [...] "Gotta Get Away" [...] to the end; Carney had wanted [...] "In Our Prime" [...] to close the record, but Auerbach thought the song was too sad and preferred a catchy, upbeat track to conclude the album. Carney agreed with the change, saying, [...] "Actually, I think <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>well</b> at the end, too. It erases your brain from whatever heavy elements {{there are in the}} record.
