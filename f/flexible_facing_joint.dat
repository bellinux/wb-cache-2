40|$|Reinforced earth wall {{system has}} become very popular because of its {{aesthetic}} value and ease of construction. In order to optimize the design, {{it is important to}} understand its behavior during and after construction. This can be achieved either through field instrumentation or numerical simulation. In this paper, field instrumentation work carried out on a reinforced earth wall is described with the objective of capturing the essential behaviour of the wall during and after construction. Two different wall conditions were considered, that is, in the first case, the wall is allowed to move laterally and in the other case, the wall is not flexible in transverse direction. Based on the observations made, it can be concluded that the locus of maximum tension is a vertical line offset approximately 0. 35 H away from the facing. For lateral pressure, it is seen that the curve for the <b>flexible</b> <b>facing</b> follows similar trend as the curve for the rigid facing except that the horizontal pressure at the <b>flexible</b> <b>facing</b> is generally slightly lower. Lastly, the connection ratio at rigid facing is generally higher than the connection ratio at the <b>flexible</b> <b>facing...</b>|$|R

40|$|When only {{a single}} image of a face is available, can we {{generate}} new images of the face across changes in viewpoint or illumination? The approach {{presented in this paper}} acquires its knowledge about possible image changes from other faces and transfers this prior knowledge to a novel face image. In previous work we introduced the concept of linear object classes (Vetter and Poggio, 1997; Vetter, 1997) : In an image based approach, a flexible image model of faces was used to synthesize new images of a face when {{only a single}} 2 D image of that face is available.

In an analysis-by-synthesis loop the flexible 3 D model is matched to the novel face image. Variation of the model parameters, similar to multidimensional morphing, allows for generating new images of the face where viewpoint, illumination or even the expression is changed. The key problem for generating a <b>flexible</b> <b>face</b> model is the computation of dense correspondence between all given example faces.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method to derive 3 D shape and surface texture of a human face from a single image. The method draws on a general <b>flexible</b> 3 D <b>face</b> model which is “learned ” from {{examples}} of individual 3 D-face data (Cyberware-scans). In an analysis-by-synthesis loop, the flexible model is matched to the novel face image. From the coloured 3 D model obtained by this procedure, we can generate new images of the face across changes in viewpoint and illumination. Moreover, nonrigid transformations which are represented within the flexible model can be applied, for example changes in facial expression. The key problem for generating a <b>flexible</b> <b>face</b> model is the computation of dense correspondence between all given 3 D example faces. A new correspondence algorithm is described which is a generalization of common algorithms for optic flow computation to 3 D-face data. ...|$|R
40|$|Today, geosynthetic-reinforced soil {{structures}} {{are widely used}} to support bridge abutments and approach roads in place of traditional pile supports and techniques. In such situations, foundation conditions {{have been shown to}} adversely affect the stability and deformation behaviour of overlying geosynthetic-reinforced slopes and walls. This paper addresses the response of geotextile-reinforced slopes subjected to differential settlements in a geotechnical centrifuge. Centrifuge model tests were carried out on model geotextile-reinforced sand slopes with two different types of reinforcement. A wrap-around technique Was used to represent a <b>flexible</b> <b>facing.</b> In order to initiate failure in the reinforcement layers, the ratio of length of reinforcement to height of the slope was maintained as 0. 85. One of the objectives {{of this paper is to}} present about a special device developed for inducing differential settlements during centrifuge test at 40 g for a reinforced soil structure. A digital image analysis technique was employed to arrive at displacement vectors of markers glued to the reinforcement layers. The displacements were used to compute and analyze the strain distribution along the reinforcement layers during different settlement stages. Results of the centrifuge test indicate that even after inducing a differential settlement equivalent to 1. 0 m in prototype dimensions, the geotextile-reinforced soil structure with a <b>flexible</b> <b>facing</b> was not found to experience a collapse failure. Analysis of geotextile strain results shows that the location of the maximum peak reinforcement strain occurs along the bottom-most reinforcement layer at the onset of differential settlements, at the point directly below the crest of the slope.

The study adopted a descriptive research design and purposive sampling. Multiple sources of evidence was used to collect information mainly literature review, questionnaires and interviews. Key findings reveal that legal and statutory requirements in the formation of joint ventures include registration by Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA), Contractors Registration Board (CRB) and under Registration of Documents Act (RDA). All JV respondents were registered by BRELA and CRB which are mandatory but only 7 were registered by RDA.

40|$|Part I: Surgical Tool Design. The primary {{objective}} of this thesis was {{the development of a}} surgical tool to implant a specialized micro-scale sensor into the anterior chamber of a mouse eye. The sensor measures intra-ocular pressure continuously under normal living conditions, creating a measurement system that is needed in the field of Glaucoma research. The sensor has a complex geometry comprised of both compliant and non-compliant materials, and requires careful handling. ^ Previously, the surgical procedure required three separate tools; a knife, a syringe and needle, and forceps. That procedure suffered from issues of ease of use, efficiency, safety and reliability. The objective was to design, fabricate, and test a single unified tool that could perform all necessary surgical functions. The motivation for unifying the toolset into a single device was primarily to improve surgical efficiency and ease of use. ^ The development of the surgical tool faced a number of different challenges. These issues pertained to creating a sharp cutting instrument within unusual geometrical constraints, loading the sensor into a narrow tube, delivering both fluid and an object through the same tube, optimizing dimensions against competing constraints, and satisfying the ergonomic needs of the surgeon. ^ Two generations of prototypes were fabricated and tested. The second generation prototype was comprised of three telescoping tubes, each with a specific function. All three surgical steps were successfully carried out on a cadaver pig eye, with minor complications in the handling of the tool. Due to inherent design constraints in the implant and available materials, the size of the tool is likely more appropriate for the anatomy of a larger animal. ^ Part II: The Effects of Leg Morphology on Running Performance. The secondary {{objective of this}} thesis was to explore how differences in joint morphology impact the dynamics and energetics of running. An analysis was completed on the effects of kinematic knee orientation on legged locomotion, specifically simple running patterns. ^ The analysis compared the dynamics of a forward facing knee found in humans, a rear facing ankle found in birds, and a linear knee found in pogo sticks and simple robots. ^ The equations of motion for the models reveal that joint orientation has a direct effect on the dynamics of the system. The early simulation results show that leg morphology directly effects deflection and force patterns, which in turn effects the trajectory of the system. In forward <b>facing</b> <b>joints,</b> hip torque increases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of higher compliance in the leg. In rear <b>facing</b> <b>joints,</b> hip torque decreases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of lower compliance in the leg. The results suggest that a forward <b>facing</b> knee <b>joint</b> found in humans is more energy efficient than a rear <b>facing</b> ankle <b>joint</b> found in birds. ...|$|R
