In large-entry mines {{that do not have}} any high resistance-sections (shafts> 100 ft long or shaft diameters < 12 ft), propeller fans can greatly increase the total system airflow. Propeller fans can be used as either main <b>mine</b> <b>fans</b> or as freestanding auxiliary (jet) fans. NIOSH researchers have documented the performance of two recently installed propeller fans in a working limestone mine (figure 1). Together the fans exhausted 750, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 200. These fans replaced an axial vane main <b>mine</b> <b>fan</b> that produced 300, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 250. The use of the propeller fans more than doubled the air quantity while operating at 50 hp less than the original main <b>mine</b> <b>fan</b> system. In addition, the new fans, when used with effective air-coursing methods such as stoppings, reduced or eliminated recirculation near the face areas.

40|$|The {{roles of}} main <b>mine</b> <b>fans</b> in {{underground}} <b>mines</b> are to induce airflow and continuously re- move hazardous gases and dust. While most larger <b>mines</b> use multiple <b>fans</b> to accomplish these tasks, many smaller mines employ {{only a single}} fan. This paper concentrates on those mines having only one fan to provide ventilation needs. If this fan should cease to function, {{it is likely that}} methane concentrations will in- crease in some areas of the mine. As a safety precaution, Federal Regulations require that personnel must be- gin evacuating the mine within fifteen minutes after fan stoppage. Powered haulage can be used to transport workers to the mine portal as long as travel is through areas where hazardous levels of methane are not expected. To determine where methane will accumulate along haulageways during a fan stoppage, air samples must be taken at specific areas and analyzed for hazardous gases. During this study, procedures were developed for measuring methane levels along the haulegeways that are used to exit a mine following stoppage of the main <b>mine</b> <b>fan.</b> Methane levels were measured in four different mines at selected underground locations during four planned fan stoppages.

50|$|Mining {{ventilation}} is {{a significant}} safety concern for many miners. Poor ventilation inside sub-surface mines causes exposure to harmful gases, heat, and dust, which can cause illness, injury, and death. The concentration of methane and other airborne contaminants underground can generally be controlled by dilution (ventilation), capture before entering the host air stream (methane drainage), or isolation (seals and stoppings). A ventilation system is set up to force a stream of air through the working areas of the mine. The air circulation necessary for effective ventilation of a mine is generated {{by one or more}} large <b>mine</b> <b>fans,</b> usually located above ground. Air flows in one direction only, making circuits through the mine such that each main work area constantly receives a supply of fresh air.

40|$|Purpose. In {{this article}} it is {{necessary}} to analyze the possibility of developing technology and increasing its efficiency during the Beskidskiy tunnel construction in difficult engineering and geological conditions. Methodology. The authors have performed analysis of the technological level of mining and construction works, new technique, equipment and production. One of the important issues of blasting operation is to ensure the seismic safety, acting at a distance of 30 m in the axes of single-track tunnel, as the distance to it will be 20 m from the nearest charge in the laying tunnel. This problem was solved by applying the combined blasting of blast-hole charges with delay-action and long-delay ways. Herewith the total mass of charges in the stope was divided into three groups, in which the first group is exploded by short-delay firing with, and the second one is exploded by short-delay firing too with intervals of 200 … 400 ms, the third is exploded by long-delay blasting at intervals of 500 … 10000 ms. The combined blasting of short-delay charges and delay action ones let significantly reduce seismic action at a mass explosion of charges when driving of double-track railway tunnel of a large cross-section. Findings. The paper presents the developed technology model, describing dependence of the machines from engineering and geological conditions. The methodology of drilling and blasting works at the construction of the tunnel callote and stross as well as a technique of arrangement determination and intervals of shot-delay and delay blasting of blasthole explosive charges was developed. Maximum permissible concentration of gases and vapours at blasting was presented. The calculations showed that the maximum level of gas contamination of the working area in Beskidskiy tunnel is achieved at blast operations.

This paper investigates the potential for energy-cost savings and actual energy savings, by implementation of variable speed drives to ventilation <b>fans</b> in underground <b>mines.</b> In particular, ventilation on demand is considered in the study, i. e., air volume is adjusted according to the demand at varying times. Two DSM strategies, energy efficiency (EE) and load management (LM), are formulated and analysed. By modelling the network with the aid of Kirchhoff’s laws and Tellegen’s theorem, a nonlinear constrained minimization model is developed, with the objective of achieving EE. The model is also made to adhere to the fan laws, such that the fan power at its operating points is found to achieve realistic results. LM is achieved by finding the optimal starting time of the mining schedule, according to the time of use (TOU) tariff. A case study is shown to demonstrate the effects of the optimization model.

40|$|Increased {{awareness}} {{of a healthy}} work environment is common to all industries and the stone industry is no exception. The presence of operating diesel equipment, welding, stone production blasting, and silica dust in a working environment all contribute to air quality issues in underground stone mines. Particularly recognized is the exposure of workers to diesel particulate matter (DPM). Recent regulations call for a DPM standard of 160 TC ug/m 3 (TC = Total Carbon). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has conducted research to improve the ventilation of these mines and consequently reduce the exposure of workers to harmful airborne contaminants. The results {{have shown that the}} ventilation of underground stone mines can be significantly enhanced using improved ventilation controls and techniques. Large-opening stone mines present specialized ventilation challenges because their entries are much larger than in other types of mines. Most stone mines have entries about 40 feet wide and up to 30 feet high, with bench areas that may extend even higher. These large entries present the positive opportunity to move large air quantities at relatively low <b>mine</b> <b>fan</b> pressures resulting in lower fan horsepower and reduced operating costs. However, the difficulty in ventilating large-opening mines is that even with large air volumes, the air velocity is often less than 100 feet/minute. Higher ventilation velocities more quickly dilute and remove contaminants from the face areas. Higher ventilation airflow velocities can be achieved by effective ventilation planning and proper choice of ventilation fans...|$|R

Coal mining, and particularly coal mine ventilation air, is {{a major source of}} anthropogenic methane emissions, a greenhouse gas. Ventilation air volumes are large and the concentration of methane in the ventilation air is low; thus making it difficult to use or abate these emissions. This test program was conducted with simulated coal mine VAM in advance of deploying the technology on active coal <b>mine</b> ventilation <b>fans.</b> The demonstration project team installed and operated a 30, 000 cfm MEGTEC VOCSIDIZER oxidation system on an inactive coal mine in West Liberty, WV. The performance of the unit was monitored and evaluated during months of unmanned operation at mostly constant conditions. The operating and maintenance history and how it impacts the implementation of the technology on <b>mine</b> <b>fans</b> were investigated.

A Monte-Carlo simulation-based approach was followed to generate random set of resistance values from the distribution functions of the airways resistances. The VENTSIM software was used to solve the Hardy-Cross method for ventilation network simulation using one set of random resistance values. The Monte-Carlo simulation based approach helps to analysis the uncertainty of air quantity at specific working faces as well as total quantity required for ventilating the mine. The major focus of the thesis is towards the quantity of air in the working face generated by the <b>mine</b> main <b>fan</b> and the risk involve with the selection of <b>mine</b> main <b>fan</b> for a coal mine. The methodology for the ventilation network design proposed in this thesis was applied in a underground coalmine in Eastern part of India. The airways resistances are calculated by measuring the values at different places in same airways. The mean and standard deviation used for Monte-Carlo simulation assuming the distribution is Gaussian. A total number of 71 airways are simulated in the case study mine. A risk analysis of quantity of air reaching at face was performed at 3 working faces by generating 200 realizations. The results in this thesis was validated my measuring quantity at different measuring station in this mine...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{illustrate}} the results of a national research project devoted to studying both features of a prehistoric fl int mining landscape and underground mines not visible, or partially visible, on the surface. The geographical context of the project is the promontory of Gargano (south-eastern Italy), where an extraordinary abundance of fl int is associated with evidence of numerous extraction complexes (underground mines). According to the available data, the mines cover a time-span of almost three thousand years; the most important of them is the Defensola A mine, the oldest in Europe and active from roughly 5800 BC onwards. Unlike other European prehistoric mining complexes, mine entrances in Gargano are generally located on convex slopes, and have often produced extremely large cone-shaped spoil heaps outside. This suggested a method of investigation based on digital aerial photogrammetry. A DGPS survey was executed to measure ground control points, to be used for the external orientation of the photographs, as well as to obtain precise positions of the main known mines. Thanks to the stereo-interpretation it was possible to recognize key geological beds, such as limestone rich in fl int, and possible ancient entrances to mines. Sometimes anthropogenic covers (dumps and alluvial <b>fans)</b> near the <b>mines</b> were also recognized and interpreted as evidence of quarrying activity. A second level of investigation used geophysical surveys. These can determine the internal layout of each mining structure of which only the entrance is known. Moreover, geophysical prospection allowed us to verify the presence of new mining structures in cases where one or a few vertical shafts are present, which generally indicates the presence of larger mining complexes. The archaeological features of the area suggested to perform additional surveys using other geophysical methods: resistivity and ground penetrating radar. This multi-method approach allowed us to check the data from several independent measurements and to increase the amount of geometrical and physical information that can be used for the interpretation...|$|R
