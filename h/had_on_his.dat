5|$|Of {{far greater}} {{importance}} to McCarthy than the committee's inconclusive final report was the negative {{effect that the}} extensive exposure <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> popularity.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells his boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), the {{negative}} impact fatherhood has <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> life. They both decide to get vasectomies from Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell). While waiting, Jack discovers the respect Tracy's son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), has for his father. After being put under, Tracy realizes his life is horrible {{because he does not}} have a daughter. Luckily, Jack is able to stop Dr. Spaceman before he conducts the procedure.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{reporter}} Joshua Prager {{wrote an}} article in the Wall Street Journal profiling the long-term toll that Raoul Wallenberg's disappearance <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> family. His mother Maj and his stepfather Fredrik von Dardel spent {{the rest of their lives}} searching for their son. They both committed suicide by overdosing on pills two days apart in 1979. Their daughter Nina Lagergren, Raoul's half-sister, attributed their suicide to their despair about never finding their son. Lagergren and Raoul's half-brother Guy von Dardel established organizations and worked to find their brother or confirmation of his death. At the request of their parents, they were to assume he was alive until the year 2000.|$|E

5|$|The {{obligations}} and offices {{that came with}} {{being one of the}} largest local landowners descended on Mason as they <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father and grandfather. In 1747, he was named to the Fairfax County Court. Mason was elected as a vestryman for Truro Parish, serving 1749–1785. He took a position among the officers of the county militia, eventually rising to the rank of colonel. In 1748, he sought a seat in the House of Burgesses; the process was controlled by more senior members of the court and he was not then successful, but he would win in 1758.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1876 Jenny Morris was {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy. Refusing {{to allow her to}} be societally marginalised or institutionalised, as was common in the period, Morris insisted that she be cared for by the family. When Janey took May and Jenny to Oneglia in Italy, the latter suffered a serious seizure, with Morris rushing to the country to see her. They then proceeded to visit a number of other cities, including Venice, Padua, and Verona, with Morris attaining a greater appreciation of the country than he <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> previous trip. In April 1879 Morris moved the family home again, this time renting an 18th-century mansion on Hammersmith's Upper Mall in West London. Owned by the novelist George MacDonald, Morris would name it Kelmscott House and re-decorate it according to his own taste. In the House's grounds he set up a workshop, focusing on the production of hand-knotted carpets. Excited that both of his homes were along the course of the River Thames, in August 1880 he and his family took a boat trip along the river from Kelmscott House to Kelmscott Manor.|$|E
5|$|Ledonne {{had spent}} many years conceptualizing games, but never created one due to his lack of game design and {{programming}} knowledge. He was inspired to create a video game about Columbine by his own experience being bullied and the effect the shooting <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> life. The game represents a critique of how traditional media sensationalized the shooting (in particular the role of video games), as well as parodying video games themselves. Super Columbine Massacre was created with ASCII's game development program RPG Maker 2000 and took approximately six months to complete. Ledonne initially published the game anonymously, releasing an artist's statement about the work after his identity was revealed. Super Columbine Massacre was released for free online and attracted little attention until 2006, when widespread media coverage fueled {{hundreds of thousands of}} downloads.|$|E

25|$|Eliade kept a {{particularly}} fond {{memory of his}} childhood and, later in life, wrote about the impact various unusual episodes and encounters <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind.

During this time he escorted Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who was on a diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic. Roddam's time in the North Sea came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, which brought the War of the Austrian Succession to a close.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Malden {{starred in}} Skag, an hour-long drama {{that focused on}} the life of a foreman at a Pittsburgh steel mill. Malden {{described}} his character, Pete Skagska, as a simple man trying to keep his family together. The pilot episode for the series had Skag temporarily disabled by a stroke and explored the effects it <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> family and co-workers. While Skag met with poor ratings, critics praised it. In some instances, even full page ads were taken out in newspapers in an attempt to keep the program from being taken off the air. Nevertheless, the series was cancelled after several episodes. In 1987, he was the host/narrator for the second and third television specials that later became the long-running series Unsolved Mysteries.|$|E

By then, Stephen as a statesman had also become a point of reference and a benchmark for the long and stabilizing rule of Carol I, King of the Romanians. Over the following three decades, Stephen's deeds became the inspiration for literary works by Iorga, Mihail Codreanu, and especially Mihail Sadoveanu.|$|E
