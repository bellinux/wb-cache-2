40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{compared}} three {{methods of}} rock cutting using drag cutters under controlled laboratory conditions. The methods tested were the conventional <b>drag</b> <b>cutting</b> method used on continuous miners, the kerf-core method used on some boring machines, and an experimental method called ripper cutting. All three methods {{were tested in}} blocks of Indiana and Kasota limestone. The results of this testing showed ripper cutting to be 30 to 40 pct more energy efficient than both the conventional and the kerf-core methods in kasota limestone and 35 pct more efficient than the kerf-core method in Indiana limestone. The conventional method was, however, 9 pct more energy efficient than the ripper method in Indiana limestone. These results are considered promising, and more tests are planned with the ripper cutting system. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 1000571...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{methods are}} {{becoming}} more attractive for modeling complex rock-tool interaction processes as idealized analytical methods with simplified assumptions do not fully capture the failure process. In this paper, a two-dimensional particle flow code and boundary element code were used to help understand the rock-cutting process in <b>drag</b> <b>cutting</b> mode. In particle flow code, the micro-parameters such as particle/grain size, particle size distribution (to account for rock heterogeneity), contact bond strength and stiffness between the particles/grains were determined by calibrating the model against known properties of Harcourt granite. The numerical simulation results have indicated crushing beneath {{the tip of the}} drag cutter, and propagation of distinct cracks further ahead towards the edge of the sample forming a rock chip. It has been observed that for small depth of cut, the rock chipping process is governed by the formation of large number of tensile cracks. However, further experiments are needed in various rock formations to gain clear understanding of fracturing mechanism of rock at different depth of cut...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} <b>drag</b> <b>cutting</b> {{experiments in}} hard, abrasive rock {{in an effort}} to extend the capabilities of an experimental kerf-core mining machine. The basic kerf-core mining machine cannot be used in hard, abrasive rocks because of the high wear experienced by the kerf cutters. These experiments were conducted {{in an effort to}} develop a method of preweakening the rock ahead of the kerf cutters {{in order to reduce the}} high cutting loads and hence the higher wear rates experienced by the cutters. The two "preweakening" techniques studied were indenting with mechanical wedges and single and double slotting with diamond saws. The best cutter force reduction achieved with mechanical indenting as 70 pct, whereas double slotting achieved force reductions of up to 99 pct. Conceptual designs of preweakening systems that could be retrofitted onto the basic kerfing cutterhead were developed for both the indenting and the slotting techniques. A high-energy impactor with wedge bit was used for the indenting method, and high-pressure water jets were used for the slotting method. A preliminary technical and economic analysis was performed for both of these full-scale systems to illustrate the methodology and to point out the important technical and economic factors that must be considered...|$|E

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} basic {{experiments to}} study the process of crack propagation with a wedge indenter. The work was conducted under plane stress conditions in a hard, brittle limestone. The purpose of these experiments was to first {{gain an understanding of}} the basic crack propagation process under a sharp indenter, and second, to determine how the crack propagation process could be used to improve mechanical fragmentation systems. Three methods of rock fracture with the wedge indenter were investigated in this program. These were the confined indentation tests, the unconfined splitting tests, and the edge chipping tests. The confined indention tests represent worst case conditions for crack growth and formed the lower bound on fracture efficiency. The unconfined splitting tests represented best case conditions and fixed the upper bound of fracture efficiency. The edge chipping tests represented an idealized fragmentation process based exclusively upon the highly efficient fracture propagation process. Edge chipping achieved a specific energy of 25 in lb f/in 3 compared to conventional drag cutters, which required a specific energy of at least 2, 385 in 27 lb f/in 322 ̆ 0 ac 2 Thus edge chipping is up to 100 times more efficient than conventional <b>drag</b> <b>cutting.</b> Because of these promising results, more work is planned with the fracture propagation process in three dimensions...|$|E
50|$|Aero Union, under {{contract}} to the USFS, has developed an improved version of the system, known as the MAFFS II. The new system has a capacity of up to 3,000 gal, replacing the five retardant tanks with one large tank, and has two on-board air compressors. The original MAFFS has to be pressurized by a compressor {{on the ground as}} a part of the loading process. The ability to pressurize the system in the air cuts turn-around time significantly. The new system discharges the retardant through a special plug in the paratroop drop door on the side of the aircraft, rather than requiring the cargo ramp door to be opened; this allows the aircraft to remain pressurized during the drop sequence. Far more significantly, the cargo ramp and door can remain closed, <b>cutting</b> <b>drag</b> considerably, and thereby allowing a greater performance margin than available with MAFFS I.|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{a series of}} laboratory experiments to test a cutting technique for hard rock using large-scale drag cutters. Cutting experiments were performed on rocks ranging in compressive strength from 10, 000 to 27, 000 Ib/in 2, using large drag cutters from 3 to 6 in. in width. The tests were conducted on a special test apparatus, called a ripper tester, which made a curvilinear cut across the rock sample while measuring the cutting force acting on the <b>drag</b> cutter. The <b>cutting</b> method that evolved from these experiments is called ripper cutting, and its energy efficiency appears superior to all other large-scale mechanical fragmentation techniques. In addition, the method cre-ated very little dust, and the wear on the bits was negligible. A fragmentation system based on ripper cutting was then devised, and a large-scale test device was fabricated to allow full-scale laboratory testing of the system. The results of these tests will be published in future Bureau reports...|$|R
30|$|Foam {{is often}} used for underbalanced drilling. Foam fluids {{generally}} consist of 5 – 25  % of the liquid phase and 75 – 95  % of the gaseous phase. The liquid phase could be fresh water or brines. The gaseous phase is usually an inert gas. A surfactant {{is used as a}} stabilizer and it comprises about 5  % of the liquid phase. The liquid phase can be weighted up using heavy brines or barites. The advantages of foam drilling over conventional mud drilling include high penetration rates, a high cuttings transport ratio, and less formation damage. For the drilling with low bottom-hole pressures, the use of a lighter fluid, such as foam, is required (Zhu et al. 1995; Teichrob and Manuel 1997; Foster and Steiner 2007; Ramalho 2006; Chen 2005; Wang et al. 2009 b). In drilling operation, the fluid is pumped through the drill pipe down to the hole. Then the fluid with cuttings is circulated back up to the surface through the annular space between the drill pipe and the hole. Cuttings transport as a multiphase flow, is important to successful drilling operation, which can affect the operation cost, the time, and the quality of well drilling and completion. Inadequate hole cleaning can result in many costly problems, such as pipe stuck, lost circulation, premature bit wear, slow penetration rate, poor cement jobs, formation fracturing, high torque and high <b>drag.</b> <b>Cuttings</b> transport is controlled by many variables, such as the well deviation angle, hole diameter, drill pipe diameter, drill pipe rotation, drill pipe eccentricity, rate of penetration (ROP), cuttings characteristics (including the size, shape and porosity of bed), fluid velocity, fluid type, and the complex non-Newtonian fluid rheology. A comprehensive review of the cuttings transport was given by Nazari et al. (2010). Much research has been carried out on cuttings transport with conventional drilling fluids in horizontal and directional wells. In addition, some empirical and mechanistic models have been developed for cuttings transport (Clark and Bickham 1994; Larsen et al. 1997; Nguyen and Rahman 1998; Kelessidis and Bandelis 2004; Loureiro et al. 2010; Piroozian et al. 2012). Foam as a non-Newtonian pseudo-plastic fluid has high viscosity. Its viscosity is greater than either its liquid or gaseous components. Its density is usually less than one-half that of water. Therefore, foam could promote efficient cuttings transport. Its low density allows for underbalanced conditions, an increased ROP, and minimal formation damage. Foams are also stable at high temperatures and pressures (Ozbayoglu 2002; Ozbayoglu et al. 2005; Chen 2005; Duan 2007).The rheological properties and hydraulic of foam have been studied much less than conventional (incompressible) drilling fluids. Even less is known about the cuttings transport capabilities of foam. Determining how to effectively remove cuttings with foam is critical to the drilling process. The cuttings particles with the foam drilling fluid could create problems similar to those with conventional drilling fluid. The solids particles can also change foam properties, which may completely alter the plan for controlling down-hole pressure. The majority of research related to cuttings transport with foam describes operators’ experiences, field practices, and one-dimensional numerical simulations of the cuttings transport process (Machado and Ikoku 1982; Owayed 1997; Saintpere et al. 2000; Martins et al. 2001; Ozbayoglu 2002; Ahmed et al. 2003; Li and Kuru 2003; Chen 2005; Capo et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2007; Osunde and Kuru 2008; Wang et al. 2009 b; Duan 2007; Duan et al. 2010; Gumati and Takahshi 2011).|$|R
40|$|Rock cutting {{theories}} are reviewed {{in the light}} of the observed mechanism of fracture processes due to rock cutting. Relatively consistent crack patterns are found for the typical rock cutting processes, such as the primary and the secondary crack systems for wedge indentations, the major chipping crack for <b>drag</b> pick <b>cutting,</b> and so on. These failure patterns suggest that fracture mechanics principles are suitable for the related crack analyses. To apply fracture mechanics principles to practical rock cutting problems, four areas are of concern. First, an efficient numerical method is required for the fracture mechanics analyses of the rock crack problems involved. Second, observations on crack propagation involved in typical rock cutting processes are important to provide information on boundary conditions and to confirm the related fracture mechanics analyses. Third, a simpler method than conventional methods is desirable for the determination of the rock fracture toughness, the value of which is required for quantitative fracture mechanics analyses. A simple measurement method is especially desirable in the field where a large number of rocks needs to be concerned and where no sophisticated instrumentation is available. Fourth, rock fracture toughness is an intrinsic rock property closely related to rock cutting fragmentation processes. Its correlation with rock cutting or drilling machine performance needs to be identified to provide alternative parameters for cutability and drillability studies. Fundamental investigations are carried out in the four areas in this thesis. A boundary element fracture modelling technique has been developed to simulate or predict the rock crack behaviours in various rock cutting, which are generally beyond the scope of any analytical method due to the complexity of the problem. Accurate analyses on crack behaviour are achieved by the development of a special crack tip element. The fracture criteria, the Griffith-Irwin and the maximum tensile stress theories, are investigated for simulation of crack propagations. The second criterion is chosen for the rest of the cutting analyses because it leads to significantly less computing time. To observe the actual crack behaviour in <b>drag</b> pick <b>cutting</b> processes, a special 2 ̆ 7 Rock Cutting Simulation Rig 2 ̆ 7 is developed, in which static cutting tests can be conducted with various cutting conditions, such as cutting attack angle, rake angle, tool bluntness and so on. The specimen is held in place by two opposite platens through which confining pressure to the specimen can be applied. Both the numerical modelling and experimental work are undertaken with emphases on the effects of cutting tool attack angle, rake angle and cutting tool bluntness on the rock cutting performances. The crack behaviours due to simultaneous vertical loads of two wedge indenters, the BiIndenters, are investigated both numerically and experimentally. In contrast to the primary crack involved in a single wedge indentation, which propagates vertically downward, the cracks initiated from the near vicinities of each indenter tip of the Bi-Indenters tend to propagate outward due to the interaction between the two individual indenters of the BiIndenters. Furthermore, crack interaction between two of the Bi-Indenters are investigated, where a wedge-shaped large fragment tends to form due to the outward propagated cracks from adjacent tips between the two Bi-Indenters. The implication of the results for efficient rock cutting is discussed. Rock fracture toughness is one of the fundamental properties which are required by any fracture mechanics modelling and therefore is an important parameter to predict rock cutting performance of actual rock cutting machines. To develop a simple method for the rock fracture mechanics measurement, frac ture mechanics analyses on the diametral crack behaviour in a disc with diametral compression are carried out. Based on these analyses a simple conventional Brazilian test, which is nonnally used for the determination of rock tensile strength, is proposed to be applied for the measurement of rock fracture toughness. The fracture toughness of six types of rocks are determined by the proposed method. The results are compared favourably with those determined by the Chevron bending specimen method, one of the recently proposed international standard methods by the International Society for Rock Measurement(ISRM). Finally, the values of rock fracture toughness are found to correlate with the penetration rates of both of diamond coring and rotary drilling machines. The correlations between the penetration rates and the values of rock fracture toughness are also compared with those derived from the values of conventional Uniaxial Compressive Strength(UCS) and the Brazilian tensile strength...|$|R
