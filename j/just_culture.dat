The easy collecting procedure of the cord stroma and the plasticity of the cells isolated make it a suitable source for the collection of human mesenchymal cells. At the present moment, the bone needing for clinical therapies is increasing and identification of an alternative human cellular resource, easy to collect and able to produce a well-differentiated extracellular bone matrix, acts in this way. In this paper we demonstrate that the cord stroma mesenchymal progenitors are easy to commit into osteogenic lineages after exposition to conditionated medium of Runx 2 +/OC+positive cells, obtained from differentiation of human dental pulp stem cell, cells that are bone committed cells {{and can be used}} to studythe bone regeneration mechanisms.
