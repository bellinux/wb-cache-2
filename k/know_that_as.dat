500|$|After {{four years}} of privately denouncing the popular nature writers in letters and conversation, Roosevelt decided to weigh in publicly; while {{alerting}} Burroughs that he had finally broken his silence, he wrote: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> President I ought not to do this". He had given an interview to journalist Edward B. Clark, who quoted Roosevelt in the article [...] "Roosevelt on the Nature Fakirs" [...] in the June 1907 issue of Everybody's Magazine. Roosevelt not only spoke out against Long, but other authors like Jack London and Roberts, who wrote what he called [...] "'unnatural' history". Roosevelt popularized the term [...] "nature faker" [...] over Clark's original spelling, and defined it in his essay as [...] "an object of derision to every scientist worthy of the name, to every real lover of the wilderness, to every faunal naturalist, to every true hunter or nature lover. But {{it is evident that}} [...] completely deceives many good people who are wholly ignorant of wild life. Sometimes he draws on his own imagination for his fictions; sometimes he gets them second-hand from irresponsible guides or trappers or Indians." [...] He voiced displeasure with and disbelief of London's descriptions of dog fighting in White Fang, as well as Long's stories about Wayeeses the wolf taking down prey; Roosevelt was so specific as to debate the depicted outcome of the fights based {{on the size of the}} animals involved. Long's books in particular were deemed a [...] "genuine crime", especially against the country's children. Fearing that a curriculum including sentimental nature stories would corrupt young children, Roosevelt wrote: [...] "As for the matter of giving these books to children for the purpose of teaching them the facts of natural history—why, it's an outrage." ...|$|E

Faith in terms of religion, I don't—religion is not my specialty, you know." ...|$|E

He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: [...] "You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> far as you are aware, you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even a tiny bit of principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway.

Just prior {{to the end of his}} time as governor general, the Queen wrote to Massey: [...] "I wish to send you my congratulations and my sincere thanks for the manner in which you have discharged [...] duties. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> my personal representative you have always sought to maintain the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada. I am grateful to you for this because I regard it as the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction." [...] The Queen had wanted to appoint Massey as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, but Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, after consulting the rest of Cabinet, advised the Queen against conferring the honour.|$|E
