40|$|This paper {{examines}} the narratives through which associations {{of private property}} owners in Delhi depict slums as zones of incivility and "nuisance. " In tracing how this "nuisance talk" travels into and gains legitimacy in popular and state visions of urban space, the paper shows the role of discourse in justifying and enacting exclusionary urban <b>imaginaries.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> lay term, nuisance is widely used to identify forms of aesthetic impropriety. But, as a primary element of environmental law, nuisance operates discursively as a catchall category allowing diverse private grievances to be {{expressed in terms of}} environmental welfare and the public interest. The widening depiction of slums as nuisances hence reworks the public/private divide, inserting once local codes of civility into the core of public life. By examining how nuisance talk circulates between property owners' associations, the media, and the government, the paper shows how slum demolitions have become widely read as a form of environmental improvement...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the notion of}} spatial <b>imaginaries</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means of understanding, interpreting and challenging unspoken norms of university life, through {{an investigation of the}} transition experiences of self-identified 'at-risk' students in a regional university in Australia.

The human geography notion of spatial imaginaries is seen as a means by which tertiary educators can {{gain a better understanding of}} how to scaffold students' learning journeys and how to support students in their construction of a 'sense of place', while at the same time affording students an opportunity to explore their engagement and sense of connectedness in what for many is initially a contested space...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There {{has been}} an ongoing dispute between {{defenders}} of world disclosure (understood here in a loosely Heideggerian sense) and advocates of normative debate. I will take up a recent confrontation between Charles Taylor and Robert Brandom over this question as my {{point of departure for}} showing how world disclosure can expand the range of normative argument. I begin by distinguishing pre-reflective disclosure—the already interpreted, structured world in which we find ourselves—from reflective disclosure—the discrete intervention of a particular utterance or text. I discuss Taylor’s notion of social <b>imaginaries</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way of thematizing our pre-reflective background and Talal Asad’s critique of Taylor to show how this background can be one space of argument. I then develop my own understanding of reflective disclosure, of which Taylor gives an indequate account, developing my argument with help of literature, including a close analysis of Susan Glaspell short story “A Jury of Her Peers. ” This story illustrates how world disclosure can make normative arguments without confining itself to Brandom’s or Habermas’s idea of the exchange of reasons...|$|E

National imaginaries are of crucial importance to the home furnishings commodity network, flowing across sites of consumption, retailing, design, and production.

These include the representation of designers in the UK and Canada as "national heroes," and the tendency to measure British and Canadian design against a third national imaginary: that of Italy. A final case considers discursive constructions of national economic trajectories-of "success" or "failure"-within accounts of the British and Canadian furniture industries. It is argued that future work on the differentiating advantages, which may accrue to creative or cultural industries in particular localities, also should be attentive {{to the ways in which}} the place of the nation is used to construct imaginative geographies.

40|$|Abstract. Early {{engagement}} with geoengineering by social scientists indicates a certain suspicion over the motives {{and modes of}} operation of scientific research in the field. In part, this reflects the prominence of the critique {{of the politics of}} emergency in recent social and political thought: a thematisation that links securitisation measures with foreclosures of the political. This paper turns the attention back on the social sciences, arguing that recent styles of ontological and political thought do not prepare us well for engaging with geologic issues in general, and geoengineering in particular. It is suggested that, rather than viewing geoengineering discourses and <b>imaginaries</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> retreat from politics, we might view them as playing an important role in opening up new kinds of politics oriented towards earth systems and their dynamics. This new ‘geologic politics ’ involves a turn from issues hinging on territorial divisions of the earth’s surface toward the strata that compose the deep temporal earth.

40|$|Bram Stoker’s Dracula {{is one of}} {{the most}} read and most reimagined novels of the past one hundred years. Its plot has not only fueled retellings in media as far ranging as comics, popular novels, and films but also has given rise to {{spin-offs}} of multiple kinds. The narrative core of Dracula is examined here with a focus on the axes of time that collide within the novel. Bram Stoker employs the Middle Ages, available as a European narrative resource, to generate a contrast with the modern world his narrators reside in. But Stoker’s references to the Middle Ages do not merely fulfill the function of creating an atmosphere of thrill, fear, and terror as former studies mostly assumed. In contrast, by drawing on Yuri Lotman’s notion of semiospheres and narrative borders, I will show first how semiotically charged temporal contact zones collide and, second, how this collision allows readers to transgress two different narrated times and at the same time feel alienated by them. Through this analysis of Dracula, it is possible to postulate more generally the resource nature of medieval <b>imaginaries</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to encounter, or more specifically: to produce cultural otherness at all...|$|E

40|$|In 2018 the City of the Gold Coast in {{south-east}} Queensland, Australia, {{will host}} the next Commonwealth Games.  The City is made up a 57 km stretch of coastline and hinterland divided by a major highway. The famous surfing beaches are framed by high-rise development while the hinterland is marketed as a green, unspoilt environment.  The winning bid for the Games, and discussion about future infrastructure and marketing of the region’s attributes, has focussed attention on the way City residents and policy makers think about their region in broad terms. Whereas in the past tourism marketing has been directed towards the pleasures of sun and surf by day and bright lights by night, various regional tourist stakeholders are beginning to reorient their programs. This paper considers some of the competing aims of the various stakeholders in this region and the interaction of existing ‘cultures’ with new technology {{and the demands of}} permanent residents, using data from a case study of e-literary trails developed in Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland.

40|$|Late modernity {{is often}} {{associated}} with the uneven pressures of globalization, increasing technologization, and an intensification of migratory, economic, and cultural flows that alienate the subject, frequently figured as a traveler, from the natural world. Contemporary American poetry, in particular by ethnic poets invested in histories of displacement, explores these tensions by evoking travel by plane. Going beyond common themes in poems of flight, these texts interrogate the desire for place-attachment in a highly mobile world, and the peculiar perspectives on the natural environment open to the air traveler. In this essay I analyze selected poems about aeromobility from the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, arguing that they are not only plane poems but also ‘planetary poems. ’ Drawing from recent critical discourses on ‘the planetary,’ I demonstrate how these texts combine considerations of racial, ethnic, and cultural difference with ecological sensibilities and thus evoke complex glocal environmental <b>imaginaries.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> reading of Ed Roberson’s collection To See the Earth Before the End of the World (2010) shows, recent American poems of flight are centrally concerned not only with questions of mobility, but also with the role of technology in our current age of global conflict and environmental change. Contemporary poetry of aeromobility thus makes possible a (techno-) critical reexamination of traditional, planar perspectives on nonhuman environments and allows for an exploration of the revisionary potential of an eco-ethical, anti-imperialist planetary poetics...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} some of the most representative writers of the Cuban diaspora of the last three decades: Reinaldo Arenas, Carlos Victoria, Guillermo Rosales, Abilio Estévez, Jesús Díaz, and Antonio José Ponte. In addition to their novels, I also consider some leading exile publications, such as Exilio, Noticias de Arte, escandalar, Areíto, La Nuez, Linden Lane Magazine, Mariel, and Encuentro de la Cultura Cubana. Traversing the theoretical fields of history, politics, literature, transnational and diaspora studies, I analyze how these narratives interpellate hegemonic discourses related to the national literary canon and the growth of new <b>imaginaries</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of migration. I explore textual representations of contemporary diasporic identities which Cuban culture has produced within a cosmopolitan and multicultural environment. To create the theoretical framework for my dissertation, I have used theories of national identity shaped by exile, such as those of Stuart Hall and Edward Said. In addition, I contextualize the study of Cuban culture and literature within the contemporary debates on globalization, migration, and transnationalism, led by scholars such as James Clifford and Stéphane Dufoix. Ultimately, my work questions the variations in nationalist ideologies that underlie each of the narratives that I focus on. I argue that the works by these authors accentuate the distinctive features of a territorial resettlement experienced by a particular national community, rather than the commonalities and understandings of migration shared with other ethnic groups which are part of global trends of displacement and geographical relocation...|$|E

The ethnographic material presented, focus on young adults in Seoul with flexible working hours and how they simultaneously struggle and embrace a culture of work that increasingly occupy leisure time. Special attention is given to privately owned sites that combine leisure time and work, {{as well as their}} role in constituting new communities enhancing informal education. I explore how individuals embrace cosmopolitan <b>imaginaries</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> part of their self- realization. English education plays a central role as marker for class and status; it thus takes a special role in the formal and informal educational race, becoming a site for major investment of capital and an intergenerational project. Challenges related to work contains a gendered element, this requires different approaches. The role of cosmetic surgery and beauty is in this thesis conceptualized as a tactic aimed at handling these challenges. The theoretical approach here used to analyze the lived reality of young adults in South Korea, is primarily based on the works of Bourdieu, Foucault and Deleuze. A central argument in this thesis is that subjectivity is constantly created and recreated as the subject internalizes forms of governmentality that emphasizes self-development. Lastly, I explore how Deleuze and Guattari provide a framework for furthering the understandings of Foucault...|$|E
40|$|A {{collaborative}} {{article by}} the Editorial Collective of Social Imaginaries. Investigations into social imaginaries have burgeoned in recent years. From ‘the capitalist imaginary’ to the ‘democratic imaginary’, from the ‘ecological imaginary’ to ‘the global imaginary’ – and beyond – the social imaginaries field has expanded across disciplines {{and beyond the}} academy. The recent debates on social imaginaries and potential new imaginaries reveal a recognisable field and paradigm-in-the-making. We argue that Castoriadis, Ricoeur, and Taylor have articulated the most important theoretical frameworks for understanding social imaginaries, although the field as a whole remains heterogeneous. We further argue {{that the notion of}} social imaginaries draws on the modern understanding of the imagination as authentically creative. We contend that an elaboration of social imaginaries involves a significant, qualitative shift in the understanding of societies as collectively and politically-instituted formations that are irreducible to inter-subjectivity or systemic logics. After marking out the contours of the field and recounting a philosophical history of the imagination, the essay turns to debates on social imaginaries in more concrete contexts, specifically political-economic imaginaries, the ecological imaginary, multiple modernities and their inter-civilisational encounters. The social imaginaries field imparts powerful messages for the human sciences and wider publics. In particular, social imaginaries hold significant implications for ontological, phenomenological and philosophical anthropological questions; for the cultural, social, and political horizons of contemporary worlds; and for ecological and economic phenomena. The essay concludes with the argument that social <b>imaginaries</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> paradigm-in-the-making offers valuable means by which movements towards social change can be elucidated as well providing an open horizon for the critiques of existing social practice...|$|E

40|$|On Horizons was a {{three-fold}} research project, {{consisting of}} the 2 nd Former West Congress, co-organized with Maria Hlalvajova in Istanbul, the group exhibition Vectors of the Possible, at BAK in Utrecht, both in 2010, and the book On Horizons, published in 2011. The project was realized {{within the framework of}} Former West, an international research, education, publishing and exhibition project. On Horizons investigated the relationship between contemporary art and political imaginaries through the figure of the horizon. Across the formats of the book, conference, and exhibition, the aim was to see the horizon as the connection between aesthetics and politics. If every age is surrounded by a specific horizon, how does this horizon become visible and contestable? The first part of this investigation was a research exhibition under the title Vectors of the Possible, featuring the work of artists such as Chto Delat?, Matthew Buckingham, Sharon Hayes and Hito Steyerl. Their works established certain horizons, proposals of what can be imagined and what cannot. Their work can be regarded as founding research into the notion of horizontality in terms of image production and conceptualization. The Congress and book, featuring theorists such as Jodi Dean, Ernesto Laclau and Peter Osborne, revolved around the theoretical notion of the horizon, and the understanding of it in the linkage between contemporary art and political <b>imaginaries.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> contested term, the horizon was understood here to suggest not only political aims or utopias, but also the very framing of any aesthetic and political project.
