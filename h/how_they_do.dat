A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated information systems and networks. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.|$|E

[...] She singled out the scene where Archer gives an [...] "oddly specific" [...] situation as to when he would utilize a gun hidden in his underwear.

500|$|The 2012 Summer Games marked Sherab Zam's Olympic debut. She was {{the flag}} bearer {{at both the}} opening and closing ceremonies. She {{qualified}} for the individual archery competition after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. In an interview with Reuters before the games Zam said that [...] "Participation {{is more important than}} winning a medal." [...] Zam spent time in South Korea and India preparing for the games. The archery events at the 2012 games were held at the Lord's Cricket Ground. Zam competed on 27 July in the ranking round, finishing 61st out of 64 competitors with 589 points. She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am not that good at archery but I love it. It was so good to meet world ranking archers who are famous and to watch <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it. I have learnt a lot from them," [...] and that, [...] "When I grew up I never dreamt I would come to London, let alone compete in an Olympics. This just shows that anything is possible.

500|$|Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger {{published}} a positive review {{for the complete}} anime series. He wrote that the premise presented many flaws but were balanced out by other aspects: Sora and Shiro's [...] "over-powered hero" [...] archetype is balanced out by their flawed lifestyles, motives, and their [...] "visible delight in crushing their enemies"; Stephanie Dola's mistreatment with gags and Sora and Shiro's growing respect towards her; and the harem aspect with Sora's apathy and interesting female characters. Regardless, Kimlinger praised the plot's [...] "big games", calling them the reason to watch the series and described them as [...] "steeped in trickery and strategy"; he added that despite knowing the protagonists would win, the fun is seeing <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it. Kimlinger wrote the over-saturation art style will be an acquired taste for most viewers and praised how the animation really shines during the [...] "big games", calling it an impressive display of fluidity and timing. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis was also positive towards the series, praising the protagonists' dynamic, echoed Kimlinger's sentiments about the games, liked the animation, but noted his dislike for fan service featuring Shiro. He also ranked the series {{as one of the}} top five anime series of 2014, and recommended it for viewers who like smart characters and gamer humor. Similarly, TAYKotaku also praised the dynamics, references to other anime and video games, and the art style; the reviewer had mixed feelings towards the harem aspect and sexual humor, and agreed with Kotaku's dislike for the fan service featuring Shiro. IGN echoed previous opinions, praising the character dynamics, and also questioned the amount of unnecessary fanservice.|$|E

500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that he has tried to downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E
2500|$|Business process {{re-engineering}} (BPR) is {{a business}} management strategy, originally pioneered in the early 1990s, focusing on the analysis and design of workflows and business processes within an organization. BPR aimed to help organizations fundamentally rethink <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> their work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors. In the mid-1990s, as many as 60% of the Fortune 500 [...] companies claimed to either have initiated reengineering efforts, or to have plans to do so.|$|E

The “unity” which matters is a linkage between that articulated discourse and the social forces with which it can, under certain historical conditions, but need not necessarily, be connected. Thus, a theory of articulation is both a way of understanding how ideological elements come, under certain conditions, to cohere together within a discourse, and a way of asking <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> or do not become articulated, at specific conjunctures, to certain political subjects.

2500|$|Telecommuting {{is another}} way {{organizations}} can help reduce stress for their workers. Employees defined telecommuting as [...] "an alternative work arrangement in which employees perform tasks elsewhere that are normally done in a primary or central workplace, {{for at least some}} portion of their work schedule, using electronic media to interact with others inside and outside the organization." [...] One reason that telecommuting gets such high marks is that it allows employees more control over <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> their work. Telecommuters reported more job satisfaction and less desire to find a new job. Employees that worked from home also had less stress, improved work/life balance and higher performance rating by their managers.|$|E

2500|$|Self-determination is {{the ability}} to make choices and {{exercise}} a high degree of control, such as what the student does and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it (Deci et al., 1991; Reeve, Hamm, & Nix, 2003; Ryan & Deci, 2002). Self-determination can be supported by providing opportunities for students to be challenged, such as leadership opportunities, providing appropriate feedback and fostering, establishing and maintaining good relationships between teachers and students. These strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated to study. On the other hand, students who lack self-determination are more likely to feel their success is out of their control. Such students lose motivation to study, which causes a state of [...] "helpless learning". Students who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try. Over time, a vicious circle of low achievement develops.|$|E

[...] On June 30, 2011, a new song was released onto T.I.'s official website and on his official YouTube channel – titled [...] "We Don't Get Down Like Y'all", which features fellow Grand Hustle rapper B.o.B on the hook. While commenting on the song, T.I. said in another letter; [...] "It's a song that I did soon after my release last time. What inspired me to write this record was the differences in how we do us and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> them suddenly became incredibly evident in just {{a very short period of}} time." [...] It was originally only available on Atlantic Records's online store. The song was available on iTunes and other vendors, such as Spotify on August 9 and it peaked at number seventy-eight in the US.|$|E

The day ended with a cover of [...] "Twist and Shout", {{which had to be}} recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold and Martin feared the throat-shredding vocal would ruin Lennon's voice for the day. This performance, caught on the first take, prompted Martin to say: [...] "I don't know <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it. We've been recording all day but the longer we go on the better they get." [...] Mark Lewisohn would later write: [...] "There can scarcely have been 585 more productive minutes in the history of recorded music" [...] Paul McCartney double tracked his vocal on [...] "A Taste of Honey" [...] and Lennon added harmonica onto [...] "There's a Place" [...] during these sessions.
