40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{question}} of professionalization of <b>election</b> <b>campaigns</b> in second-order <b>elections</b> in Czech Republic {{and its impact on}} electoral costs and profits. Author of this work uses multidimensional CAMPROF index, authored by Rachel Gibson and Andrea Römmele, with which can be measured a degree of professionalization of <b>election</b> <b>campaigns.</b> The Index is adjusted for its use in a context of the regional elections in the Czech Republic and is being applied on <b>election</b> <b>campaigns</b> Starostové a nezávislí political movement in regional elections in 2016. The theory of second-order elections is used to adapt the index. We compare ten regional <b>election</b> <b>campaigns</b> of the Starostové a nezávislí political movement, and we try to answer the research question whether there is a clear link between the professionalization of <b>election</b> <b>campaigns,</b> their costs and profits...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{founding}} elections in Czechoslovakia in 1920, 1946, and 1990. A typical mention of these elections would describe them {{simply as the}} first elections after a regime change, and go no further. This diachronic analysis, based on <b>elections</b> <b>campaigns</b> as recorded in party-aligned newspapers, attempts to depict the broader aspect of founding elections and recapture the dynamic processes typical for such transition periods. <b>Election</b> <b>campaigns</b> are strongly influenced by the special character of founding <b>elections.</b> <b>Campaigning</b> not only reflects recent changes in the society but also formulates demands on its future development. Perceptions of the current situation reflect mutual relationships in between parties. The resulting character of <b>election</b> <b>campaigns</b> {{is a combination of}} these factors, plus others such as the media scene or the general mood in the society. The thesis thus tries to understand how political subjects behave in their founding <b>election</b> <b>campaigns.</b> Even though this behaviour varies wildly depending on background conditions, all political parties tend to focus their campaigns around the future course of the country...|$|R
