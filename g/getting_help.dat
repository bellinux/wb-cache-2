5|$|While patrolling Karakura Town, Ichigo is {{informed}} about invasion of Hueco Mundo by Wandenreich, {{a group of}} Quincies. He goes to Hueco Mundo with his friends to liberate it {{from one of the}} Wandenreich's high-ranked officers Quilge Opie. After dealing with Opie, Ichigo finds out that the Quincies are attacking the Soul Society. Arriving just after Head Captain Yamamoto's death, Ichigo encounters the Wandenreich's leader Yhwach. At the end of the encounter, which ends in a draw, Ichigo learns his mother was a Quincy. During the fight, Ichigo's Zanpakutō is shattered while attempting to stop Yhwach from escaping. Ichigo goes back to the World of Living where he learns the truth that his mother was a Quincy who was on a verge of hollowification until she was saved by Isshin at the cost of his Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo later learns that entity he believed to be Zangetsu is actually the embodiment of his Quincy powers yet accept him as he gains his reforged Zanpakutō in its new split Shikai form. During the second invasion by the Wandenreich, Ichigo and his friends confront Yhwach at the Soul King's Palace. During the prolonged fight that followed, Ichigo is defeated by Yhwach. With help from new allies, Ichigo faces Yhwach once again and slices him in two after <b>getting</b> <b>help</b> from the now free Aizen. Ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Ichigo and Orihime have a son named Kazui, who destroys the remnants of Yhwach's power.|$|E
25|$|Mercier, a Montreal journalist, {{started to}} realize how much {{corruption}} and integration into the community the group had one he began to follow one of the assault cases through the courts. The case was involving {{one of the young}} Dubois brothers and a merchant from St. Henri who had been beaten after he had refused to pay his daily receipt to the brothers’ hold up men. Mercier believed that the Dubois Brothers were <b>getting</b> <b>help</b> from someone on the inside as the victim was almost sentenced and the Dubois brother had only received a small fine. The Dubois Brothers also received permits, swung votes to which person they wanted through intimidation and were able to get judges to give reduced sentences. They had corrupted a journalist in order to have the journalist change information they needed and report information they wanted out but with his change of careers, due to the company finding out about his corruption, the Dubois Brothers turned him into their lawyer opening an office and giving them legal information. They were able to corrupt politicians, the police, judges and lawyers according to Mercier causing them a vast integration into society.|$|E
25|$|Multiplayer {{is present}} in Bloodborne as well, though it {{functions}} differently from its counterparts in the Souls series. By activating a non-consumable item {{at the cost of}} one Insight point, players can summon other players into their world to help with boss battles or large groups of enemies, and progress through areas of the game cooperatively. This leaves the player vulnerable to invasions, in which another player may invade the victim's game world and attempt to kill them, unless the player can find and defeat a specific enemy before an enemy player invades. Multiplayer summons are limited by proximity; players can only be summoned within a specific distance of each other to prevent players being summoned too far away to be of any assistance. Players can only summon other players that are around the same level as them to prevent the game from being too difficult, or too easy, for one of the players. What Covenant a player is a part of affects multiplayer as well. Players can summon an NPC to help them in addition to <b>getting</b> <b>help</b> from other players. The NPC serves as an AI companion to the player, that helps defeat enemies. Players can only summon specific NPCs that they have met throughout their journey. Another way players may interact with each other is by leaving notes. A player may leave a tip for defeating a boss, tell the reader where to go, fool the reader by purposely providing incorrect information, or just leave a meaningless message to others. Players may rate a message as 'Fine' or 'Foul', which will indicate to future readers whether the note is useful or untrustworthy.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland {{lost to the}} Giants for {{the second}} time in the sixth game of the season at the Polo Grounds in New York. The Giants again managed to stymie the Browns' passing game, but {{employed}} a different strategy from the one they used in three weeks before. Instead of dropping their defensive ends into coverage to handle Cleveland's receivers, New York allowed single coverage on the receivers and had its ends rush Graham, giving him less time to find his men open. Graham lost 71 yards being tackled while dropping back to pass. A fumble by Graham early in the game was recovered by the Giants, leading to New York's first score, a 22-yard field goal. The Browns scored a field goal midway through the second quarter after going for it on fourth down at midfield and <b>getting</b> <b>help</b> from an interference penalty. Tony Adamle recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and the Browns drove into New York territory as time ran out in the first half. Groza kicked a field goal, putting the Browns ahead 6–3. After Cleveland kicked off to New York with only a few seconds left in the half, returner Jim Ostendarp let the ball roll to his own one-yard line and the Browns recovered the live ball. Graham then ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. The Giants dominated in the second half, scoring a touchdown on their second drive and adding another in the fourth quarter to win the game, 17–13. Graham was held to just 118 yards of passing on 10 completions. Cleveland defensive end Len Ford suffered a severe injury to his face during the game and had to be taken to the hospital. He sat out the remainder of the regular season and had to have his mouth wired shut so it could heal.|$|E
500|$|According to Strickland, every {{character}} {{on the show}} was affected by King's rape. The episode explored Freedman's identity and response as the partner of a rape victim, with Adelstein identifying his character as [...] "a conscious 21st-century male" [...] in his interactions with King. According to Strickland, Montgomery's decision to use the rape kit on King without her knowledge {{would be a major}} storyline in the future and Turner would become persistent in <b>getting</b> <b>help</b> for King after learning about the rape since the characters had similar traumatic experiences. A behind-the-scenes feature about the episode and others involving King's rape, [...] "An Inside Look: The Violation of Charlotte King", was included on the fourth-season DVD and Blu-ray releases.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1992 season, Zolak also looked {{unlikely}} to appear, being behind Hodson and Millen on the depth chart. Millen started the first five games before being injured, and then Hodson became the starter. In early November, Zolak made his professional debut in the fourth quarter against the New Orleans Saints. Relieving Hodson, he completed five of nine passes and threw an interception as the Patriots lost, 3114. The next week, Zolak made his first career start when the still winless Patriots faced the Indianapolis Colts. He completed 20 of 29 passes for 261yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the Patriots' first win of the season, 3734. As a result of his performance, he was named the American Football Conference (AFC) Player of the Week. The next week, Zolak led his team to their second victory of the season against the New York Jets. He completed seven of 16 passes for 102yards, <b>getting</b> <b>help</b> from Jon Vaughn who had 110 rushing yards, and the Patriots won, 243. However, the following week's performance against the Atlanta Falcons was less impressive. He completed nine of 16 passes for 58yards and two interceptions in the Patriots' losing effort, and he said it felt like he was [...] "on a desert island by myself." [...] After Zolak's performance against Atlanta, he lost the starting job, and Millen again filled that role. However, Millen suffered a shoulder injury against the Colts, and after Zolak played part of the game against Indianapolis, he again became the starter for the game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Zolak injured his ankle {{at the end of the}} third quarter, making the appearance against Kansas City his last for the season as Jeff Carlson took over quarterbacking duties. Zolak finished the season with 52 pass completions in 100 attempts, 561yards, two touchdowns, four interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 58.8.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{inspired}} by the film Ordinary People, Chapman returned to Hawaii, telling his wife he had been obsessed with killing Lennon. He showed her the gun and bullets {{but she did not}} inform the police or mental health services. He made an appointment to see a clinical psychologist but before it occurred he flew back to New York on December 6, 1980. At one point, he considered committing suicide by jumping from the Statue of Liberty. Chapman says the message [...] "Thou Shalt Not Kill" [...] flashed on the TV at him and was also on a wall hanging put up by his wife in their apartment.

"You have at {{all events}} taken your share in using good {{practical}} precautions for the town, {{and that is}} the best mode of asking for protection," [...] said Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken metaphor and bad logic of the banker's religion, somewhat increased by the apparent deafness of his sympathy. But his mind had taken up its long-prepared movement towards <b>getting</b> <b>help,</b> and was not yet arrested.

60|$|This doubt remained, {{because while}} {{the man and}} girl looked {{emaciated}} and also showed signs of having been long dead, the woman {{seemed to have been}} hardier, and had not quite lost the robustness of her form. Romola, kneeling, was about to lay her hand on the heart; but as she lifted the piece of yellow woollen drapery that lay across the bosom, she saw the purple spots which marked the familiar pestilence. Then it struck her that if the villagers knew of this, she might have more difficulty than she had expected in <b>getting</b> <b>help</b> from them; they would perhaps shrink from her with that child in her arms.

6000|$|Meantime {{the spirit}} of enquiry and faith was making-marked progress. Mr. Codrington says: 'The stir in {{the hearts and minds}} of those already christened might be called a revival, and the enquiring and earnest spirit of many more seemed to be working towards conversions. During this time, there might be seen on the cliff or under the trees in the afternoon, or on Sundays, little groups {{gathered}} round some of the elder Christians, enquiring and <b>getting</b> <b>help.</b> It was the work that George evidently was enabled to do in this way that convinced everyone that the time had quite come for his Ordination. It is worth mentioning that the boys from one island, and one individual in particular, were much influenced by the last conversations of the first Christian who died here (Walter Hotaswol), who had told his friends to be [...] "sure that all the Bishop had told them was true."' ...|$|E

It's what he does that's wrong and makes me so unhappy. And then he 's always threatenin' to cut my throat if I leave him. It's all the drink, and things preying on his mind; he 's not a bad man really. Sometimes he'll speak quite kind to me, but I've stood so much from him, I don't feel it in me to speak kind back, but just keep myself to myself. And he's all right with the children too, except when he's not himself.|$|E

[...] "Motor smash" [...] told the nature of the accident. [...] "Help--cops" [...] told the urgency of the case and the need of police aid.

6000|$|The great shrubby nettle (Urtica crenulata) {{is common}} here: this plant, called [...] "Mealum-ma," [...] attains fifteen feet in height; it has broad glossy leaves, and though {{apparently}} without stings, {{is held in}} so great dread,* [The stinging hairs are microscopic, and confined to the young shoots, leaf and flower-stalks. Leschenault de la Tour describes being stung by this nettle on three fingers of his hand only at the Calcutta Botanical Gardens, and the subsequent sneezing and running at the nose, followed by tetanic symptoms and two days' suffering, nor did the effects disappear for nine days. It is a remarkable fact that the plant stings violently only at this season. I frequently gathered it with impunity on subsequent occasions, and suspected some inaccuracy in my observations; but in Silhet both Dr. Thomson and I experienced the same effects in autumn. Endlicher ("Lindley's Vegetable Kingdom") attributes the causticity of nettle-juice to bicarbonate of ammonia, which Dr. Thomson and I ascertained was certainly not present in this species.] that I had difficulty in <b>getting</b> <b>help</b> to cut it down. I gathered many specimens without allowing any part to touch my skin; still the scentless effluvium was so powerful, that mucous matter poured from my eyes and nose {{all the rest of}} the afternoon, in such abundance, that I had to hold my head over a basin for an hour. The sting is very virulent, producing inflammation; and to punish a child with [...] "Mealum-ma" [...] is the severest Lepcha threat.
