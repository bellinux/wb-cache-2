I should have explained that I didn't suspect them of any desire to launch an attack on us. This was right after the war, and it was absurd to suppose {{that they were going to}} turn around and attack the United States. I didn't think I needed to explain that, but <b>I</b> <b>obviously</b> should have done it.|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Sevigny won a Golden Globe {{award for}} Best Supporting Actress– Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her {{performance}} in the third season of Big Love. The series itself also received nominations in two other categories. During a press conference following the award win, Sevigny addressed the repressed women living in the fundamentalist Mormon compounds: [...] "These women are kept extremely repressed. They should be helped. They don't even know who {{the president of the}} United States is." [...] In addition, she had various screening credits that year: Sevigny landed major roles in two independent comedy films: Barry Munday and Mr. Nice in Munday, Sevigny plays the sister of a homely woman who is expecting a child by a recently castrated womanizer (opposite Patrick Wilson and Judy Greer); in Mr. Nice, she had a leading role as British marijuana-trafficker Howard Marks' wife, alongside Rhys Ifans; the film was based on Marks' autobiography of the same name. In a later interview with The A.V. Club, Sevigny was asked if she felt that the show's message was that polygamy was [...] "wrong". In response, Sevigny stated: [...] "No, absolutely not. I think there are more parallels to gay rights and alternative lifestyles within Big Love—more so than 'Polygamy is wrong'. I think they actually condone people who decide to live this lifestyle outside of fundamentalist sects." [...] During the same interview, Sevigny stated her disappointment with the series' fourth season, calling it [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "very telenovela"—though she stated that she loves her character and the writing, she felt the show [...] "got away from itself". Sevigny later regretted making the statements, saying she was very [...] "exhausted" [...] and [...] "wasn't thinking about what [...] was saying"; she also apologized to the show's producers. [...] " [...] that I was biting the hand that feeds me, because <b>I</b> <b>obviously</b> love the show and have always been nothing but positive about it. And I didn't want anybody to misunderstand me or think that I wasn't, you know, appreciative." ...|$|E

[...] But, if I either affirm or deny {{in a case}} of this sort, I misuse my freedom of choice. [...] If I affirm what is false, I clearly err, and, if I stumble onto the truth, I'm still blameworthy since the light of nature reveals that a perception of the understanding should always precede a decision of the will. [...] In these misuses of freedom of choice lies the deprivation that accounts for error. [...] And this deprivation, I maintain, lies in the working of the will insofar as it comes from me — not in my God-given ability to will, or even in the will's operation insofar as it derives from Him.

2500|$|Lennon's {{inspiration}} for the song came when his son, Julian, showed him a nursery school drawing he called [...] "Lucy—in the Sky with Diamonds", depicting his classmate Lucy O'Donnell (later Lucy Vodden). Julian Lennon said, [...] "I don't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings, but <b>I</b> <b>obviously</b> had an affection for Lucy at that age. I used to show Dad everything I'd built or painted at school, and this one sparked off the idea..." [...] Vodden, in a BBC radio interview in 2007, said, [...] "I remember Julian and I both doing pictures on a double-sided easel, throwing paint at each other, much to {{the horror of the}} classroom attendant... Julian had painted a picture and on that particular day his father turned up with the chauffeur to pick him up from school." [...] O'Donnell died in 2009 at age 46 after suffering from lupus.|$|E

60|$|Till {{then the}} whole {{enterprise}} had been visionary. I gathered from Cynthia that the boy Ogden was shortly {{to be sent to}} a preparatory school, and that I was to insinuate myself into this school and, watching my opportunity, to remove him; but {{it seemed to me that}} the obstacles to this comparatively lucid scheme were insuperable. In the first place, how were we to discover which of England's million preparatory schools Mr Ford, or Mr Mennick for him, would choose? Secondly, the plot which was to carry me triumphantly into this school when--or if--found, struck me as extremely thin. I was to pose, Cynthia told me, as a young man of private means, anxious to learn the business, with a view to setting up a school of his own. The objection to that was, I held, that <b>I</b> <b>obviously</b> did not want to do anything of the sort. I had not the appearance of a man with such an ambition. I had none of the conversation of such a man.|$|E
