5|$|One {{strategy}} for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an <b>emetic</b> or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet {{sold in the}} UK which combined 500mg paracetamol with 100mg methionine, an amino acid formerly used {{in the treatment of}} paracetamol overdose.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{themes are}} {{expressed}} through the No-Face, who reflects the characters which surround him, learning by example {{and taking the}} traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bath house. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the <b>emetic</b> dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At {{the end of the}} film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, <b>emetic,</b> acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E

50|$|Salt {{water and}} mustard water {{have been used}} since ancient times as <b>emetics.</b> Care must be taken with salt, as {{excessive}} intake can potentially be harmful.|$|R
50|$|Early {{management}} of alert patients includes <b>emetics,</b> gastric lavage, and activated charcoal. Otherwise, management is by observation, including of vital signs, support and, only if necessary, considering {{the hazards of}} doing so, giving intravenous flumazenil.|$|R
5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and <b>emetic</b> to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E
5|$|Hipólito Vieytes {{was about}} to make a {{diplomatic}} mission to Britain, but Moreno requested that he should be given the appointment instead. Saavedra accepted immediately. He traveled to Britain with his brother Manuel Moreno and his secretary Tomás Guido, on the British schooner Fame. His health declined and there was no doctor on board, but the captain refused requests to land at some earlier port such as in Río de Janeiro (Brazil) or Cape Town (South Africa). The captain gave him an <b>emetic</b> in common use at that time, prepared with four grams of antimony potassium tartrate. Moreno had great convulsions as a consequence, and considered that in his state he could not have resisted more than the quarter of a gram. He died shortly afterwards. His body was wrapped in a Union Jack and thrown into the sea, after a volley of musketry.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Moreno speculated {{later that}} he was {{poisoned}} by the captain. Manuel Moreno was unsure of whether the captain really given him that substance, or if he substituted something else, or gave an even higher dose. Circumstances did not allow an autopsy to be performed. Further points used to sustain {{the idea of a}} murder are the captain's refusal to land elsewhere, his slow sailing, his administration of the <b>emetic</b> in secrecy, and that he didn't return to Buenos Aires with the ship. Enrique de Gandía pointed to an irregular ruling of the Junta that appointed a British person named Curtis as Moreno's replacement for the diplomatic mission in the case of Moreno's death. The son of Mariano Moreno commented to the historian Adolfo Saldías that his mother, Guadalupe Cuenca, received an anonymous gift of a mourning hand fan and handkerchief, with instructions to use them soon. By that time, the murder of Moreno was a common assumption, and it was mentioned during the trial of residence {{of the members of the}} Junta. Juan Madera stated at the trial that Moreno may have requested to go to Britain because he was afraid of being murdered, and that he may have stated this during the meeting when the Junta discussed his resignation. Modern author Manuel Luis Martín studied the health of both Moreno and his family, and concluded that he died of natural causes.|$|E
50|$|In 1902 {{all of the}} {{boarders}} at Abbott's Hotel were {{poisoned by}} eating tinned beetroot, many {{of the victims were}} given <b>emetics,</b> which were administered with much success. No fatalities were recorded from the incident.|$|R
5000|$|Anticholinergic agents such as Scopolamine (Hyoscine) {{are used}} as anti <b>emetics</b> as they relax smooth muscle and reduce {{gastrointestinal}} secretions by blockade of muscarinic receptors. They {{may be useful in}} the management of terminal bowel obstruction ...|$|R
25|$|Treatment of a {{recently}} ingested poison may involve gastric decontamination to decrease absorption. Gastric decontamination can involve activated charcoal, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or nasogastric aspiration. Routine use of <b>emetics</b> (syrup of Ipecac), cathartics or laxatives {{are no longer}} recommended.|$|R
25|$|The {{plant was}} widely known even in ancient times. For example, Lucretius (ca. 99 BCE – ca. 55 BCE) and Pliny the Elder (23 AD – August 25, 79) both knew of its {{medicinal}} <b>emetic</b> {{as well as}} deadly toxic properties.|$|E
25|$|During a {{recorded}} autonomic seizure, {{there was a}} small increase in blood pressure (+5/4mm Hg, systolic/diastolic), pronounced increases in heart rate (+59 bpm) and plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (+242 pg/mL), epinephrine (+175 pg/mL), and vasopressin (+22.1 pg/mL); serum glucose was also elevated (206mg/dL). The significant increase in plasma vasopressin may explain the <b>emetic</b> autonomic symptoms.|$|E
25|$|While {{the general}} method of {{production}} is known, not all details of the preparation and ceremonial usage of the black drink are. The source of the <b>emetic</b> effect of black drink is not known and has been speculated upon by historians, archaeologists, and botanists. Some professionals {{believe it to be}} caused by the addition of poisonous button snakeroot.|$|E
2500|$|Harlow's {{moderate}} (in {{the context}} of medical practice of the time) use of <b>emetics,</b> purgatives, and (in one instance) bleeding would have [...] "produced dehydration with reduction of intracranial pressure [...] may have favorably influenced {{the outcome of the}} case", according to Steegmann.|$|R
50|$|If iron {{phosphide}} is ingested, water must be {{consumed by the}} victim in order to dilute the {{iron phosphide}} and dampen its effects. Do not use <b>emetics.</b> Ipecac {{should not be used}} either. Ipecac can worsen and aggravate any iron-induced gastrointestinal irritation that may be occurring.|$|R
50|$|Masawaih al-Mardini was a Nestorian Christian. He {{is known}} {{due to his}} books on purgatives and <b>emetics</b> (De medicins laxativis) and on the {{complete}} pharmacopoeia in 12 parts called the Antidotarium sive Grabadin medicamentorum, which remained for centuries the standard textbook of pharmacy in the West.|$|R
25|$|Plants {{used by the}} Ojibwe include Agrimonia gryposepala, {{used for}} urinary problems, and pinus strobus, the resin of which was used to treat infections and gangrene. The roots of Symphyotrichum novae-angliae are smoked in pipes to attract game. Allium tricoccum is eaten as part of Ojibwe cuisine. They also use a {{decoction}} as a quick-acting <b>emetic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The root {{is known}} to be a {{powerful}} <b>emetic.</b> A proteolytic enzyme known as pedilanthain can be extracted from the plant's latex, and has been shown in experiments to be effective against intestinal worms and to reduce inflammation when ingested. In 1995, a galactose-specific lectin was purified from the plant's latex, and indications are that it might be useful in combatting diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|Mandragora {{species have}} a long use in {{traditional}} medicine, an extract being used for its real or supposed aphrodisiac, hypnotic, <b>emetic,</b> purgative, sedative and pain-killing effects. Tropane alkaloids {{are known to be}} effective as analgesics and anaesthetics, and can be used to increase circulation and dilate pupils, among other effects. Continued use of M.autumnalis in folk medicine was reported in Sicily in 2014.|$|E
50|$|The {{initiating}} Inyanga first eats black impepo, to {{take away}} dimness from the inner sight, then white impepo. White impepo is used to maintain trueness of inner sight after the black impepo. Both are <b>emetics.</b> The Inyanga sleeps with black impepo (under the head) to make the dreams clear and true.|$|R
50|$|Drugs {{affecting}} {{the central nervous}} system include: Psychedelics, hypnotics, anaesthetics, antipsychotics, eugeroics, antidepressants (including tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium salts, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)), antiemetics, Anticonvulsants/antiepileptics, anxiolytics, barbiturates, movement disorder (e.g., Parkinson's disease) drugs, stimulants (including amphetamines), benzodiazepines, cyclopyrrolones, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines, cholinergics, anticholinergics, <b>emetics,</b> cannabinoids, and 5-HT (serotonin) antagonists.|$|R
5000|$|From ancient times, {{humans have}} used cardiac-glycoside-containing plants and their crude {{extracts}} as arrow coatings, homicidal or suicidal aids, rat poisons, heart tonics, diuretics and <b>emetics,</b> {{primarily due to}} the toxic nature of these compounds.  US poison centers reported 2632 cases regarding digotoxin toxicity, and 17 cases regarding digotoxin-related deaths in 2008.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, Gundelia is used {{to treat}} {{a wide variety of}} ailments such as liver diseases, diabetes, chest pain, heart attacks, pain in the chest and the stomack, leukoderma, {{diarrhea}} and bronchitis. In addition hypoglycaemic, laxative, sedative, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasite, antiseptic and <b>emetic</b> effects have been claimed, as well as improvement of the gums and curing spleen enlargement. Proven effects include antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, antiplatelet and cholesterol suppression.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{created a}} sensation throughout the country. The ice tea was never analyzed so the exact drug was not known. There was speculation that tartar <b>emetic</b> or arsenic was the poison. There were also rumors that Hoboken, New Jersey gamblers knew {{in advance that}} Courtney would be poisoned. Betting on the race changed from Courtney being a slight favorite to Riley becoming a heavy favorite {{on the day of}} the race.|$|E
25|$|Autonomic {{seizures}} and autonomic status epilepticus as {{occur in}} Panayiotopoulos syndrome {{have not been}} described in other epileptic syndromes in that sequence though 10–20 per cent of children with the same seizure semiology may have cerebral pathology. The major problem is to recognize <b>emetic</b> and other autonomic manifestations as seizure events and not to dismiss them or erroneously to consider them as unrelated to the ictus and a feature of encephalitis, migraine, syncope or gastro-enteritis.|$|E
60|$|General Remarks.--Travellers are apt {{to expect}} too much from their medicines, {{and to think that}} savages will hail them as demigods {{wherever}} they go. But their patients are generally cripples who want to be made whole in a moment, and other suchlike impracticable cases. Powerful <b>emetics,</b> purgatives, and eyewashes are the most popular physickings.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the main}} {{building}} were two gardens for the exercise of the less disturbed inmates, one for men and another for women. More dangerous residents were kept inside, or in their cells. The treatment regime consisted of cold plunge baths, and {{a focus on the}} gastrointestinal system with the administration of anti-spasmodics, <b>emetics</b> (to induce vomiting) and purgatives.|$|R
50|$|There is {{no known}} {{antidote}} for pennyroyal toxicity. Case studies involving pennyroyal poisonings have reported {{the use of}} gastric lavages and administration of <b>emetics,</b> or vomiting inducing agents, like activated charcoal. As glutathione depletion {{has been shown to}} regulate liver toxification, administration of N-acetylcysteine in similar doses as given for acetaminophen toxicity have been given to patients.|$|R
25|$|First {{used as a}} {{treatment}} for Parkinson's disease as early as 1951, its clinical use was first reported in 1970 by Cotzias et al., although its <b>emetic</b> properties and short half-life made oral use impractical. A later study found that combining the drug with the antiemetic domperidone improved results significantly. The commercialization of apomorphine for Parkinson's disease followed its successful use in patients with refractory motor fluctuations using intermittent rescue injections and continuous infusions.|$|E
25|$|In Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} {{there is}} a diffuse multifocal cortical hyperexcitability, which is age (maturation)-related. This diffuse epileptogenicity may be unequally distributed, predominating in one area, which is often posterior. Epileptic discharges in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, irrespective of their location at onset, activate <b>emetic</b> and autonomic centers prior to any other conventional neocortical seizure manifestations. An explanation {{for this is that}} children are susceptible to autonomic disorders as illustrated by the cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is a nonepileptic condition specific to childhood.|$|E
25|$|Black drink is {{consumed}} to purify an individual by removing spiritual and physical contamination and, as such, is never taken casually. The preparation and protocols vary between tribes and ceremonial grounds. The full formula is not published or given to outsiders, but a prominent ingredient is the roasted leaves and stems of Ilex vomitoria (commonly known as yaupon holly), a plant {{native to the}} Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Black drink usually contains <b>emetic</b> herbs, which has been recorded as inducing vomiting.|$|E
50|$|However, {{around this}} time, Hahnemann {{was engaged in}} a dispute, often acrimonious, {{with most of the}} homeopaths in Leipzig, over the mixing of homeopathic and allopathic methods ("venesection, leeches, <b>emetics,</b> laxatives, etc."). Hahnemann was {{concerned}} to fight any kind of co-option by the prevailing medical system. Indeed, one of his major opponents in German medicine more generally was Hufeland, a very influential figure at the time.|$|R

He threw the cruet in the dustbin--where I found it, along with other silver--for {{the sake of a}} {{burglary}} blind. But if you look at that pepper-pot I put on the table, you'll see a small hole. That's where Cray's bullet struck, shaking up the pepper and making the criminal sneeze." ...|$|R
25|$|Cherokee black drink {{is taken}} for {{purification}} at several traditional ceremonies. Made with <b>emetics,</b> the complete recipe is not {{shared with the}} public. The black drink induces vomiting for purification purposes. Other ritual medicinal beverages are also used in the ceremonies. Ilex vomitoria was not native to the traditional area controlled by the Cherokee before removal, but it {{was brought in to}} the area through trade and then transplanted.|$|R
