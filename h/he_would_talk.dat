25|$|During Annual Q Event Direct Line with Vladimir Putin, Alexey Venediktov asked Putin to name {{a street}} in Moscow after the singer Vladimir Vysotsky, who is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} greatest Russian artists and yet almost 30 years after his death, no street in Russian capital was named after him. Venediktov stated a Russian law that allowed to President to do so and promote a law suggestion {{to name a}} street by decree. Putin answered that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to Mayor of Moscow and will solve this problem. In July 2015 former Upper and Lower Tagansky Dead-ends (Верхний и Нижний Таганские тупики) in Moscow were reorganized into Vladimir Vysotsky Street.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{election}} results saw Fine Gael win {{seats at the}} expense of the smaller parties and independents. The proportion of votes only increased significantly for Fine Gael, and increased slightly for both the Green Party and Sinn Féin, despite their disappointing seat totals. Negotiations began the following week for the formation of the new government, with Bertie Ahern stating that his preferred option was for a coalition of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and like-minded independents. The Fine Gael leader and Leader of the Opposition, Enda Kenny, did not rule out forming an alternative government, stating that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to all parties except Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin. The election for Taoiseach took place in the Dáil on 14 June 2007 with Bertie Ahern becoming Taoiseach again.|$|E
500|$|While {{campaigning in}} March 2007, Biden {{stated that he}} would put a great {{quantity}} of focus on the first Southern primary state of South Carolina as a strategy. While speaking to rural audiences Biden noted {{that the war in}} Iraq continued to be an important facet of his campaign agenda. He said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to Independent voters to convince them to propel him to the nomination stating that if [...] "the Democratic nominee cannot attract independents, Democrats cannot win". Biden would later drop out of the race before the South Carolina primary would take place.|$|E

500|$|Stevens left {{a lasting}} legacy on the NHL. [...] Stevens {{was the longest}} reigning captain in Devils history. Later on in his career, he mentored the younger Devils defencemen like Colin White and Brian Rafalski, who was Stevens' {{defensive}} linemate. Longtime teammate Scott Niedermayer said Stevens was [...] "not the most vocal guy around", but <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to players when it was necessary. Stevens was honored by the Devils by becoming the first player in team history to have his number retired by the team; his #4 was raised to the rafters on February 3, 2006. Additionally, the Kitchener Rangers have retired [...] #3 for Stevens.|$|E
500|$|Shahid Kapoor {{was born}} in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem. His parents {{divorced}} when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi {{with his mother and}} maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: [...] "He would walk me to school every single day. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to me about dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me." [...] His father, who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai, would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday. When Kapoor was 10, his mother, who was working as a dancer, moved to Mumbai to work as an actress.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{really had}} {{no option but to}} agree to do it, despite my {{reservations}} about working in television. Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I always heard 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E
6000|$|He brooded awhile, for, as I knew, {{this was}} a sore subject with him, one on which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rarely <b>talk.</b> Although <b>he</b> escaped himself, Quatermain had lost friends on that fatal field. He went on:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Synge {{must have}} read {{a great deal}} at one time, {{but he was not}} a man you would see often with a book in his hand; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sooner <b>talk,</b> or rather listen to talk--almost anyone's talk.|$|R

500|$|On January 17, 1908, Borglum's design {{received}} {{approval by}} the Sheridan monument commission, including then-Secretary of War William Howard Taft, General Henry C. Corbin, and Brigadier General Michael V. Sheridan, Philip Sheridan's brother. [...] Irene also approved the design and chose the memorial site. [...] She lived at 2211 Massachusetts Avenue NW (currently offices for the Embassy of Greece), {{a short distance from}} Sheridan Circle and the sculpture. [...] As Borglum worked on the sculpture, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to Sheridan's friends, sketch Sheridan's artifacts, and visit Irene. [...] Since Philip Jr. bore a very close resemblance to his father, Borglum used him {{as a model for the}} sculpture. [...] When the artwork was completed, Irene, Philip Jr., and Sheridan's three daughters loved the finished result. [...] The sculpture depicts Sheridan riding his horse, Rienzi, as he assembles his troops during the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19, 1864. [...] He had raced [...] from Winchester, Virginia, to reach the battle. [...] Following the Union victory, Sheridan renamed the horse Winchester. [...] After Winchester died in 1878, Sheridan had him preserved and mounted. [...] The horse is now on display at the National Museum of American History. [...] Congress paid for the plaza, base, and preparation of the memorial site, while veterans of the Army of the Cumberland paid for the statue. [...] Architect Henry Winslow designed the base and setting. [...] The stonework was provided by the Mohegan Granite Company of New York while the Malnati Stone Company of Washington, D.C. set the stones in place.|$|E
500|$|Lost {{was planned}} to be a multi-cultural show with an {{international}} cast. The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable {{to go to the}} auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience. Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called The Beast, and was keen to have him on Lost. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army. Yunjin Kim originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several films. The producers were impressed with Kim's performance and wrote her the character of Sun, who was {{planned to be}} someone who could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it. Daniel Dae Kim was cast in the role of Jin, Sun's husband. Dae Kim described his audition as a [...] "really interesting experience". He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he had not spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to his parents.|$|E
2500|$|George Sidney {{described}} Thau as [...] "a {{very quiet}} man, a gentle man." [...] He {{would be brought}} in to calm down the performers when they got upset. He said, [...] "Benny spoke very quietly. You could almost never quite hear what he said. But <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to this one and that one and {{had the ability to}} calm things down.|$|E
5000|$|Shear {{was known}} for being very quiet. His wife Connie said, [...] "There were times, {{especially}} early in his career, when <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> to a soul. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> go to the track, unload the car, set a track record, win the feature, and leave." ...|$|R

2500|$|In the {{introduction}} to Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein mentions discussions with Sraffa over many years and says: [...] "I am indebted to this stimulus for the most consequential ideas in this book". In 1946, however, Sraffa broke off his weekly conversations with Wittgenstein over the latter's protests; and when the philosopher said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> about anything Sraffa wanted, [...] "'Yes', Sraffa replied, 'but in your way'".|$|E
2500|$|Jones is {{described}} as a socialite. He had a wide circle of well-connected friends in Cairo, about whom <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> at length. The American Colonel William H. Baumer, who met Jones in March 1943, described him as [...] "one of those who spends his every word trying to impress with his acquaintances and lists of names". Jones was father to the British racehorse trainer Harry Thomson Jones.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} events in March 2010, Abhisit Vejjajivas stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to the red shirt leadership, but not to Thaksin. He criticised Thaksin's wealth and extravagance, carving a {{contrast}} between the alleged opulence of the premier's house and the humbler, agrarian roots {{of many of the}} demonstrators. Shortly after, he also directly condemned his opponent's self-proclaimed affinity with the ordinary people, the [...] "phrai", arguing that Thaksin was far closer to the [...] "ammart", or the traditional elites in Thailand's army, bureaucracy, and political parties.|$|E
60|$|Lewis called. It is a {{good and}} good-humoured man, but pestilently prolix and {{paradoxical}} and personal [8]. If <b>he</b> <b>would</b> but <b>talk</b> half, and reduce his visits to an hour, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> add to his popularity. As an author he is very good, and his vanity is ouverte, like Erskine's, and yet not offending.|$|R
2500|$|On 15 January 2009, Mugabe {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> hold <b>talks</b> with Tsvangirai again within a week.

50|$|Middelkamp {{ended his}} career in 1951, when he bought a pub in Kieldrecht. For a long time, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> to journalists about his cycling years, until he spoke about his famous 1936 stage win in a {{television}} program in 2003. Middelkamp died in 2005.|$|R
2500|$|During a {{subsequent}} meeting between President Johnson, King Hussein, and Secretary of State Rusk, Hussein said the phrasing {{of the resolution}} calling for withdrawal from occupied territories could be interpreted to mean that the Egyptians should withdraw from Gaza and the Jordanians should withdraw from the West Bank. He said this possibility was evident from a speech given by Prime Minister Eshkol in which it had been claimed that both Gaza and the West Bank had been [...] "occupied territory". The President agreed, and promised <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to Ambassador Goldberg about inserting Israel in that clause. Ambassador Goldberg told King Hussein that after taking into account legitimate Arab concerns and suggestions, the US {{would be willing to}} add the word [...] "Israeli" [...] before [...] "Armed Forces" [...] in the first operative paragraph.|$|E
2500|$|Moskvin {{has stated}} that he felt great sympathy for the dead {{children}} and felt {{that they could be}} brought back to life by either science or black magic. He enclosed the remains in the dolls in an attempt to give them functional bodies to be used when he eventually discovered a way to bring them back to life, feeling that their physical remains were too decayed and ugly for them to feel comfortable or happy. Moskvin claims to have been aware that he was committing a crime, but felt the dead children were [...] "calling out" [...] to him, begging to be rescued. He believed that rescuing the children was more important than obeying the law. He was also motivated by his own desire to have children, specifically a daughter. Moskvin often regretted that he never had children and at one point attempted to adopt a young girl against the wishes of his parents, but his application was declined due to his low income. Moskvin denied any sexual attraction to the dolls and instead considered them to be his children. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to and interact with the corpses, sing songs to them, watch cartoons with them, and even hold birthday parties and celebrate holidays for their benefit.|$|E

60|$|Twice a day {{for many}} days this youth came to my cell with food, and ever the same {{greetings}} from Zat Arrras. For a long time I tried to engage him in conversation upon other matters, but <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk,</b> and so, at length, I desisted.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{there never}} was, in modern days, such wine. Flush, to whom I offered the last drop in my glass, {{felt it was}} supernatural, and ran away. I have an idea {{that if he had}} drunk that drop, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>talked</b> afterwards--either Greek or English.|$|R

60|$|It {{was from}} Mallory Tompkins that Pupkin learned {{all about the}} Mariposa people, because Pupkin came from away off--somewhere down in the Maritime Provinces--and didn't know a soul. Mallory Tompkins used {{to tell him about}} Judge Pepperleigh, and what a wonderfully clever man he was and how <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been in the Supreme Court for certain if the Conservative Government had stayed in another fifteen or twenty years instead of coming to a {{premature}} end. He used to talk so much about the Pepperleighs, that Pupkin was sick of the very name. But just as soon as he had seen Zena Pepperleigh he couldn't hear enough of them. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> have <b>talked</b> with Tompkins for hours about the judge's dog Rover. And as for Zena, if he could have brought her name over his lips, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>talked</b> of her forever.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not easy}} to {{understand}} him, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> of home, was brief about his little Catharine; and when Clara said something of Isabel's writings, formerly his great pride, and feared that she would have no more time for them, his blunt answer was, 'She ought not.' ...|$|R
