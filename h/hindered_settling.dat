It was demonstrated that the addition of polymer flocculants helped all three clay types to settle due to the polymer bridging effect.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for relating suspension batch settling data (settling height vs time) to model settling flux functions is presented. The approach exploits a new closed-form solution relating settling height {{and time for}} a very simple functional form of the settling flux. The simple form in question employs a so-called <b>hindered</b> <b>settling</b> factor (a key material property in suspension rheology) that is taken to be a straight-line function of the solids fraction. The closed-form solution for settling height and time has a parametric dependence on the slope and intercept of the above-mentioned (straight line) <b>hindered</b> <b>settling</b> property: thus a functional relationship between batch settling height and suspension material property parameters is established. Moreover by adjusting the slope and intercept parameters, the closed-form solutions for settling height vs time can be matched to batch settling experimental data, and thereby the settling flux can be directly obtained. Unlike classical approaches for determining settling flux functions from batch settling data (i. e. Kynch theory), nowhere does the new approach require data for settling velocity: this gives it an in-built robustness to experimental noise compared to any approach that obtains experimental settling velocities via finite differences of settling heights, since such velocities tend {{to be far more}} noisy than the settling heights themselves. In a typical physical system, a straight-line relationship between <b>hindered</b> <b>settling</b> factor and solids volume fraction will only be a reasonable approximation over a very restricted domain of solids fraction. However, over a wider domain, it is possible to approximate the <b>hindered</b> <b>settling</b> factor vs solids fraction dependence via a sequence of straight-line relations, each taken over a narrow interval of solids fraction. A functional form for settling flux is thereby obtained, useful for suspension dewatering calculations and engineering equipment design for suspension/sludge processing.

40|$|Debris flows are {{typically}} a saturated mixture of poorly sorted particles and interstitial fluid, whose {{density and flow}} properties depend strongly {{on the presence of}} suspended fine sediment. Recent research suggests that grain size distribution (GSD) influences excess pore pressures (i. e., pressure in excess of predicted hydrostatic pressure), which in turn plays a governing role in debris flow behaviors. We report a series of controlled laboratory experiments in a 4 [*]m diameter vertically rotating drum where the coarse particle size distribution and the content of fine particles were varied independently. We measured basal pore fluid pressures, pore fluid pressure profiles (using novel sensor probes), velocity profiles, and longitudinal profiles of the flow height. Excess pore fluid pressure was significant for mixtures with high fines fraction. Such flows exhibited lower values for their bulk flow resistance (as measured by surface slope of the flow), had damped fluctuations of normalized fluid pressure and normal stress, and had velocity profiles where the shear was concentrated {{at the base of the}} flow. These effects were most pronounced in flows with a wide coarse GSD distribution. Sustained excess fluid pressure occurred during flow and after cessation of motion. Various mechanisms may cause dilation and contraction of the flows, and we propose that the sustained excess fluid pressures during flow and once the flow has stopped may arise from <b>hindered</b> particle <b>settling</b> and yield strength of the fluid, resulting in transfer of particle weight to the fluid. Thus, debris flow behavior may be strongly influenced by sustained excess fluid pressures controlled by particle settling rates...|$|R

Grain-size breaks are common features in turbidites around the world, including {{ancient and modern}} systems. Despite their widespread occurrence, grain-size breaks have been regarded as exceptional, and not included within idealized models of turbidity current deposition. This study uses ca 100 shallow sediment cores, from the Moroccan Turbidite System, to map out five turbidite beds for distances in excess of 2000 km. The vertical and spatial distributions of grain-size breaks within these beds are examined. Five different types of grain-size break are found: Type I - in proximal areas between coarse sand and finer grained structureless sand; Type II - in proximal areas between inversely graded sand overlain by finer sand; Type III - in proximal areas between sand overlain by ripple cross-laminated finer sand; Type IV - throughout the system between clean sand and mud; and Type V - in distal areas between mud-rich (debrite) sand and mud. This article interprets Types I and V as being generated by sharp vertical concentration boundaries, controlled by sediment and clay concentrations within the flows, whilst Types II and III are interpreted as products of spatial/temporal fluctuations in flow capacity. Type IV are interpreted {{as the product of}} fluid mud layers, which <b>hinder</b> the <b>settling</b> of non-cohesive grains and bypasses them down slope. Decelerating suspensions with sufficient clay will always form cohesive layers near to bed, promoting the generation of Type IV grain-size breaks.

One is the commonly used ideal settler, or point settler, which is assumed to never be overloaded and to have unlimited flux capacity. The other recently published steady-state settler model includes <b>hindered</b> and compressive <b>settling,</b> and models a realistic limiting flux capacity. Generally, the steady-state concentration profiles within the PFR and the settler are governed by nonlinear ordinary differential equations. It is shown that the steady-state behaviour of the ASP can, however, be captured by equations without derivatives. New theoretical results are given, such as conditions by means of inequalities on input variables and parameters for a steady-state solution to exist. Another novel finding is that, if the incoming substrate concentration is increased from a low or moderate stationary value and the solids residence time is kept fixed, then {{this results in a}} lower effluent concentration in the new steady state. The steady-state equations are solved numerically for different operating conditions. For common parameter values, numerical solutions reveal that an ASP having a PFR, instead of a continuously stirred tank reactor, is far more efficient in reducing the effluent substrate concentration and this can be obtained for much lower recycle ratios, which reduces the pumping energy considerably...|$|R
