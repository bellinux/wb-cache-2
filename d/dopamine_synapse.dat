40|$|Synaptic {{release of}} {{dopamine}} in the nucleus accumbens of the intact rat brain elicited {{by a single}} electrical impulse applied to ascending dopaminergic fibers results in extracellular concentrations sufficient to bind the known dopamine receptors. The dopamine concentration observed after four rapid, sequential pulses is exactly four times greater and is unaffected by pharmacological antagonism of dopamine uptake and receptor sites at supramaximal concentrations. Thus, dopamine efflux from the synaptic cleft is not restricted by binding to intrasynaptic proteins on the time scale of the measurements (50 - 100 msec). The extracellular concentration, {{as a result of}} a single stimulus pulse, is 0. 25 mu M and is rapidly removed by extrasynaptic uptake. This maximal, transient concentration of dopamine is 60 times higher than steady-state concentrations reported previously using dialysis techniques, illustrating that dopamine extracellular concentrations are spatially and temporally heterogenous. In contrast to ACh transmission at the neuromuscular junction, the <b>dopamine</b> <b>synapse</b> in the telencephalon is designed for the effective efflux of dopamine from the synaptic cleft to the extrasynaptic compartment during neurotransmission...|$|E
40|$|The euphoric {{response}} to equivalent doses of intravenous methylphenidate (MTP) was assessed {{in a group}} of 13 Parkinsonian patients affected by major depression, {{in a group of}} 11 nondepressed Parkinsonians, in a group of 14 nonparkinsonian subjects suffering from major depression, and finally in a group of 12 controls with no CNS or psychiatric disease.

Parkinsonian patients with major depression exhibited a significant lack of sensitivity to the euphoriant effects of MTP, in comparison with the other three groups.

40|$|The major {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} neuroleptic {{action of the}} tridecapeptide neurotensin (NT) {{appears to be an}} interaction with dopamine receptor mechanisms based on biochemical binding and behavioral experiments. In vivo microdialysis was used in conscious rats to investigate the effects of local perfusion with NT on the sensitivity of striatal dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors for their selective agonists by monitoring extracellular dopamine, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanilic acid, and gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the awake unrestrained male rat. Perfusion with NT (10 nM) counteracted the inhibitory effects of the dopamine D 2 agonist pergolide (500 nM) on extracellular levels of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid. In contrast, NT (10 mM) significantly enhanced the reduction of extracellular striatal levels of dopamine after perfusion with the D 1 agonist SKF 38393 (5 microM), and this combined treatment also resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} extracellular striatal levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid. These results provide in vivo evidence that NT regulates central dopamine transmission by reducing pre-and postsynaptic dopamine D 2 and enhancing D 1 receptor sensitivity possibly through an antagonistic NT receptor-D 2 receptor interaction. This heteroregulation has the potential to substantially increase the plasticity within the <b>dopamine</b> <b>synapse...</b>|$|E

40|$|LRRK 2 {{mutations}} produce end-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) {{with reduced}} nigrostriatal dopamine, whereas, asymptomatic carriers have increased dopamine turnover and altered brain connectivity. LRRK 2 pathophysiology remains unclear, but reduced dopamine and mitochondrial abnormalities occur in aged G 2019 S mutant knock-in (GKI) mice.

Young GKI mice exhibit more vertical exploration, elevated glutamate and dopamine transmission, and aberrant D 2 -receptor responses. These phenomena decline with age, but are stable in littermates. In young GKI mice, dopamine transients are slower, independent of dopamine transporter (DAT), increasing the lifetime of extracellular dopamine. Slowing of dopamine transients is observed with age in littermates, suggesting premature ageing of <b>dopamine</b> <b>synapses</b> in GKI mice. Thus, GKI mice exhibit early, but declining, synaptic and behavioral phenotypes, making them amenable to investigation of early pathophysiological, and later parkinsonian-like, alterations.

40|$|Dopamine neurons play a {{key role}} in normal and {{pathological}} cog-nitive processes as well as in the effects of certain drugs of addiction. Models of the synapses of such neurons include transporter mecha-nisms and reaction dynamics. We focus attention on the fundamental reaction which converts tyrosine to DOPA, which involves a cofactor. The Michaelis-Menten formula for the rate of an enzymatic reaction is modified by the presence of cofactors, which may be either essential or non-essential. In the essential case, the reaction rate is found to de-pend on the relative magnitudes of the concentrations of the primary enzyme and the cofactor. The case of a non-essential cofactor is more complex and it is shown how this leads to reaction rate formulas which depend explicitly on the concentrations of the enzyme and cofactor. The speed of reaction formulas are applied to the above-mentioned re-action with tyrosine hydroxylase as enzyme and biopterin as cofactor. The results are useful in constructing accurate models of <b>dopamine</b> <b>synapses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Midbrain {{dopamine}} neurons project densely to the striatum {{and form}} so-called dopamine synapses on medium spiny neurons (MSNs), principal neurons in the striatum. Because dopamine receptors are widely expressed away from dopamine synapses, {{it remains unclear}} how dopamine synapses are involved in dopaminergic transmission. Here we demonstrate that dopamine synapses are contacts formed between dopaminergic presynaptic and GABAergic postsynaptic structures. The presynaptic structure expressed tyrosine hydroxylase, vesicular monoamine transporter- 2, and plasmalemmal dopamine transporter, which are essential for dopamine synthesis, vesicular filling, and recycling, but was below the detection threshold for molecules involving GABA synthesis and vesicular filling or for GABA itself. In contrast, the postsynaptic structure of dopamine synapses expressed GABAergic molecules, including postsynaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin- 2, postsynaptic scaffolding molecule gephyrin, and GABA(A) receptor alpha 1, without any specific clustering of dopamine receptors. Of these, neuroligin- 2 promoted presynaptic differentiation in axons of midbrain dopamine neurons and striatal GABAergic neurons in culture. After neuroligin- 2 knockdown in the striatum, a significant decrease of dopamine synapses coupled with a reciprocal increase of GABAergic synapses was observed on MSN dendrites. This finding suggests that neuroligin- 2 controls striatal synapse formation by giving competitive advantage to heterologous dopamine synapses over conventional GABAergic synapses. Considering that MSN dendrites are preferential targets of dopamine synapses and express high levels of dopamine receptors, <b>dopamine</b> <b>synapse</b> formation may serve to increase the specificity and potency of dopaminergic modulation of striatal outputs by anchoring dopamine release sites to dopamine-sensing targets...|$|E
40|$|The four studies {{presented}} in this thesis independently provided support for a dynamic multilevel account for anxiety-related phenomena (see Table 2). Study 1 showed how medial prefrontal cortex activity (i. e., Structure Level) measured with EEG was related to heart rate (PNS Level) and provided some evidence that this association was dynamically linked to trait anxiety: in conditions of negative but not positive feedback did trait anxiety increase the link between cortical and cardiac activity. This modulation {{is consistent with the}} functional definition of anxiety given that negative but not positive feedback is normally associated with increased danger in the future. Study 2 showed how dopaminergic genes (Molecule Level) and manipulations of <b>dopamine</b> (<b>Synapse</b> Level) presumably affected network states (Network Level), which then influenced brain activity at the AMC (Structure Level) and error-related behavior (Whole System Level). The unexpected finding that trait-anxiety was not related to error monitoring in that study can be explained post hoc by task characteristics (Olvet & Hajcak, 2009), again suggesting that some patterns of multilevel interactions are dynamically linked to anxiety. Study 3 tested individuals with GAD (manifest at the Whole System Level) using a neuropsychological test designed to measure future-orientation in patients with damage of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Structure Level) and resulting impairments in neurovisceral connectivity (Bechara et al., 1997) thus affecting the CNS and PNS-Levels. Consistent with (a) the assumed future-orientation of anxiety and (b) increased neurovisceral connectivity in anxiety (Study 1) individuals with GAD performed better in the IGT than non-anxious control participants. Finally, Study 4 manipulated intracellular signalling cascades (Molecule Level), thereby modulating synaptic learning and extinction learning (Synapse Level), which then affected fear-related reflex potentiation (CNS-Level and Whole Systems Level). In contrast to prior studies that found improved extinction learning of hippocampus-dependent fear memory (e. g., fear conditioned to a place), Study 4 found that rolipram disturbed extinction learning of presumably hippocampus independent fear-memory (e. g., fear conditioned to a sound). Together with these other studies, Study 4 thus provides further evidence that situational characteristics (place vs. sound as cue for present danger) may influence various levels (including the Molecule Level) with regard to fear processing. As can be seen in Table 2, some studies covered different levels than others. Of course, the herein proposed subdivision into eight levels of organization should be seen as a flexible framework used for illustrating the multilevel perspective rather than as a rigid model. Future research may uncover that much more levels of organization are needed to explain certain phenomena, and there may also be cases when good predictions can be made based on fewer than eight levels. However, Table 2 also shows that guesses for most empty cells can be made based on existing theories and research findings. A critical exception may be the network level, and it has been noted by others that this level is underre{{presented in}} cognitive neuroscience research. However, the network level may be particularly critical for linking what we know about substances, cells, synapses and neurons (mostly based on in vitro work) to what we know about anxiety relevant structures (based on neuroimaging, EEG and lesion studies). From this perspective, future studies that include the neural network levels when investigating danger-reduction phenomena may be indispensable stations for achieving a wholistic understanding of fear and anxiety...|$|E

Here, recent epidemiological, neurophysiological and genetic advances are summarized to outline potential mechanisms involved. It {{is safe to say}} that dopaminergic drugs, particularly dopamine agonists, are able to induce ICDs only in a minority of patients, while the majority are somehow protected from this adverse effect. While it seems clear that men with early-onset PD are more vulnerable, other predisposing factors, such as various current or pre-PD personality traits, are a matter of debate. In terms of neurophysiological advances, one may find striking analogies to the addiction literature suggesting a causal chain beginning with certain predisposing conditions of striatal <b>dopamine</b> <b>synapses,</b> an “unnatural” increase of dopamine stimulation and a characteristic pattern of resulting functional changes in remote networks of appetitive drive and impulse control.

40|$|Dopamine {{is a major}} {{neurotransmitter}} in {{the central}} nervous system, and its receptors {{are associated with a}} number of neuropathological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Although the precise pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains unknown, the dopaminergic hypothesis of the illness assumes that the illness results from excessive activity at <b>dopamine</b> <b>synapses</b> in the brain. Because, at present, the diagnosis of schizophrenia relies on descriptive behavioral and symptomatic information, a peripheral measurable marker may enable a simpler, more rapid, and more accurate diagnosis and monitoring. In recent years, human peripheral blood lymphocytes have been found to express several dopamine receptors (D 3, D 4, and D 5) by using molecular biology techniques and binding assays. It has been suggested that these dopamine receptors found on lymphocytes may reflect receptors found in the brain. Here we demonstrate a correlation between the D 3 dopamine receptor on lymphocytes and schizophrenia and show a significant elevation of at least 2 -fold in the mRNA level of the D 3, but not of the D 4, dopamine receptor in schizophrenic patients. This increase is not affected by different antipsychotic drug treatments (typical or atypical). Moreover, nonmedicated patients exhibit the same pattern, indicating that this change is not a result of medical treatment. We propose the D 3 receptor mRNA on blood lymphocytes as a marker for identification and followup of schizophrenia...|$|R

50|$|The D2sh {{autoreceptor}} {{interacts with}} the trace amine-assorted receptor 1 (TAAR1), a recently discovered GPCR, to regulate monoaminergic systems in the brain. Active TAAR1 opposes the autoreceptor's activity by inactivating the dopamine transporter (DAT). In their review of TAAR1 in monoaminergic systems, Xie and Miller proposed this schematic: synaptic dopamine binds to the dopamine autoreceptor, which activates the DAT. Dopamine enters the presynaptic cells and binds to TAAR1, which increases adenylyl cyclase activity. This eventually allows for the translation of trace amines in the cytoplasm and activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, which further activate TAAR1 and dump <b>dopamine</b> into the <b>synapse.</b> Through a series of phosphorylation events related to PKA and PKC, active TAAR1 inactivates DAT, preventing uptake of <b>dopamine</b> from the <b>synapse.</b> The presence of two presynaptic receptors with opposite abilities to regulate monoamine transporter function allows for regulation of the monoaminergic system.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nicotine}} on dopamine transmission from mesostriatal dopamine neurons {{are central to}} its reinforcing properties. Only recently however, has the influence of presynaptic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) on dopaminergic axon terminals within striatum begun to be understood. Here, rather than simply enhancing (or inhibiting) dopamine release, nAChRs perform {{the role of a}} presynaptic filter, whose influence on dopamine release probability depends on presynaptic activity in dopaminergic as well as cholinergic neurons. Both mesostriatal dopaminergic neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons play key roles in motivational and sensorimotor processing by the basal ganglia. Moreover, it appears that the striatal influence of dopamine and ACh cannot be fully appreciated without an understanding of their reciprocal interactions. We will review the powerful filtering by nAChRs of striatal dopamine release and discuss its dependence on activity in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. We will also review how nicotine, acting via nAChR desensitization, promotes the sensitivity of <b>dopamine</b> <b>synapses</b> to activity. This filtering action might provide a mechanism through which nicotine promotes how burst activity in dopamine neurons facilitates goal-directed behaviour and reinforcement processing. More generally, it indicates that we should not restrict our view of presynaptic nAChRs to simply enhancing neurotransmitter release. We will also summarize current understanding of the forms and functions of the diverse nAChRs purported to exist on dopaminergic axons. A greater understanding of nAChR form and function is imperative to guide the design of ligands with subtype-selective efficacy for improved therapeutic interventions in nicotine addiction as well as Parkinson's disease...|$|R

Further progress was achieved by the introduction of 6 -hydroxydopamine as a tool for performing specific lesions, leading to the first stereotaxic mapping of the monoamine pathways in the rat brain by Urban Ungerstedt at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Unilateral intracerebral injections with 6 -hydroxydopamine led to the proposal of ‘Rotational Behaviour’, as a classical model for screening drugs useful for alleviating Parkinson’s disease and other neuropathologies. The direction of the rotational behaviour induced by drugs administrated to lesioned rats reveals their mechanisms of action on <b>dopamine</b> <b>synapses,</b> as demonstrated when rotational behaviour was combined with microdialysis. The model was useful for proposing a role of dopamine receptors in the gating of the flow of information through different efferent pathways of the basal ganglia. It is established now that the coupling of dopamine receptors is regulated by a number of proteins acting as GTPases, the regulators of G-protein signalling (RGS) family. More than 20 RGS proteins have been identified, organised into subfamilies based on structural features and specificity for different G-protein subunits. These protein subfamilies represent alternative pathways gating the flow of information generated in the basal ganglia. Microdialysis has been developed as a general tool for studying tissue and organ chemistry, leading to a truly translational venture as microdialysis is brought into clinical use, monitoring energy metabolism following global or focal ischemia in the neurosurgery and general medicine scenario.

These factors include alpha-synuclein aggre-gation at synapses [1] and in cortical Lewy aggregates [2], amyloid deposition [3], and loss of the brain’s neu-romodulators [4]. Dopamine plays a central role in the regulation of movement, reward-seeking behavior and cognition [5]. Dopamine neurons that innervate the putamen regulate movement selection [6], while those projecting to the ventral striatum, caudate, and cognitively eloquent cortices such as the cingulate cortex participate in reward-seeking behavior and cognition [7 - 10].

Hypoxia leads to an increase in the extracellular dopamine levels and therefore, an increase in the activity of the dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, this increase in extracellular concentration is not caused by an increase in the neurotransmitter synthesis, but instead on inhibiting its reuptake back into the neurons and glial cells. Therefore, there is an increased dopaminergic effect as dopamine remains in the synapse at higher concentrations leading to additional post-synaptic response. As a result, the uncontrollable writhing motions witnessed with athetosis deal with the over-activity of synapses within the basal ganglia.|$|R

40|$|Interneuronal {{communication}} in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) have always been of basic importance for theories on the cerebral morphofunctional architecture. Our group has proposed that intercellular {{communication in}} the brain can be grouped into 2 broad classes based on some general features of the transmission: wiring (WT) and volume (VT) transmission. WT occurs via a relatively constrained cellular chain (wire), while VT consists of 3 -dimensional diffusion of signals in the extracellular fluid (ECF) for distances larger than the synaptic cleft. Both morphological and functional evidence indicates that <b>dopamine</b> (DA) <b>synapses</b> in striatum are 'open' synapses, i. e., synapses which favor diffusion of the transmitter into the surrounding ECF and observations are compatible with the view that DA varicosities can synthesize, store and release DA for VT. The DAergic mesostriatal transmission has, therefore, been examined by several groups to give experimental support to VT. Moreover, due to its minor structural requirements, VT may become prevalent under some pathological conditions, e, g. Parkinson's disease. In animal models of DAergic pathway degeneration, {{it has been shown that}} a compensatory activation of surviving DA terminals may lead to a preferential potentiation of VT. WT and VT favor different and complementary types of computation. VT is markedly slower and less safe than WT, but has minor spatial constraints and allows the reach of a large number of targets. Models of neuronal systems integrating classical neuronal circuits and diffusible signals begin to show how WT and VT may interact in the neural tissue...|$|R
40|$|The human {{dopamine}} transporter (hDAT) {{provides the}} primary mechanism for <b>dopamine</b> clearance in <b>synapses</b> and thus facilitates {{the regulation of}} dopaminergic functions in cognition and reward. It is the molecular target of many centrally-active agents including amphetamines and cocaine. Therefore, an understanding of hDAT function and its modulation by these therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse can {{provide insight into the}} mechanisms of abuse and addiction. In the presented studies, hDAT is tagged with a hexahistidine construct and heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The plasma membranes are isolated, solubilized, and applied to a Nickel affinity column to obtain purified hDAT with preserved functionality. Purified hDAT reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers exhibited channel behaviors at physiological membrane potentials. We observed that the current mediated by single hDAT molecules is (1) induced by dopamine, (2) dependent on the sodium electrochemical gradient, and (3) blocked by cocaine. Our data support hDAT channel activity that is associated with dopamine uptake and presents a novel electrophysiological approach to studying monoamine transporter function and modulation by drugs...|$|R
40|$|Medications that treat {{diseases}} such as Parkinson&# 146;s disease work by regulating <b>dopamine</b> transmission at <b>synapses.</b> Surprisingly, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms regulating <b>dopamine</b> release at <b>synapses.</b> In this thesis, we study mechanisms that regulate vesicle recycling in axons and dendrites of dopamine neurons. Key questions we addressed were: (1) Are vesicles in axons and dendrites associated with the same regulatory proteins, and thus by implication the same regulatory mechanisms, as in excitatory neurons; (2) Do vesicles undergo recycling, and (3) if so, are they characterised by a distinct pool size and rate of recycling. To study this, we cultured dopamine neurons and used immunocytochemistry to detect vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT 2) and identify axons, dendrites and synaptic proteins, combined with labelling of recycling vesicles using FM 1 - 43. Vesicles in axons, but not in dendrites, were associated with presynaptic proteins such as Synaptophysin and Bassoon. We identified two kinds of presynaptic sites in axons: &# 145;synaptic&# 146; (located close to soma and dendrites&# 146; and &# 145;orphan&# 146;. The recycling vesicle pool size was smaller at orphan sites than at synaptic sites, and the initial rate of vesicle pool release was also lower at orphan sites. Both synaptic and orphan sites exhibited lower rates of vesicle pool release compared to hippocampal synapses, suggesting functional differences in presynaptic physiology between dopamine neurons and hippocampal neurons. In somatodendritic regions, VMAT 2 was localised to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosome, and large dense-core vesicles, suggesting that these vesicles might function as a part of the regulated secretory pathway in mediating dopamine release. None of the synaptic vesicle proteins we studied were detected in these regions, although some preliminary evidence of vesicle turnover was detected using FM 1 - 43 labelling. This thesis provides a detailed analysis of neurotransmitter release mechanisms in dopamine neurons. Our data suggests that presynaptic release of dopamine is mediated by mechanisms similar to those observed in excitatory neurons. In somatodendritic regions, our data suggests that VMAT 2 is localised to organelles in secretory pathways, and that distinct mechanisms of release might be present at somatodendritic sites to those present in presynaptic sites. This thesis provides novel methods for analysing vesicle recycling in dopamine neurons, which provides the basis for further studies examining presynaptic function of dopamine neurons in normal brain function, disease, and therapeutic approaches...|$|R
50|$|Drugs {{targeting}} the neurotransmitter of major systems affect the whole system, which {{can explain the}} complexity of action of some drugs. Cocaine, for example, blocks the re-uptake of dopamine back into the presynaptic neuron, leaving the neurotransmitter molecules in the synaptic gap {{for an extended period}} of time. Since the dopamine remains in the synapse longer, the neurotransmitter continues to bind to the receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, eliciting a pleasurable emotional response. Physical addiction to cocaine may result from prolonged exposure to excess <b>dopamine</b> in the <b>synapses,</b> which leads to the downregulation of some post-synaptic receptors. After the effects of the drug wear off, an individual can become depressed due to decreased probability of the neurotransmitter binding to a receptor. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), which blocks re-uptake of serotonin by the presynaptic cell which increases the amount of serotonin present at the synapse and furthermore allows it to remain there longer, providing potential for the effect of naturally released serotonin. AMPT prevents the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine; reserpine prevents dopamine storage within vesicles; and deprenyl inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B and thus increases dopamine levels.|$|R
5000|$|Exposure {{to drugs}} of abuse elicits LTP at {{excitatory}} <b>synapses</b> on VTA <b>dopamine</b> neurons. Excitatory <b>synapses</b> in brain slices from the VTA taken 24 {{hours after a}} single cocaine exposure showed an increase in AMPA receptors in comparison to a saline control. Additional LTP could not be induced in these synapses. This {{is thought to be}} because the maximal amount of LTP had already been induced by the administration of cocaine. LTP is only seen on the dopamine neurons, not on neighboring GABAergic neurons. This is of interest because the administration of drugs of abuse increases the excitation of VTA dopamine neurons, but does not increase inhibition. Excitatory inputs into the VTA will activate the dopamine neurons 200%, but do not increase activation of GABA neurons which are important in local inhibition. [...] This effect of inducing LTP in VTA slices 24 hours after drug exposure has been shown using morphine, nicotine, ethanol, cocaine, and amphetamines. These drugs have very little in common except that they are all potentially addictive. This is evidence supporting a link between structural changes in the VTA and the development of addiction.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{antidepressant}} medications act {{to raise}} noradrenaline, such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs or NERIs) and the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The {{mechanism by which}} these medications work is that the reuptake inhibitors prevent the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine by the presynaptic neuron, paralyzing the normal function of the NET. At the same time, higher levels of 5-HT are maintained in the synapse increasing the concentrations of the latter neurotransmitters. Since the noradrenaline transporter is {{responsible for most of}} the dopamine clearance in the prefrontal cortex, SNRIs block reuptake of dopamine too, accumulating the <b>dopamine</b> in the <b>synapse.</b> However, DAT, the primary way dopamine is transported out of the cell, can work to decrease dopamine concentration in the synapse when the NET is blocked. For many years, the number one choice in treating mood disorders like depression was through administration of TCAs, such as desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Arentyl, Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil) and amoxapine (Asendin). [...] SSRIs, which mainly regulate serotonin, subsequently replaced tricyclics as the primary treatment option for depression because of their better tolerability and lower incidence of adverse effects.|$|R
40|$|Background: Maternal care (MC) and {{dopamine}} modulate {{brain activity}} during emotion processing in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), striatum and amygdala. Reuptake of <b>dopamine</b> from the <b>synapse</b> is {{performed by the}} dopamine transporter (DAT), whose abundance is predicted by variation in its gene (DAT 3 'VNTR; 10 > 9 -repeat alleles). Here, we investigated the interaction between perceived MC and DAT 3 'VNTR genotype on brain activity during processing of aversive facial emotional stimuli. Methods: Sixty-one healthy subjects were genotyped for DAT 3 'VNTR and categorized in low and high MC individuals. They underwent {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} while performing a task requiring gender discrimination of facial stimuli with angry, fearful or neutral expressions. Results: An interaction between facial expression, DAT genotype and MC was found in left IFG, such that low MC and homozygosity for the 10 -repeat allele are associated with greater activity during processing of fearful faces. This greater activity was also inversely correlated with a measure of emotion control as scored with the Big Five Questionnaire. Moreover, MC and DAT genotype described a double dissociation on functional connectivity between IFG and amygdala. Conclusion: These findings suggest that perceived early parental bonding may interact with DAT 3 'VNTR genotype in modulating brain activity during emotionally relevant inputs...|$|R
