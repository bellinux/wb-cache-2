The lot had sat unused for about ten years before construction on the 215-unit complex began; Azulón at Mesa Verde opened in 2014. Several dozen palm and eucalyptus trees were saved and replanted on the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} developments, {{while they}} brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision {{for public health}} did not keep pace with them, {{and for a time}} living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.|$|E
5|$|The {{payment of}} death duties and the {{difficulty}} of maintaining a large estate during the Second World War forced the Cubitt family to begin selling packets of land. Cubitt's mansion was abandoned until its demolition in 1953, by which time the family was living in a Regency-style house converted from the <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> had been provided for the garden and stable staff in more affluent times.|$|E

5|$|Following the deindustrialisation of Greater Manchester in the mid-20th century, {{there was}} a {{significant}} economic and population decline in the region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> were built throughout the Victorian era were found to be in a poor state of repair and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered from chronic social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. Slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a decrease in population in central Greater Manchester. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population of Greater Manchester declined by over 8,000inhabitants a year. While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population of Greater Manchester decreased by only 8%.|$|E

25|$|In 1975 and 1983, two cases, both named Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township, were {{decided by}} the Court.

25|$|The {{original}} model, {{known as}} simply AirPort card, was a re-branded Lucent WaveLAN/Orinoco Gold PC card, in a modified <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> lacked the integrated antenna.

25|$|Rotary vane {{compressors}} {{consist of}} a rotor {{with a number of}} blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor. The rotor is mounted offset in a larger <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> is either circular or a more complex shape.

Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.|$|E

25|$|On Thursday, September 19, 1985, at 7:19am CST, Mexico City {{was struck}} by an {{earthquake}} of magnitude 8.1 on the Richter magnitude scale.

The government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption, forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> was lost as well.|$|E

25|$|Housing {{inequality}} is {{the difference}} in the quality of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> exists within a given society. It is a form of economic inequality. The right to housing is a recognized right by many national constitutions and the lack of adequate housing can have adverse consequences for the options available to an individual or family. The term may apply regionally across a geographic space, temporally between one generation and the next, or culturally between groups of different racial or social backgrounds. Housing inequality is directly related to concepts of racial inequality, social inequality, income inequality, and wealth inequality. It is often the result of factors including natural market forces, housing discrimination, and housing segregation.|$|E
