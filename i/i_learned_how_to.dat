25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler signed quickly, {{and broke}} in as a shortstop in 2003. He batted [...]277 in 188 at-bats in his pro debut for the Spokane Indians in the Short-season Northwest League, while leading {{the team in}} steals (11) and triples (6). He then spent the 2003–04 winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' {{strength}} and conditioning coaches. He said: [...] "I was probably 170 pounds, and I decided I needed to lift, put on some weight, and eat as much as I could. And <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> hit." ...|$|E
500|$|Murray {{likens the}} song to [...] "the R {{equivalent}} of punk rock" [...] or superficially simple {{enough not to}} intimidate beginners. [...] It interested the eleven-year-old Bo Diddley: [...] "I think the first record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen,'... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio, I said, 'If that guy can play, I know I can.' [...] I mean John Lee's got {{a hell of a}} style". [...] In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] at age thirteen: [...] "that was the first thing I thought <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen." [...] Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. [...] Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play.|$|E

500|$|Fossett {{grew up in}} Garden Grove, California {{and earned}} the Eagle Scout award in 1957. He {{credited}} his experience in Scouting {{as a foundation for}} much of his later success. [...] "As a Scout, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> set goals and achieve them," [...] he once said. [...] "Being a Scout also taught me leadership at a young age when there are few opportunities to be a leader. Scouting values have remained with me throughout my life, in my business career, and now as I take on new challenges." [...] In his later years, he was described as a [...] "legend" [...] by fellow Scouts. As a national BSA volunteer, he served as Chairman of the Northern Tier High Adventure Committee, Chairman of the Venturing Committee, member of the Philmont Ranch Committee, and member of the National Advisory Council. He later {{became a member of the}} BSA National Executive Board, and in 2007, Fossett succeeded Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as president of the National Eagle Scout Association. Fossett previously had served on the World Scout Committee.|$|E
500|$|After being heavily {{recruited}} by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications. With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that {{my job was to}} save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E
500|$|Capitol Records {{executives}} {{were worried that}} the lyrics contained psychedelic overtones, and Brian was accused of having based the song's production on his LSD experiences. Brian clarified that the song was written {{under the influence of}} marijuana, not LSD. He explained: [...] "I made ‘Good Vibrations’ on drugs; I used drugs to make that. ... <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it made me more rooted in my sanity." [...] In Steven Gaines's 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: [...] "We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could say ... those are sensual things. And then you'd say, 'I'm picking up good vibrations,' which is a contrast against the sensual, the extrasensory perception that we have. That's what we're really talking about." [...] Brian claimed in 2012 that the song's [...] "gotta keep those good vibrations" [...] bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Al Jardine of the Beach Boys compared the section to Foster's [...] "Down by the Riverside". According to Love, the lyric [...] "'she goes with me to a blossom world' was originally meant to be followed by the words 'we find'", but Brian elected to cut off the line to highlight the bass track linking into the chorus.|$|E

[...] "One of the reasons <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sing as a ventriloquist was because I like singing in the car," [...] Fator says.

2500|$|Paris {{was a city}} which McTell {{revisited}} frequently. Late in 1965 he and {{a friend}} from Croydon took a room in a cheap hotel on the Left Bank, earning their rent by busking cinema queues. After braving a bitterly cold Paris winter, McTell met a young American, Gary Petersen, who had studied with the legendary guitarist Reverend Gary Davis. [...] "There was a great anticipation every time I got to play with (Petersen)," [...] McTell recalled. [...] "Each time I learned something new, and through him <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play ragtime properly." ...|$|E
50|$|As a {{child and}} teenager, Philip {{received}} the usual education for {{a son of a}} German prince during the late Renaissance era. Soon, however, his artistic and scientific interests grew soon beyond the usual level. Even at the age of twelve, he owned a collection of books and pictures. He wrote his first scientific papers at the age of 17. His art was not just an expression of his royal representation, but emerged from an inner need. At age 18, he wrote: It is may pleasure to collect good, selectd books, portraits from a master's hand, and ancient coins of all kinds. From these <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> improve myself and also how I can be beneficial to the general public.|$|R
5000|$|Riopelle's voluminous impasto became just as {{important}} as color. His oil painting technique allowed him to paint thick layers, producing peaks and troughs as copious amounts of paint were applied {{to the surface of the}} canvas. Riopelle, though, claimed that the heavy impasto was unintentional: [...] "When I begin a painting," [...] he said, [...] "I always hope to complete it in a few strokes, starting with the first colours I daub down anywhere and anyhow. But it never works, so I add more, without realizing it. I have never wanted to paint thickly, paint tubes are much too expensive. But one way or another, the painting has to be done. When <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> paint better, <b>I</b> will paint less thickly." ...|$|R

While in high school she landed some {{modeling}} assignments and a small role in the film The Owl and the Pussycat (1970) and in which Chambers was credited as Evelyn Lang. During her early career as a model, her most prominent job was as the [...] "Ivory Soap girl" [...] on the Ivory Snow soap flake box, posing as a mother holding a baby under the tag line [...] "99 & 44/100% pure".|$|E
2500|$|Their {{music has}} been likened to singers such as Sinéad O'Connor and Siouxsie and the Banshees. O'Riordan stated her singing style {{incorporating}} yodeling was inspired by her father who used to sing [...] "The Lonesome Cattle Call": [...] "I just kept with my father all the time, just copying him and eventually <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it. Then over the years there were artists like Sinéad O’Connor and Siouxsie from Siouxsie and the Banshees and even Peter Harvey was doing it. It was something that you could work into The Cranberries’ format {{because a lot of}} that was used in religious Irish music." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Morath {{worked as}} a {{translator}} and journalist. In 1948, she was hired by Warren Trabant, first as Vienna Correspondent and later as the Austrian editor, for Heute, an illustrated magazine published by the Office of War Information in Munich. Morath encountered photographer Ernst Haas in post-war Vienna, and brought his work to Trabant's attention. Working together for Heute, Morath wrote articles to accompany Haas' pictures. In 1949, Morath and Haas were invited by Robert Capa to join the newly founded Magnum Photos in Paris, where she started as an editor. Working with contact sheets sent into the Magnum office by founding member Henri Cartier-Bresson fascinated Morath. [...] "I think that in studying his way of photographing <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> photograph myself, before I ever took a camera into my hand." ...|$|E
5000|$|The early Gonzo, with a {{permanently}} sad expression, {{inspired a}} similarly depressed portrayal from the novice puppeteer: [...] "The downcast eyes made him easy to play {{because that was}} exactly how I felt.

2500|$|Maddux was {{renowned for}} {{focusing}} on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply {{on the strength of}} his reputation. In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike. Maddux said of that pitch, [...] "That was just my normal fastball that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started to work for me when <b>I</b> ... <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff nearly {{retired in}} 1978. But after losing {{most of his}} money {{in a series of}} ill-advised {{investments}} — including, to the merriment of the Dutch press, a pig farm — that were counseled by a scam artist who had possibly seduced his wife, Cruyff and his family came to the United States. As he recalled, “I had lost millions in pig-farming and that was the reason I decided to become a footballer again.” Cruyff insisted that his decision to resume his playing career in the United States was pivotal in his career. “It was wrong, a mistake, to quit playing at 31 with the unique talent I possessed,” and adding that “Starting from zero in America, many miles away from my past, {{was one of the best}} decisions I made. There <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> develop my uncontrolled ambitions, to think as a coach and about sponsorship.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Safina {{was born}} in Moscow, Russia to Tatar parents. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, was her trainer when she was younger; while her father is {{director}} of the Spartak tennis club in Moscow. Her brother Marat is a former world No. 1 on the ATP Tour. Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: [...] "Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that's why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn't put pressure on me. I wanted to find my identity. I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning I was putting too much pressure on myself. But then gradually I found myself, and <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do better with that situation." [...] At age 8, Safina and her family moved to Valencia, Spain, and as a result Safina speaks fluent Spanish as well as Russian and English.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Wilson explained: [...] "I first felt I {{had a good}} {{voice when}} I was about {{seventeen}} or eighteen {{and was able to}} sing along well to records by the Four Freshmen. By singing along to those records that's how <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sing falsetto. [...] I would sing along to songs like 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,' 'I'll Remember April' and 'Day by Day'." [...] He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a [...] "groovy sectional sound". He added, [...] "The harmonies that we [...] are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake." [...] For a period, Wilson avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying, [...] "I thought people thought I was a fairy. ... The band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Some older {{scholarship}} {{speculated that}} the Bibliotheca was in fact compiled in Baghdad {{at the time of}} Photius's embassy to the Abbasid court, since many of the mentioned works were rarely cited during the so-called Byzantine Dark Ages c. 630 – c. 800, and it was known that the Abbasids were interested in works of Greek science and philosophy. However, specialists of this period of Byzantine history, such as Paul Lemerle, have shown that Photius could not have compiled his Bibliotheca in Baghdad because he clearly states in both his introduction and his postscript that when he learned of his appointment to the embassy, he sent his brother a summary of books that he read previously, [...] "since the time <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> understand and evaluate literature" [...] i.e. since his youth. Moreover, the Abbasids were interested only in Greek science, philosophy and medicine; they did not have Greek history, rhetoric, or other literary works translated; nor did they have Christian patristic writers translated. Yet the majority of works in Bibliotheca are by Christian patristic authors, and most of the secular texts in Bibliotheca are histories, grammars or literary works, usually rhetoric, rather than science, medicine or philosophy. This further indicates {{that the majority of the}} works cannot have been read while Photius was in the Abbasid empire.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E
