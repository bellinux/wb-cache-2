25|$|PFC. Jose Ramon Sanchez born in Brooklyn, NY was {{assigned}} to Company D, 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division. On June 6, 1968, he was {{among a group of}} fellow Marines who comprised a patrol operating in the rugged jungle covered mountains southwest of Khe Sanh, Quảng Trị Province, South Vietnam. Their mission was to block NVA troops and supplies from infiltrating toward Khe Sanh. The Marines engaged a communist force of unknown size in heavy combat. As the fierce firefight raged around them, the Marines, who were out numbered and rapidly running low on ammunition, requested an emergency extraction. A CH46A Sea Knight helicopter was sent for Sanchez {{and the rest of the}} patrol who were on Hill 672. As the helicopter gained altitude, it was immediately struck by intense and accurate enemy ground fire causing it to enter into a nose-low attitude and crash onto an east/west mountain ridgeline, roll <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the hill and burst into flames. Within an hour and a half, a search and recovery (SAR) team was inserted into the crash site. The team members pulled the charred bodies of the aircrew and passengers from what was left of the burned out helicopter and placed them in body bags. Of the 12 of the 23 Marines aboard who were killed, 4 were reported as MIA/KIA, besides Sanchez the other three were L/Cpl. LaPlant, L/Cpl. Palacios and L/Cpl. Harper. Various attempts to recover the bodies of the four were made to no avail.|$|E

500|$|The {{waterline}} {{main belt}} of the Shikishima-class vessels consisted of Harvey armour [...] high, [...] {{of which was}} above the waterline at normal load, and had a maximum thickness of [...] for the middle [...] of the ship. It was only [...] inches thick {{at the ends of}} the ship and was surmounted by a six-inch strake of armor that ran between the barbettes for 220 feet. The barbettes were [...] thick, but reduced to [...] {{at the level of the}} lower deck. The armour of the barbette hoods had a maximum thickness of [...] while their roofs were three inches thick. Diagonal bulkheads [...] thick connected the barbettes to the side armor, but the bulkheads were only six inches thick at the lower deck level. The casemates protecting the secondary armament were also six inches thick. The flat portion of the deck armour was [...] thick and four inches thick where it sloped <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the armour belt. This significantly improved the ships' protection as any shell that penetrated their vertical armour also had to penetrate the sloping deck before it could reach the machinery compartments or magazines.

500|$|One {{suggestion}} from C was to {{make the}} belt armor a load-bearing member by connecting plates end to end. This was found inordinately difficult to be practical and, while it would have added girder strength where most badly needed, was considered too radical a proposition to be truly safe. Another idea, subsequently adopted, was to design the forecastle to break abaft the turrets. The challenge then became to continue the longitudinal strength contributed by the armored deck past this point {{to the end of the}} stern. This became a difficult design problem, especially with the need to save weight wherever possible and the fact that light structural members combined with heavy armament weight had become a source of grief for the British. One proposed solution was to use a combination of three decks—a strength deck at the top of the hull, a protective deck which would rest atop the belt armor, [...] above the waterline, and a splinter deck below that, just above the waterline. [...] A third idea, also adopted, was to continue the longitudinal bulkhead between the protective and splinter decks <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the ship to add strength. The severity of the strength and weight challenges necessitated a larger displacement of 33,000 tons and a hull of [...] instead of [...] to give enough internal volume to accommodate all the needed machinery. Even so, the size of the power plant meant pushing the main turrets further toward the ends of the ships, which increased hull stress. This was why the idea was adopted to place half the boilers above the armored deck.|$|E

[...] William A Irvin was equipped to carry grain, although she never did due to {{the problems associated with}} switching cargoes from taconite to grain. [...] All cargo was loaded and unloaded through the top of the ship, through the 18 hatches on deck. [...] All hatches were covered with large one-piece steel hatch covers, which weighed 5.5 tons per cover. [...] After all the covers were lifted off and placed aside using the hatch crane, the cargo could be dumped {{to the bottom of the}} three holds, which would normally take 3–4 hours to complete. [...] Unloading used Hulett cranes: cranes whose necks reach <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the holds and grab 10-15 tons per bite, much like a large playground crane. [...] After all the cargo was either in or out of the holds, the hatch covers would be replaced and clamped down using the dog-ear or butterfly clamps.
