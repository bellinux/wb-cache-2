40|$|Abstract. There is the Jinggu-Minle road {{to cross}} through the No. 3 ore {{clusters}} in Songjiapo copper mine. The surface ground deformation and strata movement caused by underground mining will threaten the road transportation safety, which doesn’t allow collapse. Using numerical simulation method, the ground pressure activity and deformation, movement mechanism of strata were analyzed under different mining methods. Moreover, some control measures such as reserving <b>insulating</b> <b>pillar</b> and point pillars were put forward to maintain the stability of mined-out areas and the surface road. An optimal mining scheme was recommended. The {{results showed that the}} mining process of No. 3 ore clusters can’t cause direct failure to road, and the failure of hanging wall rock will have indirect influence to the road with the lapse of time. Reserving the <b>insulating</b> <b>pillar,</b> top pillar and point pillars can effectively reduce the plastic area range of hanging wall and strata failure in the mining process. The results can provide theoretical basis for the actual mining design and rock strata control...|$|E

They {{are also used}} to connect high voltage equipment at electrical switchyards, and low voltage equipment in battery banks. They are generally uninsulated, and have sufficient stiffness to be supported in air by <b>insulated</b> <b>pillars.</b> These features allow sufficient cooling of the conductors, {{and the ability to}} tap in at various points without creating a new joint.|$|R

The {{other part}} of the {{apparatus}} consisted of two <b>insulating</b> <b>pillars,</b> h and i, to which were fixed two brass balls, and through these passed two sliding rods, k and m, terminated at each end by brass balls; n is the end of an insulated conductor, which could be rendered either positive or negative from an electrical machine; o and p are wires connecting it with the two parts previously described, and q is a wire which, connecting the two opposite sides of the collateral arrangements, also communicates with a good discharging train r (292.).|$|R

(Plate VIII.): A and B were brass {{balls of}} very different diameters attached to metal rods, moving through sockets on <b>insulating</b> <b>pillars,</b> {{so that the}} distance between the balls could be varied at pleasure. The large ball A, 2 inches in diameter, was connected with an insulated brass conductor, which could be rendered positive or negative directly from a cylinder machine: the small ball B, 0.25 of an inch in diameter, was connected with a discharging train (292.) and perfectly uninsulated. The brass rods sustaining the balls were 0.2 of an inch in thickness.|$|R

40|$|Integrated gaseous pixel {{detectors}} {{consisting of}} a metal punctured foil suspended {{in the order of}} 50 μm over a pixel readout chip by means by SU- 8 <b>insulating</b> <b>pillars</b> have been fabricated. SU- 8 is used as sacrificial layer but metallization over uncrosslinked SU- 8 presents adhesion and stress problems. In this paper we describe the several methods we have investigated to fabricate a metal layer on top of a partially crosslinked SU- 8 film and the challenges we have encountered. The fabrication process using wafer post processing has been proven, but in cases where single chip processing is desirable, edge bead is a major problem to overcome as it can cover a considerable chip area, reducing the detector performance; we show different techniques to reduce this edge bead and improve detection efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA novel {{fabrication}} process for a high-aspect-ratio recording and stimulation intracortical neural microelectrode array is described. Using {{a combination of}} dicing and KOH wet-etching, microspikes are formed {{on the surface of}} a n-type (100), 4 mm thick, silicon wafer. Deep 3 mm cuts are performed in order to produce sharped tip pillars of high-aspect-ratio (0. 2 x 0. 2 x 3 mm). Thermomigration is employed as a selective doping technique performing electrically <b>insulated</b> <b>pillars</b> due to the pn back biased junctions formed between each pair of n-type substrate and p+ migrated trails.

40|$|The {{condenser}} of {{the high}} voltage circuit (column in the foreground) is being serviced by Jean Luc Vallet. Standing on the electronics platform (the big, open metallic structure on <b>insulating</b> <b>pillars,</b> for details see 7403120) is Bob Nettelton. The column at the right edge of the photo {{is part of the}} bouncer (see also 7403066 X) which compensated the voltage drop during acceleration of a proton pulse. In the background is the source (open pill box structure) attached to the accelerating column, barely visible) behind. The "old" 50 MeV Linac 1, the original PS injector built in the 1950 s, was (since 1976) replaced by a new 50 MeV linac (Linac 2) with a 750 keV "Cockcroft-Walton" pre-injector(see 7602012 X), later replaced by a 750 keV Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) preaccelerator. Linac 1 co-existed until mid 1992 (from 1982 onwards it was mainly used to inject "test-particles" into the Low Energy Antiproton ring LEAR). In 1984 the electrostatic preaccelerator of linac 1 was replaced by a 520 keV RFQ (8303511 X and 8605617 X), which was more compact and at earth potential...|$|R
40|$|The "open pill box" (in the {{background}} at the left) contains the ion source, where {{for many years}} all protons accelerated at CERN were "born". It is directly attached to the acceleration column where the protons pass from 520 kV to earth potential. The "electronics platform" (big metal structure on <b>insulating</b> <b>pillars</b> {{in the middle of}} the picture, for details see 7403120 and 7403071 X) contains all the equipment that has to be at the same potential as the source itself. It is being admired by Helmut Haseroth and Jean Luc Vallet (during servicing). The smaller metal box in the foreground is part of the "bouncer" which compensated the voltage drop during acceleration of a proton pulse. The high voltage supply (not included in this photo) was originally a Cockcroft-Walton generator. In 1973 it was replaced by a Sames generator (see 7403074 X).

40|$|A neural {{electrode}} array design is proposed with 3 mm long sharpened pillars made from an aluminumbased substrate. The array is composed by 25 electrically <b>insulated</b> <b>pillars</b> in a 5 x 5 matrix, {{in which each}} aluminum pillar was precisely machined via dicing saw technique. The result is an aluminum structure with high-aspect-ratio pillars (19 : 1), each with a tip radius of 10 mu m. A thin-film of platinum was deposited via sputtering technique to perform the ionic signal transduction. Each pillar was encapsulated with an epoxy resin <b>insulating</b> the entire <b>pillar</b> excluding the tip. This process resulted in mechanically robust electrodes each capable of withstanding loads up to 200 mN before bending. The array implantation tests were conducted on agar gel at speeds of 50 mm/min, 120 mm/min and 180 mm/min which resulted in average implantation forces of 119 mN, 145 mN and 150 mN, respectively. Insertion and withdrawal tests were also performed in porcine cadaver brain showing a necessary force of 66 mN forsuccessful explantation. A three point flexural test demonstrated a displacement of 0. 8 mm before array's breakage. The electrode's impedance was characterized showing a near resistive impedance of 385 Omega in the frequency range from 2 kHz to 125 kHz. The resultant array, {{as well as the}} fabrication technique, is an innovative alternative to silicon-based electrode solutions, avoiding some fabrication methods and limitations related to silicon and increasing the mechanical flexibility of the array.
