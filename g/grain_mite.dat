40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{investigations}} {{were made to}} find the changes in different physical and chemical parameters of three wheat varieties (Lasani- 08, Faisalabad- 08 and Sehar- 06) infested by varying levels of stored <b>grain</b> <b>mites</b> (Rhizoglyphus tritici). Results showed that significant variations were observed in physico-chemical characteristics, mineral profile, amino acid profile and fatty acid profile of three wheat varieties. Mite population was significantly increased and reaches upto 7513 mites in Lasani- 08 after six months in the treatment initially treated with twenty pairs of mite. Maximum decrease in the thousand kernel weight was observed in Lasani- 08 {{out of all the}} three varieties after six months of storage which was from 38. 50 g in control to 26. 07 g in treatment with maximum number of mites. Wet and dry gluten were also found decreasing with increasing infestation of stored <b>grain</b> <b>mites</b> in three wheat varieties. Wet gluten ranged from 22. 65 % in T 3 after six months to 31. 74 % in T 4 after one month in Sehar- 06, while dry gluten ranged from 6. 17 % in T 3 after six months to 9. 92 % in T 4 after one month in Sehar- 06. Moisture content was found increasing with increasing mite population after different storage periods in three varieties. Maximum moisture was observed in Lasain- 08 after six months of storage in the treatment initially treated with twenty pairs of mites that was 18. 13 %. Crude protein and crude fat were found decreasing in three varieties and ranged from 10. 03 % after six months in T 3 of Faisalabad- 08 to 14. 43 % after one month in T 4 of Sehar- 06 and 0. 52 % after six months in T 3 of Faisalabad- 08 to 1. 38 % after one month in T 4 of Faisalabad- 08, respectively. Fiber and ash content showed a significant and positive correlation with mite population. Fiber ranged from 1. 03 % after one month in T 4 of Lasani- 08 to 4. 30 % after six months in T 3 of Sehar- 06. Ash ranged from 1. 23 % after three and six months in T 4 of Lasani- 08 to 3. 60 % after six months in T 3 of Sehar- 06. Maximum decrease in NFE of Sehar- 06 was observed after six months in the treatment having maximum mite population (T 3) that was 62. 12 % from 65. 64 % in control. Flour quality parameters such as falling number, water absorption, dough development time, dough stability, mixing tolerance index and softening of dough showed significant and negative correlation with mite population. Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Copper (Cu), Calcium (Ca), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), Magnesium (Mg) and Zinc (Zn) in different wheat varieties were found increasing with increasing mite population after one, three and six months of storage, although this increase was just a proportion increase due to the depletion of other contents in grains. Different amino acids were found decreasing with increasing mite population in three wheat varieties after different storage periods and exhibited negative correlation with mite population. Different fatty acids were found decreasing with increasing mites infestation. After different storage periods Capric, Myristic, Palmitic and Palmitoleic ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 18 %, 0. 07 to 0. 19 %, 12. 25 to 16. 25 % and 0. 15 to 0. 40 %, respectively while Stearic, Oleic, Linoleic and Linolenic ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 62 %, 12. 15 to 15. 90 %, 55. 33 to 59. 82 % and 4. 80 to 7. 50 %, respectively under different treatments.

Grain handlers had a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs than did the city workers who comprised the comparison group. Evidence of accumulative respiratory effect due to recurring exposures to grain dust was found. Acute and chronic airway reactions were induced by exposure to grain dust. Wheezing and dyspnea on exposure were related to length of employment. Grain fever syndrome was prevalent. Cases of acute recurrent conjunctivitis and rhinitis were found along with skin pruritus, mainly on exposure to barley dust. Pesticide exposure caused temporary disabling symptoms. Lung function was adversely affected by grain dust exposure. Exposure to <b>grain</b> <b>mites</b> and insects in contaminated cereal grain caused a reaction among grain workers. A low prevalence of positive reactions to grain antigens was found.

40|$|Dust is {{a complex}} mixture of {{particles}} of organic and inorganic origin and different gases absorbed in aerosol droplets. In a poultry unit include dried faecal matter and urine, skin flakes, ammonia, carbon dioxide, pollens, feed and litter particles, feathers, <b>grain</b> <b>mites,</b> fungi spores, bacteria, viruses and their constituents. Dust particles vary in size and differentiation between particle size fractions is important in health studies in order to quantify penetration within the respiratory system. A descriptive study was developed {{in order to assess}} exposure to particles in a poultry unit during different operations, namely routine examination and floor turn over. Direct-reading equipment was used (Lighthouse, model 3016 IAQ). Particle measurement was performed in 5 different sizes (PM 0. 5; PM 1. 0; PM 2. 5; PM 5. 0; PM 10). The chemical composition of poultry litter was also determined by neutron activation analysis. Normally, the litter of poultry pavilions is turned over weekly and it was during this operation that the higher exposure of particles was observed. In all the tasks considered PM 5. 0 and PM 10. 0 were the sizes with higher concentrations values. PM 10 is what turns out to have higher values and PM 0. 5 the lowest values. The chemical element with the highest concentration was Mg (5. 7 E 6 mg. kg- 1), followed by K (1. 5 E 4 mg. kg- 1), Ca (4. 8 E 3 mg. kg- 1), Na (1. 7 E 3 mg. kg- 1), Fe (2. 1 E 2 mg. kg- 1) and Zn (4. 2 E 1 mg. kg- 1). This high presence of particles in the respirable range (< 5 – 7 μm) means that poultry dust particles can penetrate into the gas exchange region of the lung.

50|$|Abacarus hystrix (cereal rust <b>mite</b> or <b>grain</b> rust <b>mite)</b> {{belongs to}} the family Eriophyidae. They are {{extremely}} small with adults measuring up to one millimeter in length and only have four legs {{at the front of}} the body. Viewing by the human eye requires, a 10 - 20X lens. The adult mites are usually yellow but also have been seen to be white or orange. The cereal rust mite was first found on Elymus repens (couch grass), a very common perennial grass species. It has now been found on more than 60 grass species including oats, barley, wheat and ryegrass, found in Europe, North America, South Africa and Australia. Mites migrate primarily through wind movement and are usually found on the highest basal sections of the top two leaf blades. Abacarus hystrix produces up to twenty overlapping generations per year in South Australian perennial pastures, indicating that the species breeds quite rapidly. It has been noted that the cereal rust mite can cause losses in yield of up to 30-70%.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} decades, the {{population}} of the world has been increased to a greater number that is why different problems relating to food quality and food scarcity are the subject of discussion in the modern era. The main problem is to feed such a large population with a good quality food but many factors cause hindrance in achieving this task. There are many factors that lower the food quality and damage its nutritional potential. Among these factors mite pests are of immense importance which inhibat various environment including stored grains, stored products, cultivated mushroom, house dust, pollens, mosses, litter and nest of different animals. Mites (Acarina: Arachnida) are microscopic and widely distributed throughout the world. Mites' infestation decreases grains quality by changing the proportion of nutrients. Stored <b>grain</b> <b>mites</b> are also recognized as a source of allergens by inhalation in certain occupational environments and in the domestic environment. In order to check the species distribution from Punjab, identification is the key components to acquire better management. For this purpose various localities in different ecological zones including irrigated low land, semi-arid, sub humid eastern unirrigated and sub-mountain west were surveyed. For spot collection sieve method was used while the remaining samples had been processed through Berlese's funnel, the hypopi thus collected were mounted permanently on glass slides by using Hoyer's medium. In this present research work 24 species were collected. Among these 16 species are new to science and 8 species were already described of the genus Acotyledon Berlese viz. Acotyledon falki, tariqi, bellulus, stremma, haripuriensis, wazirabadensis, kamokiensis and peshawariensis. Among the new species 8 are belonging to Acotyledon Berlese, viz., cicero, multaniensis, Sarwari, haroonabadensis, augokiensis, veginus, tritici and chackwalensis; 4 species were belonging to the genus Caloglyphus Oudemans viz. pejowaliensis, sativum, jaranwalaensis and aurangensis; 1 species was belonging to genus Forcellinia Berlese viz.

40|$|Background: Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Acari: Astigmata) and Fusarium sp. co-occur in poorly managed grain. In a {{laboratory}} experiment, mite grazing resulted in significant reduction of fungal mycelium on cultivation plates. The destruction of mycelium {{appeared to be}} a result of an interaction between the mites, fungi and associated bacteria. Methodology and Principal Findings: A laboratory experiment was performed to simulate a situation of <b>grain</b> multiinfested by <b>mites</b> and Fusarium fungi. Changes of mite-associated bacterial community in T. putrescentiae were described in 3 habitats: (i) T. putrescentiae mites from a rearing diet prior to their transfer to fungal diet; (ii) fungal mycelium before mite introduction; (iii) mites after 7 day diet of each Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. poae and F. verticillioides. Bacterial communities were characterized by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. In total, 157 nearly full-length 16 S rRNA gene sequences from 9 samples representing selected habitats were analyzed. In the mites, the shift from rearing to fungal diet caused changes in mite associated bacterial community. A diverse bacterial community was associated with mites feeding on F. avenaceum, while feeding on the other three Fusarium spp. led to selection of a community dominated by Bacillaceae. Conclusions/Significance: The work demonstrated changes of bacterial community associated with T. putrescentiae after shift to fungal diets suggesting selection for Bacillaceae species known as chitinase producers, which might participate i...|$|R
40|$|The ham mite, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, is {{the major}} target pest of dry cured ham. Ham mites infest {{a wide range of}} stored food {{products}} such as dried meats, dried eggs, nuts, cheese, pet foods and <b>grains</b> (Townsend, 2007). <b>Mites</b> are very small (1 / 2 mm long), feed on the surface of dry cured meat and follow the seam fat to the interior of the bone and interior of the hams. Mites cannot fly, but they can crawl around extensively and may be carried from one spot to another by humans and other insects. Heavily infested materials may have a sweet or minty odor and infested areas will have a powdery appearance from the buildup of dead mites and their coverings (Townsend, 2007). Methyl bromide has been used to fumigate dry cured ham plants and is the only known fumigant that is effective at eradiating ham mite infestations at this time (EPA, 2010). However, methyl bromide is classified as a Class 1 ozone depletion substance and will be phased out for all industries by 2015 (EPA, 2006). A survey of 34 dry cured ham plants indicated that 22 of plants surveyed used methyl bromide fumigation one to five times a year based on the severity of the infestation (Rentfrow, et al., 2008). This demonstrates that methyl bromide fumigation is important to the economic viability of the dry cure...|$|R
40|$|Storage mites (acarid mites) {{are related}} to the house dust mite but are usually found in {{agricultural}} environments. They have been shown to cause allergic symptoms in Scottish farmworkers exposed to stored hay, but whether farmworkers who grow and store grain are also at risk is unknown. One hundred and one farmworkers on 22 Essex farms with grain storage facilities (88 % of the available workforce) participated in a survey of respiratory symptoms, with skin tests and determination of serum levels of IgE specific for mite species, including storage mites. Of the 101 workers, 21 reported attacks of cough, wheeze, or breathlessness after exposure to stored grain and 15 reported nasal symptoms after <b>grain</b> exposure. Storage <b>mite</b> specific IgE was found in 59 % of farmworkers with work related respiratory symptoms, in 60 % with work related nasal symptoms, and in only 9 % of symptomless farmworkers. Work related respiratory and nasal symptoms were also significantly associated with atopy, and with positive skin test responses and serum IgE specific for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Storage mites were found in grain samples from 16 farms in which grain was sampled, whereas D pteronyssinus was not found in any. The close association between serum storage mite specific IgE and occupational respiratory symptoms suggests that storage mites may be responsible for respiratory symptoms in these Essex farmworkers exposed to grain...|$|R
25|$|Most major {{classes of}} predatory and {{parasitic}} arthropods contain species that eat pollen, despite the common perception that bees {{are the primary}} pollen-consuming arthropod group. Many other Hymenoptera other than bees consume pollen as adults, though {{only a small number}} feed on pollen as larvae (including some ant larvae). Spiders are normally considered carnivores but pollen is an important source of food for several species, particularly for spiderlings, which catch pollen on their webs. It is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however, since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen <b>grains.</b> Some predatory <b>mites</b> also feed on pollen, with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen, such as Euseius tularensis, which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species. Members of some beetle families such as Mordellidae and Melyridae feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults, while various lineages within larger families such as Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae, and Scarabaeidae are pollen specialists even though most members of their families are not (e.g., only 36 of 40000 species of ground beetles, which are typically predatory, have been shown to eat pollen—but this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1000 species). Similarly, Ladybird beetles mainly eat insects, but many species also eat pollen, as either part or all of their diet. Hemiptera are mostly herbivores or omnivores but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the Anthocoridae). Many adult flies, especially Syrphidae, feed on pollen, and three UK syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids, like all flies, cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts, but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid). Some species of fungus, including Fomes fomentarius, are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen. Pollen may be valuable diet supplement for detritivores, providing them with nutrients needed for growth, development and maturation. It was suggested that obtaining nutrients from pollen, deposited on the forest floor during periods of pollen rains, allows fungi to decompose nutritionally scarce litter.|$|R
