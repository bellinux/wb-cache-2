40|$|This {{contribution}} {{illustrates the}} application of the standard EN ISO 6946 regarding the heat loss of an inverted roof for different regions of Europe. An addendum to the standard (EN. ISO 6946 : 19961 Al, 2003) introduces a correction to the thermal transmittance of inverted roofs due to rain water flowing between the insulation and the waterproofing membrane. It is possible to calculate the <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> loss of inverted roofs caused by rain water below the <b>heat</b> insulation. The <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> loss depends on the average rainfall and on which fraction of the rain water that will drain between the waterproofing membrane and the thermal insulation. This paper explains {{the application of}} the standard for areas of Europe. Furthermore, some constructions are proposed, which have such small <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> losses caused by rain water that they may be disregarded in the calculation...|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increased}} thermal mass of the structure, the thermal lag of the earth, the protection against unwanted air infiltration and the combined use of passive solar techniques, the need for <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling is minimal.

This used three cylindrical shells, with two directly heated cylinders below a single central steam drum.

These boilers were more a development of the egg-ended boiler, as externally heated drums without fire-tubes.|$|E

50|$|The major {{advantage}} of the Inglis is the <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> area it adds, for a comparable shell volume, of perhaps 20%. Surprisingly this is not from the additional combustion chamber, but from lengthening the narrow firetubes.

Despite this advantage, it is rarely used.|$|E

30|$|A few Mars {{development}} {{scenarios are}} based on this phenomenon. Williams and Nimmo (2004) suggest that Mars’ core formed quite rapidly and was ∼ 150 K hotter than {{the base of the}} mantle. With that <b>extra</b> <b>heat,</b> a dynamo could operate by simple core cooling by convective withdrawal of heat by the mantle from the core-mantle boundary, with the mantle operating in a stagnant lid regime (i.e., no plate tectonics). After ∼ 0.5 Gyr, the core would be cooled sufficiently that dynamo action would stop. Even added radiogenic 40 K in the core is not able to provide enough <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> early in Mars’ history to run a dynamo. In their view, Mars’ core is still entirely liquid.|$|R

50|$|In any {{alternating}} current transmission line, the inductance and capacitance of the conductors can be significant. Currents that flow solely in ‘reaction’ to these {{properties of the}} circuit, (which together with the resistance define the impedance) constitute reactive power flow, which transmits no ‘real’ power to the load. These reactive currents, however, are very real and cause <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> losses in the transmission circuit. The ratio of 'real' power (transmitted to the load) to 'apparent' power (the product of a circuit's voltage and current, without reference to phase angle) is the power factor. As reactive current increases, the reactive power increases and the power factor decreases. For transmission systems with low power factor, losses are higher than for systems with high power factor. Utilities add capacitor banks, reactors and other components (such as phase-shifting transformers; static VAR compensators; and flexible AC transmission systems, FACTS) throughout the system help {{to compensate for the}} reactive power flow, reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages. These measures are collectively called 'reactive support'.|$|E

With observed gas-phase abundances (not solar), the line ratios in the local arm at b = 0 deg are fitted with no <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> and (S/H) = 13 ppm (solar is 20 ppm). Local gas observed at b = - 35 deg requires <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> of about gamma = 0. 75, where gamma is the <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> in units of 10 ^{- 25 } erg H^{- 1 } s^{- 1 }. In the Perseus arm, there are similar results, with a domposition consistent with the Galactic abundance gradient. The requirements for NGC 891 {{are similar to the}} Perseus arm: little or no <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> at |z| = 1 kpc and gamma 3 at 2 kpc. In NGC 891 there is also an increase of 5007 /H-alpha with |z| that can only come about if most of the ionizing radiation is supplied by stars with T~ 50000 K.

40|$|Thermal {{conduction}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism by which sufficient <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> is provided in radiation-dominated accretion flows. We consider the extreme {{case in which the}} generated energy due to the viscosity and the energy transported by a saturated form of thermal conduction are balanced by the advection cooling. For the steady-state structure of such accretion flows a set of self-similar solution are presented. Based on these solutions while the radial and the rotational velocities are both sub-Keplerian, increasing the level of thermal conduction has the effects of decreasing the rotational velocity, but increasing the radial velocity. Conduction provides <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> and the temperature of the gas increases with thermal conduction. Comment: submitted to Ap...|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that strain {{hardening}} and thermal softening are two important factors affecting the surface quality. These two conflicting factors act completely opposite to each other. Strain hardening increases the hardness of the workpiece and the thermal softening reduces the workpiece hardness. At the feed rate relatively higher than 0.16  mm/rev, due to higher forces (see Fig. 6 a), <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> is produced in the cutting zone, compared with the lower feed rates. This <b>extra</b> <b>heat</b> leads to thermal softening of the workpiece material. On the other hand, CBN tools have an excellent hot hardness and the produced heat overcomes the strain hardening effects of the workpiece material and decreases its hardness and shear strength, especially at the interface of the workpiece and tool. Thus, the thermal softening of the workpiece material reduces the tool wear rate and therefore, the surface roughness is not increased.|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of aerospikes {{seem to be}} extra weight for the spike, and increased cooling requirements due to the <b>extra</b> <b>heated</b> area. Furthermore, the larger cooled area can reduce performance below theoretical levels by reducing the pressure against the nozzle.

40|$|The {{detailed}} {{observations of}} the diffuse ionized gas through the emission lines Hα, [NII], and [SII] in the Perseus Arm of our Galaxy by the Wisconsin Hα Mapper (WHAM) [...] survey challenge photoionization models. They have to explain the observed rise in the line ratios [NII]/Hα and [SII]/Hα. The models described here consider {{for the first time}} the detailed observational geometry toward the Perseus Arm. The models address the vertical variation of the line ratios up to height of 2 kpc above the midplane. The rising trends of the line ratios are matched. The increase in the line ratios is reflected in a rise of the temperature of the gas layer. This is due to the progressive hardening of the radiation going through the gas. However an <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> above photoionization is needed to explain the absolute values. Two different <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> rates are investigated which are proportional to n^ 0 and n^ 1. The models show that a combination of both are best to explain the data, where the <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> independent of density is dominant for z > 0. 8 kpc.

40|$|We present first {{results from}} high–resolution Tree+SPH {{simulations}} of galaxy clusters and groups, aimed at studying {{the effect of}} non–gravitational heating on the entropy of the intra–cluster medium (ICM). We simulate three systems, having emission–weighted temperature Tew ≃ 0. 6, 1 and 3 keV, with spatial resolution better than 1 % of the virial radius. We consider the effect of different prescriptions for non–gravitational ICM heating, such as supernova (SN) energy feedback, as predicted by semi–analytical models of galaxy formation, and two different minimum entropy floors, Sfl = 50 and 100 keV cm 2, imposed at z = 3. Simulations with only gravitational heating nicely reproduce predictions from self–similar ICM models, while <b>extra</b> <b>heating</b> is shown to break the self– similarity, by a degree which depends on total injected energy and on cluster mass. We use observational results on the excess entropy in central regions of galaxy systems, to constrain the amount of extra–heating required.
