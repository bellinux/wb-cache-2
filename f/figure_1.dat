5|$|The {{contact angle}} (θ), {{as seen in}} <b>Figure</b> <b>1,</b> is the angle at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E

5|$|Tracer {{diffusion}} {{describes the}} motion of individual adparticles on a surface at relatively low coverage levels. At these low levels (< 0.01 monolayer), particle interaction is low and each particle can be considered to move independently of the others. The single atom diffusing in <b>figure</b> <b>1</b> is a nice example of tracer diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Receptors and the {{structure}} of melatonin are known. Therefore researchers started to investigate modulations of the core structure to develop better agonists than melatonin; more potent, with better pharmacokinetics and longer half-life. TIK-301 (<b>figure</b> <b>1)</b> is an agonist of the early classes. It is very similar to melatonin and has made it to clinical trials. This led to further research on the molecule, mainly substitution of the aromatic ring. Various modulations showed promising activity, especially the naphthalene ring which is present in agomelatine (<b>figure</b> <b>1).</b> Other ring systems have also showed melatonin agonist activity. Amongst them are indane which is present in ramelteon (<b>figure</b> <b>1)</b> and the ring system of tasimelteon (<b>figure</b> <b>1).</b>|$|E
