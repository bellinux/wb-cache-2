The relationship between national security and privacy and civil liberties is often modeled as a scale with security on one end and privacy and civil liberties on the other. Success {{is said to be}} achieved when security and privacy are balanced. This model forces these values to be traded in a zero-sum game. A new model that decreases the "cost" to privacy and increases the "value" to security is needed. Technological, policy and organizational innovation hold promise in designing new intelligence and information-sharing architectures capable of detecting <b>indications</b> <b>and</b> <b>warnings</b> of terrorism <b>and</b> protecting the privacy and civil liberties of Americans. Using government documents that articulate attributes for a terrorism early <b>warning</b> system <b>and</b> widely accepted privacy principles as design requirements, the thesis examines technologies that could meet the challenges of both security and privacy. Designing and building a system that supports both security and privacy will benefit both.

Detecting reconnaissance is a key early <b>indication</b> <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> of an adversary's impending attack or intelligence gathering effort against a network.

50|$|The ES-3A Shadow was {{designed}} as a carrier-based, subsonic, all-weather, long-range, electronic reconnaissance (ELINT) aircraft. 16 aircraft were modified, replacing the EA-3B Skywarrior, and entering fleet service in 1993. The ES-3A carried an extensive suite of electronic sensors and communications gear, replacing the S-3's submarine detection, armament, and maritime surveillance equipment with avionics racks accommodating the ES-3A's sensors. These modifications had minor impact on airspeed, reducing its top rated speed from 450 KTAS to 405 KTAS but had no noticeable impact on the aircraft's range and actually increased its rated loiter time. Because these aircraft were standoff <b>indications</b> <b>and</b> <b>warnings</b> platforms <b>and</b> were never intended to be part of an ingress strike package, this new speed limitation was considered insignificant.|$|R
