40|$|Flushing basins {{have been}} used at several {{locations}} in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands in the past centuries to maintain the navigational depths of harbour channels. These locations are not in use anymore or are only partly responsible for channel maintenance. This thesis encompasses a study to optimize the geometric parameters of a <b>flushing</b> <b>basin</b> system in a tidal back barrier basin. The addition of a <b>flushing</b> <b>basin</b> behind a tidal harbour channel is meant to affect the sediment regime in the channel from a flood-dominant towards an ebb-dominant regime. With a one-dimensional model of a schematized reference situation, the role of three parameters: the sluice width, the horizontal area of the <b>flushing</b> <b>basin</b> and the ratio between the tidal amplitude and the channel depth, in the tide-residual sediment transport is investigated for the <b>flushing</b> <b>basin</b> system. Three conditions need to be met simultaneously to create ebb dominance along the total length of the channel: a sufficiently large <b>flushing</b> <b>basin</b> area, a small sluice width, compared to the channel width and a relatively deep channel compared to the tidal amplitude.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a sediment analysis program formulated to determine the flushing potential of various shaped small boat marina basins. Chemical tests regarding volatile solids, Kjeldahl nitrogen, grease and oil, and sulfides were performed with the results compared to established sediment quality criteria. These results were used to estimate the relative state of pollution of several Oregon marinas. Existing criteria were used in normalizing laboratory test results into pollution indices. The marinas were characterized via dimensionless numbers composed of several physical parameters indicative of the basin's geometry on which the flushing ability of estuarine and riverine enclosures might depend. From a general statistical examination of the benthic sediment quality data, models were developed representing sediment quality indices and flushing phenomena. Comparing the relative differences in pollution indices between stations in one basin provided useful information concerning the confidence that can be regarded about assumptions made in the problem solving technique. Five dimensionless basin parameters were assigned limiting values that were felt optimum to obtain adequate <b>flushing</b> for marina <b>basins.</b> A nomogram for use in the design process for marina sitings was developed. Using this tool one can predict whether adequate <b>flushing</b> of enclosed <b>basins</b> would be ensured with the effect that existing water quality would be high. It is felt that this method of research, using sediments in describing a hydraulic system, has a potential for further use in examining marina flushing ability. Suggestions for future work are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Transport {{time scales}} are key {{parameters}} to assess water renewal of estuaries and tidal basins {{and they have}} long been used to this purpose. In a modern-day Tower of Babel, an ever-increasing confusion has involved terminology, use and estimation of time scales, despite valuable efforts towards a sounder theoretical framework. Within the framework of tidally <b>flushed,</b> semi-enclosed <b>basins</b> with negligible freshwater inflow, water renewal is strongly controlled by diffusion. The inlet of a tidal basin acts alternatively as a source and as a sink. A significant fraction of effluent water can return to the basin each flood tide. Accordingly, to correctly assess water renewal of such basins, a region larger than the basin itself has to be considered. To account {{for the effects of}} return flow, the concept of exposure time was introduced {{as an alternative to the}} residence time. However, deep analysis of exposure time revealed unexpected complications that, in part, are still open questions. The present contribution extends the concepts of water age and local flushing time to account for the return flow, as for exposure time. These time scales are studied and compared to each other, aided by a modelling study focusing on the Venice lagoon. Also, approximate methods to estimate the real time scales are introduced and analysed. We show that the local flushing time well approximates, quantitatively, both water age and exposure time in steady periodic hydrodynamic condition. Conversely, wind-driven advection makes exposure time to be significantly different from water age and local flushing time...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of tidally <b>flushed,</b> semi-enclosed <b>basins</b> with negligible freshwater inflow, and under steady periodic flow conditions, three frequently used local transport time scales to quantify the efficiency of water renewal, namely water age, exposure time, and local flushing time are studied and compared to each other. In these environments, water renewal is strongly controlled by diffusion, and it is significantly affected by the return flow (i. e., the fraction of effluent water that returns into the basin on each flood tide). The definition of water age is here modified {{to account for the}} return flow, in analogy with exposure time and local flushing time. We consider approximate time scales, whose accuracy is analyzed, in order to overcome problems related {{to the size of the}} computational domain and to reduce the computational effort. A new approximate procedure is introduced to estimate water age, which is based on the water aging rate. Also, the concept of local flushing time as a relevant time scale is introduced. Under steady periodic conditions, we demonstrate that the local flushing time quantitatively corresponds to water age, and well approximates exposure time when the flow is dominated by diffusion. Since the effort required to compute water age and exposure time is greater than that required to compute the local flushing time, the present results can also have a practical interest in the assessment of water renewal efficiency of semi-enclosed water basins. The results of a modeling study, in which the lagoon of Venice is used as a benchmark, confirm the substantial quantitative equivalence between these three transport time scales in highly diffusive environments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{profiled}} five ice-covered {{lakes and}} two ice-covered fiords of Ellesmere Island {{at the northern}} limit of High Arctic Canada to examine their environmental characteristics, and to evaluate the long-term limnological consequences of changes in their surrounding landscape through time (landscape evolution). All of the ecosystems showed strong patterns of thermal, chemical, and biological stratification with subsurface temperature maxima from 0. 75 to 12. 15 °C; conductivities up to 98. 1 mS cm– 1 (twice that of seawater) in some bottom waters; pronounced gradients in nitrogen, phosphorus, pH, dissolved inorganic and organic carbon, manganese, iron, and oxygen; and stratified photo-synthetic communities. These ecosystems form an inferred chronosequence that reflects different steps of landscape evolution including marine embayments open to the sea, inlets blocked by thick sea ice (Disraeli Fiord, Taconite Inlet), perennially ice-capped, saline lakes isolated from the sea by isostatic uplift (Lakes A, C 1, C 2), and isolated lakes that lose their ice cover in summer. The latter are subject to entrainment of saline water into their upper water column by wind-induced mixing (Lake Romulus; Lake A in 2000), or complete <b>flushing</b> of their <b>basins</b> by dilute snowmelt (Lake C 3 and Char Lake, which lies 650 km {{to the south of}} the Ellesmere lakes region). This chronosequence illustrates how changes in geomorphology and other landscape properties may influence the limnology of coastal, high-latitude lakes, and it provides a framework to explore the potential impacts of climate change.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} stream nitrate {{response}} to spatially distributed snowmelt in alpine environments. Green Lakes Valley, CO (GLV 4) and Tokapah Basin, CA (TOK) are two geologically and climatologically different alpine watersheds {{that served as}} our study sites for hydrochemistry comparisons (focused on nitrate, NO 3 -) over a 12 year period (1996 - 2007). A snow water equivalent reconstruction model was used to estimate daily grids of snowmelt and nitrate <b>flushing</b> for each <b>basin.</b> From a nitrate mass balance, I found that GLV 4 exhibited high levels of nitrate-export (i. e. greater stream nitrate-export than snowpack nitrate-loading) for all 12 years. In TOK, years with deeper snowpacks exhibited net nitrate-export from the basin, and years with shallower snowpacks exhibited nitrate-retention. Contributing areas of nitrate (i. e. snowpack and soil flushing) were better correlated with the stream nitrate concentration in TOK than in GLV 4. In TOK, as much as 76 % of the variability in the stream nitrate pulse {{could be explained by}} a spatially distributed snowmelt model. In GLV 4, on average only 44 % of the variability in the stream nitrate pulse could be explained by this spatially distributed snowmelt model. These results suggest that GLV 4 may be potentially less sensitive to snowpack N-loading and snowmelt than TOK. As the snowpack regimes of these alpine catchments are altered by climate change and nitrogen-loading to these areas increases over the next century, it will become increasingly important to understand how these fragile ecosystems may react chemically, hydrologically, and ecologically...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCirculation {{in typical}} fjords is {{characterized}} by a shallow brackish layer at the surface over a deep long and narrow saltwater column. This surface layer is responsible for the outflow of water from the fjord and is important for <b>flushing</b> of the <b>basin</b> and water quality maintenance. The vertical structure of circulation and transport is known to be easily disrupted, and we postulate that the stability of fjordal circulation may also be vulnerable to impacts from anthropogenic alterations, such as floating structures, which could constrict the mixing and transport in the upper layers of the water column. First, using simplified fjord geometry and a three-dimensional finite volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM), a baseline examination of tidally averaged current profiles in basins with and without sills is presented. The response, varying from a partially mixed estuary regime to classical fjord conditions matches many fjord-like basins such as those in Puget Sound, Washington. The effect of surface obstruction on tidally averaged currents and residence times was then examined by incorporation of a narrow block in the surface layer of the model across the width of the simplified fjord channel such that normal velocity in the horizontal direction was forced to zero. This block approximated the presence of a floating bridge and was further tested using the geometry of Hood Canal, a fjordal sub-basin with a sill in Puget Sound. The results show that tidally averaged mean outflow under the influence of such a constraint at the water surface could be reduced significantly. In the case of Hood Canal, preliminary results indicate that the presence of the floating bridge might have increased the residence times in the basin by 8 – 13 %, which could be an important factor affecting water quality...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} results of {{three-dimensional}} numerical experiments designed to study the response of a layer of crustal material subjected to convergence through an imposed basal velocity discontinuity and to surface processes (erosion/sedimentation). We focus on the three-dimensional response of the system arising from the finite width of the imposed velocity discontinuity. In particular, we describe the complex structures that develop around the wedge and their interactions with the loading/unloading produced by the surface processes. We show that the pro- and retro-shear zones that develop in a doubly-vergent two-dimensional wedge curve {{around the end of}} the velocity line-discontinuity to merge into the strike-slip structure that naturally develop, i. e. {{as a consequence of the}} imposed boundary conditions, along the edge of the wedge. Along the retro-shear zone the stress orientation rotates along a vertical axis, which implies that the retro-shear zone is a pure thrust along all of its curved length, whereas, along the pro-shear zone stresses rotate along a horizontal axis, which, in turn, implies that the pro-shear zone progressively evolves towards an oblique thrust in its curved section. Furthermore, the outward motion (i. e. perpendicular to the direction of imposed shortening) along the curved section of the retro-shear zone is accommodated by oblique extension along a secondary, kinked structure antithetic to the retro-shear zone. We also show the complex evolution of the wedge when ductile flow and ductile strain softening is activated by increasing the imposed basal temperature. In this situation, the wedge is broader as structures develop at finite distances on either side of the line-discontinuity and its dynamics resembles more that of a ‘vise-like' orogen. At the surface, a flat plateau forms that accumulates sediment from the surrounding actively deforming mountain ranges until a channel breaks through one of the sides and <b>flushes</b> the inward-draining <b>basin</b> of its sedimentary content. The complex numerical models provide a detailed insight into the geometry and complex three-dimensional structures within and at the margins of an orogen, and how they can be affected by erosional processes at the surface...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Ice-ocean {{interactions}} remain {{poorly understood}} despite the growing recognition that they play significant {{roles in the}} complex behavior of glaciers that reach the oceans, which is of broad interest because it contributes substantially {{to the challenge of}} predicting global sea-level rise. This research focuses on the dynamics of sediment accumulation near the calving fronts of tidewater glaciers across a climatic continuum from polar to temperate conditions. Rates and spatial patterns of sediment accumulation merit close attention because they can affect glacier stability by reducing the water depth that controls the calving rate, the surface area available for submarine melting, and the ability of tidewater glaciers to advance into deep water. The sediments produced by these glaciers are also of considerable interest because they record changes in glacial, environmental, and tectonic conditions. In light of the recent, well documented changes in climate and glacier extent along the Antarctic Peninsula through much of the last century, a detailed study was developed to understand how modern sediments have recorded these regional changes. Sediment accumulation rates for sixteen cores collected in fjords across a 15 ° N-S transect from the Antarctic Peninsula to southern Chile were calculated using the decay of naturally occurring radioisotope 210 Pb. Records from the Antarctic Peninsula show surprisingly constant rates of sediment accumulation (1 - 7 mm/yr) throughout the past century despite rapid warming, increase in surface melt, and glacial retreat. Cores from the South Shetland Islands, on the other hand, reveal accelerated sediment accumulation over the past few decades, likely due to warming and an increase in surface melt in this region, which straddles the boundary between subpolar and temperate conditions. In the temperate fjords of southern Chile, sediment accumulates faster (11 - 24 mm/yr). This increase in sediment accumulation with decreasing latitude reflects the gradient from subpolar to temperate climates, and is consistent with glacial erosion being much faster in the very wet, temperate climate of southern Chile than along the colder Antarctic Peninsula. Links between rates of glacier retreat, ice motion, sediment flux, and the evolution of glacial sediment deposits in a temperate setting are explored using a large existing dataset for Columbia Glacier, Alaska and new oceanographic data from the fjord recently exposed by its retreat. High-resolution seismic data indicate that 3. 2 x 10 8 m 3 of sediment has accumulated over the last three decades; this volume corresponds to erosion at 5. 1 ± 1. 8 mm/yr averaged over the entire ~ 1000 km 2 area of the glacier. A numerical model is developed to relate known patterns of sedimentation and changes in the glacier terminus position to the accumulation of sediment in the fjord during the 30 -year period of retreat. The model, which represents both primary sedimentation and secondary reworking, is used to produce a history of the sediment flux from the glacier that is compatible with the observed post-retreat sediment deposit thickness and architecture. The bathymetric history and model results corroborate that the sediment flux increased sixfold within the 1997 - 2000 period; interestingly this increase is not correlated with concurrent changes in glacier dynamics. It is suggested that the increase resulted from the sediment transport capacity of subglacial rivers increasing due to the retreat-related steepening of the glacier surface over a deep subglacial basin. That major variations in the sediment flux can be controlled by changes in subglacial sediment storage, in addition to changes in climate and the erosion rate, adds richness and complexity to the interpretation of the glacimarine sediment record. The sediment-flux model is also applied to Jorge Montt Glacier, a Patagonian tidewater glacier with very similar behavior to Columbia Glacier, but without the detailed record of its retreat history and other complementary glaciological data. Sediment volume calculations for both glaciers indicate that the effective erosion rate necessary to sustain the mean sediment fluxes during their respective periods of retreat is surprisingly similar, ~ 5 mm/yr, despite differences in the geographic, tectonic, and geologic settings. For both rapidly retreating glaciers, the numerical model yields a sediment-flux history that produces sediment packages generally consistent with observed bathymetry and internal stratigraphic architecture. On the time scale of retreat, temporal variations in the modeled sediment flux from both glaciers are not related to concurrent variations in ice velocity, as expected. Rather, changes in the sediment flux are attributed to the tendency for sediment to be <b>flushed</b> from subglacial <b>basins</b> due to the progressive steepening of the glacier terminus during retreat. In both fjords, model results corroborate that sediment accumulates rapidly (> 1 m/yr) near the ice front. In addition, the model suggests that gravity-driven processes are essential for delivering and redistributing sediment within the fjords to create the observed bathymetry and internal stratigraphic architecture...|$|R

Supplement. The detrital composition of the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous Surat Basin sandstones comprises a wide spectrum ranging from quartzarenite through sublitharenite and feldsarenite/lithic feldsarenite to feldspathic litharenite. The sandstones are subdivided into two petrofacies: quartzose having more than 50 % QFR detrital quartz, and labile having less than 50 % detrital quartz. The results of petrographic modal analyses illustrate the characteristically dual-provenance basin-fill pattern of the succession, namely, an andesitic magmatic arc to the east-northeast and a stable craton consisting of plutono-metamorphic terrains and sedimentary and silicic volcanic rocks in older basins and platforms in the flanking cratonic regions. The labile sandstones are derived from the magmatic arc which intermittently shed volcanogenic detritus into the subsiding foreland basin. Conversely, the quartzose facies received predominantly cratonic input (deposited during waning phases of magmatism in the arc and concomitant gentle rise of the foreland) with some additional sediments from the arc which presumably was dissected to varying degrees during these periods of relative tectonic quiescence. Sandstones of the whole Mesozoic succession in the Surat Basin comprise several petrologic cycles each of which begins with a craton-derived quartzose facies and ends with an arcderived quartz-poor labile facies. These cycles reflect the episodic tectonic activity of the arc-craton couplet during basin evolution. [...] A study of the geologic evolution of sandstone reservoir characteristics suggests that compaction and cementation have both reduced primary porosity and permeability to an extent that is dependent on detrital composition and texture. On the other hand, subsequent dissolution of framework grains and cement have created secondary porosity that is present in varying proportions in sandstones of all mineralogic compositions. Two mechanisms are thought to have been especially important in the development of secondary dissolution porosity in the Surat Basin sandstones: firstly, selective framework-grain and interstitial cement dissolution caused by organic maturation products emanating from intercalated mudrocks prior to the onset of hydrocarbon generation; and secondly, meteoric <b>flushing</b> of the <b>basin</b> consequent upon the inception of its artesian character (i. e., as a geographic component of the Great Artesian Basin) in the Tertiary. [...] Diagenetic clay minerals are present in all stratigraphic units, either as individual species or in preferred species associations, and invariably are found to have reduced porosity and permeability. Their effects on reservoir characteristics are a function of the abundance, mineralogy, crystallographic habits, and geometry of distribution of the clay within the reservoir. Some of the clay minerals are fresh-waterand/ or acid-sensitive whereas others are prone to effect a mechanical migration-of-fines problem due to pressure-differential between the formation and the well during drilling, testing and hydrocarbon production. Furthermore, the presence of interstitial clays, whether detrital or authigenic, has drastically increased the proportion of microporosty {{while at the same time}} reduced effective (macro-) porosity - information about which phenomena is crucial for reliable estimation of hydrocarbon reserves. [...] The diagenetic clay minerals in the Surat Basin are found to follow certain stratigraphic and geographic trends: the relatively quartzose sandstones contain mainly kaolinite with some minor smectite, illitesmectite and chlorite whereas formations rich in volcanogenic detritus are characterised by smectite, mixed-layer smectite-illite, and minor kaolinite. [...] A quantitative study employing multiple regression analysis indicates that the present-day porosity of the Surat Basin sandstones is primarily a function of five variables; in order of decreasing importance they are the diagenetic cement, detrital mineralogy, geologic age, burial depth and depositional environments. The present study also confirmed in a quantitative manner the notion and observations of various workers that: in a retro-arc foreland basin, hydrocarbon reservoirs occur preferentially in the craton-derived mineralogically mature quartzose sandstones; and conversely, petroleum source-rocks preferentially comprise the arc-derived finer-grained lithic/labile volcanogenic rocks that are prone to be 'tight' because of their greater physical and chemical reactivities. A literature survey of the Mesozoic Western Canada Basin indicates a similar pattern of association suggesting that the occurrence of hydrocarbons in retro-arc foreland basins probably follows this general pattern world-wide.
