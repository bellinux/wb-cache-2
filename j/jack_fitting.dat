6000|$|... "A wild cat!" [...] cried <b>Jack,</b> <b>fitting</b> {{an arrow}} to his bow, and {{discharging}} it so hastily that {{he missed the}} animal, and hit the earth about half-a-foot {{to one side of}} it. To our surprise, the wild cat did not fly, but walked slowly towards the arrow and snuffed at it.|$|E
60|$|The earl's {{orders to}} the tailors were {{peremptory}} to lose no time in <b>fitting</b> <b>Jack</b> with an undress suit, and in twenty-four hours {{he was able to}} join the mess of the young officers and volunteers who accompanied the general. These were all young men of good family; and having heard how Jack had saved the ship from mutiny, they received him among them with great heartiness, which was increased when they found that he was well educated and the son of a gentleman.|$|R
2500|$|Jack {{renamed the}} yard the Chester Shipbuilding Company, {{and used it}} mostly for {{converting}} freighters into oil tankers. Lacking steel fabrication facilities of his own, Jack contracted with the American Bridge Company in Pittsburgh to supply the plates for the ships' hulls [...] and oil tanks. This innovation in building ships from prefabricated parts manufactured in distant locations {{was made possible by}} Jack's simplified hull designs, which made as much use as possible of flat steel plates that could be easily produced and which required a minimum of post-production <b>fitting.</b> <b>Jack's</b> prefabricated method would later be emulated by the Emergency Fleet Corporation in its emergency wartime shipyards.|$|R
50|$|A {{bottle jack}} or whiskey jack is a jack which resembles a bottle in shape, having a {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} neck. Within is a vertical lifting ram with a support pad of some kind fixed to the top. The jack may be hydraulic or work by screw action. In the hydraulic version the hydraulic ram emerges from the body vertically by hydraulic pressure provided by a pump either on the baseplate or at a remote location via a pressure hose. With a single action piston the lift range is somewhat limited, so its use for lifting vehicles is limited to those with a relatively high clearance. For lifting structures such as houses the hydraulic interconnection of multiple vertical jacks through valves enables the even distribution of forces while enabling close control of the lift. The screw version of the bottle jack works by turning a large nut running on the threaded vertical ram at {{the neck of the}} body. The nut has gear teeth and is turned by a bevel gear spigotted to the body, the bevel gear being turned manually by a <b>jack</b> handle <b>fitting</b> into a square socket. The ram may have a second screwed ram within it, which doubles the lifting range telescopically.|$|R
