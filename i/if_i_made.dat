Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E

2500|$|Mahan {{also played}} for Harvard's varsity {{baseball}} team for three years. In {{an exhibition game}} {{in the spring of}} 1916, Mahan pitched a shutout against the Boston Red Sox, the year after the Red Sox team featuring Babe Ruth and Tris Speaker won the 1915 World Series. [...] Mahan was offered a contract by several major league clubs, but none was willing to meet his demand for a salary of $6,500. Mahan described his negotiations {{in an interview with the}} Oakland Tribune:"I had a chance first to go with the Boston Red Sox when I was in my senior year at Harvard. They said to name my price and I named $6,500. They thought it was too much. Then the Detroit club made an offer to me but they too thought I had a gold-brick scheme. The Chicago White Sox were willing to give me a good contract with a bonus <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> good, but the risk was not worth the undertaking. I considered the Braves more seriously than any other team but my negotiations there too were not satisfactory ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|I told Foster I {{should hold}} {{him for the}} money, and the old man, Van Triplett, said we acted as if we could not trust him, and gave {{some of the money}} back, and then said he would give us a chance to win it , so Foster turned the right card and [...] started to give him the money, but said, ‘Supposing you had bet that in earnest, did you have the money to put up?’ Foster said, ‘No,’ and turning to me said, ‘You have the money,’ and I said no, I did not have any money; that he took it all, but he said, ‘You have some dust,’ and wanted me to get it just to show the old man that we had the money in case the bet had been a real one. Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man {{said he did not know}} if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> a noise it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E
