5|$|Abel Starkey (died September 28, 1827) was {{a convicted}} {{counterfeiter}} whose death is {{closely tied to}} Old Newgate Prison after fatally falling during an escape attempt {{the night before the}} close of the prison. Starkey was from Roxbury, Massachusetts and became a counterfeiter. Members of a counterfeiting ring had eluded authorities for years, but they finally discovered the secret third attic of a lightning splitter home. Starkey was arrested, tried and convicted of counterfeiting. He was sentenced to a term of twenty years in the prison, where he would amass a sum of money. <b>His</b> <b>attempt</b> to escape ended in his death, accounts of Starkey's attempt continued to be popular in reference to the prison's history.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten years}} as the vicar, Wheelwright was {{suspended}} in 1633 following <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> to sell his Bilsby ministry back to its patron to get funds to travel to New England. Instead of procuring the necessary funds, {{he was convicted of}} simony (selling church offices), and completely removed from his office. After his removal from Bilsby he was likely in Laceby in June 1633 where his daughter Elizabeth was baptized. He then preached for a short while at Belleau, Lincolnshire, but was soon silenced by the Anglican authorities for his Puritan opinions, and began making plans for his emigration from England. Wheelwright left England in 1636 with his second wife, her mother Susanna Hutchinson, and his five living children.|$|E

5|$|Andrew II {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to occupy the}} neighboring Principality of Halych. His son, Béla, persuaded a group of Cumans to accept AndrewII's suzerainty in 1228 and established a new march in Oltenia (known as the Banate of Szörény) in 1231. Béla IV succeeded his father in 1235. <b>His</b> <b>attempt</b> to reacquire crown lands alienated by his predecessors created a deep rift between the monarch and the lords just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across the Eurasian steppes.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> {{to balance}} the budget, Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration.

When <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful in <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> to sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He {{had set up a}} meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E
5|$|Clemson {{received}} Georgia Tech's kickoff with 1:20 {{remaining in}} the game. On the Tigers' first play, they committed a 10-yard penalty. Two incomplete passes followed from Parker, who then completed an 18-yard throw to Xavier Dye. This set up a fourth-and-two for the Tigers, who needed to gain a first down to keep their potential game-winning drive going. Instead, Parker was stymied in <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> {{to run for the}} needed yards, and Clemson turned the ball over on downs. Georgia Tech's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and ensured their 39–34 victory.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the Anarchy, in which the Empress Matilda and Stephen fought for control of England, the castle was held by William le Gros, the bishop of Winchester and {{supporter}} of Stephen. When Henry II came to the throne in 1153, he took back the castle and took steps to improve the condition of Southampton castle, as part of <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> to improve the general standard of security in the south. At this time, Southampton was considered a key fortification, classed alongside other important castles such as the Tower of London, Windsor, Oxford, Lincoln and Winchester.|$|E
