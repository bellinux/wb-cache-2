5|$|Under Knight Ridder, The <b>Inquirer</b> {{continued}} to be editorially independent. However, conservative commentators have labeled The <b>Inquirer</b> left leaning, and the paper has not endorsed a Republican candidate for President of the United States since Gerald Ford in 1976. Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, groups supportive of Israel such as the Zionist Organization of America often accused The <b>Inquirer</b> of being anti-Israel. At the same time, Edward S. Herman, a University of Pennsylvania media analyst, has written many articles accusing The <b>Inquirer</b> of having given in to conservative pressure and including a conservative slant in the paper's reporting and editorial page. In 2006, The <b>Inquirer</b> {{became one of the}} only major United States newspapers to print one of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. Afterwards, protesting the printing of the cartoon, Muslims picketed outside The <b>Inquirer</b> Building.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor Elverson Patenôtre ordered cuts {{throughout}} the paper, {{but was not}} really interested in managing it and ownership was soon put up for sale. Cyrus Curtis and Curtis-Martin Newspapers Inc. bought the newspaper on March 5, 1930. Curtis died a year later and his stepson-in-law, John Charles Martin, took charge. Martin merged The <b>Inquirer</b> with another paper, the Public Ledger, but the Great Depression hurt Curtis-Martin Newspapers and the company defaulted in payments of maturity notes. Subsequently, ownership of The <b>Inquirer</b> returned to the Patenôtre family and Elverson Corp. Charles A. Taylor {{was elected president of}} The <b>Inquirer</b> Co. and ran the paper until it was sold to Moses L. Annenberg in 1936. During the period between Elverson Jr. and Annenberg The <b>Inquirer</b> stagnated, its editors ignoring most of the poor economic news of the Depression. The lack of growth allowed J. David Stern's newspaper, The Philadelphia Record, to surpass The <b>Inquirer</b> in circulation and become the largest newspaper in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers local {{coverage}} area includes Philadelphia, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey.

In September 1994 The <b>Inquirer</b> and WPHL-TV co-produced a 10:00p.m. newscast called <b>Inquirer</b> News Tonight. The show lasted {{a year before}} WPHL-TV took complete control over the program and was renamed WB17 News at Ten. In 2004, The <b>Inquirer</b> formed a partnership with Philadelphia's NBC station, WCAU, giving the paper access to WCAU's weather forecasts while also contributing to news segments throughout the day.|$|E

5|$|Under Moses Annenberg, The <b>Inquirer</b> turned around. Annenberg added new features, {{increased}} {{staff and}} held promotions to increase circulation. By November 1938 Inquirers weekday circulation increased to 345,422 from 280,093 in 1936. During {{that same period}} the Records circulation had dropped to 204,000 from 328,322. In 1939, Annenberg was charged with income tax evasion. Annenberg pleaded guilty before his trial and was sent to prison where he died in 1942. Upon Moses Annenberg's death, his son, Walter Annenberg, took over. Not long after, in 1947, the Record {{went out of business}} and The Philadelphia <b>Inquirer</b> became Philadelphia's only major daily morning newspaper. While still trailing behind Philadelphia's largest newspaper, the Evening Bulletin, The <b>Inquirer</b> continued to be profitable. In 1948, Walter Annenberg expanded the <b>Inquirer</b> Building with a new structure that housed new printing presses for The <b>Inquirer</b> and, during the 1950s and 1960s, Annenberg's other properties, Seventeen and TV Guide. In 1957 Annenberg bought the Philadelphia Daily News and combined the Daily News facilities with The Inquirers.|$|E
5|$|After Elverson's {{death in}} 1911, his son {{by his wife}} Sallie Duvall, James Elverson Jr. took charge. Under Elverson Jr., the {{newspaper}} continued to grow, eventually needing to move again. Elverson Jr. bought land at Broad and Callowhill Streets and built the eighteen-story Elverson Building, {{now known as the}} <b>Inquirer</b> Building. The first <b>Inquirer</b> issue printed at the building came out on July 13, 1925. Elverson Jr. died a few years later in 1929 and his sister, Eleanor Elverson, Mrs. Jules Patenôtre, took over.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{retired in}} 1859 and was succeeded {{by his son}} William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed {{the name of the}} {{newspaper}} to its current name, The Philadelphia <b>Inquirer.</b> Harding, in an attempt to increase circulation, cut the price of the paper, began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the American Civil War. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of The <b>Inquirer</b> were often distributed to Union soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked The Philadelphia <b>Inquirer</b> to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. The Philadelphia <b>Inquirer</b> supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper's war coverage was accurate.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} The <b>Inquirer</b> was founded, with {{competition}} from eight established daily newspapers, {{lack of funds}} forced Norvell and Walker to sell the newspaper to publisher and United States Gazette associate editor Jesper Harding. After Harding acquired The Pennsylvania <b>Inquirer,</b> it was briefly published as an afternoon paper before returning to its original morning format in January 1830. Under Harding, in 1829, The <b>Inquirer</b> moved from its original location between Front and Second Streets to between Second and Third Streets. When Harding bought and merged the Morning Journal in January 1830, the newspaper was moved to South Second Street. Ten years later The <b>Inquirer</b> again was moved, this time to its own building {{at the corner of}} Third Street and Carter's Alley. Harding expanded The Inquirers content and the paper soon grew into a major Philadelphian newspaper. The expanded content included the addition of fiction, and in 1840, Harding gained rights to publish several Charles Dickens novels for which Dickens was paid a significant amount. At the time the common practice was to pay little or nothing for the rights of foreign authors' works.|$|E
