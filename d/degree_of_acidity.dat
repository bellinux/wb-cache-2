The influence of these factors results in an observed optimum photoactivity at pH 4. 5 for the RuP–NiP system. The electron transfer from photo-reduced RuP to NiP is efficient and independent of the pH value of the medium. At pH 4. 5, the efficiency of the system is limited by the poor protonation of NiP, which inhibits its ability to reduce protons to hydrogen.

40|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder characterized by oxidative stress and CNS iron deposition. Ceruloplasmin is an extracellular ferroxidase that regulates cellular iron loading and export, and hence protects tissues from oxidative damage. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis, we investigated ceruloplasmin patterns in the CSF of human Parkinson's disease patients. Parkinson's disease ceruloplasmin profiles proved more acidic than those found in healthy controls and in other human neurological diseases (peripheral neuropathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease); <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidity</b> correlated with patients' pathological grading. Applying an unsupervised pattern recognition procedure to the two-dimensional electrophoresis images, we identified representative pathological clusters. In vitro oxidation of CSF in two-dimensional electrophoresis generated a ceruloplasmin shift resembling that observed in Parkinson's disease and co-occurred {{with an increase in}} protein carbonylation. Likewise, increased protein carbonylation was observed in Parkinson's disease CSF, and the same modification was directly identified in these samples on ceruloplasmin. These results indicate that ceruloplasmin oxidation contributes to pattern modification in Parkinson's disease. From the functional point of view, ceruloplasmin oxidation caused a decrease in ferroxidase activity, which in turn promotes intracellular iron retention in neuronal cell lines as well as in primary neurons, which are more sensitive to iron accumulation. Accordingly, the presence of oxidized ceruloplasmin in Parkinson's disease CSF might be used as a marker for oxidative damage and might provide new insights into the underlying pathological mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Com o fim de selecionar fermentos que produzissem vinhos com grau alcoólico satisfatório e com baixo teor de acidez volátil e aldeído acético, estudou-se o comportamento de cinco leveduras, escolhidas dentre 25 já ensaiadas anteriormente. Os fermentos I. A. 78 e I. A. 199 mostraram-se bastante promissores, podendo ser utilizados com sucesso nas cantinas industriais. Experiments were {{accomplished}} on laboratory scale, {{to observe}} the behavior of five yeast strains in the wine fermentation. The statistical analysis of the results point out that {{two of them are}} very promising to be used on a large scale by the winemakers. The strains I. A. 78 and I. A. 199 produce wines with a reasonable alcohol concentration, besides a low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> volatile <b>acidity</b> and acetaldehyde...|$|R
40|$|Record from National and International {{literature}} from 1966 to 2006, six genera of Zygnemataceae recorded from different districts of Bangladesh. Among these, Mougeotia Agardh are represented 23 taxa, Sirogonium Kützing four taxa, Spirogyra Link 66 taxa, Sirocladium Randhawa, Temnogametum W. & G. S. West solitary taxa each and Zygnema Agardh 12 taxa. Maximum {{diversity of the}} taxa was observed in central part of Bangladesh. About 80 % habitats were lentic type, while the others are of lotic type. In Bangladesh all the taxa of Zygnemataceae are reported {{to be found in}} freshwater habitats and found all the season specially in winter period. Distribution pattern and habitats of Zygnemataceae reveal that they are capable of growing in diversified habitat including varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> alkalinity, <b>acidity</b> (pH = 6 - 7. 5) ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the microtensile bond strength (μTBS) of three self-etching adhesive systems with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidity</b> (Clearfil SE Bond, One-Up Bond F, and Xeno III) to dentin prepared {{with three different}} methods. Methods: Forty-five extracted human third molars were ground flat to expose occlusal dentin and polished with 600 -grit abrasive paper. All teeth were randomly divided into three groups according to the preparation method: baseline surface (AP# 600), steel fissure bur (SB) and regular grit diamond bur (DB). Dentin surfaces were bonded {{with one of the}} three adhesive systems; then resin composite was incrementally built up. After storage in 37 °C water for 24 hours, specimens were cut and trimmed to create an hourglass shape with cross sectional area of approximate 1 mm 2. All specimens were subjected to microtensile bond strength testing. The bond strength data were analyzed with one and two-way ANOVA and Dunnett Multiple comparisons test at P< 0. 05. Results: For Xeno III and One-Up Bond F, the μTBS to dentin prepared with the different methods were not significantly different. However, the μTBS of Clearfil SE Bond to dentin prepared with the diamond bur was significantly lower than the other preparation methods. Xeno III produced the lowest μTBS that were statistically different from the other adhesive systems when each preparation method was compared (P< 0. 01). SEM observation of the prepared dentin surfaces showed that the diamond bur group produced a thicker smear layer that followed by steel bur and 600 -grit paper. Therefore, the smear layer from diamond burs had a greater influence in decreasing μTBS of Clearfil SE Bond that has the weakest acidity self-etching adhesive systems evaluated. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
