5|$|Arlington {{was used}} for select scenes in the movie Sugar & Spice.

5|$|Stone had a love scene {{removed from}} the final cut of The Quick and the Dead before the film's release in the United States.

5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1930s {{there were a}} variety of spaniels in Moscow, Leningrad and Sverdlovsk that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> any {{specific}} spaniel breed standard, but were not yet standardised into the modern Russian Spaniel. Purposeful breeding after World War II led to the original Russian Spaniel standard in 1951. Further revised standards were issued in 1966 and 2000.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Kon {{released}} the 13-episode television series Paranoia Agent, in which Kon revisits {{the theme of}} the blending of imagination and reality, as well as working in additional social themes.

5|$|In November 2016, Manning made {{a formal}} {{petition}} to President Obama to reduce her 35-year sentence {{to the six}} years of time she had already served. On December 10, 2016, a White House petition to commute her sentence reached the minimum 100,000 signatures required for an official response. Lawyers familiar with clemency applications stated in December 2016 that the pardon was unlikely to happen; the request <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> into the usual criteria.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were mostly positive, with most reviewers commenting that the book was well {{researched}} and provided a solid history of the show.

5|$|The story {{which became}} the director's {{follow-up}} film The Hateful Eight was first attempted as a paperback novel sequel to Django Unchained titled Django in White Hell. Tarantino decided, however, that the character's established morals <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> {{the tone of the}} developing story so he began re-writing it as an original screenplay with no connection to the earlier film. He has expressed a desire to write a series of Django sequel novels.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity in the script, as the vulgar {{language}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> {{his vision of}} the 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nationwide}} attention the incident received, the Mussel Slough Tragedy is not remembered much today {{as well as}} later gunfights such as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Richard Maxwell Brown argues in No Duty to Retreat that the Mussel Slough shootout <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> the mold of the gunfight/hero myth, which usually ignores such factors as ideology, and social and economic conflict, thus not implanting it in the lore of the American Old West.|$|E

5|$|During {{battles in}} Soviet Union in 1941 and 1942, the Waffen-SS {{suffered}} enormous casualties. The LSSAH and Das Reich lost over half their troops to illness and combat casualties. In need of recruits, Himmler began to accept soldiers that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> the original SS racial profile. In early 1942, SS-Leibstandarte, SS-Totenkopf, and SS-Das Reich were withdrawn to the West to refit and {{were converted to}} Panzergrenadier divisions. The SS-Panzer Corps returned to the Soviet Union in 1943 and participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov in February and March.|$|E
5|$|East Timorese animist {{belief systems}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> with Indonesia's {{constitutional}} monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity. Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese mass {{was replaced by}} Indonesian mass. Before the invasion, only 20 percent of East Timorese were Roman Catholics, and by the 1980s, 95 percent were registered as Catholics. With over 90 percent Catholic population, East Timor is currently {{one of the most}} densely Catholic countries in the world.|$|E
5|$|In July 1960, Abebe won {{his first}} {{marathon}} in Addis Ababa. A month later he won again in Addis Ababa {{with a time of}} 2:21:23, which was faster than the existing Olympic record held by Emil Zátopek. Niskanen entered Abebe Bikila and Abebe Wakgira in the marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympics, which would be run on September 10. In Rome, Abebe Bikila purchased new running shoes, but they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> well and gave him blisters. He consequently decided to run barefoot instead.|$|E

5|$|Redhead and Smith {{placed the}} genus in the Strophariaceae, as {{the biology of}} the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> well in a more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied to this group. Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister {{to the rest of}} the family.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} of Banksia attenuata within the genus are unclear. When Carl Meissner published his infrageneric arrangement of Banksia in 1856, he placed B.attenuata in section Eubanksia because its inflorescence is a spike {{rather than a}} domed head, and in series Salicinae, a large series that is now considered quite heterogeneous. This series was discarded in the 1870 arrangement of George Bentham; instead, B.attenuata was placed in section Cyrtostylis, a group of species which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> easily {{into one of the}} other sections.|$|E

Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> the energy of the album.|$|E
