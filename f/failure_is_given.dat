40|$|Abstract—Telecommunications {{networks}} heavily rely on {{the physical}} infrastructure and, are therefore, vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes or floods, {{as well as to}} physical attacks, such as an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) attack. Largescale disasters are likely to destroy network equipment and to severely affect interdependent systems such as the power-grid. In turn, long-term outage of the power-grid might cause additional failures to the telecommunication network. In this paper, we model an attack as a disk around its epicenter, and provide efficient algorithms to find vulnerable points within the network, under various metrics. In addition, we consider the case in which multiple disasters happen simultaneously and provide an approximation algorithm to find the points which cause the most significant destruction. Finally, since a network element does not always fail, even when it is close to the attack’s epicenter, we consider a simple probabilistic model in which the probability of a network element <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> <b>given.</b> Under this model, we tackle the cases of single and multiple attacks and develop algorithms that identify potential points where an attack is likely to cause a significant damage.

40|$|In {{the initial}} {{alignment}} process of strapdown {{inertial navigation system}} (SINS), large initial misalignment angles always bring nonlinear problem, which causes alignment failure when the classical linear error model and standard Kalman filter are used. In this paper, the problem of large misalignment angles in SINS initial alignment is investigated, and the key reason for alignment <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> <b>given</b> as the state covariance from Kalman filter cannot represent the true one during the steady filtering process. According to the analysis, an alignment method for SINS based on multiresetting the state covariance matrix of Kalman filter is designed to deal with large initial misalignment angles, in which classical linear error model and standard Kalman filter are used, but the state covariance matrix should be multireset before the steady process until large misalignment angles are decreased to small ones. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation and car test, and {{the results indicate that}} the proposed method can fulfill initial alignment with large misalignment angles effectively and the alignment accuracy of the proposed method is as precise as that of alignment with small misalignment angles...|$|E

40|$|A {{distributed}} {{hash table}} (DHT) {{is a type}} of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) network that, like traditional hash tables, maps keys to values. Unlike traditional hash tables, however, the data is distributed across a network with each node being responsible for a particular range of keys. Numerous other DHTs have been presented and have become the cornerstone of wildly popular P 2 P file-sharing applications, such as BitTorrent. Each of these DHTs trades-off the number of pointers maintained per node with the overhead and lookup time; storing more pointers decreases the lookup time at the expense of increased overhead. A Grouped Hamming Network (GHN), the overlay network presented in this thesis, allows for the number of pointers per node to be any increasing function of n, P(n) = Ω(log n). The system presented assumes that nodes fail independently and uniformly at random with some probability q = 1 − p. Three different schemes for routing in a GHN are presented. For each routing scheme a theoretical estimate on the probability of <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> <b>given</b> and optimal configurations in terms of n and P(n) are given. Simulations of GHNs with various configurations indicate that the given estimates are indeed accurate for reasonable values of q and that the optimal configurations are accurate...|$|E
40|$|Adhesion at polymer-solid {{interfaces}} was explored {{for a new}} bio-based {{pressure sensitive}} adhesive (PSA) in terms of sticker groups φX on the polymer phase, receptor groups φY on the solid surface and the bond strength of the sticker-receptor X-Y acid-base interaction, χ. The polymer-solid interface restructuring models of Gong and Lee et al were extended with new percolation models of entanglements and interface strength to determine the optimal sticker group concentration φ*X. For the general case where φY and χ are constant, it is predicted that when φX φ*X, failure occurs cohesively in a polymer-polymer interface adjacent to the solid and the strength decreases as G 1 c ~ φ*X/φX. The switch from adhesive to cohesive failure can {{be understood in terms}} of the changes in the chain conformations of the adhered chains and their decreasing interpenetration Xi with the bulk chains, via Xi ~ 1 /r, where r = χφXφY. The optimal value of φX which maximizes the adhesion and determines the mode of <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> <b>given</b> by φ*X ≈ 0. 129 /C∝, and for typical values of the characteristic ratio C ∝ in the range 7 - 20, φ*X ≈ 1 % mole fraction, corresponding to about 2 sticker groups per entanglement molecular weight Me.

40|$|The {{realization}} of the Semantic Web vision, in which computational logic has a prominent role, has stimulated {{a lot of research}} on combining rules and ontologies, which are formulated in different formalisms, into a framework that is more useful for describing semantic content. In particular, combining logic programming with the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which is a standard based on description logics, emerged as an important issue for linking the Rules and Ontology Layers of the Semantic Web. Non-monotonic description logic programs (or dl-programs) were introduced for such a combination, in which a pair (L,P) of a description logic knowledge base L and a set of rules P with negation as <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> <b>given</b> a model-based semantics that generalizes the answer set semantics of logic programs. In this paper, we reconsider dl-programs and present a well-founded semantics for them as an analog for the other main semantics of logic programs. It generalizes the canonical definition of the well-founded semantics based on unfounded sets, and, as we show, lifts many of the well-known properties from ordinary logic programs to dl-programs. Among these properties: our semantics amounts to a partial model approximating the answer set semantics, which yields for positive and stratified dl-programs a total model coinciding with the answer set semantics; it has polynomial data complexity provided the access to the description logi...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: Experimental {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that constant intravenous infusion would be preferable to conventional intermittent bolus administration of beta-lactam antibiotics for serious Gram-negative infections. Severe melioidosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei infection) carries a mortality of 40 % despite treatment with high dose ceftazidime. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of continuous infusion of ceftazidime vs intermittent bolus dosing in septicaemic melioidosis. METHODS: Patients with suspected septicaemic melioidosis were randomised to receive ceftazidime 40 mg kg- 1 8 hourly by bolus injection or 4 mg kg- 1 h- 1 by constant infusion following a 12 mg kg- 1 priming dose to perform estimation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients studied 16 (59 %) died. Twenty patients had cultures positive for B. pseudomallei of whom 12 (60 %) died. The median MIC 90 of B. pseudomallei was 2 mg l- 1, giving a target concentration CT, of 8 mg l- 1. The median (range) estimated total apparent volume of distribution, systemic clearance and terminal elimination half-lives of ceftazidime were 0. 468 (0. 241 - 0. 573) l kg- 1, 0. 058 (0. 005 - 0. 159) l kg- 1 h- 1 and 7. 74 (1. 95 - 44. 71) h, respectively. Clearance of ceftazidime and creatinine clearance were correlated closely (r = 0. 71; P < 0. 001) and there was no evidence of significant nonrenal clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Simulations based on these data and the ceftazidime sensitivity of the B. pseudomallei isolates indicated that administration by constant infusion would allow significant dose reduction and cost saving. With conventional 8 h intermittent dosing to patients with normal renal function, plasma ceftazidime concentrations could fall below the target concentration but this would be unlikely with a constant infusion. Correction for renal failure which is common in these patients is Clearance = k * creatinine clearance where k = 0. 072. Calculation of a loading dose gives median (range) values of loading dose, DL of 3. 7 mg kg- 1 (1. 9 - 4. 6) and infusion rate I = 0. 46 mg kg h- 1 (0. 04 - 1. 3) (which equals 14. 8 mg kg- 1 day- 1).

40|$|The present research, {{triggered}} by the potential development of offshore oil exploitation off Newfoundland coast, concludes {{a part of a}} research programme, at Memorial University, St. John's, Nfld, Canada, in which the use of lightweight aggregate concrete (LAC) and steel fibres reinforced lightweight aggregate concrete (SFRLAC) as structural materials for potential Arcticand sub-Arctic structures was investigated. The work was financed from NSERC Grant # 31176. [...] The thesis starts with the literature review and introduction in Chapter 1, and consists of two main parts. The first one, Chapters 2 and 3, presents a few relevant rheological and hardened state properties of lightweight aggregate concrete (LAC) and steel fibre reinforced lightweight aggregate concrete (SFRLAC); also in Chapter 2, the composition of concrete was determined to meet the specifications, and steel fibres were added by a trial-and-error method to obtain the most suitable SFRLAC. The second part, Chapters 4 to 6, includes the results of the theoretical and experimental analysis of the behaviour of the LAC and SFRLAC plates subjected to static loading. In Chapter 4, the design of the plates, based on the available semi-empirical methods is presented; in addition, a finite element computer code used in this work is introduced, and its predictions are compared with the experimental results in Chapter 6. The laboratory experimental work is presented in Chapters 2, 3, 5 and 6. [...] The behaviour of the plates with regard to deformation, strain, cracking pattern, ultimate capacity, and modes of <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> <b>given</b> in Chapter 6; the effect of varying the shear and flexural reinforcement on the behaviour of the plates was also investigated. The comparison of theoretical predictions, as described in Chapter 4, using the actual properties of the concrete and reinforcement, with the experimental results is also given. [...] Throughout the thesis, one main purpose was to assess the suitability of the LAC and SFRLAC to cold ocean environment (COE), simulated under laboratory conditions. Another main purpose of the work was to assess the shear capacity of the plates, and to improve it. The shear capacity is calculated, as presented in Chapters 4 and 6, according to conventional and modified conventional reinforced concrete theory. The fibres contribution to the behaviour of the plates was also investigated. [...] It is concluded in Chapter 7, that LAC, and especially SFRLAC, are suitable structural materials for Arctic and sub-Arctic offshore structures, possessing suitable structural behaviour...|$|E
