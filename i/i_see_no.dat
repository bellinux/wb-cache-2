25|$|A {{performance}} of Faust begins with Christine singing {{the lead role}} of Marguerite ("Ah! Do I Hear My Lover's Voice?"). However, during the song there's an unscheduled blackout and when the lights come back up, Christine has disappeared. The show quickly adjourns {{and the rest of}} the cast search high and low for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns into the audience ("No Sign! <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>No</b> Sign!"). But to no avail. The scene switches to The Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind ("Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright").|$|E

500|$|In 1874, Wallace {{visited the}} spirit {{photographer}} Frederick Hudson. A photograph {{of him with}} his deceased mother was produced and Wallace declared the photograph genuine, declaring [...] "even if he had by some means obtained possession of all the photographs ever taken of my mother, {{they would not have}} been of the slightest use to him in the manufacture of these pictures. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> escape from the conclusion that some spiritual being, acquainted with my mother's various aspects during life, produced these recognisable impressions on the plate." [...] However, Hudson's photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in 1872.|$|E

500|$|In a major address, Grant stated: [...] "The {{building}} of rail-roads and the access thereby given {{to all the}} agricultural and mineral {{regions of the country}} is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians. No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is they do not get on together, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom, and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life, and the rights of others, dangerous to society. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations...and giving them absolute protection there." ...|$|E
500|$|Garcia {{returned}} to the Indians in 1949. A newspaper article predicted that Garcia might fill big needs in the Cleveland bullpen. Garcia saw action as a starter and as a relief pitcher that year, starting 20 of his 41 regular season appearances. He finished his rookie season with a 14–5 record, a league-leading 2.36 ERA, 94 strikeouts and five shutouts. Fellow pitcher Bob Feller said, [...] "From the beginning, Mike was a sneaky quick pitcher. For a big guy, he was certainly mobile." [...] One year removed from his rookie season, expectations from Indians General Manager Hank Greenberg and pitching coach Mel Harder were for Garcia to become a key piece of the Indians' rotation. [...] "Garcia has all the potentialities of a really great pitcher. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> reason he should not reach greatness this season", Greenberg said. Garcia finished the 1950 season 11–11.|$|E
500|$|Mosley won {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the FIA on 3 June 2008, with 103 votes in support and 55 against, with seven abstentions and four invalid votes. Several clubs, including the ADAC, AAA and KNAF considered withdrawal from the FIA after the decision. Other formerly critical organisations have since said that they will accept the outcome of the vote and now wish to move on. In July 2008, Mosley won a High Court legal case against the News of the World for invasion of privacy. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Eady, said there was: [...] "no evidence that the gathering on March 28, 2008 was intended to be an enactment of Nazi behavior or adoption of any of its attitudes. Nor was it in fact. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> genuine basis at all for the suggestion that the participants mocked the victims of the Holocaust." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{cultural}} historian Caroline Dakers {{wrote that}} the Tower House was a [...] "pledge {{to the spirit of}} Gothic in an area given over to Queen Anne". Burges loathed the Queen Anne style prevalent in Holland Park, writing that it: [...] "like other fashions... will have its day, I do not call it Queen Anne art, for, unfortunately <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> art in it at all". His inspirations were French Gothic domestic architecture of the thirteenth century and more recent models drawn from the work of the nineteenth-century French architect Viollet-le-Duc. Architectural historians Gavin Stamp and Colin Amery considered that the building [...] "sums up Burges in miniature. Although clearly a redbrick suburban house, it is massive, picturesquely composed, with a prominent tourelle for the staircase which is surmounted by a conical roofed turret." [...] Burges's neighbour Luke Fildes described the house as a [...] "model modern house of moderately large size in the 13th-century style built to show what may be done for 19th-century everyday wants".|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>no</b> courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E
