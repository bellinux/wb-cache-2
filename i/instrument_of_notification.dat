Esta conquista propicia o relato da evolução do veículo de divulgação da Sociedade Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia que se iniciou em 1973. Até 1984 o Boletim foi um veículo de divulgação, transformando-se em seguida em revista científica. Em 1999 mudou de título, modernizou-se e passou a ser também o órgão oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Transplante de Medula Óssea. Para o entendimento da referida conquista foi realizado um histórico sobre o Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), {{principal}} base de dados internacional, e a SciELO, base de dados {{nacional de}} recuperação de linha. Ao final o autor apresenta uma reflexão sobre o futuro da RBHH e os caminhos que o periódico deve trilhar com a finalidade de aumentar a sua importância no meio científico. The Brazilian Hematology and Hemotherapy Journal (Revista Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia) {{was included in}} the data base of Scientific Electronic library on-line (SciELO) in October of 2001. This achievement encourages a historic registration of the means by which the performance of the Brazilian Hematology and Hemotherapy Society, which began in 1973, has been divulged. Until 1984, the Boletim was the <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of the work of the society which soon became a scientific journal. In 1999, the title was changed and the journal was modernized. At this time it also became the official publication of the Brazilian Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation. To better understand the importance of this victory, a historic review of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), the main international data base and SciELO, the national data base was assembled. Finally the author reflects {{on the future of the}} Journal and the paths that it should follow with the objective of increasing the periodicals importance in the scientific world...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis had the {{objective}} {{to identify and}} analyze situations of illnesses and accidents in the workplace {{as well as their}} repercussions in the worker’s lives. It started from the exploratory and descriptive qualitative approach with theoretical-epistemological critical and dialectical references in order to contribute to researches referring to the worker’s health through studies, policies and strategies that aim at the guarantee of rights, social inclusion and emancipation. The subjects that constituted this research were ill and injured workers in consequence of work, originally from the municipality of Porto Alegre/ Rio Grande do Sul State, from 2007 to 2010. The study has involved the documental research of the notifications held in the Worker’s Health Notification System (SIST) of the State Bureau of Health of Rio Grande do Sul (SES/RS), has mapped the notification tools of work related accidents and illnesses used by the sector services to characterize the structure of the worker’s health care services, the demands in the Worker’s Health Policies and their ways of access and of service to the population, factors that enable or hamper the access to the social rights, and has also outlined the profile of the injured and sick workers by identifying the conditions that might be influencing situations of accidents and morbimortality. A form type instrument has also been applied, through interviews with the workers selected for the sample, identifying and analyzing the repercussions of the accident and/or illness in consequence of work in the workers’ lives. The survey findings show that the Notification System in Workers Health (SIST) although it constituting in an important <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of illness and accidents related to work, aiming to address the under reporting by health surveillance of workers; contradictory in practice, this has been accomplished partially with results in reducing the number of notifications, as well as filling in incomplete information, thus hampering the knowledge about the reality of injuries resulting from work. Also the study noted the absence of specific information, especially about the repercussions of the illness and accidents at work are focused on workers without direct impact on family relationships, affective, in the last analysis, in social life. In this context, which constitutes a serious social problem, actions are necessary for the production of more detailed information, to identify conditions that may be influencing the illness and accidents at work, considering that the occurrence of these conditions imply a thorough investigation to unveil the network of factorsc involved that contributed to its occurrence. Furthermore, the study points to the urgency of wide discussion in the national policy in occupational health, looking, for example, the impact that illness and accidents at work in relationships have, that is, beyond the working life. Finally, the study concluded that the fear of having an accident and worsening of the disease is closely related to the maintenance of the workplace, showing the importance that the work has {{in the lives of the}} interviewees in relation to recognition and guarantee of citizenship. A presente tese teve por objetivo identificar e analisar situações de adoecimentos e acidentes de trabalho e suas repercussões na vida do trabalhador. Partiu da abordagem qualitativa do tipo exploratório e descritivo com referencial teórico-epistemológico dialético-crítico a fim de contribuir com pesquisas referentes à saúde do trabalhador por meio de estudos, políticas e estratégias que visem à garantia de direitos, inclusão e emancipação social. Constituíram sujeitos desta pesquisa trabalhadores adoecidos e acidentados em decorrência do trabalho, oriundos do município de Porto Alegre/Rio Grande do Sul, no período de 2007 a 2010. O estudo envolveu a pesquisa documental das notificações contidas no Sistema de Notificações em Saúde do Trabalhador (SIST) da Secretaria Estadual da Saúde do Rio Grande do Sul (SES/RS), e mapeou os instrumentos de notificação de acidentes e doenças relacionados ao trabalho utilizados pelos serviços setoriais para caracterizar a estrutura dos serviços de saúde do trabalhador, as demandas na Política de Saúde do Trabalhador e suas formas de acesso e de atendimento à população, fatores que possibilitam ou dificultam o acesso aos direitos sociais, bem como delineou o perfil dos trabalhadores acidentados e adoecidos identificando as condições que podem estar influenciando situações de acidentes e de morbimortalidade. Utilizou-se também a aplicação de instrumento do tipo formulário em entrevista com os trabalhadores selecionados, identificando e analisando as repercussões do acidente e/ou adoecimento decorrentes do trabalho na vida dos trabalhadores. A pesquisa evidenciou que o Sistema de Notificações em Saúde do Trabalhador (SIST) embora se constitua em um importante instrumento de notificação de adoecimentos e acidentes relacionados ao trabalho, tendo por objetivo enfrentar a sub-notificação por meio da vigilância em saúde do trabalhador; contraditoriamente, na prática, esta vem sendo efetivada de forma parcial com resultado na redução do número de notificações, bem como no preenchimento incompleto das informações, dificultando, assim, o conhecimento sobre a realidade dos agravos decorrentes do trabalho. Igualmente, o estudo observou a ausência de informações específicas, principalmente quanto aos rebatimentos do adoecimento e acidente de trabalho no âmbito da família, evidenciando a noção de que o adoecimento e o acidente de trabalho estão centrados no trabalhador sem repercussões diretas nas relações familiares, afetivas, em última análise, na vida social. Diante desse contexto, que se configura como um sério problema social, são necessárias ações que visem à produção de informações mais detalhadas, permitindo identificar as condições que podem estar influenciando os adoecimentos e acidentes de trabalho, tendo em vista que a ocorrência desses agravos implica em uma investigação meticulosa a fim de desvendar a rede de fatores envolvidos que contribuiu para a sua ocorrência. Ademais, o estudo aponta para a urgência de ampla discussão no âmbito da Política Nacional de Saúde do Trabalhador, contemplando, por exemplo, as repercussões que tem o adoecimento e acidente de trabalho nas relações afetivas, isto é, para além da vida laboral. Por fim, o estudo concluiu que o temor de se acidentar e de agravamento da doença, está intimamente relacionado à manutenção do posto de trabalho, revelando a centralidade que tem o trabalho na vida dos entrevistados enquanto reconhecimento e garantia de cidadania...|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} in ten homes was {{conducted}} to understand what influences users’ acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home environment. The key finding is that perceived message urgency is the primary indicator <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home—if people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> No effect <b>of</b> physical activity was found on acceptability. The results suggest that to improve the scheduling <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home, notification systems need a mechanism assessing both the message urgency and the mental activity load, whereas physical activity can be ignored. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to measure acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in a realistic setting, given the need to balance experimental control with realistic context. The present paper suggests a way to introduce controlled notifications and subjective measurements of acceptability in homes. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to extend previous reports on network analysis relating to food notifications by including an optional filter by type <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> and in cases of contamination, by type of contaminant in the notified foodstuff. Methodology/Principal Findings A filter function has been applied to enable processing <b>of</b> selected <b>notifications</b> by contaminant or type <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> to i) capture complexity, ii) analyze trends, and iii) identify patterns of reporting activities between countries. The program rapidly assesses nations' roles as transgressor and/or detector for each category of contaminant and for the key class of border rejection.

40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{dissertation}} research {{is on the}} examination <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> systems that harness different presentation formats for notification delivery, the preferences that individuals express for these various types <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> and how these preferences are affected by contextual information surrounding notification delivery. My research is unique from other work in the literature in two primary ways. First, {{while the majority of}} prior work addressing notification delivery, both in terms of format and timing, has focused on the effects <b>of</b> a <b>notification</b> on an individual’s performance on a given task or set of tasks, my focus is the individual’s perception <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> and particularly on that individual’s preferences for different notification formats delivered within different contextual scenarios. An interest in this question is motivated by prior studies that have shown that annoyance with computer-human interactions is a primary reason behind user abandonment of interactive software systems. Second, my preliminary findings suggest that different people prefer different types <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in different contexts, which motivates a change of focus in the development of such systems toward customizing notifications not only to the features of an individual’s context but also to the individual him- or herself. An additional element of novelty in my work is that my final study was conducted in a purely naturalistic office environment, in which the notifications evaluated were precisely those notifications being delivered to study participants throughout their workday. The primary contribution of this dissertation is twofold: a detailed analysis of the methodology for the design, data collection, and analysis of a study <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> preferences in a naturalistic setting {{with a great deal of}} inherent complexity; and a set of results, based on the analysis of preference data acquired in various settings, about how an individual’s contextual environment, and the content <b>of</b> a given <b>notification,</b> can affect that individual’s preferences for notification delivery...|$|R
