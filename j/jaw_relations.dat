40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare facial growth in {{patients}} with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (UCLP) in whom the palate was repaired with the von Langenbeck procedure at 8 months (L- 8), or the Wardill procedure at 18 months (W- 18). A total of 151 unaffected subjects were used as a reference series. Sixty-one adult patients, 34 in the L- 8 group and 27 in the W- 18 group, were investigated clinically and with lateral skull radiography and also filled out a questionnaire about their dental condition. Multiple linear regression was used to analyse the effects of the surgical strategy, sex, and the presence of a velopharyngeal flap on several dependent variables indicating sagittal <b>jaw</b> <b>relations,</b> vertical <b>jaw</b> <b>relations,</b> and inclination of incisors. The UCLP group was characterised by a short (n-sp) and retrusive maxilla (s-n-ss) and a retrusive mandible for women (s-n-sm), larger maxillary inclination (NSL/NL), more retroclined lower incisors (IL(I) /ML), shorter upper facial heights (n-sp) and normal total face height (n-gn) than the reference group. In the UCLP group there were significant differences between men and women in mandibular prognathism (s-n-sm), maxillary/mandibular relations (ss-n-sm), maxillary inclination (NSL/NL), total anterior facial height (n-gn), and upper anterior facial height (n-sp). Lateral crossbite was found in 20 % of the UCLP group. The prevalence was similar in the L- 8 and W- 18 groups. Almost 80 % of the patients in the UCLP group considered that their dental condition was good.

40|$|Patients with {{complete}} unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) display considerable variability in clinical presentation. This variability relates to presentation at birth, later observed dento-alveolar and skeletal craniofacial deficiencies, response to treatment, and post-treatment stability. Possible factors affecting later observed variability are genetics, function, and iatrogenic influences. The present objectives were to investigate 1) possible associations between {{the severity of}} the cleft lip deficiency in patients with UCLP and variations in dento-facial growth and development, and 2) whether variation in stability following orthognathic surgery to permit adequate functional <b>jaw</b> <b>relations</b> and harmonious facial esthetics could be explained by the magnitude or segmentation of maxillary advancement. The results suggest that children with a more severe form of UCLP at infancy are susceptible to tooth agenesis in the cleft area, poorer dental arch relationships, and more deficient maxillary growth. The stability of maxillary advancement appears to be independent of magnitude or segmentation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if patient ratings {{of their ability}} to chew are dependent on the method of complete denture fabrication. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Twenty edentulous patients participated in a randomized within-subject crossover trial. Each participant received 2 sets of new complete dentures. One pair (Gerber prosthesis) was manufactured based on tracings (to determine centric relation) and facebow transfer; semianatomic teeth with a lingualized and balanced occlusal pattern were used. The other set of complete dentures was made using a simplified procedure without facebow transfer; <b>jaw</b> <b>relations</b> were recorded with wax occlusion rims, and anatomic teeth were set with a canine and premolar guidance (Gysi prosthesis). The 2 dentures were delivered in randomized order, and each was worn for 3 months. Three months after insertion, patients' ratings of each new prosthesis were obtained on visual analog scales for general satisfaction, comfort, ability to speak, stability, esthetics, ease of cleaning, and ability to chew. RESULTS: Patients rated their general satisfaction, stability, and esthetic appearance significantly better for the Gysi prostheses (P >. 05). No significant differences between the 2 denture treatment methods were detected for ability to speak, comfort, chewing ability, and the ease of cleaning the dentures. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive method for the fabrication of complete dentures using lingualized teeth does not appear to positively influence patient ratings of denture satisfaction when compared to a simple procedure with anatomic teeth...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Soft liners act as {{a cushion}} between the denture base and the {{residual}} ridge. Hence, {{it is important to}} study their effect on resorption of mandibular denture bearing area. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of soft denture liner on mandibular ridge resorption after 1 year in completely denture wearers. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight completely edentulous patients having age between 45 and 60 years with well-formed ridges in class I <b>jaw</b> <b>relations</b> were selected as per the inclusion and exclusion criterion. Randomization chart was used to enroll participants in experimental and control groups who were given mandibular dentures with and without soft denture liner, respectively. Vertical measurements were made on orthopantomograph and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 7. 0 software at five points, i. e., one at central incisor and two points at right and left first premolars and two in each first molar region. Results: On application of repeated measures analysis of variance, both groups showed a significant change in bone height after denture delivery (P < 0. 05). Intergroup comparison (Wilcoxon rank sum test) of bone height in different regions at various time intervals showed statistically significant difference in bone levels (P < 0. 05) from baseline to 6 months and baseline to 12 months (P < 0. 01), while the difference was statistically not significant during 6 and 12 months’ period. Conclusion: The use of soft denture liner significantly reduces the residual ridge resorption in complete denture wearers as compared to conventional denture wearers (without denture liner) over a period of 1 year...|$|E

A total of 151 unaffected subjects were used as a reference group. Thirty-six adult patients, 26 in the L- 14 group, and 10 in the W- 18 group, were investigated clinically and with lateral skull radiography, and they also filled out a questionnaire about their dental condition. Multiple linear regression was used to analyse the effect of surgical strategy, sex, and the presence of a velopharyngeal flap on several dependent variables indicating sagittal and vertical <b>jaw</b> <b>relations,</b> and inclination of incisors. The BCLP group was characterised by a pre-normal basal relation (ss-n-sm), retroclined upper (ILs/NL) and lower (ILi/ML) incisors, maxillary retrognathism (s-n-ss) in men, larger maxillary plane angle (NSL/NL) in women, larger mandibular plane (NSL/ML) and intermaxillary vertical relation (NL/ML) in men, and smaller anterior facial height (n-gn) and upper anterior facial height (n-sp). In the BCLP group, differences in outcomes could be explained only by sex.

40|$|Purpose: The {{rehabilitation}} of the edentulous mandible is a challenge due to various limiting factors, of which the available vertical restorative space (AVRS) has been well understood in the literature. However, other anatomic variations such as arch form, arch size, and also the interforaminal distance (IFD) (due {{to the presence of}} mandibular nerve) are influential in the selection of size and position of implants, and thereby the prosthetic design. Materials and Method: In the present study, 30 edentulous patients from a group of 300 edentulous patients, representing all the three <b>jaw</b> <b>relations</b> (Class I, II, and III) were evaluated for designing a classification that could help in a comprehensive treatment plan for the edentulous mandible. Dental panoramic radiographs of each individual with a trial or final prosthesis were made. The horizontal IFD and AVRS values were calculated. Results: One-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc test (multiple comparison) and Bonferroni method having P < 0. 05 as significant value showed an overall mean of 38. 9 mm for horizontal distance and 13. 69 mm for the AVRS in 30 edentulous patients. Conclusion: The results showed that in the majority of cases (90 %) there is insufficient space to place a bar attachment supported by five implants for mandibular overdentures. This suggests that a universal treatment plan cannot be followed due to varying anatomic factors. Hence, it becomes imperative to have a set of clinical guidelines based on the AVRS and IFD, for the selection of implant number and type of attachment. The article proposes a simple classification system based on the AVRS and IFD for establishing guidelines in the treatment planning of the edentulous mandible, to aid in selection of implant size, number, and position along with the associated prosthetic design...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the alterations in the pharyngeal airway dimensions after mandibular advancement surgery and to assess its postsurgical stability. Materials and methods: A total of 40 adult patients with skeletal class II <b>jaw</b> <b>relation,</b> treated by mandibular advancement surgery, were included in the study. Lateral cephalogram was obtained before surgery (T 0), 1 month after surgery (T 1), and 6 months postsurgery (T 2). The cephalograms obtained were hand traced; various soft and hard tissue points identified, and linear and angular measurements were carried out to evaluate the changes postsurgery. The results thus obtained were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The hyoid bone adapted to a more anterior (AH-C 3 Hor) and superior position (AH-s Ver, AH-FH Ver, AH-ML Ver and AH-C 3 Ver), the head assumed a more upright position (NSL/CVT and NSL/OPT) and there was a significant widening of the posterior airway space at all levels (pm-UPW, U-MPW, V-LPW, and PASmin) postmandibular advancement surgery. Conclusion: The study concludes that mandibular advancement surgeries bring about significant widening of the posterior airway space and also long-term changes in hyoid bone position and head posture and, therefore, it could be used in the treatment of selected cases of obstructive sleep apnea...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Malocclusion of {{skeletal}} class III is {{a complex}} abnormality, with a characteristic sagital position of the lower jaw {{in front of the}} upper one. A higher level of prognatism of the lower <b>jaw</b> in <b>relation</b> to the upper one can be the consequence of its excessive length. The aim {{of this study was to}} find the differences in the length of the lower jaw in the children with skeletal class III and the children with normal sagital interjaw relation (skeletal class I) in the period of mixed dentition. Methods. After clinical and x-ray diagnostics, profile tele-x-rays of the head were analyzed in 60 examinees with mixed dentition, aged from 6 to 12 years. The examinees were divided into two groups: group 1 - the children with skeletal class III and group 2 - the children with skeletal class I. The length of the lower jaw, upper jaw and cranial base were measured. The proportional relations between the lengths measured within each group were established and the level of difference in the lengths measured and their proportions between the groups were estimated. Results. No significant difference between the groups was found in the body length, ramus and the total length of the lower <b>jaw.</b> Proportional <b>relation</b> between the body length and the length of the lower jaw ramus and proportional relation between the forward cranial base and the lower jaw body were not significantly different. A significant difference was found in proportional relations of the total length of the lower jaw with the total lengths of cranial base and the upper <b>jaw</b> and proportional <b>relation</b> of the length of the lower and upper jaw body. Conclusion. Of all the analyzed parameters, the following were selected as the early indicators of the development of skeletal class III on the lower jaw: greater total length of the lower jaw, proportional to the total lengths of cranial base and the upper jaw, as well as greater length of the lower jaw body, proportional to the length of the upper jaw body. ...|$|R

In each experimental session, 72 taps were delivered during clenching at 10 % of the maximal electromyographic output. Statistical criteria provided by a previously developed computer program allowed the objective determination of inhibitory and excitatory periods in the electromyographic output following the stimulus, which together constitute the poststimulus electromyographic complex (PSEC). The influence of the change in occlusal relations on the PSEC was determined in ten subjects by comparing pretreatment results with those obtained after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. Concurrent with an improvement of the sagittal <b>jaw</b> <b>relation</b> in the patients with a pronounced disharmony, a short latency excitatory peak appeared in their PSECs. It was demonstrated by averaging nonrectified electromyographic activity that this peak was brought about through synchronization of motor units. In the control group, however, the morphology of the PSEC was reproducible over time. Successful functional therapy is thus accompanied by specific transient changes in the reflex response of the masseter muscles to standardized tooth taps. The neural pathways contributing to these observations originate in periodontal and muscular receptors, and might provide a clue for the mechanism underlying successful functional treatment. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{cases of}} TMD {{are complex and}} multifactorial, {{therefore}} the management should be done by several disciplines. In this report, a 27 -year-old man came to the teaching hospital of the University of Indonesia Faculty of Dentistry’s Prosthodontic Department complaining about clicking sound and pain around his right joint. He received orthodontic treatment 9 years ago with removable appliance at a private practice and had 4 premolar extractions. The patient’s face looked asymmetric, with a low vertical dimension, a Class II occlusion, and an anterior deep bite. Besides that, he clenched his teeth during emotional stress. Lateral transcranial photo showed that {{the position of the}} left condyle was relatively normal or slightly anterior, and the right condyle was in the superoposterior position in the fossa with an abnormal shape. To solve this problem, the patient was referred to the Orthodontic Department to get a correct vertical dimension and normal anterior overbite. After 6 years, the patient was again referred to the Prosthodontic Department, but the result was not successful. In order to get the right vertical dimension, an occlusal splint was fabricated to achieve a comfort <b>jaw</b> <b>relation.</b> In this position, the overbite was 2 mm, but the space between the upper and lower posterior teeth was 5 mm.

The current recommended average settings using the Hanau's formula commonly used by clinicians is questionable, and thus reassessment is needed. This study was carried out to evaluate and compare the lateral condylar guidance: (1) Using the Hanau's formula and the computerized jaw tracking device (Kinesiograph). (2) On the right and left sides using both these methods. Materials and Methods: A total of 20 completely edentulous patients (14 male and 6 females) within 40 – 60 years of age were selected. <b>Jaw</b> <b>relation</b> was recorded followed by face bow transfer. Extraoral Gothic arch tracing was recorded; three protrusive records were obtained and condylar guidance was calculated. Lateral condylar guidance was then calculated using Hanau's formula, followed by the computerized jaw tracking device. A comparative evaluation was done of the obtained values. The same investigator worked with each of the study participants for the purpose of standardization. Results: The lateral condylar guidance values obtained using the Hanau's formula ranged from 14 to 17 ° while those obtained using the computerized K 7 jaw tracking device ranged from 8 to 40 °. Bennett angle values, obtained using the jaw tracking device and Hanau's formula showed statistically significant differences (P 0. 05).

40|$|The {{search for}} the ideal {{artificial}} tooth arrangement that maximizes denture stability, comfort, aesthetics, and function has occupied the dental literature {{for many years and}} still continues to do so. Of the many occlusal schemes that have been presented to the dental profession, that of lingualized occlusion has {{emerged as one of the}} more popular. The popularity of lingualized occlusion stems from the simplicity and flexibility of the concept and from its wide application to clinical practice (Parr & Ivanhoe, 1996). The registration of a repeatable correct centric <b>jaw</b> <b>relation</b> is not always possible. We don't know whether the patient will use centric relation during normal function. It is therefore useful to provide the patient with some freedom of movement around centric. lingualized occlusion provides freedom in centric. For many dentists the arrangement of artificial denture teeth into balanced occlusion is difficult and time consuming. As a result this task is most often performed by the dental technician. In the South African countryside dental laboratories are often far away. If dentists perform the arrangement of the denture teeth, time and costs can be saved. The mounting of denture teeth in lingualized occlusion is simple and fast. This will motivate dentists to arrange denture teeth themselves, with obvious benefits for both the patient and the dentist. The School of Oral Health Sciences of the University of Stellenbosch teaches this concept to its undergraduate students in order to improve the prosthetic service to the large edentulous population of South Africa.

The {{aim of the}} study was to establish the differences in the thickness of facial soft tissue profile in persons with dentoskeletal Class II/ 1 and II/ 2 relationship. Methods. In the study we used cephalometric rendgenograms profile analysis of 60 patients aged 12 - 18 years of the Dental Clinic in Niš who had not previously undergone orthodontical treatment. According to the dentoskeletal <b>jaws</b> <b>relations</b> the patients were divided into two groups with Class II division 1 and Class II class division 2. In all of them the standard dentoskeletal profile analysis by Steiner and soft tissue profile analysis by Burston was done. The obtained findings were statistically analyzed and the comparison between the studied groups was performed. Results. The results indicated the following: in the patients with Class II/ 1 relationship there was a significantly thinner upper lip (t= 5. 741; p< 0. 0001), thinner upper lip sulcus (t= 3. 858; p< 0. 001) and significantly thinner lower lip (t= 2. 009; p< 0. 05) in relation to the patients with Class II/ 2. Compensatory effect in the Class II/ 1 patients was more distinctive in females, as their soft tissue profiles were thicker. In Class II/ 2 patients this relationship was in favor of males. Conclusion. The facial soft tissue profile indicated significant differences in the thickness dependant on the type of malocclusion and gender.

40|$|Introduction: Occlusal plane {{orientation}} {{is an important}} part of organized occlusion. The ala-tragus plane is considered to be parallel to the occlusal plane while reconstructing occlusion. This study was aimed to determine the condition of parallelism of these two planes in Iranian. Methods and material: In this cross sectional study, 197 patients were examined. The angle between ala-tragus and occlusal plane was assessed by indexed fox plane and the position of Stensen's duct to adjacent molar in maxillary tooth and the position of the dorsal side of the tongue relative to posterior mandibular teeth were also examined by clinical examination. Then two planes were investigated by lateral cephalometry for 23 patients. Deep bite, long face, and with bruxism patients were identified to examine the probable effect of this position in them. The data was analyzed with t-test, Peirson and χ 2 tests (a = 0. 05). Results: The ala-tragus line had the tendency to be paralleled with posterior occlusal plane and the mean angle of two planes was 1. 77 ˚. In cephalometric measurement, the estimated mean of the angle was 2. 96 ˚. In the most of the cases, Dorsum of tongue was above the mandibular occlusal plan. In the half of the cases Stensen's duct was in the occlusal third of adjacent molar. Conclusion: The differences in the mean angles of clinical measurement and cephalometric measurement have been resulted from the differences in two methods. The results allow clinicians to parallel occlusal plan with the ala-tragus line to achieve a natural position for reconstruction of occlusal plan.

Dental literature reported many studies on functional appliances and their effects, but there are few published studies on their effects on the airway. Objectives: To investigate the immediate effect of the Twin block (TB) functional appliance on the airway in patients with class II division 1 malocclusion on skeletal II base and to measure the immediate changes in the position of the hyoid bone after insertion of the TB appliance. Materials and Methods: Two lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken and analyzed one before and one after insertion of the TB appliance for the 19 patients. The age range 10 - 14 years. Immediate change in the airway was performed by measuring the changes in the vertical position of the hyoid bone relative to the mandibular plane (H 1) and to the (cv 3 -RGN) plane (H 2). The change in the airway can be measured by the change in the vertical position of the hyoid bone before and after insertion of TB appliance (H-H 1) + (H-H 2).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this}} in vivo {{study was}} to {{investigate}} how reproducible individuals find their habitual intercuspation. METHODS: A new type of highly accurate measuring procedure was involved using an intraoral optical scanning device (Cerec Bluecam). First, a pilot test investigated the accuracy of the procedure within a standardized setting. With regard to the in vivo study, fifteen participants with full dentition were selected. For each of these individuals, eight scans were taken both in the morning and in the afternoon. Furthermore, during each session, scans were taken both in horizontal and upright position. In order to compare this to ubiquitous used processes, plaster replicas of five individuals were investigated as well. The scans were analysed, and the differences in the position of the lower jaw were calculated by a specialized superimposition program (n= 570 comparisons/OraCheck). RESULTS: The results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between the time of day and the position of the patient. The overall mean±SD value for locating the habitual intercuspation was 42 ± 34 μm, however ranging from 22 ± 9 μm to 77 ± 58 μm for single individuals. On the other hand, the differences in positioning plaster replicas reached a mean of 135 ± 77 μm.

METHODS: Upper and lower edentulous jaw models were clinically prepared, 10 pairs of resin cylinders with same size were adhered to axial surfaces of upper and lower models. The occlusal bases and {{the upper and lower}} jaw models were installed in the centric relation position. Faro Edge 1. 8 m was used to directly obtain center points of the base surface of the cylinders (contact method). Activity 880 dental scanner was used to obtain 3 D data of the cylinders and the center points were fitted (fitting method). 3 pairs of center points were used to align the virtual model to centric relation. An observation coordinate system was interactively established. The straight-line distances in the X (horizontal left/right), Y (horizontal anterior/posterior), and Z (vertical) between the remaining 7 pairs of center points derived from contact method and fitting method were measured respectively and analyzed using a paired t-test. RESULTS: The differences of the straight-line distances of the remaining 7 pairs of center points between the two methods were X: 0. 074 ± 0. 107 mm, Y: 0. 168 ± 0. 176 mm, and Z: - 0. 003 ± 0. 155 mm.

40|$|Introduction Based on {{literature}} data {{it is obvious}} that there is a connection between smoking and periodontal diseases. Alveolar bone loss increases with smoking. Tobacco smoking affects the proportion of subgingival bacterial flora by influencing oxidoreduction potential of dental plaque and thus making conditions for development of anaerobic bacteria. According to some researchers, smoking affects the mineral component of bone tissue. Orthopantomograms show higher level of alveolar bone loss in smokers than in nonsmokers with the same level of oral hygiene. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish if smoking affects alveolar bone loss in complete denture wearers. Material and methods Our clinical investigation included 60 patients of both sexes (30 smokers and 30 nonsmokers) all complete dentures wearers. All patients met study criteria: <b>jaw</b> <b>relation</b> and smokers who smoke over 20 cigarettes per day. All subjects were interviewed, and after that orthopantomograms were made. They were used to calculate the degree of alveolar bone loss. Results The examined subjects were approximately of the same age. Mean age of smokers was 59. 9 and nonsmokers 61. 8. It was established that differences regarding resorption in men were not significant. The degree of resorption in women smokers and women nonsmokers was different, but differences were not significant. Discussion It has been proven that the number of cigarettes smoked per day is very important. It is considered that the risk of oral epithelial dysplasia increases when smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day. Considering our results regarding resorption of edentulous alveolar ridge in smokers and nonsmokers, we concluded that there were no significant differences. There are opinions in literature that smoking is not an etiological factor in resorption, but there are some opinions that smoking is connected with the degree of resorption in periodontium. The analyses of resorptive changes in edentulous smokers were done only around implants and it was estimated that smoking has more influence than other clinical risk factors. Conclusion On the bases of our research we may conclude that smoking does not directly affect the degree of resorption of edentulous alveolar ridge with complete denture wearers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Several {{studies have}} shown soft tissue profile changes after {{orthodontic}} treatment in Class II Division 1 patients. However, {{a few studies have}} described factors influencing the soft tissue changes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the factors influencing the soft tissue profile changes following orthodontic treatment in Class II Division 1 patients. Methods The subjects comprised 104 Thai patients age 8 – 16  years who presented Class II Division 1 malocclusions and were treated with different orthodontic modalities comprising cervical headgear, Class II traction and extraction of the four first premolars. The profile changes were evaluated from the lateral cephalograms before and after treatment by means of the X-Y coordinate system. Significant soft tissue profile changes were evaluated by paired t test at a 0. 05 significance level. The correlations among significant soft tissue changes and independent variables comprising treatment modality, age, sex, pretreatment skeletal, dental and soft tissue morphology were evaluated by stepwise multiple regression analysis at a 0. 05 significance level. Results The multiple regression analysis indicated that different treatment modalities, age, sex, pretreatment skeletal, dental and soft tissue morphology were related to the profile changes. The predictive power of these variables on the soft tissue profile changes ranged from 9. 9 to 40. 3  %. Conclusions Prediction of the soft tissue profile changes following treatment of Class II Division 1 malocclusion from initial patient morphology, age, sex and types of treatment was complicated and required several variables to explain their variations. Upper lip change in horizontal direction could be found only at the stomion superius and was less predictable than those of the lower lip. Variations in upper lip retraction at the stomion superius were explained by types of treatment (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 099), whereas protrusion of the lower lip at the labrale inferius was correlated with initial inclination of the lower incisor (L 1 to NB), <b>jaw</b> <b>relation</b> (ANB angle), lower lip thickness and sex (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 403). Prediction of chin protrusion at the soft tissue pogonion was also low predictable (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 190) depending upon sex, age and initial mandibular plane angle (SN-GoGn).
