25|$|Papillomaviruses {{were first}} {{identified}} in the early 20th century, when it was shown that skin warts, or papillomas, could be transmitted between individuals by a <b>filterable</b> infectious agent. In 1935 Francis Peyton Rous, who had previously demonstrated {{the existence of a}} cancer-causing sarcoma virus in chickens, went on to show that a papillomavirus could cause skin cancer in infected rabbits. This was the first demonstration that a virus could cause cancer in mammals.|$|E
25|$|Screw press- Grapes {{are loaded}} into an input where a large helical screw {{transfers}} the grape across perforated cylinder {{that allows the}} release juice to escape. As screw moves further down, the cake pomace is subjected to increasing pressure. While the advantage is the high throughput, the harsh pressing and lots of movement causes substantial tearing and grinding of the grape skins and seeds. This causes more minerals (such as potassium, which can affect pH), tannins and natural gums to be extracted into the juice. As much as 4% v/v of the pressed juice from a screw press could be suspended solids that {{may need to be}} treated by clarification and fining agents to be stable and <b>filterable.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{process was}} {{improved}} again, to allow repeated separation of lanthanum from the barium solution, as the lanthanum built up. Initially, a phosphate process was used, where lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum phosphate. This was later abandoned when an oxalate or hydroxide method was developed; lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum hydroxide and then {{converted to a}} <b>filterable</b> precipitate by addition of oxalate with a trace of fluoride. The oxalate method had to be performed quickly, as the oxalate ion was susceptible to radiolysis and the lanthanum had the tendency {{to go back into}} solution. The oxalate process could be performed by remotely operated devices. The batches contained about [...] of radiolanthanum, the highest radiation levels people had ever worked with at that time. Special tools had to be developed for remote handling of the hot materials. Lead bricks were used for shielding the sources. The radiation dose limit for the personnel was set to 500mrem (5mSv) per source preparation. Sometimes this limit was exceeded; once the received dose was 2rem (20mSv).|$|E
2500|$|In warm, clear {{tropical}} waters corals {{are more}} abundant than towards the poles where the waters are cold. Calcium carbonate contributors, including plankton (such as coccoliths and planktic foraminifera), coralline algae, sponges, brachiopods, echinoderms, bryozoa and mollusks, are typically found {{in shallow water}} environments where sunlight and <b>filterable</b> food are more abundant. [...] Cold-water carbonates do exist at higher latitudes but have a very slow growth rate. The calcification processes are changed by ocean acidification.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{bluetongue}} {{disease was}} already recognized in South Africa {{in the early}} 19th century, a comprehensive description of the disease was not published until {{the first decade of}} the 20th century. [...] In 1906 Arnold Theiler showed that bluetongue was caused by a <b>filterable</b> agent. [...] He also created the first bluetongue vaccine, which was developed from an attenuated BTV strain. [...] For many decades bluetongue was thought to be confined to Africa. [...] The first confirmed outbreak outside of Africa occurred in Cyprus in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|By 1928 enough {{was known}} about viruses to enable the {{publication}} of <b>Filterable</b> Viruses, {{a collection of essays}} covering all known viruses edited by Thomas Milton Rivers (1888–1962).

2500|$|In 1903 it was {{suggested}} {{for the first time}} that transduction by viruses might cause cancer. In 1908 Bang and Ellerman showed that a <b>filterable</b> virus could transmit chicken leukemia, data largely ignored till the 1930s when leukemia became regarded as cancerous. In 1911 Peyton Rous reported the transmission of chicken sarcoma, a solid tumor, with a virus, and thus Rous became [...] "father of tumor virology". The virus was later called Rous sarcoma virus 1 and understood to be a retrovirus. Several other cancer-causing retroviruses have since been described.|$|E

5000|$|Negri went on, however, to {{demonstrate}} in 1906 that the smallpox vaccine, {{then known as}} [...] "vaccine virus", or [...] "variola vaccinae", was also a <b>filterable</b> virus.

50|$|In 1937, Max Theiler {{discovered}} a <b>filterable</b> agent {{that was a}} known cause for paralysis in mice. He found the virus was not transmittable to rhesus macaques, and that only some mice developed symptoms. The virus is now referred to as Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. The virus has been well characterized, and now serves as a standard model for studying multiple sclerosis.|$|E
50|$|In 1918 he {{demonstrated}} that influenza {{was caused by}} a <b>filterable</b> agent that was in all probability a virus. In the 1920s he performed research of Amanita phalloides (death cap mushroom) in Louis Lapicque's laboratory at the Sorbonne, producing an antitoxic serum (serum antiphallinique) as a result. In 1927, at the Pasteur Institute, he established a {{center for the study of}} blood groups.|$|E
50|$|Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) is {{the product}} of fused, common, continuous, {{unambiguous}} tracks of all airborne objects in the surveillance area.

50|$|A well-maintained, {{properly}} operating pool filtration and re-circulation {{system is}} the first barrier in combating contaminants {{large enough to be}} filtered. Rapid removal of <b>filterable</b> contaminants reduces the impact on the disinfection system thereby limiting the formation of chloramines, restricting the formation of disinfection by-products and optimizing sanitation effectiveness. To kill pathogens and help prevent recreational water illnesses, pool operators must maintain proper levels of chlorine or another sanitizer.|$|E
50|$|Following these initiatives, when ETCs again became {{available}} in 2002, {{a number of}} experiments on pregnant mice seeking {{to evaluate the use}} of pregnant mice as a laboratory model of MRLS and to develop experimental support for a <b>filterable</b> protein ETC toxin. These experiments showed intact ETC setae appeared to cause fetal resorption in mice, but frozen ETC setae and ETC setal filtrates failed to produce fetal resorptions in mice.|$|E
50|$|On {{his return}} to the Lister he {{continued}} experiments on diphtheria antitoxic horse sera. In 1940, Sir Percival Hartley, head of the Medical Research Council Biological Standards Division, raised problems with serum and plasma for transfusion. On storage, sterile human serum developed a haze owing to liberation of lipid from serum lipoprotein. This was visually indistinguishable from bacterial contamination. A method was found to produce a clear, <b>filterable,</b> stable product.|$|E

Conventional polymer solutions are usually clear or translucent and have the viscosity of molasses, more or less.

This was a liquid crystalline solution, but I {{did not know it}} at the time.” ...|$|E

Such a tap can be part of a strategy to monitor for essential metrics, such as frame errors and corrupted frames in IPv6.|$|E

50|$|Solid {{material}} in wastewater may be dissolved, suspended, or settled.

50|$|Negri {{performed}} {{extensive research}} {{in the fields of}} histology, hematology, cytology, protozoology and hygiene. In 1903 he discovered the eponymous Negri bodies, defined as cytoplasmatic inclusion bodies located in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in cases of rabies in animals and humans. He documented his findings in an article titled Contributo allo studio dell'eziologia della rabia, published in the journal Bollettino della Societa medico-chirurgica. At the time, Negri mistakenly described the pathological agent of rabies as a parasitic protozoa. A few months later, Paul Remlinger (1871-1964) at the Constantinople Imperial Bacteriology Institute correctly demonstrated that the aetiological agent of rabies was not a protozoan, but a <b>filterable</b> virus.|$|E
