500|$|Cole {{initially}} {{looked for}} original songs to {{record for the}} album, but said [...] "the songs being sent were pretty bad." [...] A writer from Vibe said Cole's decision to create a covers album was a marketing strategy to breed [...] "a connection between song and interpreter and between singer and audience" [...] and appeal to [...] "fans yearning for {{the good old days}} before they had to hire a sitter to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> show". Cole later clarified she could not afford to record an album of original material, explaining [...] "we're doing a contemporary urban record on a jazz budget".|$|E
500|$|As {{with most}} episodes of The Simpsons, {{the music was}} {{composed}} by Alf Clausen and edited by Chris Ledesma. In a blog written by Ledesma, it was revealed prior to the airing of the episode that it would contain {{the use of the}} waltz [...] "Tales from the Vienna Woods" [...] by Johann Strauss II as well as a musical cue similar to the style of the main theme from the film Catch Me If You Can. The episode features several other references to popular culture as well. For example, Homer skips work to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> film called Paul Flart: Water Park Cop, a parody of the 2009 film [...] In addition, there is a brief shot of the character Bender from the animated television series Futurama.|$|E

500|$|In his 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema, Randor Guy {{described}} Kalidas as a [...] "crude experiment" [...] {{that had}} poor lip sync; when characters opened their mouths {{there was no}} sound, and when dialogue or song was heard, artistes remained silent. He said the public did not care about technical niceties and flocked to see the film. Film critic and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy, in his review of the film for Ananda Vikatan, noted that he was awestruck by the costumes used. He praised Rajalakshmi's performance and her dancing but criticised her singing, saying {{that she had to}} <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> doctor to get her vocal chords fixed. The Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran printed a favourable review for Kalidas on 29 October 1931, two days prior to its theatrical release, where the reviewer, in contrast to Krishnamurthy's comments, appreciated Rajalakshmi's singing.|$|E
2500|$|Otis Williams and {{the other}} Temptations decided to resort to enlisting an on-hand fill-in for Paul Williams. Richard Street, then-lead singer of fellow Motown act The Monitors and {{formerly}} lead singer of The Distants, was hired to travel with The Temptations and sing all of Williams' parts, save for Williams' special numbers such as [...] "Don't Look Back" [...] and [...] "For Once in My Life", from backstage behind a curtain. [...] When Williams was not well enough to go on, Street took his place onstage. In April 1971, Williams was finally persuaded to <b>go</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> doctor. The doctor found a spot on Williams' liver and advised him to retire from the group altogether. Williams left the group and Street became his permanent replacement. In support of helping Williams get back on his feet, The Temptations continued to pay Williams his same one-fifth share of the group's earnings, and kept Williams on their payroll as an advisor and choreographer, and Williams continued to help the group with routines and dance moves {{for the next two}} years.|$|E
