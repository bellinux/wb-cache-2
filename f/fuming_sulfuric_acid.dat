5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, <b>fuming</b> <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E

The sequence involves, (i) regioselective N-alkylation of pyrimidone by phenacyl bromides, (ii) cyclization of obtained 1 -(2 -aryl- 2 -oxoethyl) pyrimidin- 2 (1 H) -ones into oxazolo[3, 2 -a]pyrimi-dinium salts under {{the action of}} <b>fuming</b> <b>sulfuric</b> (or triflic) <b>acid,</b> and (iii) reaction of the obtained salts with hydrazine leading to 2 -ami-no- 5 -aryloxazoles.

40|$|Phenyl sulfone may be {{considered}} a dephenyl derivative of <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid,</b> in which two of the DH groups of the acid are replaced by phenyl groups. It is also called dephenyl sulfone, and in German "sulfobenzid," but in this paper {{it will always be}} referred to as phenyl sulfone. It is formed in appreciable quantities as a by-product in the sulfonation of benzene, especially when very concentrated acid is used. Perhaps the best method of preparing it for laboratory use is by the Friedel-Crafts synthesis, in which the chloride of benzene sulfonic acid and benzene condense in the presence of aluminum chloride. Substituted phenyl sulfones are produced either by the direct substitution of the hydrogen atoms in the benzene rings, or through the action of sulfuric anhydride on substituted benzenes. Thus phenol and sulfur trioxide yield dihydroxy phenyl sulfone; brombenzine and sulfur trioxide yield dibrom phenyl sulfone, etc. Chlorine may be directly substituted under certain conditions, and the nitro and sulfonic acid derivatives may be directly produced by the action of a mixture of fuming nitric and <b>fuming</b> <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids,</b> and of chlorsulfonic acid, respectively. After the war considerable quantities of phenyl sulfone were left over from the various industrial processes, and the problem of its use became of importance. This need for a use to which the excess product could be put led M. E. Granmougin to prepare a great many derivatives of the substance with the hope of being able to apply some of them in the dye industry. He based his structures on an assumption, which although it may be correct, cannot be said to absolutely justified. Several other investigators had worked with the directly substituted derivatives of phenyl sulfone, but in no case had the structure of the disubstituted products been unquestionably determined by actually splitting apart the two rings and determining the structure of the resulting products. It has always been assumed that these products have a symmetrical constitution. This assumption seems to be justified in that both the phenyl groups are equivalent, and should be subject to the same directing influence of the SO 2 group. It has also been assumed that all of the products formed with the aid of substituted benzenes conform to that constitution which the directing influence of the substituted benzene group would call for. ...|$|R
