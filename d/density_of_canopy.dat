40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} how evolutionary convergence within shared environments shapes some features of bird song while leaving others unaffected, using as an example the songs of 51 North American wood warblers (Parulinae). I combined published information on breeding habitats and evolutionary relationships to show that the structure of warbler songs is correlated with habitat, whereas the structure of the notes that comprise the songs is relatively unaffected by habitat and more closely related to phylogenetic history. The results confirm known relationships between bird song and habitat, including correlations between song frequency and the type and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>canopy</b> foliage, and between the number and arrangement of notes in the song and foliage density and moisture. More importantly, the results suggest that individual notes and whole songs are to some extent functionally independent, because the configuration of notes shows more evidence of evolutionary constraint than does the way notes are assembled into songs...|$|E

However, few studies have investigated the nesting habitat and survival of Mountain Quail translocated into an area from {{which they have been}} extirpated. We translocated 217 wild Mountain Quail (Oreortyx pictus) from southwestern Oregon to Steens Mountain in southeastern Oregon to re-establish a population in this former part of their range. We measured habitat characteristics at 45 nest sites and 90 random sites to identify which habitat characteristics are important in Mountain Quail nest site selection. We found that canopy cover of shrubs, trees, and rocks, and shrub height 8 m from the nest were the 2 most important characteristics influencing Mountain Quail nest-site selection. Mean shrub height at nest sites was approximately 1 m tall and mean canopy cover was 28 %. Managing habitat for shrubs of this height and a similar <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>canopy</b> cover will increase habitat suitable for Mountain Quail reproduction.

40|$|The high {{temporal}} {{resolution of the}} NOAA/AVHRR satellite data can provide an efficient and consistent way for biomass and yield monitoring and assessment. The reflected radiation provides {{an indication of the}} type and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>canopy.</b> A combination of spectral bands results in the vegetation indices, which are based on the spectral signatures of vegetation and account for the difference in response of the vegetation to the visible and near infrared channels. A widely used index for vegetation monitoring is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is the normalized difference of visible (red) and near infrared channels. The condition, distribution, structure and the development of the vegetation through the phenological stages can affect the relation between yield and NDVI. The primary objective of this study consists of examining the feasibility of applying a regression model for cotton yield monitoring by using the NDVI. NOAA/AVHRR images of six areas covered with cotton have been examined for a period of three years. The results show that the temporal variability of cotton yield from year to year can be monitored by the use of NDVI. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Treatments included burning alone, burning with thinning, and burning with clear-cutting. Plant abundance and diversity were compared before treatment and one year after treatment. Ninety-nine plant species were identified during the study, of which 40 were new following treatment, although most of these were forest associates. Increases in diversity of understory species were observed after treatment, particularly in plots with combined burning and thinning. The forb group was most consistent in response to treatment, increasing in cover an average of 9 % in burn-only plots to 33 % in burn-clear plots. Carex spp. and Eupatorium rugosum were the species most consistently responsive to treatments, but responses varied widely among other species. <b>Density</b> <b>of</b> <b>canopy</b> tree species generally did not decline with burning, indicating fire alone is ineffective in short-term removal of established trees.

For the active geological hazard regime like Taiwan or Japan, {{the change of}} terrain associated with particular event reached {{to the level of}} meter or even tens of meters which enhance the importance of the data processing in regarding to the DTM at both accuracy and efficiency issues. Aerial LiDAR could gather both the DSM and DEM simultaneously, it also provide the intensity map of reflected laser strength that serves as a black & white base image map.

Two hillsides of JES where cerradão physiognomy was present were analyzed, and {{for each of them}} we sampled three positions: base, medium and top. Vertical structure and canopy cover density varied along hillsides. For each site, we extracted the texture pattern for two spatial scales (150 x 150 m and 75 x 75 m). Spatial complexity were estimated by two landscape metrics, both based on informational entropy: a) maximum entropy (H/Hmax), in which high values of complexity are assigned to patterns more disordered; and b) convex function of entropy (LMC), which attribute high values of complexity to patterns situated in intermediate range between order and disorder. Comparing different sites of the same hillside, both metrics had identical results in relation to greatest and smallest values of complexity. In hillside 1, the top side showed greater values. In these area, the cerradão shows high trees with less <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>canopy</b> in comparison to others sites of this hillside, which provides more spatial heterogeneity. For the smaller values of complexity, there was difference in comparison of analyzed extensions in hillside 1 : for 150 x 150 m spatial scale, was attributed medium hillside site to smaller values of complexity; for 75 x 75 m, the base had the smallest values. However, the value of complexity of medium and low hillsides for the same spatial extension were very close. In hillside 2, on the base of site, which shows a cerradão with shorter trees and lesser canopy cover density in relation to others sites of hillside, texture patterns had highest values of complexity for both entropy measures. The most homogeneity site, located in medium position of hillside and with presence of high trees and canopy density, smallest values were recorded. Based on our findings we can concluded that there is a tendency of sites situated in the top and in the base of hillside showed great values of complexity, while sites located in medium hillside tend to be less complex in terms of spatial heterogeneity. Also, for local scale, the canopy density is more relevant than tree vertical structure on determining the complexity of texture patterns of vegetation. 201...|$|E

40|$|Saltwater Forest is a Dacrydium cupressinum-dominated lowland forest {{covering}} 9000 ha {{in south}} Westland, South Island, New Zealand. Four thousand hectares is managed for sustainable production of indigenous timber. The {{aim of this}} study was to provide an integrated analysis of soils, soil-landform relationships, and soil-vegetation relationships at broad and detailed scales. The broad scale understandings provide a framework in which existing or future studies can be placed and the detailed studies elucidate sources of soil and forest variability. Glacial landforms dominate. They include late Pleistocene lateral, terminal and ablation moraines, and outwash aggradation and degradation terraces. Deposits and landforms from six glacial advances have been recognised ranging from latest Last (Otira) Glaciation to Penultimate (Waimea) Glaciation. The absolute ages of landforms were established by analysis of the thickness and soil stratigraphy of loess coverbeds, augmented with radiocarbon dating and phytolith and pollen analysis. In the prevailing high rainfall of Westland soil formation is rapid. The rate of loess accretion in Saltwater Forest (ca. 30 mm ka⁻¹) has been low enough that soil formation and loess accretion took place contemporaneously. Soils formed in this manner are known as upbuilding soils. The significant difference between upbuilding pedogenesis and pedogenesis in a topdown sense into an existing sediment body is that each subsoil increment of an upbuilding soil has experienced processes of all horizons above. In Saltwater Forest subsoils of upbuilding soils are strongly altered because they have experienced the extremely acid environment of the soil surface at some earlier time. Some soil chronosequence studies in Westland have included upbuilding soils formed in loess as the older members of the sequence. Rates and types of processes inferred from these soils should be reviewed because upbuilding is a different pedogenic pathway to topdown pedogenesis. Landform age and morphology were used as a primary stratification for a study of the soil pattern and nature of soil variability in the 4000 ha production area of Saltwater Forest. The age of landforms (> 14 ka) and rapid soil formation mean that soils are uniformly strongly weathered and leached. Soils include Humic Organic Soils, Perch-gley Podzols, Acid Gley Soils, Allophanic Brown Soils, and Orthic or Pan Podzols. The major influence on the nature of soils is site hydrology which is determined by macroscale features of landforms (slope, relief, drainage density), mesoscale effects related to position on landforms, and microscale influences determined by microtopography and individual tree effects. Much of the soil variability arises at microscales so that it is not possible to map areas of uniform soils at practical map scales. The distribution of soil variability across spatial scales, in relation to the intensity of forest management, dictates that it is most appropriate to map soil complexes with boundaries coinciding with landforms. Disturbance of canopy trees is an important agent in forest dynamics. The frequency of forest disturbance in the production area of Saltwater Forest varies in a systematic way among landforms in accord with changes in abundance of different soils. The frequency of forest turnover is highest on landforms with the greatest abundance of extremely poorly-drained Organic Soils. As the abundance of better-drained soils increases the frequency of forest turnover declines. Changes in turnover frequency are reflected in the mean size and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>canopy</b> trees (Dacrydium cupressinum) among landforms. Terrace and ablation moraine landforms with the greatest abundance of extremely poorly-drained soils have on average the smallest trees growing most densely. The steep lateral moraines, characterised by well drained soils, have fewer, larger trees. The changes manifested at the landform scale are an integration of processes operating over much shorter range as a result of short-range soil variability. The systematic changes in forest structure and turnover frequency among landforms and soils have important implications for sustainable forest management...|$|E

Its canopy {{is a mix}} of red and white pine with balsam fir, quaking aspen, and paper birch with occasional jack pine. The shrub layer varies inversely with the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canopy,</b> and comprises beaked hazel, juneberry, blueberry, and bush honeysuckle. Aspen-birch forest occurs as an early-succession cover type on the moraines, the last areas of the park to be logged. Its canopy is dominated by trembling aspen and paper birch, with balsam fir and red and white pine. Beaked hazel dominates the dense shrub layer, while ground cover is characterized by bracken fern and forbs such as largeleaf aster and sarsaparilla. Lastly the shallow upland till soils support aspen-birch-fir forest. Trembling aspen, paper birch, and balsam fir are of course dominant, with some black and white spruce, red and white pine, and white cedar. Beaked hazel and mountain maple comprise the modest shrub layer, while the ground cover is more litter and grasses than forbs.|$|R
50|$|Vegetation {{classification}} is {{the process}} of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface. Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management. Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used. In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management. Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the woody <b>canopy,</b> floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations. Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.|$|R
40|$|The global {{productivity}} of a vineyard is conditioned {{by the development}} of leaf area. The shoot density and the spatial distribution of leaf area influence the porosity <b>of</b> the <b>canopy</b> and the production of dry matter. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the influence <b>of</b> the shoot <b>density</b> in the production of biomass in renewable parts and in the canopy microclimate, in both positioned and non-positioned training systems. The trial was developed during 2013 and 2014, in a Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard in Albacete (Spain). In two different training systems, one positioned -Vertical Shoot Positioned (VSP) - and another not positioned -Sprawl-, three levels <b>of</b> shoot <b>density</b> were established: 35 000, 55 000 and 70 000 shoots per hectare. At maturity the total leaf area, the external leaf area and the volume occupied by the canopy were determined, and the leaf area density was calculated. At the end of ripening, the biomass produced in renewable vegetative organs ?leaves and shoots- and reproductive organs -cluster - were determined. The higher the shoot density was the greater the production of total biomass, due to increased biomass production in clusters. The individual shoot vigour offset the differences in shoot density, so no differences were observed in the production of vegetative biomass due to the shoot <b>density.</b> The increases <b>of</b> vegetative growth and biomass accumulation due to increased shoot density were higher in Sprawl, the not positioned training system, than in VSP, the positioned one. In 2013, with the increasing <b>of</b> the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> shoot, the amount of biomass produced by leaf area increased in both training systems. But in 2014, no significant differences were found. The increase <b>of</b> leaf area <b>density</b> caused by the increase of the shoot number was higher in VSP than Sprawl. With higher <b>density</b> <b>of</b> shoot, <b>canopy</b> have higher <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> leaf area and therefore less porous...|$|R
40|$|Airborne LiDAR {{point cloud}} {{representing}} a forest contains 3 D data, from which vertical stand structure even of understory layers can be derived. This paper presents a tree segmentation approach for multi-story stands that stratifies the point cloud to canopy layers and segments individual tree crowns within each layer using a digital surface model based tree segmentation method. The novelty {{of the approach}} is the stratification procedure that separates the point cloud to an overstory and multiple understory tree canopy layers by analyzing vertical distributions of LiDAR points within overlapping locales. The procedure {{does not make a}} priori assumptions about the shape and size of the tree crowns and can, independent of the tree segmentation method, be utilized to vertically stratify tree crowns <b>of</b> forest <b>canopies.</b> We applied the proposed approach to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest - a natural deciduous forest with complex and highly variable terrain and vegetation structure. The segmentation results showed that using the stratification procedure strongly improved detecting understory trees (from 46 % to 68 %) at the cost of introducing a fair number of over-segmented understory trees (increased from 1 % to 16 %), while barely affecting the overall segmentation quality of overstory trees. Results of vertical stratification <b>of</b> the <b>canopy</b> showed that the point <b>density</b> <b>of</b> understory <b>canopy</b> layers were suboptimal for performing a reasonable tree segmentation, suggesting that acquiring denser LiDAR point clouds would allow more improvements in segmenting understory trees. As shown by inspecting correlations of the results with forest structure, the segmentation approach is applicable to a variety of forest types...|$|R
