50|$|A choke {{connection}} is formed by mating one choke flange and one cover (or gasket/cover) flange. The central {{region of the}} choke flange face is very slightly recessed {{so that it does}} not touch the face of the cover flange, but is separated from it by a narrow gap. The recessed region is bounded by a deep choke trench (or ditch or groove) cut into the face of the flange. Choke flanges are only used with rectangular waveguide, and are invariably pressurizable, having a <b>gasket</b> <b>groove</b> encircling the choke ditch. The presence of these two concentric circular grooves makes choke flanges easily recognizable. The left-hand flange in figure 2 is a choke flange.|$|E
50|$|IEC flanges are {{identified}} by an alphanumeric code consisting of; the letter U, P or C for Unpressurizable (plain cover), Pressurizable (with a <b>gasket</b> <b>groove)</b> and Choke (with both choke gasket grooves); a second letter, indicating {{the shape and}} other details of the flange and finally the IEC identifier for the waveguide. For standard rectangular waveguide the second letter is A to E, where A and C are round flanges, B is square and D and E are rectangular. So for example UBR220 is a square plain cover flange for R220 waveguide (that is, for WG20, WR42), PDR84 is a rectangular gasket flange for R84 waveguide (WG15, WR112) and CAR70 is a round choke flange for R70 waveguide (WG14, WR137).|$|E
40|$|The {{regulatory}} compliance of the containment system is of essential {{importance for the}} design assessment of Type B(U) transport packages. The requirements of the IAEA regulations SSR- 6 for accident conditions of transport implies high load on the containment system. The integrity of the containment system has to be ensured under the mechanical and thermal tests. The containment system of German transport packages for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high level waste (HLW) usually includes bolted lids with metal gaskets. BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing as the German competent authority for the mechanical and thermal design assessment of approved transport packages has developed the guideline BAM-GGR 012 {{for the analysis of}} bolted lid and trunnion systems. According to this guideline the finite element (FE) method is recommended for the calculations. FE analyses provide more accurate and detailed information about loading and deformation of such kind of structures. The results allow the strength assessment of the lid and bolts as well as the evaluation of relative displacements between the lid and the cask body {{in the area of the}} <b>gasket</b> <b>groove.</b> This paper discusses aspects concerning FE simulation of lid systems for SNF and HLW transpor...|$|E

40|$|Flanged joints are {{fundamental}} components of pipelines {{and they must}} be optimized to avoid leaks, bolts overstress and flanged joints damage. Overcoming standards indications as overtorqueing, and combination of different parameters, as difference in hardness between flanges and <b>gasket,</b> can cause <b>groove</b> impressions. Aim {{of this study is to}} provide an efficient tool to optimize the choice of characteristic parameters of flanged joints, by numerical simulations. Geometries of a real test case are simulated by FE models, considering different values of flange and gasket hardness, as well as tightening torques, in order to cover possible ranges. From the analyses, it is possible to highlight that a particular combination of hardness difference and over-torque is responsible for permanent flange impression...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{assessment}} of flange joints with gasket. The first part defines term flange joint and its load. It surveys and assesses the possible alternatives of design solution. Mentioned {{is the issue of}} bolt connections with pretension, including force relations in the joint, determination rigidity of parts and their strength. In addition, analysis of the causes of bolts failures and their removal, methods of creating pretension. It gives an overview of the most widely used types of gaskets, their properties, application and definition of characteristic values of gaskets and their determination according to ČSN EN 13 555. Another section {{deals with the}} design process of flange joints, standards for the design, desired outputs and assesses analytical and numerical approach. Computational program was created in MS Excel 2007 for design calculation of flange joints according to ČSN EN 1591 - 1. Verification of the results was performed with calculation of identical models using finite element method (FEM) in ANSYS Workbench 14. 0. Errors in standards formulas were submitted. In conclusion, the results obtained analytically and by FEM were assessed for a specific load conditions of gate valve DN 300. Camprofile (<b>grooved)</b> <b>gasket</b> with nonlinear material model was used...|$|R
40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steel flanges are normally forged to form, {{as required by}} the ASTM A 182 /A 182 M standard, but may also potentially be machined directly from forged {{stainless steel}} bar. In order to evaluate the integrity of such flanges, axisymmetric elastic-plastic finite element models have been developed, considering static effects such as bolt load and internal pressure. Additionally, tensile testing of a sample forged bar (UNS S 31803) has been conducted. The stress distribution in a flange during gasket seating and operating conditions has been determined, as well as the degree of plastic strain caused by the bolt loads. The maximum stresses {{have been found to be}} around the same values as the minimum yield strength requirement of the studied material (UNS S 31803), and the location of the maximum stress concentrations have been identified as the <b>gasket</b> <b>groove.</b> The tensile tests of the forged bar (UNS S 31803) have shown that the yield and tensile strength properties are considerably higher than the standardized minimum requirements. The elastic modulus of the forged bar has also been determined, and was found to be lower than anticipated in the axisymmetric models. Some specimens have also been found to exhibit highly non-linear elastic properties. </p...|$|E
