5|$|After peak intensity, Nadine began {{weakening}} {{once again}} and deteriorated to a tropical storm at 1200UTC, on October1. Northwesterly winds began to increase on October3, after an upper-level trough that was causing low wind shear moved eastward. A few hours later, the low-level center became partially exposed, before becoming fully separated from the convection by 1500UTC. Due to strong wind shear and cold sea surface temperatures, showers and thunderstorms rapidly diminished, and by late on October3, Nadine became <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> deep convection. At 0000UTC on October4, Nadine transitioned into an extratropical low-pressure area, while located about 195miles (315km) southwest of the central Azores.

5|$|Dora {{held its}} peak {{strength}} for just six hours before {{it began to}} weaken due to cooler waters {{and the presence of}} wind shear. Although the hurricane's initial weakening phase was gradual, the overall structure of Dora quickly deteriorated in response to increasingly hostile wind shear around the storm. The storm's eye abruptly dissipated less than 12hours after Dora's peak intensity, By 1800UTC on July22, the tropical cyclone had weakened to tropical storm intensity, undergoing an 80mph (130km/h) decrease in winds in just 24hours. Continued weakening prompted the NHC to downgrade Dora to a tropical depression two days later at 1200UTC as the system curved west of the Baja California Peninsula. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> thunderstorm activity.

5|$|By September3, Tropical Depression Kristy {{was without}} {{persistent}} deep convection for about 18hours. However, thunderstorms increased around the center later that day, developing a shallow eye-like feature. The convection persisted {{along the western}} periphery of the circulation, and it is estimated Kristy re-attained tropical storm status about 24hours after it was first downgraded to depression status. Around the same time, the cyclone began a steady motion to the southwest. Its re-intensification was short-lived, as continued wind shear weakened the convection and left the center <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> thunderstorms. On September4, Kristy weakened to tropical depression status, and though quick dissipation was predicted, officials noted that intermittent convection flares could develop. One such convection flare occurred on September5, which persisted around the center and warranted Kristy being upgraded to tropical storm status. By that time, wind shear had decreased somewhat and the storm had turned westward, and with a track through warm water temperatures, Kristy was forecast to maintain tropical storm status for five days.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 3, {{strong wind}} shear over Chris {{detached}} the deep convection {{from the low}} level circulation, while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west into an area of drier air. By mid-day on the 3rd the circulation was <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> convection within 85miles (135km), while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. Late on August 3, deep convection developed over the center of circulation again, though persistent vertical shear weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4. Due to computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear, forecasters indicated the possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60mph (95km/h) storm. However, convection remained minimal, and Chris degenerated into a remnant {{area of low pressure}} late on August 4. Late on August 5, convection increased in the remnants of the storm, and forecasters indicated the potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico due to marginally favorable conditions. Redevelopment never occurred, and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana, Cuba on August 6.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakening}} trend {{continued through}} the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong southerly shear.

Josephine regained {{a small amount of}} convection in the late night hours, but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm. Due to the lack of convection, Josephine was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at 11p.m. (EDT) with winds of 35mph (55km/h). Since there was no convection around the system, it would have normally been classified a remnant low but, due to the possibility of the storm regenerating over the next several days, it was considered a tropical depression. The next morning, Josephine was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm. No redevelopment was expected with Josephine as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated.|$|E

There's something comforting about the meaningless hindbrain tension that The Associate generates in the reader — empty tension, the kind where there's nothing genuine at stake. Comforting too is the cozy quaintness of Grisham's little world. It's supposed to be a scary place, in theory, full of brooding criminals and impossible choices, but it's really a relic of the American past, one as sentimental and archaic as a Norman Rockwell painting [...] [...] [...] The Associate is high-calorie comfort food, a thriller that doesn't actually thrill." ...|$|R
5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Located {{in an area}} of {{warm water}} {{temperatures}} and light wind shear, Hurricane Paul continued to intensify and organize; its well-defined eye was surrounded by a ring of deep convection while outflow remained strong to the north and south. On October23, while located 465miles (750km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Paul reached its peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h), a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A large trough located off the west coast of California turned the hurricane to the north-northwest, and later to the north. The combination of increasing shear and dry air quickly weakened Paul to a tropical storm on October24 as its low-level circulation became detached from the diminishing convection. The storm then turned to the northeast after passing near Socorro Island. Despite increasing wind shear of over 50mph (80km/h), Paul remained a tropical storm while its circulation remained on the southwest side of its developing deep convection. Early on October25, the storm passed about 100miles (160km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. The circulation briefly became involved with the deep convection as it accelerated northeastward, though as it approached the coast of Sinaloa, the center again decoupled from the upper level circulation. Later that day, Paul weakened to a tropical depression a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and turned to the north. Early the next day, the depression, <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> deep convection, made landfall near Isla Altamura in northwestern Sinaloa. Hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the dissipating tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|The post-war boom in {{automobile}} {{travel and}} the construction of the Interstate Highway System, as well as competition from commercial airlines, led to the decline of passenger rail. The Pennsylvania Railroad eliminated passenger service between Erie and Pittsburgh in April1948. It eventually ended through service to Philadelphia, requiring passengers to transfer in Emporium, Pennsylvania, and discontinued service from Erie altogether on March27, 1965. By 1968, the number of New York Central trains was also reduced to five per day. The two railroads were merged on February1, 1968, and formed the Penn Central Transportation Company. Penn Central continued to run the former New York Central passenger trains, until the last departed Union Station on April30, 1971. The newly created National Passenger Rail Corporation, more commonly known as Amtrak, took over nationwide passenger rail operations the next day. Amtrak continued to operate a New York-to-Chicago train until January1972, the Lake Shore, which had a station stop in Erie starting in November1971. However, the poor condition of the track between Buffalo and Chicago, as well as the service's general lack of profitability, led to the Lake Shores demise. Erie remained <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> passenger rail service until Amtrak reintroduced the former New York Central train, the Lake Shore Limited, on November30, 1975.|$|E
