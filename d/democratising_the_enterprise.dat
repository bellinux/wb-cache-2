40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa has {{witnessed}} {{the end of}} foreign colonial rule, {{the rise and fall}} of autocratic political regimes, and the disappearance of statist command economies. The challenges were to turn populations into coherent nations owing allegiance to <b>the</b> state; to <b>democratise</b> <b>the</b> state structures that govern these populations; and to liberalise the rules that regulate economic transactions. An important source to assess these prospects are the views and attitudes of ordinary Africans. This essay reflects on the original data derived from a crossnational research project. Nine African states were surveyed between 1999 and 2000. An attempt is made to gather some propositions from the analysis of the data. Many present serious challenges to common wisdom about African politics. It appears that the process of nationbuilding has created coherent political communities with high levels of national identity; that <b>democratising</b> <b>the</b> state in Africa builds on existing indigenous demands from ordinary Africans; and that economic liberalisation proceeds in the face of a mixed set of values about market and state...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the workings of popular national agency in late nineteenth-century Amsterdam and the question in what ways {{and to what extent}} ‘ordinary’ citizens constructed and experienced ‘the Netherlands’ through their urban surroundings. It steers away from a top-down perspective and considers the lower and middle social classes as actual actors in <b>the</b> process of <b>democratising</b> <b>the</b> nation. The argument of the book is centred around five case studies: the popular experience of public monuments and statues; the singing of the national anthem; popular Orangism; the public response to the Boer Wars; and the commercialisation of the nation in an urban context...|$|R

It is also a way for workers to better the terms and conditions of their contracts in an orderly and regulated way.|$|R

In order to test the validity of these arguments, the author will undertake a comparative study {{of the impact of the}} Internet on recent general elections in Malaysia and Singapore. The study will demonstrate that in the case of Singapore, the Internet has merely exerted some pressure on the pre-existing laws and state-imposed norms governing free speech; in contrast, in Malaysia, the Internet was a major contributory factor to what has been described as...|$|R
