5|$|Candidates for non-operative {{treatment}} {{are limited to}} skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small, intact lesion {{and the absence of}} loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote <b>healing</b> <b>in</b> the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.|$|E
5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for <b>healing</b> <b>in</b> the fragment.|$|E
5|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players must visit {{a church}} (known as a House of <b>Healing</b> <b>in</b> the NES translations) {{and talk to}} a priest or nun to save the games' progress; in Dragon Warrior, players {{had to talk to}} a king to save their progress, though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use a {{password}} save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} ofswitching {{from one}} type ofHz-receptor antag-onist (Hz-blocker) to another, {{in the treatment}} of Hz-blocker-resistant ulcers was investigated using Hz-blockers with five-membered rings (five-membered-ring agents) - such as cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine- and an Hz-blocker with a six-membered ring, roxatidine.

5|$|The Augustinian Friars were {{originally}} {{an order of}} hermits in northern Italy who Pope Alexander IV first congregated into a single body in 1256. The Order spread to France and then to England after being invited by Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, to found Clare Priory in Suffolk, by the River Stour. On 3 September 1249, de Clare was able to obtain a writ of protection for the friars from the King. The brethren were clothed in black and observed the rule of St Augustine of Hippo. Augustianian friars had been in England since 1250 and they helped by preaching and <b>healing</b> <b>in</b> the community.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} time it {{typically}} takes a piercing to heal varies widely according to the placement of the piercing. Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the clitoral hood and Prince Albert piercings <b>healing</b> <b>in</b> as little as a month, though some may take longer. Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years. The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{she married}} a man named Frank (his surname is unknown), {{and they had a}} {{daughter}} two years later. The couple divorced in the early 1920s; Frank gained custody of their daughter, although Ruth had access as well. Little is known for certain about Ruth's life from the mid-1920s to the 1940s, but she worked in a variety of jobs. She held positions in several restaurants and also worked as a model, real-estate broker, resort manager, and nanny. In the 1940s, she enrolled at the Church of Religious Science, where she studied New Thought under Ernest Holmes, and was separately introduced to psychic <b>healing</b> <b>in</b> that decade. Over time, she also became interested in spiritualism, channeling, and past-life regression. She married Benjamin Arnold in the 1940s; the marriage lasted until his death in 1951. Two years later, she remarried and settled in Lancaster, California. Her third husband, George Marian, owned a milk-delivery business which Ruth helped him to manage. In the mid-1950s, she became interested in acting and earned the starring role in a local play.|$|E
