500|$|During {{the height}} of the Daddies' popularity, Perry found the band's {{mainstream}} notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life, claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public. He would later recall, [...] "It's a total cliché, but [...] doesn't make you happy. There's a lot missing. Success has given people the right to yell at me on the street, but I don't really feel like it's given me any dignity". Already feeling burnt out from the Daddies' constant touring, Perry's frustration was only exacerbated by the media's persistent dismissal of the Daddies as a retro novelty act, though he later claimed to have felt pressured to maintain the image due to audience and media expectations. When the band began to face criticism and accusations of selling out from their Northwest fanbase, the Daddies fought to further push themselves away from their mainstream typecasting: in a 1999 interview, responding to their place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> scene, Perry retorted [...] " [...] unapologetically play ska right in the face {{of people who want to}} hear swing".|$|E

He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the [...] "bobby soxers". He released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of From Here to Eternity, with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956), Come Fly with Me (1958), Only the Lonely (1958) and Nice 'n' Easy (1960).|$|E
500|$|With the war {{fifteen years}} {{in the past and}} Union generals at the head of both tickets, the tactic was less {{effective}} than the Republicans hoped. [...] Realizing this, they adjusted their approach to claim that Democrats would lower the country's protective tariff, which would allow cheaper manufactured goods to be imported from Europe, and thereby put thousands out of work. This argument struck home <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> states of New York and Indiana, where many were employed in manufacturing. Hancock did not help his own cause when, in an attempt to remain neutral on the tariff, he said that [...] "he tariff question is a local question," [...] which only made him appear uninformed about an important issue. [...] Candidates for high office did not personally campaign in those days, but as state Republican chairman, Arthur played a part in the campaign in his usual fashion: overseeing the effort in New York and raising money. The funds were crucial in the close election, and winning his home state of New York was critical. The Republicans carried New York by 20,000 votes and, in an election with the largest turnout of qualified voters ever recorded—78.4%—they won the nationwide popular vote by just 7,018 votes. [...] The electoral college result was more decisive—214 to 155—and Garfield and Arthur were elected.|$|E

2500|$|To a small extent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> era, {{but most}} {{strongly}} in the bebop period, {{the role of the}} drummer evolved from an almost purely time-keeping position to that of a member of the interactive musical ensemble. Using the clearly defined ride pattern as a base, which was brought from the previous rough quality to the smooth, flowing rhythm we know today by [...] "Papa" [...] Jo Jones, as well as a standardized drum set, drummers were able to experiment with comping patterns and subtleties in their playing. One such innovator was Sidney [...] "Big Sid" [...] Catlett. His many contributions included comping with the bass drum, playing [...] "on top of the beat" [...] (imperceptibly speeding up), playing with the soloist instead of just accompanying him, playing solos of his own with many melodic and subtle qualities, and incorporating melodicism into all of his playing. Another influential drummer of bebop was Kenny Clarke, the man who switched the four beat pulse that had previously been played on the bass drum to the ride cymbal, effectively making it possible for comping to move forward in the future. Once again, this time in the late 1950s and most of the '60s, drummers began to change the entire basis of their art. Elvin Jones, in an interview with Down Beat magazine, described it as [...] "a natural step".|$|E

During <b>the</b> backward <b>swing</b> <b>in</b> stage 3, <b>the</b> hamstrings (bicep femoris, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus) are activated to flex the knee and extend <b>the</b> hip <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> limb. Hamstrings are also activated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supporting limb throughout <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> stages until foot comes {{into contact with the}} ball to allow stabilization and balance. Stabilizer muscles, such as the gluteus medius and psoas, on the supporting limb are active to prevent the hip from adducting. As the kicking limb begins forward movement in stage 4, quadriceps, hip flexor muscles (iliopsoas), knee extensor muscles including the rectus femoris creates concentric activity to produce a fast forward velocity toward the ball by extending the knee and flexing the hip. During <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> stage prior to contact of <b>the</b> ball <b>in</b> stage 5, there is greater activation of the rectus femoris and the vastus medialis that may contribute to final knee extension speed.

2500|$|The kindred spirits {{developing}} the new music gravitated to sessions at Minton's Playhouse, where Monk and Clarke {{were in the}} house band, and Monroe's Uptown House, where Max Roach {{was in the house}} band. [...] Part of the atmosphere created at jams like the ones found at Minton's Playhouse was an air of exclusivity: the [...] "regular" [...] musicians would often reharmonize the standards, add complex rhythmic and phrasing devices into their melodies, or [...] "heads," [...] and play them at breakneck tempos in order to exclude those whom they considered outsiders or simply weaker players. These pioneers of the new music (which would later be termed bebop or bop, although Parker himself never used the term, feeling it demeaned the music) began exploring advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords and chord substitutions. The bop musicians advanced these techniques with a more freewheeling, intricate and often arcane approach. Bop improvisers built upon the phrasing ideas first brought to attention by Lester Young's soloing style. They would often deploy phrases over an odd number of bars and overlap their phrases across bar lines and across major harmonic cadences. Christian and the other early boppers would also begin stating a harmony in their improvised line before it appeared in the song form being outlined by the rhythm section. This momentary dissonance creates a strong sense of forward motion in the improvisation. [...] The sessions also attracted top musicians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> idiom such as Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, and Don Byas. [...] Byas became the first tenor saxophone player to fully assimilate the new bebop style in his playing. [...] In 1944 the crew of innovators was joined by Dexter Gordon, a tenor saxophone player from the west coast in New York with the Louis Armstrong band, and a young trumpet player attending the Juilliard School of Music, Miles Davis..|$|E
