5|$|The juice {{forms the}} basis for various popular cordials, juice drinks, <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> smoothies. Typically blended with apple or other red fruits, it is also mixed with {{pomegranate}} and grape juice. Macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the apéritif liqueur crème de cassis, {{which in turn is}} added to white wine to produce a Kir or to champagne to make a Kir Royale.|$|E
5|$|Glucose, {{dextrose}} or grape sugar, occurs {{naturally in}} fruits and plant <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> {{is the primary}} product of photosynthesis. Most ingested carbohydrates are converted into glucose during digestion {{and it is the}} form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the bloodstream. It can be manufactured from starch by the addition of enzymes or in the presence of acids. Glucose syrup is a liquid form of glucose that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis.|$|E
40|$|Gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) and gas chromatographyolfactometry (GC-O) {{were used}} to determine the aromatic composition and aroma active compounds of fruit <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> peel oil of Jinchen sweet orange fruit. Totals of 49 and 32 compounds were identified in fruit <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> peel oil, respectively. GC-O was performed to study the aromatic profile of Jinchen fruit <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> peel oil. A total of 41 components appeared to contribute to the aroma of fruit <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> peel oil. Twelve components were the odorants perceived in both samples. The aromatic compositions of fruit juice were more complex than that of peel oil. Ethyl butanoate, ÃŽÂ²-myrcene, octanal, linalool, ÃŽÂ±-pinene, and decanal were found to be responsible for the aromatic notes in fruit <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> peel oil. Nineteen components have been perceived only in the <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> ten compounds were described as aromatic components of only the peel oil by the panelists. These differences lead to the different overall aroma between fruit <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> peel oil...|$|R
50|$|When three commercially {{available}} juice mixes containing unspecified percentages of açaí juice were compared for in vitro antioxidant capacity against red wine, tea, six types of pure fruit <b>juice,</b> <b>and</b> pomegranate <b>juice,</b> the average antioxidant capacity was ranked {{lower than that}} of pomegranate juice, Concord grape <b>juice,</b> blueberry <b>juice,</b> <b>and</b> red wine.

5|$|Measurement of {{antioxidant}} {{content in}} food {{is not a}} straightforward process, as antioxidants collectively are {{a diverse group of}} compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. In food science, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) was once an industry standard for antioxidant strength of whole foods, <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> food additives. However, the United States Department of Agriculture withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed to support the free-radical theory or roles for ingested phytochemicals, especially for polyphenols. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from in vitro experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} that both {{adults and children}} reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. A reduction to below 5% of total energy intake brings additional health benefits, especially in what regards dental caries (cavities in the teeth). These recommendations {{were based on the}} totality of available evidence reviewed regarding the relationship between free sugars intake and body weight and dental caries. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> fruit juice concentrates.|$|E
5|$|When the {{predecessor}} of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu {{by adding the}} Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as Icees, <b>juices,</b> <b>and</b> bottled waters. As the company expanded {{both inside and outside}} the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its products, or brings out completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.|$|E

40|$|Mao or Makmao (Antidesma thwaitesianum Müll. Arg.) is a {{wild plant}} {{found in the}} {{northeast}} of Thailand. Mao is one of fruits which are source of anthocyanins. Mao fruits are used for <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> concentrate which are consumed for healthy drinks. Determination of the kinetic parameters is essential to predict the quality changes and stability of anthocyanins in Mao <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> concentrate that occur during storage. The purpose {{of this research was}} to study the degradation of anthocyanins in Mao <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> concentrate during storage at 5, 30 and 37 °C for 15 days. The storage stability of Mao anthocyanins was studied in 15 °Brix <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> 45 °Brix concentrate. The degradation kinetic (k), half-life (t 1 / 2), activation energy (Ea) and Q 10 values for Mao anthocyanins degradation were determined. The results indicated that analysis of kinetic data for the degradation of anthocyanins followed a first-order reaction. An increase storage temperature from 5 to 30 and 37 °C increased k value of anthocyanins in Mao <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> concentrate. Increasing storage temperature decreased t 1 / 2 value of anthocyanins in both concentrations. At 5, 30 and 37 °C, the t 1 / 2 of anthocyanins decreased from 35 to 13 and 5 days for Mao <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> 32 to 25 and 21 days for Mao concentrate. The Ea value of the anthocyanins degradation in Mao <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> concentrate were 38. 03 and 8. 42 kJ/mol, respectively. Q 10 values of both Mao <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> concentrate at 30 - 37 °C were higher than those were storaged at 5 - 30 °C. Thus higher stability of anthocyanins was achieved by using concentration and storage at lower temperature...|$|R
