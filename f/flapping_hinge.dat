This major difficulty was resolved by Juan de la Cierva's introduction of the <b>flapping</b> <b>hinge.</b> In 1923, de la Cierva's first successful autogyro was flown in Spain by Lt. Gomez Spencer. In 1925 he brought his C.6 to Britain and demonstrated it to the Air Ministry at Farnborough, Hampshire. This machine had a four blade rotor with flapping hinges but relied upon conventional airplane controls for pitch, roll and yaw. It was based upon an Avro 504K fuselage, initial rotation of the rotor was achieved by the rapid uncoiling of a rope passed around stops on the undersides of the blades.|$|E
5000|$|The second Gyrodyne was {{grounded}} {{during the}} accident investigation which determined <b>flapping</b> <b>hinge</b> retaining nut failure due to poor machining as the cause. The extensively modified second prototype, renamed Jet Gyrodyne, flew in January 1954. Though retaining the name [...] "Gyrodyne", the Jet Gyrodyne was a compound gyroplane, {{and did not}} operate on the same principle as the original aircraft. It had a two-blade rotor manually controlled with cyclic and collective pitch mechanisms that acted directly on each rotor blade and was driven by tip jets fed with air from two compressors driven by the Alvis Leonides radial engine. Pusher propellers, one mounted {{at the tip of}} each stub wing, provided yaw control through differential collective pitch and thrust for forward flight. The Jet Gyrodyne was constructed to provide rotor drive and operational data for the Fairey Rotodyne compound gyroplane.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, low-g {{conditions}} can be disastrous for helicopters. In {{such a situation}} their rotors may flap beyond normal limits. The excessive flapping can cause {{the root of the}} blades to exceed the limit of their hinges and this condition, known as mast bumping, can cause the separation of the blades from the hub or for the mast to shear, and hence detach the whole system from the aircraft, falling from the sky. This is especially true for helicopters with teetering rotors, such as the two-bladed design seen on Robinson helicopters.This effect was first discovered when many accidents with Bell UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters occurred. These particular helicopters simply crashed without any obvious cause. Later, it was found that these accidents usually happened during low terrain flight after passing a ridge and initiating a dive from the previous climb.Articulated and rigid rotor systems do not lose controlling forces up to 0g, but may encounter this depending on their <b>flapping</b> <b>hinge</b> offset from the mast. However, dangerous situations, as with a teetering rotor, may not occur.|$|E
50|$|The offset <b>flapping</b> <b>hinges</b> and {{hydraulic}} servos {{gave more}} positive flight control under differing loading conditions, isolated the flight controls from vibration, and lessened control forces; the H-19 could be flown {{with only two}} fingers on the cyclic control.|$|R

During phase 1 of the two-phase program, an onboard excitation system provided independent control surface movements {{that were used}} to develop a loads model for the wing structure and wing control surfaces. The resulting loads model, which was used to develop the control laws for phase 2, is described. The loads model was developed from flight data {{through the use of a}} multiple linear regression technique. The loads model input consisted of aircraft states and control surface positions, in addition to nonlinear inputs that were calculated from flight-measured parameters. The loads model output for each wing consisted of wing-root bending moment and torque, wing-fold bending moment and torque, inboard and outboard leading-edge <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> moment, trailing-edge <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> moment, and aileron hinge moment. The development of the Active Aeroelastic Wing loads model is described, and the ability of the model to predict loads during phase 2 research maneuvers is demonstrated.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the effect of}} prolonging the standard suction duration during laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) {{and its effect on}} <b>flap</b> thickness and <b>hinge</b> length using sub-Bowman keratomileusis (SBK) microkeratome. Methods: Fifty-six eyes (28 patients) were included and divided into 2 groups; Group-A: eyes with flatter corneas (36 eyes, 18 patients) and mean keratometric readings ranging from 40. 13 to 43. 71 diopters (D). Group-B: eyes with steeper corneas (20 eyes, 10 patients) with mean keratometric readings ranging from 43. 85 to 46. 72  D. One-Use-Plus SBK microkeratome was used for flap creation.

In left eyes, the surgeon waited for 10  s after suction was built up before <b>flap</b> creation. <b>Flap</b> <b>hinge</b> length and <b>flap</b> thickness were measured using surgical caliper and ultrasonic pachymetry, respectively. Results: Statistically significant differences were observed in corneal <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> size between right eyes versus left eyes, with a mean of 3. 98  ±  0. 48 vs. 3. 78  ±  0. 55  mm (p <  0. 001).

Sub-group analysis of Group-A vs. Group-B revealed hinge sizes that were significantly larger in steeper corneas (p <  0. 01 and p <  0. 05, respectively).

5000|$|Juan de la Cierva {{developed}} the fully articulating rotor for the autogyro. The {{basis of his}} design permitted successful helicopter development. In a fully articulated rotor system, each rotor blade {{is attached to the}} rotor hub through a series of hinges that let the blade move independently of the others. These rotor systems usually have three or more blades. The blades are allowed to flap, feather, and lead or lag independently of each other. The horizontal hinge, called the <b>flapping</b> <b>hinge,</b> allows the blade to move up and down. This movement is called flapping and is designed to compensate for dissymmetry of lift. The <b>flapping</b> <b>hinge</b> may be located at varying distances from the rotor hub, and there may be more than one hinge. The vertical hinge, called the lead-lag hinge or drag hinge, allows the blade to move back and forth. This movement is called lead-lag, dragging, or hunting. Dampers are usually used to prevent excess back and forth movement around the drag hinge. The purpose of the drag hinge and dampers is to compensate for acceleration and deceleration caused by the Coriolis effect. Later models have switched from using traditional bearings to elastomeric bearings. Elastomeric bearings are naturally fail-safe and their wear is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this design. The third hinge in the fully articulated system is called the feathering hinge about the feathering axis. This hinge is responsible for the change in pitch of rotor blades excited via pilot input to the Collective or Cyclic.A variation of the fully articulated system is the [...] "soft-in-plane" [...] rotor system. This type of rotor can be found on several aircraft produced by Bell Helicopter, such as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. This system is similar to the fully articulated type in that each blade has the ability to lead/lag and hunt independent of the other blades. The difference between a fully articulated system and soft-in-plane system is that the soft-in-plane system utilizes a composite yoke. This yoke is attached to the mast and runs through the blade grips between the blades and the shear bearing inside the grip. This yoke does transfer some movement of one blade to another, usually opposing blades. While this is not fully articulated, the flight characteristics are very similar and maintenance time and cost are reduced.|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests of}} aeroelastically {{designed}} helicopter rotor models {{were conducted to}} obtain rotor aerodynamic performance and dynamic response data pertaining to two-bladed teetering rotors with a wider chord and lower hover tip speed than currently employed on production helicopters. The effects of a <b>flapping</b> <b>hinge</b> at 62 percent radius were also studied. Finally, the effects of changing tip mass on operating characteristics of the rotor with the outboard <b>flapping</b> <b>hinge</b> were examined. The models were tested at several shaft angles of attack for five advance ratios, 0. 15, 0. 25, 0. 35, 0. 40, and 0. 45. For each combination of shaft angle and advance ratio, the rotor lift was varied {{over a wide range}} to include simulated maneuver conditions. At each test condition, rotor aerodynamic performance and dynamic response data were obtained. From these tests, it was found that wide-chord rotors may be subject to large control forces.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Static Test Facility of the NASA Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel to determine the internal performance of two-dimensional convergent-divergent nozzles designed to have simultaneous pitch and yaw thrust vectoring capability. This concept utilized divergent flap rotation of thrust vectoring in the pitch plane and deflection of flat yaw <b>flaps</b> <b>hinged</b> {{at the end of}} the sidewalls for yaw thrust vectoring. The hinge location of the yaw flaps was varied at four positions from the nozzle exit plane to the throat plane. The yaw flaps were designed to contain the flow laterally independent of power setting. In order to eliminate any physical interference between the yaw flap deflected into the exhaust stream and the divergent flaps, the downstream corners of both upper and lower divergent flaps were cut off to allow for up to 30 deg of yaw flap deflection. The impact of varying the nozzle pitch vector angle, throat area, yaw <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> location, yaw <b>flap</b> length, and yaw flap deflection angle on nozzle internal performance characteristics, was studied. High-pressure air was used to simulate jet exhaust at nozzle pressure ratios up to 7. 0. Static results indicate that configurations with the yaw <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> located upstream of the exit plane provide relatively high levels of thrust vectoring efficiency without causing large losses in resultant thrust ratio. Therefore, these configurations represent a viable concept for providing simultaneous pitch and yaw thrust vectoring...|$|R

The yaw <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> location was varied along the divergent region of the nozzle at four locations including the exit plane and the throat plane.

Effects of the nonuniform downwash model of White and Blake on the blade flapping motion are examined, and the theoretical calculation is then correlated with experimental test data. The condition for achieving perfect decoupling of the flapping response due to aircraft pitch and roll rates, which was previously obtained for a hovering rotor, is evaluated in forward flight. The results show that negligible coupling is achieved in forward flight; moreover, there is the additional benefit of a slight reduction in the coupling of the roll rate to coning.

The steady state flapping response is examined with respect to control input and aircraft angular rate which leads to a feedforward control law for control decoupling through cross feed, and a feedback control law to decouple the steady state flapping response. The condition for achieving perfect decoupling of the flapping response due to aircraft pitch and roll rates without using feedback control is also found for the hover case.

Variables studied included collective pitch angle, flapping-hinge offset, rotor angle of attack, and tip-speed ratio. The results show that the blade periodic bending moments generally increase with tip-speed ratio up into the transition region, diminish over a certain range of tip-speed ratio, and increase again at higher tip-speed ratios. Above the transition region, the bending moments increase with collective pitch angle and rotor angle of attack. The absence of a <b>flapping</b> <b>hinge</b> results in a significant amplification of the periodic bending moments, the magnitudes of which increase with tip-speed ratio. When the <b>flapping</b> <b>hinge</b> is used, an increase in flapping-hinge offset results in reduced period bending moments.

40|$|This is a {{follow-on}} {{study to}} a 2010 correlation effort. Measured {{data from the}} SMART rotor test in the NASA Ames 40 - by 80 - Foot Wind Tunnel are compared with CAMRAD II calculations. As background, during the wind tunnel test, unexpectedly high inboard loads were encountered, and it was hypothesized {{at that time that}} due to changes in the flexbeams over the years, the flexbeam properties used in the analysis needed updating. Boeing Mesa, recently updated these properties. This correlation study uses the updated flexbeam properties. Compared to earlier studies, the following two enhancements are implemented: i) the inboard loads (pitchcase and flexbeam loads) correlation is included for the first time (reliable prediction of the inboard loads is a prerequisite for any future anticipated flight-testing); ii) the number of blade modes is increased to better capture the flap dynamics and the pitchcase-flexbeam dynamics. Also, aerodynamically, both the rolled-up wake model and the more complex, multiple trailer wake model are used, with the latter slightly improving the blade chordwise moment correlation. This sensitivity to the wake model indicates that CFD is needed. Three high-speed experimental cases, one uncontrolled free flap case and two commanded flap cases, are considered. The two commanded flap cases include a 2 o flap deflection at 5 P case and a 0 o flap deflection case. For the free flap case, selected modifications to the HH- 06 section flap airfoil pitching moment table are implemented. For the commanded 2 o flap case, the experimental flap variation is approximately matched by increasing the analytical <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> stiffness. This increased <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> stiffness is retained for the commanded 0 o flap case also, which is treated as a free flap case, but with larger <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> stiffness. The change in the mid-span and outboard loads correlation due to the updating of the flexbeam properties is not significant. Increasing the number of blade modes results in an effective, commanded <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> stiffness of 4 X baseline, not 3 X as reported earlier. The inboard loads correlation is reasonable, but needs further study. Overall, the free flap case correlation is reasonable, thus confirming the basic correctness of the current semi-empirical modifications; the correlation for the commanded 2 o flap at 5 P case and the 0 o flap case is also reasonable...|$|R
