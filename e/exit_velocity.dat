According to SportsCenter, with his home run off of Greinke, Bumgarner joined Carlos González and Joey Votto as the third player and the first pitcher to hit multiple home runs off of both Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke. The ball had an <b>exit</b> <b>velocity</b> of 112.5 miles per hour, the hardest hit by a pitcher in the Statcast Era. After throwing five and a third perfect innings to start the ballgame, he hit another home run, surpassing Hal Schumacher to become the franchise career home run leader by a pitcher. His first career multi-home run game made him the first pitcher in Major League history to hit at least two home runs on Opening Day.

2500|$|British {{expectations}} {{had been}} set by performance figures established by the unarmed and unarmored XP-39 prototype. The British production contract stated that a maximum speed of [...] +/- 4% was required at rated altitude. In acceptance testing, actual production aircraft {{were found to be}} capable of only 371mph at 14,090ft. To enable the aircraft to make the guarantee speed, a variety of drag-reduction modifications were developed by Bell. The areas of the elevator and rudder were reduced by 14.2% and 25.2% respectively. Modified fillets were installed in the tail area. The canopy glass was faired to its frame with putty. The gun access doors on the wing had been seen to bulge in flight, so they were replaced with thicker aluminum sheet. Similarly, the landing gear doors deflected open by as much as two inches at maximum speed, so a stronger linkage was installed to hold them flush. The cooling air exit from the oil and coolant radiators was reduced in area to match the <b>exit</b> <b>velocity</b> to the local flow. New engine exhaust stacks, deflected to match the local flow and with nozzles to increase thrust augmentation, were installed. The machine gun ports were faired over, the antenna mast was removed, a single-piece engine cowling was installed and an exhaust stack fairing was added.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe use of oxy-combustion in separated-jet burners opens {{interesting}} {{possibilities in}} pollutant and flame control, and has very important impacts on flame stability. An {{experimental study of}} the combustion characteristics and flame structures has been conducted on a simplified version of a separated-jet burner that includes a central natural gas jet surrounded by two pure-oxygen jets. The flame stability and its structural properties are analyzed by the chemiluminescence of OH. Liftoff positions, flame front, flame length, and the concentrations of CO 2, CO, O 2 and NOx have been measured. The effects of jet <b>exit</b> <b>velocities,</b> jet diameters and separation distance between jets on flame characteristics have been examined. The results quantify the increase of central jet velocity and {{the distance between the}} jets makes possible to control and reduce appreciably the NOx emission. The liftoff height and the flame length depend strongly on the spacing between the jets and the jet <b>exit</b> <b>velocities.</b> The flame front spreads noticeably with the distance between the jets; however, the effect of jet <b>exit</b> <b>velocities</b> is lower, especially if the distance between the jets is high...|$|R
2500|$|At the Clark physics lab, Goddard {{conducted}} {{static tests}} of powder rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency. He found his earlier estimates to be verified; powder rockets were converting only about 2 {{percent of their}} fuel into thrust. At this point he applied de Laval nozzles, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the internal efficiency of the engine: {{the ratio of the}} kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.) By mid-summer of 1915, Goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle <b>exit</b> <b>velocity</b> of [...] Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion nozzles, Goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet (2134 meters) per second. Few would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space. This engine, and subsequent experiments sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, were the beginning of modern rocketry and, ultimately, space exploration. Goddard realized, however, that it would take the more efficient liquid propellants to reach space.|$|E

25|$|Forced draught — A {{mechanical}} draft tower with {{a blower}} type fan at the intake. The fan forces {{air into the}} tower, creating high entering and low <b>exiting</b> air <b>velocities.</b> The low <b>exiting</b> <b>velocity</b> is much more susceptible to recirculation. With the fan on the air intake, the fan is more susceptible to complications due to freezing conditions. Another disadvantage is that a forced draft design typically requires more motor horsepower than an equivalent induced draft design. The benefit of the forced draft design {{is its ability to}} work with high static pressure. Such setups can be installed in more-confined spaces and even in some indoor situations.

40|$|Efficiency {{improvement}} {{is one of}} the most important aspects of engineering and especially important in the field of energy production. In the past decades, energy was mostly produced by fossil based technologies involving turbomachines, and the efficiency of these machines nearly quadrupled since the introduction of the first economically viable gas turbines. The progress continues, as there are still areas where improvement can be made. Such area is the High Pressure Turbine stage (HPT), which influences the flow characteristics and losses downstream, which this thesis will examine in more detail. In the open literature it can be found that one of the areas with potential for progress is the external cooling of the nozzle guide vanes (NGV) of the HPT stage. However not many studies go towards supersonic <b>exit</b> <b>velocities</b> even though that is the most common trend followed by the industry these days. The external cooling allows the turbine entry temperature (TET) to go beyond the melting point of the blade material thus increase Carnot efficiency but in the meantime influences the flow characteristics and losses. To understand these influences of the cooling, experiments in an annular sector cascade (ASC) were conducted with <b>exit</b> <b>velocities</b> from Mach 0. 95 to 1. 2 without and with cooling applied. The findings of the experiments are believed to help the more detailed understanding of the flow behaviour at high <b>exit</b> <b>velocities.</b> When comparing the corresponding runs in the two cases it became obvious that with cooling applied the deviation of the exit flow angle is generally smaller than in the uncooled case. This might be a highly important design feature for designers to work with. From the available data it was concluded that the total pressure distribution across the span is not significantly affected with the introduction of cooling...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} flowfield and acoustic behavior of an innovative quadruple synthetic jet device operated in different configurations. The device consists of four resonant cavities, each driven separately by a loudspeaker {{in such a way}} that it is possible to implement any configuration in terms of the frequency, amplitude, and initial phase angle of the <b>exit</b> <b>velocities</b> of the four embedded jets. Here, the main goal is to investigate the effect of varying the phase delay between the ejection strokes of the single synthetic jets.

Second, four different configurations are investigated at fixed values of the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers of each synthetic jet, equal to 4000 and 0. 2, respectively. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements highlight the central role of the near-field large-scale coherent vortex structures in determining the flow behavior. Far-field noise measurements show that, by introducing a phase shift between the jet <b>exit</b> <b>velocities,</b> a significant noise reduction can be obtained (up to 23. 9 % for the examined configurations) ...|$|R
