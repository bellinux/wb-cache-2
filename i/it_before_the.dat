5|$|A Kentucky {{governor}} is elected under our constitution {{for four years}} without legal opportunity, regardless of how acceptable his program has been, to put <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> public for approval or rejection. In practical application he must successfully run the legislative gauntlet during the first hurried ninety days he is in office {{if he is to}} adopt a program and have an administration worthy of history's harsh pen. The remaining general assembly two years hence is invariably plagued with vicissitudes common to 'lame duck' tenures.|$|E

5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders). Although there is little evidence of <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 3rd century, the consensus is that auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E

5|$|The sole {{content of}} Article III is the {{statement}} regarding separation of powers. The three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative) are created and defined.

5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had been treated wrongly and insisted in bringing <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E

5|$|After this {{there was}} a lull in {{fighting}} in the Zadar area {{until the end of}} the month, with only sporadic small-arms fire and minor skirmishes. During that period, the JNA's efforts were concentrated on the Battle of Šibenik and an advance towards Sinj. Although the ZNG defended Šibenik and Sinj it lost Drniš, abandoning <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> JNA's arrival on 23 September. During the last week of September the JNA returned its focus to Zadar, stepping up its artillery bombardment of the city and ending its naval blockade on 23 September. On 29 September the JNA edged towards Zadar, capturing the villages of Bulić, Lišane Ostrovičke and Vukšić and announcing its intention to evacuate its Zadar barracks (which was affected by desertions).|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Pacific War the {{strategic}} port town of Rabaul in New Britain was defended by 'Lark Force', which comprised the 2/22nd Infantry Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron. While Lark Force was regarded as inadequate by the Australian military, {{it was not possible to}} reinforce <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Japanese South Seas Force landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942. The outnumbered Australian force was swiftly defeated and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle. Few members of Lark Force survived the war, as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1,057Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul were killed when the ship carrying them to Japan (Montevideo Maru) was sunk by a US submarine on 1 July 1942.|$|E
5|$|Kaiserin {{was present}} during the fleet {{operation}} {{that resulted in}} the battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916; her commander at the time was Kapitän zur See (KzS) Karl Sievers. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, Kaiserin was the second ship in the VI Division of III Squadron and the seventh ship in the line, directly astern of Kaiser and ahead of Prinzregent Luitpold. The VI Division was behind only the V Division, consisting of the four s. The eight battleships of the - and es assigned to the I and II Divisions in I Squadron followed the VI Division. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the III and IV Divisions, II Battle Squadron, formed the rear of the formation.|$|E

5|$|La Galissonnière was lead ship of a {{class of}} wooden-hulled, armored corvettes built for the French Navy during the 1870s. She was named after the victor of the Battle of Minorca in 1756, Marquis de la Galissonnière. She bombarded Sfax in 1881 {{as part of the}} French {{occupation}} of Tunisia and was present in Alexandria shortly before the British bombarded <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. The ship participated in a number of battles during the Sino-French War of 1884–85. La Galissonnière was condemned in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Newly united {{as a team}} in ROH, the Briscoes began, in 2003, to {{feud with}} A.J. Styles and Amazing Red, then holders of the ROH Tag Team Championship, losing in title matches at Night of Champions, The Epic Encounter, and Death Before Dishonor, which by {{stipulation}} was their last match for the title {{for as long as}} Styles and Red held <b>it.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> last match, a poll was held on ROH's website, asking the fans if they wanted to see a third match between the two teams. Over 80% of respondents voted 'yes'. At Beating the Odds, they returned from a brief absence to score a pair of wins which were depicted in the storyline as being improbable, Mark over ROH veteran B.J. Whitmer and Jay in a Four Corner Survival match with ROH World Champion Samoa Joe, NWA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles, and Chris Sabin, pinning Sabin to earn a future title shot at Joe. At ROH's Maryland debut, Tradition Continues, Joe retained over Jay.|$|E

During the operation, Oldenburg was the fourth ship in the I Division of I Squadron and the twelfth ship in the line, directly astern of her sister ship Helgoland and ahead of Posen.

Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines then {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the Persian fort of Onoguris, but they were forced to abandon it at the unexpectedly quick arrival of Persian relief forces under Nachoragan. In spring 556, Justin was {{with the rest of the}} Byzantine forces at Nesos, when Nakhoragan invaded western Lazica, making for the town of Phasis. The Byzantines hastily departed for the town, managing to reach <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Persian army and then proceeded to successfully defend it during a prolonged siege. Following this success, in early 556 Justin returned to Nesos to guard it together with Buzes, while the rest of the army marched against the Misimians, a tribe that had recently allied itself with the Persians and killed the Byzantine general Soterichus. Justin's only activity during this time was to dispatch one of his officers, Elminzur, to capture Rhodopolis (modern Vartsikhe) with 2,000 cavalry. In the next year, a general truce was agreed, which was finalized into a peace treaty in 562.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Bartolomé Mitre {{stated that}} Manuel Belgrano held a deep admiration for George Washington, {{leader of the}} American Revolution and first President of the United States. Because of this, he worked on a translation of George Washington's Farewell Address into the Spanish language. He started working on it during the Paraguay Campaign, but before the battle of Tacuarí he destroyed all his papers, including the unfinished translation, {{to prevent them from}} falling into enemy hands. Belgrano resumed work on it afterwards and finished <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Salta. He sent it to Buenos Aires for publication. George Washington's Farewell Address is considered, along with Gettysburg Address, {{one of the most important}} texts in the history of the United States. It talks about the importance of keeping national unity as the key to maintain independence, prosperity, and freedom—ideas that were shared by Belgrano regarding the population of Hispanic America.|$|E

5|$|The magician John Nevil Maskelyne {{also criticized}} {{the design of}} the {{experiment}} for taking place under a table. The psychologist Millais Culpin wrote the experiment was not scientific and questioned why the experiment was done under the table instead of in a more convenient position on top of <b>it.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> accordion experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the accordion feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's accordion played only two pieces, Home Sweet Home and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E
5|$|The player must explore solar systems, gather clues, {{and find}} special {{artifacts}} that grant {{access to the}} Crystal Planet, ultimately destroying <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> player's home system flares. Commander McConnell's last journal entry {{can be found on}} the surface of the Crystal Planet; in it, he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living, sentient beings who are being burned up as fuel for interstellar travel. Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup, they are not even aware of outside life and have come to view other races as a virus. The game is won after the player successfully plants an artifact on the Crystal Planet's surface and retreats back into space, causing the planet to explode, though the game can still be played after the Crystal Planet is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Zappa {{attempted}} {{to earn a}} living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with {{a new version of the}} Blackouts. Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films The World's Greatest Sinner (1962) and Run Home Slow (1965) were more financially rewarding. The former score was commissioned by actor-producer Timothy Carey and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records. The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may have worked on <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> film was shot. Excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album The Lost Episodes (1996).|$|E
