5|$|Vesta's {{surface is}} covered by {{regolith}} distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently.

Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components. The dark component is {{probably due to the}} infall of carbonaceous material, whereas the bright component <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Vesta basaltic soil.|$|E
