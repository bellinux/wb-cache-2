5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, the US Department of Treasury {{called for}} all {{drinking}} water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for water purification (such as in water treatment plants), in disinfectants, and in bleach.

5|$|During the {{development}} of the C9, the management of the bankruptcy-threatened Chrysler Corporation decided to divest itself of its debt-ridden European operations. The buyer was the French PSA Group, formed in 1976 after Peugeot took over Citroën. The deal was finalised in 1978, in which the buyer paid US$1.00 for the entirety of Chrysler Europe and its obligations. The take-over was <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> of 1 January 1979.|$|E
5|$|Galleys were <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> troop {{transports}} for amphibious operations, {{but were}} severely under-gunned, especially {{in relation to}} their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically carry only one 24-pounder cannon and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. The galleys also lacked decks and adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of exposure during the war of 1741–43.|$|E
5|$|Given with {{chloroquine}} or quinine, clindamycin {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E

5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|In the {{treatment}} of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.|$|E

Nowotny was {{transferred}} again, this time to the 9th Staffel of JG 54 (9./JG 54), the so-called Teufelsstaffel (Devils' Squadron) where he was further trained by veterans from the front line (23February1941 – 25March1941). From 25March1941 to 10March1942, Notwotny flew with the Stabsstaffel of the Ergänzungs-Jagdgruppe JG 54where he was promoted to Leutnant on 1April1941, <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> of 1February1941.|$|E

5|$|Nowotny was {{promoted}} to Hauptmann on 21September1943, <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> of 1October, following his 225th victory.

Nowotny was celebrating this feat in the Ria Bar in Vilna when he {{received a phone call from}} Hitler himself, announcing that he had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds, making him the eighth of 27 men to be so honored.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May, Johnson {{experienced}} an unusual mission. His section engaged a Dornier Do 217 carrying British markings, four {{miles west of}} his base. Johnson allowed the three inexperienced pilots to attack it, but they only managed to damage the bomber. Days later, on 26 June 1942, Johnson was awarded the Bar to his DFC. More welcome news was received late in the month as the first Spitfire Mk. IXs began reaching RAF units. On 10 July 1942, Johnson was promoted {{to the rank of}} squadron leader, <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> of the 13 July, and given command of 610 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, {{but these are}} not as <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial cell wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by big game hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence. The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage.
