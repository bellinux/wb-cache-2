500|$|In 2007, Chuck Lorre, {{the creator}} of Two and a Half Men, {{contacted}} Carol Mendelsohn, the show runner of , about a crossover. The first reactions to this were that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> idea. CSI writer and executive producer Naren Shankar commented that when Mendelsohn first {{told him about the}} idea he replied: [...] "What a nut". However, that same year, the idea resurfaced, when Lorre and Mendelsohn met at the World Television Festival in Banff. Upon hearing this, the cast of both shows were surprised and not interested, but they eventually jumped aboard. In an interview with The New York Post, before the idea was fully worked out, Mendelsohn described the possible crossover as [...] "a great challenge".|$|E
500|$|In September 1999, Buffon faced heavy {{criticism}} and severe disciplinary sanctions for bearing the fascist slogan [...] "Boia chi molla" [...] ("who gives up is a scoundrel") handwritten on a T-shirt under his goalkeeping jersey, which {{he proceeded to}} wear and show during media interviews after a match. Buffon publicly apologised, stating that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> and naïve gesture, because he was completely ignorant of the slogan's neo-fascist connotations, stating that he had first encountered the slogan written on a boarding school desk, and was unaware of its far right-wing association and, in particular, its use with the neo-fascists in Reggio Calabria during the Reggio revolt in the early 1970s. He declared that he merely intended to use the slogan to spur on his teammates and the fans, as Parma had previously encountered some disappointing results.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, {{he married}} his fourth wife, Lori Horowitz. He was 41 {{and she was}} 19. He said of the {{marriage}}, [...] "I was desperately in love with her, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> marriage on my part." [...] They were divorced after eight months.|$|E

6000|$|... "So are you, Hallett. You {{are just}} as keen about getting your company into order as I am, only you always try to look bored over <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> plan, old man, for I don't think that you get the kudos that you deserve." ...|$|R
2500|$|Interference, Inc., hired {{two people}} to {{distribute}} twenty devices throughout Philadelphia on January 11. One of these was Ryan, a 24-year-old from Fishtown, who claimed that he was promised $300 for installing the devices, only 18 of which were actually functional. Following the scare in Boston, the Philadelphia Police Department recovered three of the 18 devices. Joe Grace, spokesman for Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street, was quoted as saying, [...] "We think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid,</b> regrettable, irresponsible stunt by Turner. We do not take kindly to it." [...] A cease-and-desist letter was sent to Turner, threatening fines for violating zoning codes.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 June 2009 ex-communities {{secretary}} Hazel Blears, {{who chose}} to resign from the government just before the English county council and European elections, said that she regretted the timing of her decision. She also stated that her decision to wear a brooch with the words 'rocking the boat' {{on the same day}} as the resignation was a [...] "stupid thing to do". Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch my husband had given me. I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> thing to do but I think it was just trying to put a brave face on—not going out cowed on the basis of expenses claims that genuinely are not true." ...|$|E

I'm not sure. The only {{pleasure}} I get in life is in creating pretty things out of gold." ...|$|R
50|$|The story {{starts with}} Roddy's narration, {{explaining}} {{a little about}} her past, and Grundo's as well. It then proceeds {{to a point where}} her mother tries to do her usual attempt to talk Roddy into staying with her grandfather Hyde. Roddy refuses, as she does not want to leave Grundo alone with his mother and sister. She points out to her mother that her grandfather Hyde grows dahlias, saying that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> thing for <b>a</b> powerful magician to do. Her mother stoutly insisted that Roddy must stay with her grandfather, until Roddy mentioned her mother's father, Gwyn, after which Roddy's mother went away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take a seat," [...] said Wildeve, placing {{chairs for}} the two women. [...] "Well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very <b>stupid</b> mistake, but such {{mistakes}} will happen.

6000|$|... "But {{as far as}} I could hear," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Palliser, [...] "Lord George Carruthers cannot {{possibly have}} {{had anything to do}} with it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> mistake on the part of the police." ...|$|E

60|$|He was {{no longer}} {{thinking}} of the Germans as diabolical. They were human; they had a case. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> case, but our case, too, was a stupid case. How stupid were all our cases! What was it we missed? Something, he felt, very close to us, and very elusive. Something that would resolve a hundred tangled oppositions....|$|E

60|$|As I slowly {{recalled}} my collegiate {{studies and}} paleontological readings in Bowen's textbooks, I realized that I had looked upon {{nothing less than}} a diplodocus of the Upper Jurassic; but how infinitely different was the true, live thing from the crude restorations of Hatcher and Holland! I had had the idea that the diplodocus <b>was</b> <b>a</b> land-animal, but evidently <b>it</b> <b>is</b> partially amphibious. I have seen several since my first encounter, and in each case the creature took to the sea for concealment as soon as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> disturbed. With the exception of its gigantic tail, it has no weapon of defense; but with this appendage it can lash so terrific a blow as to lay low even a giant cave-bear, stunned and broken. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid,</b> simple, gentle beast--one of the few within Caspak which such a description might even remotely fit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those two men--they {{looked like}} sous-officiers--must {{have come in}} it, after being too late, I suppose, for the galley.

I could not believe my eyes in the very moment I was stepping into that boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} bishop, when Mr. Archibald had {{finished}} {{what he had}} to say, [...] "there is nothing to thank me for. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> thing to launch a young girl out upon what, by some very natural bit of carelessness, might have become to her the waters of eternity, and it was my very commonplace duty {{to get her out of}} the danger into which I had placed her; so this, my dear sir, is really all there is to say about the matter." ...|$|E
60|$|Without {{giving a}} thought {{to what might}} be the {{feelings}} of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter at once considered how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use; and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like all slaves to a fixed idea, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> beast.|$|E
50|$|Hamdi, the eager-to-please local imam, {{brings the}} young İlyas to Aydın {{in an attempt}} to make amends for the glass-breaking incident. However, this only serves to annoy Aydin, inspiring him to write a column on how an imam should really give a proper example to their community. At first, his sister Necla wonders why Aydın does not use his writing talent in a better place than the local newspaper. Later, she reverses her view and tells him that he is just superficially and sentimentally criticising other people from his {{comfortable}} armchair. This results in a long chain of snide remarks made back and forth at each other. This reversal occurs after Necla mentions to Aydın's wife Nihal that Necla might be better off going back to her ex-husband, after which Nihal tells Necla that she is free to leave even though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> idea.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{begins with}} Cartman betting Kyle five dollars {{that when people}} die they [...] "crap their pants". Kyle says <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> idea. In the meantime, a Wall-Mart opens in South Park (where Stark's Pond used to be) with much fanfare and {{everyone}} in town starts shopping there. Cartman is especially delighted that one can buy three copies of Timecop for $18 instead of just one for $9.98, though Kyle wonders why one would need three copies of the same movie. The popularity of Wall-Mart forces the local businesses to shut down, including Jim's Drugs, within minutes of Kyle's declaration that he will now take all his personal shopping there. Local residents, including Stan's father Randy, soon start to work at Wall-Mart for minimum wage and an extra 10% employee discount on store purchases which according to Randy, evens out the wage.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very <b>stupid</b> {{person who}} could not take such a hint as that, and so, after {{a walk around the}} garden, Euphemia took {{occasion}} to go below to look at the kitchen fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{everything}} seemed against me. My horse was shot, and, {{just at the}} time, I had been having a bad run at the tables and had lost my last stiver. I was in hiding for a fortnight {{at one of the}} cribs; for they had got a description of me from an old gentleman, who, with his wife and daughter, I had eased of their money and watches. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> business. I dropped a valuable diamond ring on the ground, and in groping about for it my mask came off, and, like a fool, I stood up in the full light of the carriage lamp. So I thought it better, for all reasons, to get away for a month or so, until things quieted down. I wanted to visit my banker, and it was a good many miles to tramp." ...|$|E
60|$|LARRY [coming down on Mat promptly]. I'll tell you, Mat. I {{always thought}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid,</b> lazy, good-for-nothing {{sort of thing}} to leave the land {{in the hands of}} the old landlords without calling them to a strict account for the use they made of it, and the {{condition}} of the people on it. I could see for myself that they thought of nothing but what they could get out of it to spend in England; and that they mortgaged and mortgaged until hardly one of them owned his own property or could have afforded to keep it up decently if he'd wanted to. But I tell you plump and plain, Mat, that if anybody thinks things will be any better now that the land is handed over to a lot of little men like you, without calling you to account either, they're mistaken.|$|E
60|$|She {{began her}} {{business}} in a deep sweet voice. Those who know the play of the 'Stranger,' are aware that the remarks made by the various characters are not valuable in themselves, either for their sound sense, their novelty of observation, or their poetic fancy. In fact, if a man were to say <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> play, {{he would not be}} far wrong. Nobody ever talked so. If we meet idiots in life, as will happen, it is a great mercy that they do not use such absurdly fine words. The Stranger's talk is sham, like the book he reads and the hair he wears, and the bank he sits on, and the diamond ring he makes play with--but, {{in the midst of the}} balderdash, there runs that reality of love, children, and forgiveness of wrong, which will be listened to wherever it is preached, and sets all the world sympathising.|$|E
6000|$|The {{infantile}} meal had {{not been}} long concluded, when servants announced [...] "the Marquis of Farintosh;" [...] and that nobleman made his appearance to pay his respects to Miss Newcome and Lady Anne. He brought the very last news of the very last party in London, where [...] "Really, upon my honour, now, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> party, because Miss Newcome wasn't there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> now, really." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t care a rap for family,” he said, “but at {{the same}} time I suppose every man would like his daughter—” Here he stopped abruptly. “I mean to say,” he said, “would like to have for his {{son-in-law}} a man of good family. I grant that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very <b>stupid</b> prejudice, still I suppose <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> general one.

6000|$|Never mind, Dolly; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> house. Next time, perhaps, {{you will}} play a better part; {{and then they will}} cheer, instead of hissing you. You were wasted, I am {{inclined}} to think, on modern comedy. You should have been cast for the heroine of some old-world tragedy. The strength of character, the courage, the power of self-forgetfulness, the enthusiasm were yours: it was the part that was lacking. You might have worn the mantle of a Judith, a Boadicea, or a Jeanne d'Arc, had such plays been popular in your time. Perhaps they, had they played in your day, might have had to be content with such a part as yours. They could not have played the meek heroine, and what else would there have been for them in modern drama? Catherine of Russia! had she been a waiter's daughter {{in the days of the}} Second Empire, should we have called her Great? The Magdalene! had her lodging in those days been in some bye-street of Rome instead of in Jerusalem, should we mention her name in our churches? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{girl was}} kind and sympathetic," [...] he went on, [...] "but I {{was not so}} great a fool as not {{to know that she}} was a flirt and {{accustomed}} to attention. I suppose it was in my desperation that I told my brother, thinking he would tell you, as he did. He would not tell me what you said to him, except that you seemed to be indignant at the thought that I was only flirting with Frida. Then I resolved to speak with you myself--and I did. I know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid,</b> clumsy contrivance. It never seemed so stupid before I spoke to you. It never seemed so wicked as when you promised to help me, and your eyes shone on {{me for the first time}} with kindness. And it never seemed so hopeless as when I found you touched with my love for another. You wonder why I kept up this deceit until you promised. Well, I had prepared the bitter cup myself--I thought I ought to drink it to the dregs." ...|$|E
60|$|By this {{it may be}} {{perceived}} that Kate and Ernest had become tolerably intimate friends. They had informed each other of what games were their favourites; Kate had told him the Wardour names and ages; and required from him in return those of his brothers and sisters. She had been greatly delighted by learning that Adelaide was no end of a hand at climbing trees; and that whenever she should come and stay at their house, Ernest would teach her to ride. And then they began to consider what play was possible under the present circumstances-- beginning they hardly knew how, by dodging one another round and round the table, making snatches at one another, gradually assuming the characters of hunter and Red Indian. Only when the hunter had snatched up Aunt Jane's tortoise-shell paper-cutter to stab with, complaining direfully that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> place, with nothing for a gun, and the Red Indian's crinoline had knocked down two chairs, she recollected the consequences in time to strangle her own war-whoop, and suggested {{that they should be}} safer on the stairs; to which Ernest readily responded, adding that there was a great gallery at home all full of pillars and statues, the jolliest place in the world for making a row.|$|E
