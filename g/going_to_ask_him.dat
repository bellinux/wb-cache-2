I am going to treat this matter as an {{academic}} discussion, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> then what {{the result would be}} of such a step as you propose." ...|$|E

60|$|George Hatchard was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>'im</b> {{more about}} it, {{but just then}} Mrs. Pearce {{came in with a}} pair of Alf's socks that he 'ad been untidy enough to leave {{in the middle of the}} floor instead of {{chucking}} 'em under the bed. She was so unpleasant about it that, if it hadn't ha' been for the thought of wot was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> 'appen on Tuesday, Alf couldn't ha' stood it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know enough," [...] {{replied the}} Scarecrow cheerfully. [...] "My head is stuffed with straw, you know, {{and that is}} why I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Oz <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> for some brains." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{said nothing}} to him, only just smiled. And the look of {{knowledge}} in her eyes seemed, for the moment, to be contained in another look: a look of faith, and at last happiness. Aaron's heart stood still. No, in her moment's mood of faith and at last peace, life-trust, he was perhaps more terrified of her than in her previous sinister elegance. His spirit started and shrank. What was she <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of <b>him?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Charlie wouldn't {{come in to}} lunch, father," [...] Letitia announced. [...] "I {{think he}} was afraid you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> his intentions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about it, anyway," [...] {{answered}} the Yankee youth. [...] "See, {{he is looking}} at us, and it 'pears to me as if he was enjoying himself to see me in trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Tredgold hesitated. [...] "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{to give me}} a cup of tea," [...] he said, with a shiver. [...] "I’m half frozen, and I’m {{afraid that}} I have a taken a chill." ...|$|E
5000|$|House agrees he {{will stop}} seeing his hooker/masseuse. Cuddy invites him over. Chase finds Kelly packing up her stuff to quit. She is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave, but <b>asks</b> <b>him</b> out. House, Cuddy and her {{daughter}} have dinner together. [...] "Aren't you adorable," [...] he says to her when Cuddy leaves the room.|$|R
6000|$|Heaven knows. I've been racking my brains. I {{can think}} of nothing. I'd {{arranged}} everything so beautifully. And now I'm helpless. I thought even of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Ronny and <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> refuse any job that will keep him here. But Arthur looks upon it as so important. He'll insist on Ronny's accepting unless his reasons for going are--what's the word I want? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write and <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come back?" [...] said Violet wildly. [...] "I've enough pride left yet {{to keep me}} from doing that for a man at whose head I've thrown myself openly--yes, openly, and who has never, in words at least, told me he cared {{anything}} about me. I will never forgive you, Edith!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was your}} sister's master--her friend. A {{few days ago}} I saw him leave your house. He was like a man beside himself. He began to tell me something--and stopped. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to finish it." ...|$|E
60|$|And yet? And yet he {{was going}} to seek out Nevitt; going to stand face to face with that smiling villain again; going to tax him with his crime; <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> what he meant by this double-dyed treachery.|$|E
6000|$|Dear me, I thought, {{is it as}} bad as all that? Is Blaize, {{in despair}} of ever rescuing the unfortunate prisoner, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{to draw up a}} 'last dying words' document, to be pushed under the door and {{despatched}} to his sorrowing guardian? ...|$|E
5000|$|Time passes {{but in the}} end Laali after <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Loha's Mansion <b>asks</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{tell him}} the truth about her past if he knew it but he says that he knows nothing, but then she pushes him into telling her and he agrees and suggest to re-act what {{happened}} in order to make her remember and he does that ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{there in}} the water was the little fish {{swimming}} about, while an army of beavers began to pile up earth and stones in a high bank to keep the river back. How they worked, digging and heaping with teeth and claws, and beating the earth hard with their queer tails like shovels! Rosy and the men watched them work, glad to be safe, while the storm cleared up; {{and by the time}} the dam was made, all danger was over. Rosy looked into the faces of the rough men, hoping her father was there, and was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> about <b>him,</b> when a great shouting rose again, and all began to run to the pit hole, saying,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Winter had begun, and {{although}} the briars shone red along the hedgerows and the stunted oaks had not lost all their leaves, bitter sleet blew across the dale when Grace went up the muddy lonning to Mireside farm. Railton's daughter had for a time helped the housekeeper at Tarnside, and Grace, hearing that the farmer had been ill, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> about <b>him.</b> It was nearly dark when she entered the big kitchen. The lamp had not been lighted, but a peat fire burned in the wide grate, where irons for cooking pots hung above the blaze. A bright glow leaped up and spread about the kitchen, touching {{the people in the}} room, and then faded as she shut the massive door.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it hasn't," [...] said Kate, {{with some}} warmth. [...] "It's turned out first-rate. I think that {{interest}} idea is all stuff. As {{if we wanted}} to set up Aunt Matilda with an income that would last forever! Here comes father. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about the gun." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady de la Poer, {{thinking}} this a hard {{trial of the}} poor child's temper, was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> not to tease her; but Kate was really candid and good tempered, and she said, [...] "I was wrong to say that! It was Mary that had presence of mind, and I had not." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{this was}} his usual hour for having a little {{confidential}} chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing through the open window, down into the street.|$|E
5000|$|Chase {{describes}} {{a dispute over}} the ownership of the stone::In the fall of 1826, a friend called upon me and wished to see that stone .... On <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Smith's, and <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> for the stone, he said, [...] "you cannot have it;" [...] I told him it belonged to me, repeated to him the promise he made me, {{at the time of}} obtaining the stone: upon which he faced me with a malignant look and said, [...] "I don't care who in the Devil it belongs to, you shall not have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Relieved by this revelation, it {{was easy}} work for Mrs. Horncastle to launch out into a playful, tantalizing, witty--but, I grieve to say, entirely imaginative--account of her escapade with Mrs. Barker. How, left alone at the San Francisco hotel while their gentlemen friends were enjoying {{themselves}} at Hymettus, they resolved upon a little trip, partly {{for the purpose of}} looking into some small investments of their own, and partly for the fun of the thing. What funny experiences they had! How, in particular, one horrid inquisitive, vulgar wretch had been boring a European fellow passenger who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Hymettus, finally <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> where he had come from last, and when he answered [...] "Hymettus," [...] thought the man was insulting him-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My name's Osborne," [...] said Georgy, and was {{fingering}} in his {{own pockets}} for dollars, and just {{about to make a}} trial, when the Major, in his uniform, and Jos, en Marquis, from the Court ball, made their appearance. Other people, finding the entertainment stupid and preferring the fun at the Stadthaus, had quitted the Palace ball earlier; but it is probable the Major and Jos had gone home and found the boy's absence, for the former instantly went up to him and, taking him by the shoulder, pulled him briskly back from the place of temptation. Then, looking round the room, he saw Kirsch employed as we have said, and <b>going</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>asked</b> how he dared to bring Mr. George to such a place.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think we'll go West next," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "Father {{wants to}} look up his mining interests, you know. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to take us along." [...] They did go west, and what adventures they had will be related in a new volume, entitled [...] "The Rover Boys Out West; or, The Search for a Lost Mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shucks, he needn't worry a morsel over that. Seth'll {{quiet down}} {{as soon as}} he finds he can't run the Master. He's a rare good teacher--better'n Mr. West was even, and that's saying something. The {{trustees}} are hoping he'll stay for another term. They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> at the school meeting to-morrow, and offer him a raise of supplement." ...|$|E
60|$|Soames {{watched his}} {{daughter}} give her hand, saw her wince at the squeeze it received, and distinctly heard the young man's sigh {{as he passed}} out. Then she came from the window, trailing her finger along the mahogany edge of the billiard-table. Watching her, Soames {{knew that she was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> something. Her finger felt round the last pocket, and she looked up.|$|E
5000|$|Maertens {{alleges that}} a {{laxative}} {{was put in}} his drink during the world championship in Montreal in 1974. He was handed it {{while he was in}} the lead with Bernard Thévenet and Constantino Conti. He said his masseur, Jef D’Hont, had told Gust Naessens - Merckx’s soigneur - that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> eat and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hand a bottle to his rider. Maertens took the bottle because he trusted Naessens, with whom he worked from 1981 to 1983. Maertens said: “I got confirmation of that from Gust Naessens. I <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> 'What did you do in Montreal?'" [...] He said Naessens replied: “It was normal, Freddy. I was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> give you your drink and I put something in it. You were too good for my guy, so I put something in it to block you.” Merckx won.|$|R
60|$|One day, however, when Harry {{came down}} early with the {{intention}} of taking us up the river, Charley happened to come down in the same carriage with him, and Harry told him what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take an oar. After great difficulty, and only under the promise that he should pull bow, so as to be as far {{out of the way of}} conversation as possible, Charley consented to come. Harry came home to fetch us, while his friend went round to the club-room to dress, and met us at the boat-house. When he saw us coming I do believe that if he could by any possibility have got away he would have done so; but there was no escape. Harry introduced him to us, he murmured something vague, and then went off to help to get the boat down.|$|R
50|$|Despite Miccinio's instructions, the companions don't {{trust each}} other, and have trouble {{sleeping}} because of this. They don't get along very well either, but still, their {{journey to the}} city is mostly uneventful. Right outside the city perimeter, however, they encounter a masked man - Alexandro's brother. He gives Domenico a bag of gold with 1000 drahcans and tells them both to turn around immediately and head back to Camoora without entering the City of Beauty. Domenico and Ciccio do as they are told. Their mutual distrust is now sharply increased due {{to the presence of}} a bag full of gold, and on their way back, neither of them has slept for days, fearing the other one might murder him. Exhausted and almost out of food, they have to hide when they hear a cart approaching behind them. The cart is controlled by Santos, who still has revenge on his mind. He is carrying food and a log called Masimo, which he did not leave back at Calabria, but decided to take it with him and keep choking it at night. Santos is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Canudos to aid them in their fight against the Camoorians. Ciccio suggests that they befriend Santos, sweet-talk their way onto his cart and then kill him in his sleep. However, this is the last straw for Domenico, who has had enough of Camoorians and their amoral ways. Ignoring Miccinio's commands, he beats Ciccio up with his fists. After that, he appears to Santos on the road, covered in blood, asking Santos where he is going, and after finding out Santos is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Canudos, <b>asks</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take him with. Santos is suspicious of Domenico at first because of all the blood, but Domenico explains that the blood on him is that of a Camoorian thug. Santos lets Domenico come with him. Domenico almost immediately falls asleep on Santos's cart, but not before giving Santos his bag of gold telling him to distribute it around in Canudos, as it will prove useful fighting Camoorians.|$|R
6000|$|He snuffed the candle, and {{backing away}} {{a little to}} see how it looked, backed out of the room--unexpectedly to me, for I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> by whom he had been sent. The door of the {{opposite}} parlour being then opened, I heard some voices, familiar in my ears I thought, which stopped. A quick light step approached the room in which I was, and who should stand before me but Richard! ...|$|E
60|$|At first I was alarmed, for an Express lunatic and no {{communication}} with the guard, is a serious position. The thought came to my relief that the gentleman might be what is popularly called a Rapper: one of a sect for (some of) whom I have the highest respect, but whom I don't believe in. I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> the question, {{when he took the}} bread out of my mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I {{only wish}} I could. But it's {{not in the}} power of my gift. You know what my forte is, Gilbert--the fanciful, the fairylike, the pretty. To write Captain Jim's life-book as it should be written one should be a master of {{vigorous}} yet subtle style, a keen psychologist, a born humorist and a born tragedian. A rare combination of gifts is needed. Paul might do it if he were older. Anyhow, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to come down next summer and meet Captain Jim." ...|$|E
6000|$|That the Commissaries are steeped to {{the lips}} in this horrible {{business}} has been amply shown in these paragraphs. But Mr. Sjoblom {{was able to go}} one stage further along the line which leads to the Palace at Brussels. M. Wahis, the Governor-General, a man who has played a sinister part in the country, came up the river and endeavoured to get the outspoken Swede to contradict himself, or, failing that, to intimidate him. To get at the truth or to right the wrong seems to have been the last thing in his mind, for he knew well that the wrong was essential to the system, and that without it the wheels would move more slowly and the head engineer in Europe would soon wish to know what was amiss with his rubber-producing machine. [...] "You may have seen all these things that you have stated," [...] said he, [...] "but nothing is proved." [...] The Commissary meanwhile had been holding a rifle to the head of witnesses so as to make sure that nothing would be proved. In spite of this Mr. Sjoblom managed to collect his evidence, and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Governor, <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> when he could listen to it. [...] "I don't want to hear any witnesses," [...] said he, and then: [...] "If you continue to demand investigation in these matters we will make a charge against you.... That means five years' imprisonment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case, you {{can give}} us no further information. Would you please remain in the room? Stand over there near the bedroom door. Now, Soames, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> have the great {{kindness}} {{to go up to the}} room of young Gilchrist, and <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> step down into yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what I mean by {{posing as}} Miss Prim," [...] she said. [...] "I have {{never said that}} I was Miss Prim. You took the word of an ignorant little farmer's boy and I did not deny it when I found that you {{intended}} bringing me to Mr. Prim, for I wanted to see <b>him.</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> help me. I have never met him, or his daughter either; but my father and Mr. Prim have been friends for many years.|$|R
