The population surveyed consisted of all laboratories listed with HELIX, a national directory of <b>DNA</b> <b>diagnostic</b> labs that includes a fairly comprehensive listing of clinical service labs as well as a large number of research labs. The survey was concerned primarily with the legal and ethical issues that the long-term storage of DNA may raise. The survey inquired into the respondents' policies and procedures concerning (1) the extent of DNA banking and of interest in developing DNA banking in academia and industry and (2) the degree to which DNA banks had developed written internal policies and/or a written depositor's agreement (a signed document defining the rights and obligations of the person from whom the sample was taken and the bank) designed to anticipate or prevent some of the ethical and legal problems that can arise from the long-term retention of DNA.

40|$|A {{restriction}} endonuclease cleavage {{map of the}} genome of AKV, the endogenous, ecotropic leukemia virus of AKR mice, has been derived. By using this map and analyzing DNA from congenic mice, we have defined four <b>DNA</b> fragments <b>diagnostic</b> for AKV proviruses. Analysis of DNAs from 10 strains of American laboratory mice revealed that all strains carrying inducible, ecotropic murine leukemia viruses yielded DNAs which contained the four <b>DNA</b> fragments <b>diagnostic</b> for AKV. Virus-negative strains lacked these fragments in their DNA. Screening DNA from 23 additional mice revealed that, among these mice, only mice from Asia {{gave rise to the}} <b>DNA</b> fragments <b>diagnostic</b> of an AKV provirus. We conclude that all of the endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia proviruses in American laboratory mice are closely related since they share a common set of {{restriction endonuclease}} cleavage sites. These proviruses appear to derive from the East Asian ancestors of these mouse strains. Analysis of DNA from six selected mice with an additional restriction endonuclease showed that greater than 97 % of the nucleotide sequences in each provirus are contigous and that these endogenous proviruses are indistinguishable from proviruses introduced by exogenous infection...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{activity}} {{has often been}} attributed to changes in pollutant profiles found in contaminated soils when abiotic processes actually caused pollutant removal.
