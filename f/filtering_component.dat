50|$|Visual {{selective}} attention requires many underlying cognitive processes, including {{detection of}} important sensory and perceptual information, {{the ability to}} inhibit information that is irrelevant to the task, {{and the ability to}} shift attention from feature or location to another. In this study, it was found that DLB patients in this task performed markedly worse than both AD patients and healthy controls in the single-target condition. This suggests that the perceptual <b>filtering</b> <b>component</b> of selective attention is significantly impaired in DLB. Difficulties in discrimination in DLB patients for visual stimuli may be due to reduced ability to select and encode relevant or important information in the target search. DLB patients’ general slowness could have increased perceptual interference due to masking from distractors, and target selection and processing (in tasks such as the RSVP task) must be performed under time pressure.|$|E

The resultant accelerated algorithm is able to achieve 1. 5 ∼ 5 times speedup, depending on the image statistics and the filtering parameters. The proposed algorithm only marginally degrades {{the accuracy of the}} filtering, and the simplicity and small memory footprint of Yang’s original algorithm are largely maintained.

This paper proposes the median-type filters with {{an impulse}} noise {{detector}} using the decision {{tree and the}} particle swarm optimization, for {{the recovery of the}} corrupted gray-level images by impulse noises. It first utilizes an impulse noise detector to determine whether a pixel is corrupted or not. If yes, the <b>filtering</b> <b>component</b> in this method is triggered to filter it. Otherwise, the pixel is kept unchanged. In this work, the impulse noise detector is an adaptive hybrid detector which is constructed by integrating 10 impulse noise detectors based on the decision tree and the particle swarm optimization. Subsequently, the restoring process in this method respectively utilizes the median filter, the rank ordered mean filter, and the progressive noise-free ordered median filter to restore the corrupted pixel. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves high performance for detecting and restoring impulse noises, and outperforms the existing well-known methods...|$|E

The proposed content-based recommender system is enhanced using the ontological information about tourism domain to represent both the user profile and the recommendable POIs.
