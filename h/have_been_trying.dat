5|$|Celia Solis (Daniella Baltodano), {{one of the}} Solis' daughters, {{comes down}} with chickenpox. Since Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) has never had the illness, she is forced to leave the house. She stays with neighbors Bob (Tuc Watkins) and Lee (Kevin Rahm), where she enjoys partying and {{drinking}} with them so much she tries to prolong her visit.

5|$|End of Ages {{takes place}} in the present day, {{sometime}} after the events of , and begins as the player responds to a letter from Atrus. Atrus is a writer of special volumes called linking books, which serve as portals or links to worlds known as Ages. A linking book to the Age of Myst, the setting of the original game, lies sealed in the ruins of the ancient D'ni civilization. The D'ni had the ability to craft linking books, but their society crumbled from within; Atrus and his family <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to restore the D'ni people and created an Age for the survivors to live on, known as Releeshahn (introduced in Exile). Atrus by this period is an old man, mourning the deaths of his sons Sirrus and Achenar in Revelation, and the death of his wife Catherine in the period after. In his letter, Atrus expresses concern that his daughter, Yeesha, may be lost as well.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging.|$|E

25|$|If both {{partners}} {{are young and}} healthy and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to conceive for one year without success, {{a visit to a}} physician or women's health nurse practitioner (WHNP) could help to highlight potential medical problems earlier rather than later. The doctor or WHNP may also be able to suggest lifestyle changes to increase the chances of conceiving.|$|E
25|$|Nanotechnology {{may also}} help in the {{transfer}} of drugs across the BBB. Recently, researchers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to build liposomes loaded with nanoparticles to gain access through the BBB. More {{research is needed to}} determine which strategies will be most effective and how they can be improved for patients with brain tumors. The potential for using BBB opening to target specific agents to brain tumors has just begun to be explored.|$|E

Cyclophosphamide and prednisone <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>tried.</b> Vitamin C therapy has improved immune function and clotting in some patients.|$|R
25|$|Biologists <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> {{to control}} {{lampreys}} {{in the lake}} since 1985 or earlier. Lampreys are native to the area but have expanded in population {{to such an extent}} that they wounded nearly all lake trout in 2006 and 70–80% of salmon. The use of pesticides against the lamprey has reduced their casualties of other fish to 35% of salmon and 31% of lake trout. The goal was 15% of salmon and 25% of lake trout.|$|E
25|$|The Crossing of the Rhine in 405/6 brought unmanageable {{numbers of}} German and Alan barbarians (perhaps some 30,000 warriors, 100,000 people) into Gaul. They may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> {{to get away}} from the Huns, who about this time {{advanced}} to occupy the Great Hungarian Plain. For the next few years the barbarian tribes who had crossed the Rhine wandered in search of food and employment, while Roman forces fought each other in the name of Honorius and a number of competing claimants to the imperial throne.|$|E

25|$|A three-year-old male white tiger {{succumbed to}} {{injuries}} suffered during {{a fight with}} its potential mate, a nine-year-old royal Bengal tigress, on 7 August 2013. The tigress, also severely injured following the fight. Deep wounds in the brain had resulted in the tiger’s death. The incident came as a blow to officials at the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur, who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to prevent in-breeding among white tigers and strengthen the species gene through cross breeding. Christened by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in September 2010, the deceased white tiger, Sembian, was paired with a nine-year-old royal Bengal tigress, Sathya, a few months ago.|$|E
25|$|Among some {{developing}} and Islamic countries, Mahathir is generally respected, particularly for Malaysia's relatively high economic growth {{as well as}} for his support towards liberal Muslim values. Leaders such as Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, praised him and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to emulate Mahathir's developmental formulae. He {{was one of the greatest}} spokesmen on the issues of developing world and strongly supported the bridging of the North-South divide, as well as exhorting the development of Islamic nations. He was dedicated to various non-NATO blocs such as ASEAN, the G77, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of Islamic Nations, and most recently, the G22 at the latest World Trade Organization talks at Cancún.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} on Mars in the Meridian Bay, Ghost informs the Guardian of its inhabitants. The Cabal <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> {{to break the}} encryption on the Vex Gate with only limited success, but they do control many of the places that the Guardian needs to visit on Mars thanks to their Exclusion Zone, which nobody had ever penetrated. The player's Guardian becomes the first to penetrate the Exclusion Zone and heads to the Garden's Spire, which charges the Gate Lord's eye. They also travel to the Buried City, the birthplace of many technological wonders where they discover an AI {{that used to be}} linked to the Warmind of Mars, but is now controlled by Rasputin. With the Vex now present on Mars, the Guardian finds out what they are doing; they are returning to their home, the Black Garden.|$|E

25|$|Controversy erupted {{before the}} fight when Mosley's trainer, Naazim Richardson, {{observed}} that Margarito had a pasty white substance in his handwraps. One doctor described this material as plaster {{hidden in the}} wrapped hands of Margarito, leading to accusations that he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to cheat. At Richardson's insistence, California State Inspector Dean Lohuis called for Margarito's hands to be rewrapped. According to Judd Burstein, the attorney for Mosley, Margarito had wet pads in the wrapping. Mosley's doctor, Robert Olvera, likened the material {{to the type of}} plaster used to make casts. Burstein said he seized the pad removed from the wrapping and another pad found in Margarito's dressing room. Both were placed in a sealed box that was given to Lohuis for further study. The California Department of Justice laboratory later confirmed the substance to be similar in nature to plaster of Paris.|$|E
25|$|Jesus Christ's wife. Teabing {{argues that}} she was {{pregnant}} during His Crucifixion, and the Priory was formed to protect their descendants. The Opus Dei <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to destroy the Grail to preserve the credibility of the Vatican. Silas breaks into Teabing's house, but Teabing knocks him out with one of his prescription crutches. The group escapes to London via Teabing's private plane, along with his butler, Remy Jean. They travel to the Temple Church, but the clue to unlocking the cryptex is a red herring. Silas is freed by Remy while claiming to be the Teacher and taking Teabing hostage, dumping him in his car's trunk while Silas hides out in an Opus Dei safe house. Teabing poisons Remy and sends the police after Silas, who is shot by police after accidentally wounding Aringarosa, who is promptly arrested by Fache for using him to hunt Langdon.|$|E
25|$|En {{route to}} Richmond, Fremantle passed through Wilmington, North Carolina, and Petersburg, Virginia, before {{arriving}} in the Confederate capital two days after leaving Charleston. On {{the day of his}} arrival, he was granted a meeting with Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin. During the audience, Benjamin assured Fremantle that British diplomatic recognition of the C.S.A. would terminate the war without more bloodshed, though the British officer was concerned about a possible Union invasion of Canada. Benjamin also complained to his guest about revelations about his gambling habits made by the former correspondent of The Times, William Howard Russell. Benjamin then took Fremantle to see President Jefferson Davis, with whom he spoke for an hour. From Fremantle's account, it is possible to conclude that the Confederate leaders may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to impress their British visitor on the matter of diplomatic intervention, without real consideration of his lack of power to do so.|$|E
