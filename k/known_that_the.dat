5|$|As {{the use of}} English in worship {{services}} spread, {{the need for a}} complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can only be partially reconstructed, but it is <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence and believed that the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.|$|E
5|$|As with written records, {{the archaeological}} {{evidence}} for this period is not extensive, {{and knowledge of the}} daily lives of the population is lacking. It is <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E

This led to the use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E
5|$|From the 740s {{until the}} end of the Northumbrian kingdom, coins were issued by most kings, {{although}} in variable quantities. Until recently no coins from Eardwulf's reign were known, which suggested that it may have been a time of instability, or perhaps that the kingdom was impoverished by the payment of tribute to Offa and Coenwulf of Mercia. It is now <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> issue of new coins continued during Eardwulf's reign, as two of his coins were identified in the 1990s. Issues of new currency appear to have been limited under Eardwulf, and significant numbers of Northumbrian coins are not again attested until the reign of Eardwulf's son Eanred.|$|E

5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion. The piers {{to the south and}} north were somewhat lower than those to the east and west. The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the south and north, each again featuring a vaulted roof. The relation of the Church of Christ Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left, but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself. It is <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chapel was placed atop an elevated platform, and 18th-century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E

5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity.

5|$|The {{foundation}} of Celestial Master {{belief is that}} there is an energy source known as qi, that is born from the Dao and is the source of life all things. The human body contains spirits that need to be nourished by the proper balance of qi. There are three types of qi: yin qi, yang qi and blended qi, which is mixed yin/yang qi. The goal of a Daoist is to achieve transcendence to a higher plane. In order to do this, they must preserve and harmonize their internal spirits. Only through meditation that guides qi correctly throughout the body, can the spirits be harmonized correctly. While it is <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Celestial Masters meditated in order to obtain qi, there is no surviving evidence that describes their meditation practices.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{documentary}} {{evidence about the}} nature of trade in Æthelberht's Kent. It is <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kings of Kent had established royal control of trade by the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological evidence suggesting that the royal influence predates any of the written sources. It has been suggested that one of Æthelberht's achievements was to take control of trade away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods which gave it an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself.|$|E
