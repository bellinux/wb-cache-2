40|$|Agriculture {{remains a}} major {{component}} in the North Dakota economy, yet many activities within the agricultural industry remain unquantified. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the economic contribution of the soybean industry to the North Dakota economy. Expenditures and returns from soybean production, grain handling, and transportation were estimated to calculate the <b>direct</b> economic <b>impacts</b> from soybean activities. Secondary economic impacts were estimated using the North Dakota Input-Output Model. Since 1995, soybean acreage in the United States has increased substantially in nontraditional row-crop regions, such as those found in some parts of North Dakota. Soybean acreage in the state has increased 135 percent since 1995, and 210 percent since 1990. The expansion of soybean production in North Dakota has been limited to the eastern half of the state, with the largest concentration of production occurring in the Red River Valley. Soybean production in North Dakota averaged 1. 2 million planted acres from 1996 to 1998. <b>Direct</b> <b>impacts</b> (expenditures and returns) from soybean production averaged $ 184 per acre or $ 221 million annually from 1996 through 1998. Average <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> from handling soybeans at North Dakota elevators were estimated at $ 4. 3 million annually. Transportation of soybeans to market destinations was estimated to generate $ 10. 1 million in annual <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> to the state. Total <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> from soybean production, grain handling, and transportation were estimated at $ 235. 4 million annually. Total annual economic <b>impacts</b> (<b>direct</b> and secondary effects) from soybean production, grain handling, and transportation were estimated at $ 579 million, $ 11. 7 million, and $ 26. 3 million, respectively. The total annual economic impact from all soybean activities was estimated at $ 617 million. Soybean industry activities supported 7, 700 full-time secondary jobs in North Dakota. Soybean activities were also responsible for $ 25 million in combined property tax, sales tax, individual income tax, and corporate income tax revenues. soybeans, North Dakota, economic impact, Production Economics,...|$|R

5|$|During {{the opening}} days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards {{parallel}} to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600km (370mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it {{was too far away}} from the coast for there to be any <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> on the UK economy, air {{transport}} is an £11.4billion industry, a figure which represents 1.1 per {{cent of the}} country’s economy. It employs 186,000 people (full-time equivalents), and indirectly supports an additional 334,000 jobs, although the inclusion of indirect employment as an economic benefit of air transport is disputed. In terms of productivity the aviation industry in 2004 was the third most productive, after the oil/gas extraction and utilities sectors, exceeding the national average {{by a factor of}} two and a half. The industry is also very capital intensive, accounting for up to 3.5 per cent of total UK business investment in the period 2000 to 2004. Air transport was directly responsible for £3.6billion in tax and national insurance contributions in 2004/5, which includes £0.9billion raised in Air Passenger Duty (APD), a figure set to double after APD rates were doubled in February 2007. Because of the global nature of the industry, article 15 of the Chicago Convention effectively prevents the imposition of fuel duty on aviation, and the industry does not pay Value Added Tax (VAT). Environmental groups argue that these, along with duty-free sales, are iniquitous tax concessions valued at £9billion annually. Despite generating £6.9billion in exports in 2004, representing 3 per cent of all UK exports and 7 per cent of the total export of services, the patronage in the UK of air transport services provided by overseas airlines resulted in a £3.3billion balance of payments deficit attributable to the industry.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{economic}} contribution of the soybean industry to the North Dakota economy. Expenditures and returns from soybean production, grain handling, and transportation were estimated to calculate the <b>direct</b> economic <b>impacts</b> from soybean activities. Secondary economic impacts were estimated using the North Dakota Input- Output Model. Soybean production in North Dakota has trended upward over the past three decades. Increases in acreage were relatively modest in the 1980 s, but by the mid 1990 s acreage was beginning to rapidly expand. In 1990, North Dakota had about 500, 000 acres of soybeans. By 2000, acreage had increased to 1. 9 million acres. By 2009, soybean acreage in the state was approaching 4 million acres. <b>Direct</b> <b>impacts</b> (expenditures and returns) from soybean production averaged $ 312 per acre or $ 1. 1 billion annually from 2007 through 2009. Average <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> from handling soybeans at North Dakota elevators were estimated at $ 27. 5 million annually. Transportation of soybeans to market destinations was estimated to generate $ 49. 8 million in annual <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> to the state. Total <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> from soybean production, grain handling, and transportation were estimated at $ 1. 2 billion annually. Total annual economic <b>impacts</b> (<b>direct</b> and secondary effects) from soybean production, grain handling, and transportation were estimated at $ 3 billion, $ 75. 9 million, and $ 129 million, respectively. The total annual economic impact from all soybean activities was estimated at $ 3. 2 billion. Soybean industry activities supported 11, 400 full-time secondary jobs in North Dakota. Soybean activities were also responsible for $ 85 million in combined property tax, sales tax, individual income tax, and corporate income tax revenues. Based on comparison to economic impact estimates from the 1996 through 1998 period, the economic contribution of the soybean industry in North Dakota increased by $ 2. 4 billion or by 306 percent in real terms. Much of the increase in the gross business volume of the industry has come from a three-fold increase in soybean production combined with higher crop prices, handling margins, and transportation rates. soybeans, North Dakota, economic impact, Crop Production/Industries, Production Economics,...|$|R
5|$|Khalid's {{strategy}} of {{withdrawing from the}} occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response. The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large-scale decisive battles, and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill-prepared. Damascus was the closest logistical base, but Mansur, leader of Damascus, could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmouk plain. Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply requisition, as summer was at an end {{and there was a}} decline of pasturage. Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius' command not to engage in large-scale battle with Arabs. Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmouk, however, Vahan {{had little choice but to}} respond in kind. Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension. There was a struggle for power between Trithurios and Vahan, Jarajis, and Qanatir (Buccinator). Jabalah, the Christian Arab leader, was largely ignored, to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain. An atmosphere of mistrust thus existed between the Romans, Greeks, Armenians, and Arabs. Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions, while of negligible <b>direct</b> <b>impact,</b> certainly inflamed underlying tensions. The effect of these feuds was decreased coordination and planning, one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the economic contribution of crude oil and natural gas exploration, extraction, transportation, and processing in North Dakota in 2005. Primary data for the study came from three separate surveys of firms involved with various aspects of the petroleum industry. Exploration, the process of finding mineral resources, was estimated to have <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> (in-state expenditures) of $ 445. 1 million. Extraction, the process of developing and recovering mineral resources, had <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> of $ 909. 6 million. The processing sector of the industry, which included pipeline transportation of crude oil and natural gas, had $ 132 million in <b>direct</b> <b>impacts.</b> The North Dakota Input-Output Model was used to estimate the secondary economic impacts (multiplier effects). The $ 1. 4 billion in <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> were estimated to generate $ 2. 4 billion in secondary impacts. The gross business volume for the entire industry in North Dakota in 2005 was estimated at $ 3. 9 billion. Other economic measures for the industry were estimated, which included direct contributions to local and state government tax revenues of over $ 280 million, 5, 267 full-time jobs, economy-wide personal income of $ 1. 5 billion, statewide retail sales of over $ 900 million, indirect contribution of $ 55 million in state government general tax collections, and secondary employment of 20, 650 full-time equivalent jobs. While only a snapshot in time, results from this study would suggest that recent upswings in energy prices, increased drilling activity, and growth in oil and gas production in North Dakota have made the petroleum industry the one of largest single industries in the state.

Wheat is produced in all areas of the state; however, production is concentrated in the Red River Valley and in the northern third of the state. Wheat production (spring, durum, and winter wheat) in North Dakota averaged about 9. 1 million planted acres and 275 million bushels annually from 2001 through 2003. <b>Direct</b> <b>impacts</b> (in-state expenditures and returns) from wheat production averaged $ 126. 50 per acre or $ 1. 14 billion annually from 2001 through 2003. <b>Direct</b> <b>impacts</b> from handling wheat at North Dakota elevators were estimated at $ 32 million annually. Transportation of wheat to both in-state and out-of-state destinations was estimated to generate $ 73 million annually in <b>direct</b> <b>impacts.</b> Annual <b>direct</b> <b>impacts</b> from wheat processing (milling activities) were estimated at $ 100 million. When secondary economic impacts were included, the wheat industry was estimated to have a gross business volume of $ 3. 56 billion annually from 2001 through 2003. Wheat industry activities also supported over 35, 000 full-time secondary jobs and generated $ 126 million in combined property tax, sales tax, individual income tax, and corporate income tax collections in North Dakota. Due primarily to reduced grain volume, current economic impacts from wheat production, grain handling, and transportation activities decreased from levels in 1991 through 1993. However, impacts from wheat processing increased by 121 percent in real terms between the two periods. Overall, the economic size of the wheat industry in North Dakota declined 33 percent from 1991 through 1993 to 2001 through 2003.
