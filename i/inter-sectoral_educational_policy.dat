In the situation that educational {{administration is going to}} melt into politics by Education Board reform, what will be brought with progress of these studies? By reflexivity of political context, <b>educational</b> <b>policy</b> will be seen as politics. Even if for clarifying policy making process objectively, political study is done only for itself, not for others. In this sense, it is not objective, but subjective. It must be done for reconstructing “raison d’etre” of politics itself, and we can name it, by using A. Giddens or U. Beck’s word “Reflexitivity”, “Political Reflexivity”. When approaches of political study are using in <b>Educational</b> <b>Policy</b> Study, it can’t help but reconstruct meanings of education policy, so we need well reflection for “Reflexivity” of studies...|$|R

40|$|Educators hold varied {{opinions}} about the nature the social foundations of education. The social-foundations perspective generally characterizes education as an integrated multidisciplinary approach {{to the study of}} education, which focuses on the relationship among social conditions, values, and <b>educational</b> <b>policies.</b> This paper supports the social-foundations perspective and presents a paradigm for analyzing <b>educational</b> <b>policy</b> from that perspective. The paradigm examines the relationships among values, social conditions, and <b>educational</b> <b>policies.</b> The inquiry steps of <b>educational</b> <b>policy</b> analysis are descriptive analysis, critical evaluation, and speculative analysis. The social-foundations analysis integrates descriptive data from the social sciences, provides a historical context for understanding the relationship between social conditions {{and the role of the}} school, and applies the descriptive-analytical, critical-evaluation, and speculative tasks of the philosopher of education. In conclusion, social-foundations inquiry can make fruitful use of democratic values, history, and the social-science disciplines, by calling for a profound analysis of social conditions and the relationship of <b>educational</b> <b>policy</b> to social action.
