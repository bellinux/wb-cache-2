He will be staying with us {{throughout}} the fourth Test.... Alan wants to help with other duties in any way he can. That's the sort of person he <b>is...</b> <b>He</b> <b>really</b> struggled for his rhythm and line. He just can't get around. He's very disappointed. He was hopeful he might put up with it and carry on, but it's no use now... He's lost everything. On his form against West Zone you just couldn't play him anymore. He's still got a lot of cricket left in him and he could do himself permanent damage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, Hardwicke, in a turnabout {{from her}} initial underwhelmed {{reaction}} upon first seeing {{a photograph of}} Pattinson, enthused; [...] "The thing that’s great about him <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> does [...] feel like he’s otherworldly. I mean, he doesn’t look like a normal guy. And {{when you read the}} book, you think, ‘Who on the planet can live up to this description?’ But I think he does. He’s just got that chiseled face that photographs exactly like it’s described in the book. When you read about the sculptured cheeks and chiseled jawbone and everything, it’s like, ‘Wow. Did she write this for Rob?" [...] Pattinson, in a detailed interview on how he perceives the character, admitted to having incorporated aspects of Rebel Without a Cause into his portrayal of Edward, assessing; [...] "I guess kind of the thing which I found interesting is that he is essentially the hero of this story but violently denies that he is the hero. Like at every point even when he does heroic things he still thinks that he’s [...] the most ridiculously selfish evil creature around. [...] He refuses to accept Bella’s love for him {{but at the same time}} can’t help but just kind of needs it, which is kind of what the essential storyline is." [...] Appearing at ComicCon in July 2008 while the film was in post-production, Pattinson surmised the Twilight experience as: [...] "bizarre. You kind of know that it is essentially the book. The book has so many obsessive, obsessively loyal fans. It's strange because people just immediately relate you to the character right away rather than you as an actor." [...] Pattinson reprised his role as Edward in all of the Twilight sequels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrade Fidanza," [...] he began, solemnly, [...] "you {{have refused}} all aid from that doctor. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> a {{dangerous}} {{enemy of the}} people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Or, had {{he found}} that <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> too late, and thus gone back to a living death upon a dead world? Or <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> dead after all, never to return either to his mother Earth or his beloved Mars? ...|$|R
60|$|Reiterating {{these words}} again and again, he leaned {{his head against}} the {{partition}} and burst into tears. Sordid and coarse as his nature <b>was,</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> loved his daughter. All the heart <b>he</b> had <b>was</b> in his statues and in her.|$|R
60|$|EDSTASTON. Come! I <b>am</b> sure <b>he</b> <b>really</b> loved you; and {{you truly}} loved him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{felt a bit}} {{afraid of}} her," [...] laughed Joan, [...] "so I made her promise not to part with it. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> very ill, her husband?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Lady Harman slowly, not {{advancing}} {{and pointing}} incredulously at the unwinking stare that met her own, [...] "is he dead? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> dead? Like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor dear Herbert!" [...] {{she said}} tenderly. [...] "After {{we have been}} eight years married, <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> afraid that I shall be jealous? Mamma! Why are you looking so serious?" ...|$|E
60|$|Madame Christophor looked steadfastly at her visitor. Was it her fancy or <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> growing older, {{this man}} of iron? The {{story of the}} last few weeks was written into his face, there were shadows under his eyes, a deep line across his forehead.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{never did}} care {{particularly}} about anything," [...] Mrs. Brander said, [...] "and it may <b>be</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> {{glad to get}} away from the country." ...|$|R
5000|$|Plaintiff's {{attorney}} explained, [...] "The judge's opinion <b>was</b> resounding. <b>He</b> <b>really</b> regarded {{this case}} as important and understood the real-life issues." ...|$|R
6000|$|The mother {{instinct}} in Lady Valleys took sudden fright. [...] "Are {{you telling}} me the truth, Babs? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> out of danger? How wrong of you not {{to let me know}} before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Annie {{would not}} laugh at his joke. [...] "Ralph," [...] she asked, [...] "is {{it true that}} Mr. Peck is so unpopular in his church? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> going to be turned out--dismissed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] {{the young}} lady said, as she went upon deck, [...] "I {{have been talking to}} that young {{carpenter}} of yours. I am quite interested in him. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> a carpenter? He does not talk a bit like one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] she murmured, [...] "that {{it would}} <b>be</b> difficult. <b>He</b> <b>really</b> deserves a better fate, does <b>he</b> not? <b>He</b> <b>is</b> so beautifully persistent." ...|$|R
5000|$|... initial {{incident}} is when Claude and his mates assault Ben into the hospital. That <b>is</b> when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> think about revenge and take action.|$|R
3000|$|Lale: “My {{sister-in-law}} and {{my brother}} would say – just when he [the supervisee, SR] was leaving the room, so he could still hear it –: “Oh, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> so smart! <b>He’s</b> {{going to go to}} university, just like his aunt”. And then I would react like: “Yes, for sure, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> smart. <b>He</b> <b>really</b> studies hard!”.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} him," [...] said the Russian slowly. [...] "Spoken to him face to face. I {{did not know}} it until afterwards. He was one of a crowd. I should not know him again. Who <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really?</b> I do not know. But I know this--he is a man to fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] Dr. Beddersley answered. [...] "That is {{just what}} I should expect. Now, the {{question}} is, {{do you know him}} to be one man, or <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> a gang? Is he a name for a syndicate? Have you any photographs of Colonel Clay himself in any of his disguises?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But my dear boy, believe me, a man {{is never}} himself save in the supreme state of love: or perhaps hate, too, which amounts to the same thing. Never really himself.--Apart from this he is a tram-driver or a money-shoveller or an idea-machine. Only {{in the state of}} love <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> a man, and really himself. I say so, because I know," [...] said Argyle.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only real}} {{chance of a}} reprieve that I can see," [...] Hardaway continued, [...] "is {{on account of the}} fellow's health. I believe <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> very much worse than he appears, and I fancy that if we had a medical {{examination}} it would give us at least a chance. The trouble <b>is</b> that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> seems quite indifferent. Are you thinking of trying to see him, Deane?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was worth}} {{while to get}} Carquinez to loosen up. Nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>really</b> himself until <b>he</b> felt the mellow warmth of the vine singing in his blood. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> an artist, it is true, always an artist; but somehow, sober, the high pitch and lilt {{went out of his}} thought-processes and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> prone to be as deadly dull as a British Sunday--not dull as other men are dull, but dull when {{measured}} by the sprightly wight that Monte Carquinez <b>was</b> when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} kept it {{specially}} dark," [...] said Horne Fisher to himself. [...] "It must <b>be</b> something <b>he's</b> <b>really</b> ashamed of. Hang it all! {{what is a}} man ashamed of nowadays?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} you speak {{once or twice}} of Bax and his exploits," [...] said Guy Foster, when the boy left them, [...] "but {{this is the first}} time I have seen him perform. I did not see much of him when down on the coast last summer, but I saw enough to make me like him. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> the {{wonderful}} fellow that Tommy makes him out to be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? You are {{not afraid}} of him." [...] The son smiled, but made no answer. [...] "You might find out from him what it <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wants;--what he will really do. Those {{attorneys}} don't understand. Carey isn't a bad fellow, and as for honesty, I'd trust him with anything. I've known him and his father all my life, and in any ordinary piece of business {{there is no one}} whose opinion I would take so soon. But he talks of my waiting, telling me that the thing will come round after a few years,--as if what one wanted was merely an investment for one's money. It isn't that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. And, he {{was brought}} up so well, and sent to Casterbridge Grammar School for years and years. Learnt all {{languages}} while he was there; and it was said he got on so far that he could take down Chinese in shorthand; but that I don't answer for, as it was only reported. However, he wasted his gifted lot, and listed a soldier; but even then he rose to be a sergeant without trying at all. Ah! such a blessing {{it is to be}} high-born; nobility of blood will shine out even in the ranks and files. And <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> come home, miss?" ...|$|E
60|$|CZAR. You <b>are</b> right. If <b>he</b> <b>really</b> {{loved the}} people, <b>he</b> could not <b>be</b> my son.|$|R
50|$|Surprisingly, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> bad in art (chapter 49.5).|$|R
6000|$|... "My poor Denis!" [...] Anne <b>was</b> touched. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> too pathetic as {{he stood}} {{there in front of}} her in his white flannel trousers. [...] "But does one suffer about these things? It seems very extraordinary." ...|$|R
60|$|War in {{the future}} is going to be Puss in the Corner on a bigger scale. You lure your enemy away from his base. If all goes well--if he does not see the trap that is being laid for him--why, then, almost before he knows it, he finds himself in your capital. That {{finishes}} the game. You find out what it <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wants. Provided it is something within reason, and you happen to have it handy, you give it to him. He goes home crowing, and you, on your side, laugh when you think how cleverly you succeeded in luring him away from his base.|$|E
6000|$|The Baptist {{himself is}} not convinced; for at quite a late period in his former disciple's career he sends {{two young men}} to ask Jesus <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> the Christ. This is {{noteworthy}} because Jesus immediately gives them a deliberate exhibition of miracles, and bids them tell John what they have seen, and {{ask him what he}} thinks now: This is in complete contradiction to what I have called the Rousseau view of miracles as inferred from Matthew. Luke shows all a romancer's thoughtlessness about miracles; he regards them as [...] "signs": that is, as proofs of the divinity of the person performing them, and not merely of thaumaturgic powers. He revels in miracles just as he revels in parables: they make such capital stories. He cannot allow the calling of Peter, James, and John from their boats to pass without a comic miraculous overdraft of fishes, with the net sinking the boats and provoking Peter to exclaim, [...] "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord," [...] which should probably be translated, [...] "I want no more of your miracles: natural fishing is good enough for my boats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, at Oxford, is he?' Miss Luttrell chimed on vacantly, wagging her {{wrinkled}} old head in solemn deprecation of tke evil omen. She knew {{it as well}} as Mrs. Oswald herself did, {{having heard}} the fact at least a thousand times before; but she made it a matter of principle never to encourage these upstart pretensions {{on the part of the}} lower orders, and just to keep them rigorously at their proper level she always made a feint of forgetting any steps in advance which they might have been bold enough to take, without humbly obtaining her previous permission, out of their original and natural obscurity. 'Fellow of his college <b>is</b> <b>he,</b> <b>really?</b> Fellow of a college! Dear me, how completely Oxford is going to the dogs. Admitting all kinds of odd people into the University, I understand. Why, my second brother--the Archdeacon, you know--was a Fellow of Magdalen for some time in his younger days. You surprise me, quite. Fellow of a college! You're perfectly sure he isn't a National schoolmaster at Oxford instead, and that you and his father haven't got the two things mixed up together in your heads, Mrs. Oswald?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Trevino has {{a younger}} sister named Sarah. Having {{finished}} High School, Trevino {{decided to start}} fighting, as he wasn't {{able to focus on}} a profession unless it <b>was</b> something <b>he</b> <b>really</b> loved, due to his ADHD.|$|R
2500|$|On 31 October Baxter {{wrote to}} Newcome, {{acknowledging}} that Paget {{was a difficult}} man, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not sure <b>he</b> <b>really</b> resented Newcome: ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Malcolm Gladwell {{does not}} believe that intuition <b>is</b> magic. <b>He</b> <b>really</b> doesn't...But here his story has helped people, in a belief that they want to have, which is that intuition works magically; and that belief, is false." ...|$|R
