5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E

5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample {{of those in the}} parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E
5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the perception of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the perception of a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> leaps.|$|E
5|$|As {{the signal}} {{passes through the}} satellite, it is {{translated}} by—added to—a signal generated by an oscillator in the satellite. Although the oscillator is housed in a temperature-controlled enclosure, it is subjected to thermal variation throughout the day that results in minor changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the translation signal. The thermal variation results from {{the rotation of the}} satellite relative to the sun over a given 24-hour period, including the time the satellite passes through the Earth's shadow (which affected the 3:40 and 4:26 handshakes), and is complicated by the use of heaters that run when the oscillator temperature exits pre-determined limits. The variation in the translation frequency was calculated over several days, including the day of Flight 370's disappearance, and could be factored into the BFO measurement.|$|E

40|$|Etoposide (ET) is a {{chemotherapeutic}} agent widely used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of leukemia, lymphomas and many solid tumors, such as testicular and ovarian cancers, that affect patients in their reproductive years. The {{purpose of the}} study was to use sperm FISH analyses to characterize the long-term effects of ET on male germ cells. We used a mouse model to characterize the induction of chromosomal aberrations (partial duplications and deletions) and whole chromosomal aneuploidies in sperm of mice treated with a clinical dose of ET. Semen samples were collected at 25 and 49 days after dosing to investigate the effects of ET on meiotic pachytene cells and spermatogonial stem-cells, respectively. ET treatment resulted in major increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> sperm carrying chromosomal aberrations in both meiotic pachytene (27 - to 578 -fold) and spermatogonial stem-cells (8 - to 16 -fold), but aneuploid sperm were induced only after treatment of meiotic cells (27 -fold) with no persistent effects in stem cells. These results demonstrate that male meiotic germ cells are considerably more sensitive to ET than spermatogonial stem-cell and that increased <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> sperm with structural aberrations persist after spermatogonial stem-cell treatment. These findings predict that patients who undergo chemotherapy with ET may have transient elevations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> aneuploid sperm, but more importantly, may have persistent elevations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> sperm with chromosomal aberrations, placing them at higher risk for abnormal reproductive outcomes long after the end of their chemotherapy...|$|R

40|$|SummarySmoking is {{a public}} health concern {{and we are still}} unsure of its {{relation}} with auditory problems. AimTo study the effects of cigarette smoking in auditory thresholds, in otoacoustic emissions and in their inhibition by the efferent olivocochlear medial system.

Resultssmokers presented worse auditory thresholds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> 12. 500 Hz <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right ear and 14, 000 kHz in both ears.

40|$|We measure {{resonant}} Raman scattering from 11 individual C(60) -derived double-wall carbon nanotubes all having inner semiconducting (6, 5) {{tubes and}} various outer metallic tubes.
