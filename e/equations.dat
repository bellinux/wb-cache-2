5|$|Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in {{the study}} of partial {{differential}} <b>equations.</b> For many classes of partial differential <b>equations,</b> such as linear elliptic <b>equations,</b> it is possible to consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or, often what is more important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic <b>equations,</b> one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution of partial differential <b>equations.</b>|$|E

Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's <b>equations,</b> so in particular, the matter's energy–momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional <b>equations</b> were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.|$|E
