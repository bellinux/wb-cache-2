5|$|On 11 February, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.|$|E
5|$|In October 1974 Abu Nidal {{formed the}} ANO, calling it Fatah: The Revolutionary Council. In November that year a Fatah court {{sentenced him to}} death in {{absentia}} for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas. Seale writes that {{it is unlikely that}} Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas, and just as unlikely that Fatah wanted to kill Abu Nidal. He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence, and was allowed to leave again, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had become persona non grata. As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons. He also received Iraq's regular aid to the PLO: around $150,000 a month and a lump sum of $3–5 million.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would not}} make the Derby and he {{was removed from the}} race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine {{on the morning of the}} 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s {{the hotel}} was {{beginning}} to lose it reputation and a slow decline in popularity began which would culminate in tragedy for Tony Pike. In 1998, Pike had put the hotel up for sale. A deal was {{set up for the}} sale {{which turned out to be}} a scam and Pike was swindled out of £50,000. His son, Anthony Dale Pike, flew to Miami to resolve the situation for his father. However, he was killed the same day of his arrival on 15 February 1998, shot twice in the head and dumped in a secluded forest at Virginia Key beach. Miami Dade Police detectives believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was killed by the people plotting to seize control of the hotel. The police arrested and questioned German tennis professional Thomas Heinz Knott over the murder, but the investigation led them to charge Italian TV producer Enrico Forti with fraud over the transfer of £50,000 from Anthony’s father. In June 2000, Forti was also convicted of murdering Anthony Dale Pike in Miami. Forti is now serving a lifetime prison sentence at the Everglades Correctional Institution in Florida.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} {{game of the}} 1979 season, Richard set the modern-day record for {{throwing}} six wild pitches in a single game against the Dodgers. Despite this, he finished {{the game with a}} 13-strikeout performance in a 2–1 Astros victory. He won his first four decisions that season but those victories were followed by four losses. He continued to accumulate strikeouts and finally began to walk fewer batters on average, exhibiting greater control over his pitching. Richard evened out his record at seven wins and seven losses by pitching a complete game three-hit shutout against the Padres on June 30. By the All-Star break, Richard had 7wins, 10losses, a 3.52 earned run average and 158strikeouts in just a bit over 157innings of work. By July 25, his record stood at eight wins and 11 losses, but after he pitched nine straight complete games (including two-hit and three-hit shutouts on August 27 and September 6, respectively) through September 6 and worked 86 consecutive innings without the need of a relief pitcher, which set an Astros club record, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was on a winning streak. On September 21, in a game against the Reds, he pitched 11innings and matched a career high of 15strikeouts, which he also reached earlier in the season on August 3 in a game against the Braves. He closed out the season against the Dodgers by winning his 11th straight game against the team, with his last loss coming on June 23, 1976. He was honored as the National League Pitcher of the Month for September after going 4–1 with a 1.24ERA, four complete games, two shutouts and 69strikeouts in 53innings pitched during the stretch.|$|E
25|$|Prison {{records for}} John William Henry stopped in 1873, {{suggesting}} that he was kept on the record books until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not coming back and had died. The evidence assembled by Nelson, though suggestive, is circumstantial; Nelson stresses that John Henry would have been representative of the many hundreds of convict laborers {{who were killed in}} unknown circumstances tunneling through the mountains or who died shortly afterwards of silicosis from dust created by the drills and blasting.|$|E

25|$|The {{miracle of}} the oil is widely {{regarded}} as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages. However, given the famous question Rabbi Yosef Karo posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day), <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed it was a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Rabbi Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main Code of Jewish Law.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, Goring had {{no desire}} to lose the {{independent}} command that he had extorted at Stow-on-the-Wold in May. Still, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must be disposed of, as quickly as possible. On 26 June, Fairfax requested the Houses to take other measures against the King. This, they did by paying up the arrears due to Leven's army, and bringing it to the Severn valley. On 8 July, Leven reached Alcester, bringing with him a Parliamentarian force from Derbyshire, under Sir John Gell. The design was to besiege Hereford.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those with}} the {{foresight}} to recognize the possibilities of Burbank’s work was Clarence McDowell Stark, who went to California and sought Burbank out. After talking to him in Santa Rosa and seeing {{the results of his}} experiments, Clarence was convinced that Burbank was right and his professorial critics were wrong. To Clarence’s great dismay, he saw that Luther Burbank was operating a small seed and nursery business in an attempt to finance his experiments and provide himself a living. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would never be able to}} realize his potential under these meager circumstances.|$|E

25|$|By 6 p.m., {{the center}} of Bragg's line had broken {{completely}} and fled in panic, requiring the abandonment of Missionary Ridge and a headlong retreat eastward to South Chickamauga Creek. The sole exception to the panicked flight was Cleburne's command, his division augmented by two brigades from another division. As the only command not in complete disarray, {{it was the last}} unit to withdraw and formed the rearguard of Bragg's army as it retreated eastward. Only Sheridan tried to pursue beyond Missionary Ridge, but he finally gave up late that night when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not being supported by either Granger or Thomas.|$|E
25|$|France was now {{strong and}} united under Louis XIV, {{and after the}} Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) took Spain's place as the {{dominant}} power in Europe. Three wars were fought during this period, the War of Devolution (1667–1668), the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678), and the War of the Grand Alliance (1688–1697). Although Spain's territorial losses (the Franche-Comté, some towns in the Southern Netherlands {{and part of the}} island of Hispaniola) were relatively few, it had demonstrated some vulnerability, and Louis XIV (and indeed the other European rulers) had plans for when Charles II's death came, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would produce no children and the Habsburg line in Spain would die with him. The end came with Charles' passing at the age of 39 on November 1, 1700.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} Sundar Singh had wanted to visit Britain, and the {{opportunity}} came when his father, Sher Singh, who was converted too gave him the money for his fare to Britain. He visited the West twice, travelling to Britain, the United States and Australia in 1920, and to Europe again in 1922. He was welcomed by Christians of many traditions, and his words searched the hearts of people who now faced the aftermath of World War I and who seemed to evidence a shallow attitude to life. Singh was appalled {{by what he saw}} as the materialism, emptiness and irreligion he found everywhere, contrasting it with Asia's awareness of God, no matter how limited that might be. Once back in India he continued his Gospel-proclamation work, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was getting more physically frail.|$|E

25|$|This {{diplomacy}} {{was initially}} successful because the reigning Tsar, Alexander I (r.1801–25), {{was reluctant to}} support any revolutionary movement because of his experience during the Napoleonic Wars. Despite fervent support for the Greek cause in Russian nationalist circles, Alexander proved unwilling to defy Metternich and Castlereagh and offer the Greeks more than (limited) diplomatic support. Indeed, at the Congress of Verona (1822), Castlereagh persuaded Tsar Alexander to ignore the Greek cause altogether, even refusing to admit a Greek delegation to the conference. In the same year, Alexander also forced the resignation of his ethnic Venetian/Greek foreign minister, Count Giovanni Capo d'Istria (Ioannis Kapodistrias, later president of the First Hellenic Republic), for his passionate advocacy of the Greek cause. In 1824 the Tsar proposed a plan for Greek autonomy to the other powers, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was simply not prepared to act unilaterally.|$|E
25|$|The product {{rule and}} chain rule, {{the notions of}} higher {{derivatives}} and Taylor series, and of analytic functions were introduced by Isaac Newton in an idiosyncratic notation which he used to solve problems of mathematical physics. In his works, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus {{to solve the problem}} of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a cycloid, and many other problems discussed in his Principia Mathematica (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> understood the principles of the Taylor series. He did not publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable.|$|E
25|$|Lanrezac's harsh {{criticism}} of his superiors in the Staff Corps overshadowed his impressive ability to avoid envelopment by the Germans, and he was replaced by Louis Franchet d'Espérey just before {{the opening of the}} First Battle of the Marne. Joffre later recorded that ever since the Battle of Guise, Lanrezac’s normal tendency to criticise and argue about his orders had been exacerbated by fatigue, to the detriment of Fifth Army staff’s morale. Lanrezac’s staff were bickering among themselves. As he could not be counted upon for the planned counterstroke, it was necessary to relieve him on the afternoon of 3 September. The eyewitness accounts of Lanrezac (who claimed that he protested that events had proved him right about most of the issues under dispute, but that Joffre refused to meet his gaze, so that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had exhausted Joffre’s confidence), Joffre (who claimed that Lanrezac immediately agreed and cheered up when relieved of command, in his own office) and Spears (who recalled seeing them having a lengthy and strained conversation in the playground of the school where Fifth Army HQ was currently based) differ somewhat.|$|E

500|$|Fowler was {{appointed}} as Massey's supervisor although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not need}} any supervision per se. Massey obtained his PhD on The Collisions of Material Particles in 1932. [...] Shortly afterwards, he co-authored a book on atomic collision processes with Nevill Mott, Theory of Atomic Collisions (1933). He also applied the theory of collisions to models of neutron structure. At the Cavendish laboratory, he also played hockey with Cockcroft, and cricket for the Cavendish Cricket Club, becoming team captain in his final year there.|$|E
500|$|The British became alarmed in January 1951 {{when the}} Americans began talking of {{evacuating}} Korea. The British argued that to maintain European faith and unity it was vital {{to maintain some}} presence in Korea, {{even if it was}} nothing more than a toehold in the Pusan area. Once again, Bradley defended MacArthur, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had become an irritant in the relationship between the two countries. However, the alliance with Britain itself was unpopular in Congress.
