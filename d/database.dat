5|$|In Perl 5, <b>database</b> {{interfaces}} {{are implemented}} by Perl DBI modules. The DBI (<b>Database</b> Interface) module presents a single, database-independent interface to Perl applications, while the DBD (<b>Database</b> Driver) modules handle {{the details of}} accessing some 50 different databases; there are DBD drivers for most ANSI SQL databases.|$|E
5|$|In early {{versions}} of Perl, <b>database</b> interfaces {{were created by}} relinking the interpreter with a client-side <b>database</b> library. This was sufficiently difficult that it was done {{for only a few}} of the most-important and most widely used databases, and it restricted the resulting perl executable to using just one <b>database</b> interface at a time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Database</b> {{forensics}} is {{a branch}} of digital forensics relating to the forensic study of databases and their metadata. Investigations use <b>database</b> contents, log files and in-RAM data to build a timeline or recover relevant information.|$|E
40|$|Non-relational <b>databases</b> {{are growing}} these days. Non-relational <b>databases</b> {{consists}} {{of various types}} of <b>databases</b> which are used to handle different types of data and have different features like Key value stores, document oriented <b>databases</b> and column oriented <b>databases,</b> graph <b>databases</b> and many others. In this paper we study the two popular non-relational <b>databases</b> document oriented <b>databases</b> and column oriented <b>databases,</b> describe their types, advantages and disadvantage...|$|R
5000|$|Essentially, {{there are}} four types of databases: curated <b>databases,</b> {{predictive}} <b>databases,</b> literature <b>databases</b> and integrative <b>databases</b> ...|$|R
50|$|One {{solution}} is to recast disparate <b>databases</b> to integrate these <b>databases</b> {{without the need for}} ETL. The recast <b>databases</b> support commonality constraints where referential integrity may be enforced between <b>databases.</b> The recast <b>databases</b> provide designed data access paths with data value commonality across <b>databases.</b>|$|R
5|$|Following the Nimda and Code Red worms, {{this version}} scans all {{incoming}} and outgoing traffic for suspicious data exchanges against a routinely updated <b>database,</b> a feature ported from Norton Internet Security 2002 Professional Edition. Connection to the offending computer is automatically severed if the traffic matches a <b>database</b> item.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{examples}} of protein pairs related by a circular permutation were subsequently discovered in nature or produced in the laboratory. As of February 2012, the Circular Permutation <b>Database</b> contains 2,238 circularly permuted protein pairs with known structures, and many more are known without structures. The CyBase <b>database</b> collects proteins that are cyclic, {{some of which are}} permuted variants of cyclic wild-type proteins. SISYPHUS is a <b>database</b> that contains a collection of hand-curated manual alignments of proteins with non-trivial relationships, several of which have circular permutations.|$|E
5|$|In the {{official}} Atlantic hurricane <b>database,</b> which {{dates back to}} 1851, the first storm to occur outside of the current season was in 1865 in the Caribbean Sea. In the <b>database,</b> 81 tropical or subtropical cyclones have existed between December and May, most recently Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017. In addition, {{there were at least}} five storms in May and another in December before the start of {{the official}} <b>database.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{marketing}} <b>databases,</b> 1) Consumer <b>databases,</b> and 2) business <b>databases.</b> Consumer <b>databases</b> are primarily geared towards companies that sell to consumers, often abbreviated as business-to-consumer (B2C) or BtoC. Business marketing <b>databases</b> are often much more advanced in {{the information that they}} can provide. This is mainly because business <b>databases</b> aren't restricted by the same privacy laws as consumer <b>databases.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{new kind}} of navigational <b>databases</b> has {{recently}} emerged, the graph <b>databases.</b> This category of <b>databases</b> is often included {{as one of the}} four family of the NoSQL <b>databases.</b>|$|R
40|$|Document {{oriented}} <b>databases</b> are {{the major}} type of non relational <b>databases.</b> These are growing and very popular these days because of their advantages over the relational <b>databases.</b> In this paper we will discuss the document oriented <b>databases</b> and also the security features as well as security problems in these <b>databases...</b>|$|R
5|$|Note: the <b>database</b> {{used here}} {{includes}} statistics since 1949.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the model}} of a molecule's {{structure}} has been finalized, it is often deposited in a crystallographic <b>database</b> such as the Cambridge Structural <b>Database</b> (for small molecules), the Inorganic Crystal Structure <b>Database</b> (ICSD) (for inorganic compounds) or the Protein Data Bank (for protein structures). Many structures obtained in private commercial ventures to crystallize medicinally relevant proteins are not deposited in public crystallographic databases.|$|E
5|$|Production {{codes are}} taken from the M*A*S*H episode <b>database.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Databases</b> {{configured}} for OLAP use {{a multidimensional}} data model, allowing for complex analytical and ad hoc queries with a rapid execution time. [...] They borrow aspects of navigational <b>databases,</b> hierarchical <b>databases</b> and relational <b>databases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Examples {{of these}} <b>databases</b> include the popular {{collection}} of public-domain subjective picture quality <b>databases</b> {{available at the}} Laboratory for Image & Video Engineering (LIVE) website. The LIVE <b>databases</b> were the first high quality, large subjective picture quality <b>databases</b> to {{be made available to}} the public free of charge and without withholding of any data portion. Recent work includes the <b>databases</b> by the Institut de Recherche en Communications et Cybernétique de Nantes (IRCCyN). A list of European <b>databases</b> related to the field of Quality of Experience {{can be found in the}} QUALINET <b>databases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Secondary <b>databases</b> are <b>databases,</b> {{which use}} other <b>databases</b> as their source of information, thus {{they get their}} data by {{requesting}} other <b>databases.</b> They often already process or analyze the data matching the corresponding request to get new results.|$|R
5|$|Some {{had said}} that the <b>database</b> might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where {{children}} from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the <b>database</b> would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The sheer size of the <b>database</b> could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate {{of the cost of the}} <b>database.</b> The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the <b>database</b> to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the <b>database</b> would do nothing to prevent child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E
5|$|The <b>database,</b> created {{under the}} Children Act 2004, cost £224m {{to set up}} and £41m a year to run. It {{operated}} in 150 local authorities, and was accessible to at least 330,000 users. The <b>database</b> was heavily criticised by a wide range of groups, mainly for privacy, security and child protection reasons. On 12 May 2010 the new UK Coalition Government announced plans to scrap ContactPoint and on 6 August 2010 the <b>database</b> was shut down. From that date the Children Act 2004 Information <b>Database</b> (England) Regulations 2007, as amended in 2010, no longer applies.|$|E
5|$|This is {{complicated}} by the fact that in some <b>database</b> interface programs (or even <b>database</b> implementations like Oracle's), NULL is reported as an empty string, and empty strings may be incorrectly stored as NULL.|$|E
40|$|Clinical <b>databases</b> in {{physical}} therapy provide increasing opportunities for research into physical therapy theory and practice. At present, {{information on the}} characteristics of existing <b>databases</b> is lacking. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify clinical <b>databases</b> in which physical therapists record data on their patients and treatments and to investigate the basic aspects, data sets, output, management, and data quality of the <b>databases.</b> Identification of the <b>databases</b> was performed by contacting members of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy, searching Pubmed, searching the Internet, and snowball sampling. A structured questionnaire was used to study the characteristics of the <b>databases.</b> The search was restricted to North America, Australia, Israel, and Western Europe. Seven clinical <b>databases</b> on physical therapy were identified. Four <b>databases</b> collected data on specific patient categories, whereas the others collected data on all patients. All <b>databases</b> collected data on patient characteristics, referrals, diagnoses, treatments, and closure, whereas some <b>databases</b> also collected functional status information. The purposes of the <b>databases</b> were diverse, but they can be summarized as quality improvement, research, and performance management. Although clinical <b>databases</b> are new to the field, they offer great potential for physical therapy research. Potential can be increased by further cooperation among <b>databases</b> allowing international comparative studies. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
30|$|The used <b>databases</b> {{were also}} defined through an {{iterative}} cycle. In our research, we started {{by using the}} <b>databases</b> EBSCOhost, JSTOR, GENIOS/WISO and Google Scholar. EBSCOhost and JSTOR {{are one of the}} biggest <b>databases</b> for academic research and connected with numerous other <b>databases.</b> During our research process on Google Scholar, some literature sources were found on other specific <b>databases</b> such as Emerald, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and SpringerLink. Thus, these <b>databases</b> were also included in the research process.|$|R

5|$|To {{allow the}} {{introduction}} of the <b>database,</b> the government required all local authorities to implement the Integrated Children's System, a framework to help improve outcomes for children. The government set a deadline of 1 January 2007, and 92 out of the 150 local authorities failed to achieve this. The government began a consultation on the 2007 draft regulations on 21 September 2006 which ended on 14 December 2006. In October 2006, the government selected Capgemini to design the <b>database.</b> On 15 February 2007, the <b>database</b> was renamed from Information Sharing Index to ContactPoint, following research with stakeholder groups, including children and families, who decided that the name ContactPoint made clear what the purpose of the <b>database</b> was: to improve communication between those working with children. A consultation on a guide for <b>database</b> users was launched on 4 May 2007 and ended on 27 July 2007.|$|E

25|$|Btrieve {{is not a}} {{relational}} <b>database</b> {{management system}} (RDBMS). Early descriptions of Btrieve {{referred to it as}} a record manager (though Pervasive initially used the term navigational <b>database</b> but later changed this to transactional <b>database)</b> because it only deals with the underlying record creation, data retrieval, record updating and data deletion primitives. It uses ISAM as its underlying indexing and storage mechanism. A key part of Pervasive's architecture is the use of a MicroKernel <b>Database</b> Engine, which allows different <b>database</b> backends to be modularised and integrated easily into their DBMS package, Pervasive.SQL. This has enabled them to support both their Btrieve navigational <b>database</b> engine and an SQL-based engine, Scalable SQL.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, Deductive <b>Databases</b> {{have been the}} focus of intense research, which has brought {{dramatic}} advances in theory, systems and applications. A salient feature of deductive <b>databases</b> is their capability of supporting a declarative, rule-based style of expressing queries and applications on <b>databases.</b> As such, they find applications in disparate areas, such as knowledge mining from <b>databases,</b> and computer-aided design and manufacturing systems. In this paper, we briefly review the key concepts behind deductive <b>databases</b> and their newly developed enabling technology.
