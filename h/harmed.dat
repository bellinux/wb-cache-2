In these circumstances, the authorities lack the information necessary {{to implement the}} usual liability rules or externality taxes. We propose a novel solution: hold each participant in the activity responsible {{for all of the}} excessive <b>harm</b> that everyone causes. By excessive <b>harm</b> we mean the difference between the total <b>harm</b> caused by all injurers and the optimal total <b>harm.</b> We show that the rule of total liability for excessive <b>harm</b> creates incentives for efficient precaution and activity level. Consequently, actual <b>harm</b> is not excessive and actual liability is nil.

40|$|<b>Harm</b> {{reduction}} is {{an approach that}} aims to reduce <b>harms</b> related to using drugs. <b>Harm</b> reduction services often fail to consider the needs of women who inject drugs or minimise responses to women’s needs in service design and implementation (Bennett et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2005; EMCDDA, 2006; Levy, 2014 a; Pinkham, Stoicesu and Myers, 2012; UNODC et al., 2014). It is therefore crucial to understand the experiences of women who inject drugs from their own perspectives, {{as well as those}} of <b>harm</b> reduction workers, in order to develop and implement effective responses to injecting drug use. This thesis explores how ‘harm’ and ‘harm reduction’ are conceptualised by workers and clients at a women-only day syringe exchange programme. It answers the following questions: In what ways do participants’ broader understandings of ‘harm’ and ‘harm reduction’ go beyond the traditional public health model of <b>harm</b> reduction in response to illicit injectable drug use? How are clients and workers’ understandings gendered? These questions were explored empirically through fieldwork in 2013 and 2014 at a <b>harm</b> reduction centre which featured a women-only day syringe exchange programme in Budapest, Hungary. This women-only day was the only gender sensitive <b>harm</b> reduction programme in the country, and the first study undertaken with Roma women who inject drugs in Hungary and female <b>harm</b> reduction workers. In addition, this first research project to use photovoice within a <b>harm</b> reduction context in Hungary. Data were co-produced with respondents according to the principles of Feminist- informed Participatory Action Research, using the method of ‘photovoice’. This method involved providing cameras for clients and employees of the women-only day to photograph their experiences and understandings of <b>harm,</b> <b>harm</b> production, and <b>harm</b> reduction. A significant portion of the data collected for this study was created by female <b>harm</b> reduction workers who worked at the women-only syringe exchange programme. Employees and clients’ images guided the research observations, interviews, and analysis. This meant collaboration between the participants and the researcher through the fieldwork, including the development and implementation of a research output in the form of a public photo exhibition and fundraiser event. The event was called ‘Chicks on the Corner’, and is the source of the thesis title as well as the title of the research project. The theoretical frameworks of zemiology (the study of <b>harm)</b> and black and multiracial feminist thought informed the ontological and epistemological grounding of the Chicks on the Corner project. These frameworks, coupled with the empirical data, produced an argument for the development of a feminist zemiology. The analytical themes that emerged from the Chicks on the Corner project were produced and categorised primarily using participant generated photographs. These images depict the multiple intersecting, overlapping, and mutually reinforcing sources of <b>harm</b> production and attempts at <b>harm</b> reduction in participants’ lives. Analysis of the photographs affirm that women who inject drugs experience an array of <b>harms</b> in addition to physical <b>harms</b> related to their drug use. <b>Harms</b> identified by research participants were categorised using Hillyard and Tombs (2004; 2005) zemiological typology. This typology consists of: physical <b>harms,</b> emotional <b>harms,</b> economic <b>harms,</b> and cultural <b>harms</b> (also known as lack of cultural safety). In addition, a new fifth category of <b>harm</b> was created based on participants’ responses, and is called institutional and political <b>harms.</b> The data from the Chicks on the Corner project show how institutional and political <b>harms</b> contributed to the production of the other four categories of <b>harm.</b> Furthermore, the analysis outlines the numerous challenges workers faced in attempting to provide adequate <b>harm</b> reduction responses while experiencing multiple social <b>harms</b> as well. These novel findings suggest the need for expanded definitions of ‘harm’ in <b>harm</b> reduction theory and practices. The findings from the Chicks on the Corner project complement existing literature on <b>harm</b> reduction theory and practice while also adding to the limited body of research on gender- sensitive approaches to <b>harm</b> reduction. This thesis contributes to an expansion of theoretical understandings of <b>harm</b> and <b>harm</b> reduction in relation to women who inject drugs and <b>harm</b> reduction workers, as well as discussing implications for gender sensitive <b>harm</b> reduction practices. Based on this analysis, I propose the development of feminist zemiology as a way to better understanding <b>harm...</b>|$|R
