500|$|Nix {{praised the}} game's sound design, {{describing}} it as [...] "far and away above {{what would be}} expected on the Game Boy Color." [...] He noted, for example, that [...] "there are individual sounds of the lightsaber swinging back and forth — cutting left will sound differently than the backswing or upswing of the third stroke against an enemy." [...] Samantha Craggs of The Electric Playground praised Obi-Wan's Adventures for its interesting gameplay {{and the use of}} the lightsaber. She commented: [...] "There are quite a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> like about this game. For one thing, you can't underestimate the feeling of moving across the floor wielding a deadly lightsaber. Also, the levels are interesting. [...] In , Obi-Wan is actually in a boat, going through the Naboo swamp, while battle droids shoot at him from the banks. While you're essentially fighting the same enemies in the same manner, there are enough twists in the level designs to interest you in continuing." ...|$|E
500|$|In England's response, Shakib {{opted to}} use his spinners to {{minimise}} scoring opportunities, a tactic which led to Cook's dismissal for 21. His fellow opener, Trott, scored his first run from his 33rd delivery, and continued to bat circumspectly throughout the second day. Pietersen attempted to score more quickly, though it took a bad over from Razzak {{to allow him to}} do so. A misjudged shot after leaving his crease resulted in him being caught, and Collingwood followed soon after, leg before wicket from his third delivery. Bell joined Trott in the middle, and the pair added 67 runs together before Trott was dismissed for 64. Prior capitalised on more bad bowling from Razzak to reach his half-century, but fell shortly after, giving Bangladesh hope of a first-innings lead. Bell and Bresnan took England to the brink of a lead, adding 143 runs together, including a century for Bell. It was the first occasion on which Bell had scored a century in Test cricket without a teammate having already done so in the innings, a statistic that had been used to suggest he could not score run in tough conditions. Speaking about his century, Bell alluded to that statistic, stating that he had [...] "put a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> bed." [...] After his dismissal, Bresnan batted with the tail, taking his score to 91, and England's to 496, a lead of 77 runs. After the third day, Bangladesh's captain, Shakib, criticised the Bangladesh Cricket Board for not paying {{for the use of the}} Umpire Decision Review System. He believed that a number of the umpiring decisions had gone against his side, and the technology could have given his side a better chance of their first Test win over England.|$|E

500|$|The afterlife {{experienced}} by the survivors is shown during season six. In [...] "The Substitute", Ben Linus is shown as a teacher of European History. In [...] "Dr. Linus", Ben laments his life in general, frustrated with the school bureaucracy and particularly due to Reynolds, the principal who does not care for the school. He is living with his father, Roger (Jon Gries), who is on life support. At school, he is shown to have {{a close relationship with}} his star pupil, Alex, and befriends a substitute teacher, John Locke. While studying together, Alex tells Ben that Principal Reynolds is having a sexual affair with one of the school nurses on campus. [...] Ben attempts to blackmail Reynolds, threatening to reveal his affair and citing his position as principal as the demand. However, Reynolds swiftly retaliates by saying if he makes good on his threats, Alex's chances of going to Yale University will decrease substantially, as he is requested to write her a recommendation letter. Wanting to save Alex's educational future, Ben backs down. Days later, Ben notices Desmond Hume waiting outside the school in his car for an extended amount of time. Desmond runs over Locke, and swiftly drives off. As soon as the ambulance arrives, Ben gets in and sits next to the critically injured Locke, assuring him everything will be all right. When Locke returns to the school, Desmond does as well, and Ben catches him. Desmond beats Ben severely saying he was only trying to help Locke let go. Ben has a vision from his previous life during Desmond's beating. Ben believes him and relays Locke this information. When Alex sees how badly Ben was beaten, she invites him to her house where her mother, Danielle, fixes him supper. Danielle tells Ben that Alex views him as a father, and Ben begins to cry. Ben waits outside the chapel where the Oceanic survivors plan to move on together, and he sees Locke for the last time. Ben sincerely apologizes to Locke for killing him, and Locke forgives him. Hurley later comes out of the chapel and invites Ben in, but Ben politely declines saying he is not ready to move on, saying he [...] "has a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> work out". Hurley accepts this, and tells Ben that he was a [...] "real good number two", thanking him for his help in protecting the island. Ben, touched by this, responds [...] "And you were a great number one, Hugo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hemostasis (blood clotting): Within {{the first}} few minutes of injury, {{platelets}} in the blood begin to stick to the injured site. This activates the platelets, causing a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> happen. They change into an amorphous shape, more suitable for clotting, and they release chemical signals to promote clotting. This results in the activation of fibrin, which forms a mesh and acts as [...] "glue" [...] to bind platelets to each other. This makes a clot that serves to plug the break in the blood vessel, slowing/preventing further bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|In Spain, Saint Joseph's Day {{is their}} version of Father's Day, which is called El Dia del Padre. In some parts of Spain it is celebrated as Falles. They feel that St. Joseph {{is a good example}} of what a father figure should be like, which is why they connect these two days. Since Spain does {{correlate}} this day with Father's Day, it is tradition for children to cook their fathers breakfast or even give small gifts. It is a [...] "meatless affair", because it occurs during the Lenten season. Some symbols to represent this day include Jesus holding carpenter tools, baby Jesus, and a staff with lilies. A <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do on this day to celebrate are attending a special church service, visiting different cathedrals, joining Valencia's Falla Festival, and exploring the city, museums and art galleries. The Falla Festival runs for 5 days and ends on March 19 in remembrance of Saint Joseph.|$|E

Salt Lake City {{also has the}} Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument, where Brigham Young, Eliza R.

Additionally, the Pioneer (characterized as [...] "Pioneer Pete") is Lehi High School's mascot. Lehi High School is located in Lehi, Utah County. In some places, Mormons hold an event called [...] "Pioneer Trek" [...] {{for people who are}} ages fourteen to eighteen. In participating in the trek, the youth dress as pioneers and pack a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> carry in handcarts. They go on a hike for a couple days so they can experience what the pioneers experienced. During this multi-day event, camp organizers sometimes require youth to avoid the use of technology or anything that the pioneers did not have on their journeys, to enhance the experience.|$|E
