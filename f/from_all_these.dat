5|$|A. b. caama (Saint-Hilaire, 1803) : Known {{as the red}} {{hartebeest}} or Cape hartebeest. Formerly {{occurred in}} southern Angola; northern and eastern savannahs of Namibia; central, southern and southwestern Botswana; Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Free State, Northwest and Gauteng provinces and western KwaZulu-Natal of South Africa. Presently has been eliminated <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> areas except Northern Cape, central and southwestern Botswana and Namibia. Major re-introductions {{have taken place in}} these countries. The population of this hartebeest is on the rise.|$|E

25|$|The {{vestibular}} {{system is}} {{the region of the}} inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the cochlea. The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in view when the head is moved. Joint and muscle receptors are also important in maintaining balance. The brain receives, interprets, and processes the information <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> systems to create the sensation of balance.|$|E

25|$|Over time, the {{approach}} of the Tosafists spread to other Jewish communities, particularly those in Spain. This led to the composition of many other commentaries in similar styles. Among these are the commentaries of Nachmanides (Ramban), Solomon ben Adret (Rashba), Yom Tov of Seville (Ritva) and Nissim of Gerona (Ran). A comprehensive anthology consisting of extracts <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> is the Shittah Mekubbetzet of Bezalel Ashkenazi.|$|E

25|$|The PDU {{favored a}} centralist administration, pushed for Romanianization in public life, and was {{generally}} {{hostile to the}} centrifugal tendencies of other communities, primarily Ukrainians, Germans, Poles and Jews. These together formed a relative majority of Bukovina's population, and Nistor's agenda met with sustained opposition from {{all sides of the}} region's political spectrum, although the PDU was successful in rallying to its cause some individuals <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> communities. In addition, the PDU clashed with the moderate or autonomist Bukovinan Romanians, whose leaders were Aurel Onciul and Iancu Flondor.|$|E

25|$|POJOROSA is {{the acronym}} {{representing}} the alliance between Pope John Senior High School and Minor Seminary and St. Roses Senior High School. This alliance {{has been made}} manifest in the marriages of alumni of the two schools. Teachers from St. Roses have taught in Pojoss and vice versa. Alumni from Pojoss have also returned the gesture and taught in St. Roses. Annual programmes organized by the two schools are often well attended by students of the schools {{as a gesture of}} the friendliness they bear each other. Apart <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these,</b> Pope John and Saint Roses share the same heritage in their founding fathers, the SVD missionaries.|$|E

In 1779, Ann Bleecker was forced (it is unclear whether due to British troop activity, Native American activity, or some other reason) to flee with her surviving daughter to Albany again. But further trauma was yet to come. On hearing in 1781 that her husband had been captured by Loyalist forces or possibly [...] "a band of wandering British soldiers", she suffered a miscarriage and nervous breakdown. Ann Bleecker never fully recovered <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> traumatic events.

PewDiePie later uploaded a short video apologizing for the language he used during the live-stream, expressing [...] "I'm not going to make any excuses to why it did because there are no excuses for it.

500|$|As {{a younger}} son, Gebhard was {{prepared}} early for an ecclesiastical career. He received a broad, Humanist education, learned several languages, including Latin, Italian, French, and German, and studied history and theology. After studying at the universities of Dillingen, Ingolstadt, Perugia, Louvain and elsewhere, {{he began his}} ecclesiastical career in 1560at Augsburg, serving as prebendary in the Cathedral church. His life at Augsburg caused some scandal; Uncle Otto, the archbishop, petitioned the Duke of Bavaria to remonstrate with Gebhard about his conduct, which apparently led to some improvement in his behavior. [...] In 1561, he became a deacon at the cathedral in Cologne (1561–77), a canon of St. Gereon in Köln (1562–67), a canon in Strassburg (1567), in Ellwangen (1567–83), and in Würzburg (1569–70). In 1571, he became deacon of the Strassburg Cathedral, a position he held {{until his death in}} 1601. In 1576, by papal nomination, he became provost of the Cathedral in Augsburg. He would have drawn a stipend <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> positions.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with London's 95.8 Capital FM radio station, Gaga further elaborated on {{the changes in the}} show. She said that the show was constructed like a piece of musical theater. It also incorporated a number of contemporary and old musical pieces, some of them being re-recorded specifically for the show itself. A new keytar was constructed for the show and was named Emma. The instrument was created by the Haus of Gaga and the singer said, [...] "We have this new instrument that I brought to the Brits tonight, 'Emma', which is what I was playing on the stage. She's a hybrid <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> other instruments." [...] During {{an interview}} on KISS-FM with Ryan Seacrest, on his show On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Gaga explained that the concert tour was still called Monster Ball, but it had become more of a musical and less of a concert. It had a New York theme at its core; telling a story where Gaga and her friends traveled to the Monster Ball, but got lost.|$|E
500|$|Fifteen shipyards {{from the}} United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy began bidding on the battleships. Diplomatic {{pressure}} {{to give the}} contracts was brought to bear <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> countries, especially the first three. Even with this assistance, industry leaders in the United States believed {{that they had no}} chance in the bidding without active cooperation from their government, as Europe was the traditional arms supplier to Argentina (and to all of South America). Even when this was given, including the removal of import tariffs on hides from Argentina, promises for additional concessions if American shipbuilders were selected, and an offer to include the most technologically advanced fire-control system and torpedo tubes available on the Argentine battleships, the United States was widely viewed as a non-contender. Historian Seward W. Livermore remarked that [...] "opposition to the United States was formidable. The naval commission was pro-British; the vice-president of the republic, Roque Sáenz Peña, favored Italy, where he had been the Argentine envoy for many years; and the minister of war wanted the contracts to go to Germany, so as to standardize the military and naval equipment of the country." ...|$|E
500|$|Like other ABC shows, Quantico has a racially-diverse cast (allowing {{viewers to}} relate {{to at least one}} character) as FBI {{recruits}} who deal with their individual problems. Safran had wanted the show to be diverse from the beginning, saying: [...] "You’re not just watching people who have struggled to achieve places of power and they’re there. This show is about the struggle to achieve that. Their politics and their racial makeup and their religious backgrounds are very important to their characterizations and who they are. I really am interested in looking at how every culture handles stress — and in particular, how people <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> different backgrounds find their place in the FBI, an agency that has historically fraught relationships with gay people and people of color." [...] The first actor cast in the series was Tate Ellington, as FBI trainee Simon Asher. Graham Rogers was then cast as another FBI trainee, Caleb Hass. It was announced that Aunjanue Ellis had signed to play Miranda Shaw, assistant director and training supervisor of the academy. Dougray Scott was then cast as Liam O'Connor, Miranda's former partner and current subordinate.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene where}} Walter confronts the chimera {{was shot in}} a Boston sewer. He and Peter carry 50 caliber Desert Eagle handguns, called [...] "monster killers" [...] by one prop crew member. While shooting, the actors had to use their imagination, as the CGI monster was not yet complete. Director Brad Anderson {{described}} the chimera [...] "sort of an amalgam of a bat, lion, and a dragon". Anderson called the scene between Walter and the chimera as a [...] "triumphant moment" [...] for Walter, and actor Joshua Jackson characterized the scene as Walter's [...] "action hero moment". The actor himself, John Noble, described the scene with the chimera as [...] "terrifying", as his character [...] "tries to be a hero". Andrew Orloff, Zoic’s Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor later called the chimera effect the most difficult effect he'd done for the show thus far. Sound editor Thomas Harris explained that because the episode had a monster that was [...] "part lizard, part wasp, part bat, and part lion," [...] {{it was difficult to}} [...] "manipulate sounds <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> animals, as well as other sweeteners, without getting muddy and meshing together". Their efforts on the episode were ultimately nominated in several categories at the Golden Reel Awards, and at the HPA Awards, for which they won.|$|E
500|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. Prior to 1969 there was no official singles chart; however, The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums regard the canonical sources as New Musical Express (NME) before 10 March 1960 and Record Retailer from then until 15 February 1969 when Retailer and the BBC jointly commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile the charts. The choice to use Record Retailer as the canonical source for the 1960s has been contentious because NME (which continued compiling charts beyond March 1960) had the biggest circulation of periodicals in the decade and was more widely followed. As well as the chart compilers mentioned previously, Melody Maker, Disc and Record Mirror all compiled their own charts during the decade. Due {{to the lack of}} any official chart the BBC aggregated results <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> charts to announce its own Pick of the Pops chart. One source explains that the reason for using the Record Retailer chart for the 1960s was that it was [...] "the only chart to have as many as 50 positions for almost the entire decade". The sample size of Record Retailer in the early 1960s was around 30 stores whereas NME and Melody Maker were sampling over 100 stores. In 1969, the first BMRB chart was compiled using postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops.|$|E
500|$|On 4 November 1794, Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer {{replaced}} the ill Dumerbion as army commander. Schérer wrote that Sérurier was [...] "a very good officer, {{devoted to his}} duties; his patriotism has been attacked {{in the time of}} Hébert and his consorts; he has emerged victorious <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> charges. In my opinion he is worthy of the post he holds on the right of the active army." [...] Sérurier's promotion was not confirmed until 13 June 1795. The Austro-Sardinian commander Joseph Nikolaus De Vins attacked the French lines on 24 June. Most of the assaults failed but since a few positions were captured and could not be retaken, the French withdrew from Vado to Borghetto Santo Spirito by 5 July. In the new line, Masséna with 14,000 troops held the coast while Sérurier and 6,000 men defended Ormea. On 5 July Sérurier reported that a key position had been partly lost, causing consternation at army headquarters. Later that day he reported that one of his brigadiers, Louis Pelletier, retook the position. Curiously, this incident did not count against him; instead Sérurier was given command of the left wing in place of Garnier. On the evening of 31 August, his headquarters at Saint-Martin-Vésubie was surrounded by the enemy. Though only 318 soldiers were at hand, Sérurier resisted successfully until early the following morning when he attacked and scattered his attackers, capturing 86 of them. The enemy commander, the émigré Chevalier Bonnaud committed suicide. Not only was he a good soldier, but Sérurier's troops liked him, he treated the local civilians with decency and his diplomacy allowed him to serve as a link between his army and the neighboring Army of the Alps. François Christophe Kellermann then in command of both armies, wrote, [...] "It is to the coolness and courage of this excellent officer that was due the success of this glorious day." ...|$|E
