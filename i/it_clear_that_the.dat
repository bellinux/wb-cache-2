5|$|Resistance to the German {{occupiers}} {{began in}} Belgium {{in the winter}} of 1940, after the German defeat in the Battle of Britain made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war was not lost for the Allies. Involvement in illegal resistance activity was a decision made by a minority of Belgians (approximately five percent of the population) but many more were involved in passive resistance. If captured, resistance members risked torture and execution, and around 17,000 were killed during the occupation.|$|E

5|$|Bede {{described}} Aldfrith as a scholar, and {{his interest}} in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede also makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated {{from the time of}} Aldfrith's death.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted Bede's report of Coenred's and Offa's abdications, but Barbara Yorke {{has suggested that}} they may not have relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery. On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then the apparently friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his overlord, makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship between an overlord and his underking was not hostile in every case.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights.

Section 2(2) of the Act makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E

5|$|The Chronicle is not unbiased: {{there are}} {{occasions}} when {{comparison with other}} medieval sources makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, the Chronicle {{is the single most}} important historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Vlaams Blok seized {{the occasion of the}} ban to dissolve the party, and start afresh under a new name. Five days later, on 14 November, the Vlaams Blok disbanded itself, and a new party with the name Vlaams Belang was established. (Other proposed names included the Flemish People's Party and Flemish Freedom Front.) The new party instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating some of the more extreme positions of the former Vlaams Blok. Nevertheless, the party leadership made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party would fundamentally remain the same.|$|E
5|$|After {{a search}} {{that had taken}} several years, Wheeler was able to secure a {{premises}} for the Institute of Archaeology: St. John's Lodge in Regent's Park, central London. Left empty since its use as a hospital during the First World War, the building was owned by the Crown and was controlled by the First Commissioner of Works, William Ormsby-Gore; he was very sympathetic to archaeology, and leased the building to the Institute at a low rent. The St. John's Lodge premises were officially opened on 29 April 1937. During his speech at the ceremony, the University of London's Vice-Chancellor Charles Reed Peers made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> building was only intended as a temporary home for the Institute, which it was hoped {{would be able to}} move to Bloomsbury, the city's academic hub. In his speech, the university's Chancellor, Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, compared the new institution to both the Institute of Historical Research and the Courtauld Institute of Art.|$|E

5|$|Although Bede's {{narrative}} is widely accepted, an alternative chronology {{has been proposed}} by D.P. Kirby. Kirby points out that Boniface's letter to Æthelburg makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> news of Eadbald's conversion is recent, {{and that it is}} unthinkable that Boniface would not have been kept {{up to date on the}} status of Eadbald's conversion. Hence Eadbald must have been converted by Justus, as is implied by Boniface's letter to Justus. The pallium accompanying that letter indicates Justus was archbishop by that time, and the duration of Mellitus's archiepiscopate means that even if Bede's dates are somewhat wrong in other particulars, Eadbald was converted no earlier than 621, and no later than April 624, since Mellitus consecrated a church for Eadbald before his death in that month. The account of Laurence's miraculous scourging by St Peter can be disregarded as a later hagiographical invention of the monastery of St Augustine.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the main}} {{military}} leaders on the border to Scotland, Harclay became frustrated with Edward II's inactivity, particularly the humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322, which made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war could not be won. Harclay initiated negotiations with the Scots on his own accord, and on 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce. The act was without royal sanction, and amounted to treason. The king issued an arrest order for the earl, and on 25 February Harclay was taken into the king's custody. He was arraigned before royal justices on 3 March, denied a hearing, and executed the same day. He was hanged, drawn and quartered, and the various parts of his body displayed {{in different parts of the}} country. Only after five years was he allowed a proper burial, but the conviction for treason was never annulled.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tim Newark unraveled {{the myth}} {{in his book}} Mafia Allies. A version that is {{probably}} {{closer to the truth}} is that Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. He quotes local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini was taken to a command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out in a stream of obscenities. Vizzini was utterly embarrassed by the incident and ordered his interpreter not to tell anybody what had happened.|$|E

5|$|Judging {{relationships}} {{based on}} shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently. Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation {{similar to those}} of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two groups are not closely related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The expedition was now perilously short of fresh water, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull {{close to the}} shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the Spanish spotted the Maya city of Campeche. A large contingent put ashore to fill their water casks. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. Once inside the city, the Maya leaders made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Spanish would be killed {{if they did not}} withdraw immediately. The Spanish party retreated in defensive formation to the safety of the ships.|$|E
5|$|The French {{reaction}} to this flurry of reforms was mixed, however. The very zeal of the program might betoken a renascent nationalism that could work against French interests. The debacle of the Battle of Trafalgar had made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> projected invasion had to be scrapped. The Dutch now began to clamor for economies {{in the form of}} the return of the Boulogne flotilla, which annoyed Napoleon, because he still had a use for it. The man who had led that flotilla to Boulogne Carel Hendrik Ver Huell, was now Secretary for the Navy. He had also become a confidant of the emperor, and now engaged in a secret correspondence with Talleyrand and Napoleon. The latter had just concluded the Peace of Pressburg and was busy dividing up Europe in client-kingdoms apportioned to his relatives. He saw a good candidate for such a position in the Netherlands in his brother Louis Bonaparte.|$|E

5|$|The low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP, {{which stood}} for Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile, was {{designed}} by the Montreal Laboratory, {{and became the first}} nuclear reactor to operate in Western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO, a 6 MW research reactor designed by AERE, on 3 July 1948. Because heavy water was unavailable in Britain, BEPO was designed and built as a graphite-moderated reactor. Harwell was involved in the design of reactors at Windscale, and the chemical separation plant there. The passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States' atomic research. This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. Cockcroft helped negotiate a new, more informal and unsigned agreement with the Americans that was announced on 7 January 1948, known as the Modus Vivendi. The renewed cooperation that he hoped for under the agreement proved illusory. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The presidential {{elections}} of May 1989 were marred by fraud and violence. COLINA, a pro-military coalition {{led by the}} PRD, named Carlos Duque, a former business partner of Noriega as its candidate. ADOC, an opposition coalition, nominated Guillermo Endara, a member of Arias' Panameñista Party, and two other prominent oppositionists, Ricardo Arias Calderón and Guillermo Ford, as vice-presidential candidates. Anticipating fraud, the opposition tracked ballot counts at local precincts {{on the day of}} the election (local ballot counts were done in public). As an exit poll made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> opposition slate was winning by a wide margin, reports of missing tally sheets and seizures of ballot boxes by PDF soon emerged. In the afternoon of the day after the election, the Catholic Bishops conference announced that a quick count of public tallies at polling centers showed the opposition slate winning 3-to-1. Official tallies the day after that, however, had Duque winning by a 2–1 margin.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier {{under the direction}} of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material. He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E
