5|$|Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is the series' protagonist. Tony {{is one of}} the capos (and the {{unofficial}} underboss) of the New Jersey-based DiMeo crime family, {{at the beginning of the}} series; he eventually becomes its undisputed boss. He is also the patriarch of the Soprano household. Throughout the series, Tony struggles to balance the conflicting requirements of his family wife Carmela, daughter Meadow, son A. J., and mother Liviawith those of the Mafia family <b>he</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E
5|$|At an eco {{hotel in}} the desert, Greene tells Medrano that now <b>he</b> <b>controls</b> the {{majority}} of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills {{the chief of police}} (Fernando Guillén Cuervo) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.|$|E
5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a portable computer and a visor that <b>he</b> <b>controls</b> demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and the visor {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the city of Los Angeles, in the year 1947, with players {{assuming}} the role of Los Angeles Police Department officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps. The game starts with Phelps as a uniformed patrolman, and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives players a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns players with cases that they must solve. After each case, players receive a rating of 1–5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, players can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps' war memories. Near the end of the final desk, players assume control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the player character for {{most of the rest of}} the game; although different in appearance and personality, <b>he</b> <b>controls</b> identically to Phelps.|$|E
25|$|Khamenei {{was one of}} Iran's leaders {{during the}} Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, and {{developed}} close ties with the now-powerful Revolutionary Guards which <b>he</b> <b>controls,</b> and whose commanders are elected and dismissed by him. The Revolutionary Guards {{have been used to}} suppress opposition to Khamenei.|$|E
25|$|Tragedians: {{travelling}} {{with the}} Player, including Alfred. They provide a chorus {{for the audience}} and react to specific things that the player says.

25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power. <b>He</b> <b>controls</b> everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it. He decides what the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders to hammer out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E
25|$|Indirectly, the Act {{enhanced}} the already dominant position of Prime Minister in the constitutional hierarchy. Although the Lords are still {{involved in the}} legislative process and the Prime Minister must still guide legislation through both Houses, the Lords {{no longer have the}} power to veto or even delay enactment of legislation passed by the Commons. Provided that <b>he</b> <b>controls</b> the Cabinet, maintains party discipline, and commands a majority in the Commons, the Prime Minister is assured of putting through his legislative agenda.|$|E
25|$|The Authority is {{the first}} angel to have emerged from Dust. <b>He</b> <b>controls</b> the Church, an oppressive {{religious}} institution. He told the later-arriving angels that he created them and the universe, {{but this is a}} lie. Although {{he is one of the}} two primary adversaries in the trilogy — Lord Asriel is his primary opponent — he remains in the background; he makes his only appearance late in The Amber Spyglass. The Authority has grown weak and transferred most of his powers to his regent, Metatron. He is extremely aged, fragile and naive.|$|E

25|$|Both Monserrate and Espada faced {{accusations of}} {{unethical}} or criminal conduct. Monserrate was indicted for felony assault in March {{and would have}} automatically lost his seat if convicted. New York, like most states, has a provision in its state constitution which bars convicted felons from holding office. (Monseratte would be acquitted of the felonies, but was convicted on misdemeanors.) Espada {{was the target of}} a state investigation into whether he funded his campaign with money siphoned from a nonprofit health care agency <b>he</b> <b>controls.</b> The Bronx County District Attorney's office was also investigating charges that Espada actually resided in Mamaroneck, Westchester County rather than the north Bronx district he represented.|$|E
25|$|The bowler pre-sets the {{location}} of the bowling mechanism {{at the edge of the}} pitch. The bowler loads the ball onto the release mechanism (spring or gravity controlled), whereupon the ball rolls towards the batsman. The batsman has to pre-set the angle of the face of the bat shown, and {{the location}} of the batting mechanism. <b>He</b> <b>controls</b> the power and timing of the shot in real time. After hitting the bat, the ball may roll and rest in one of the marked run zones on the playing carpet (in which case the batsman obtains runs), or be channelled into the base of a fielder's statuette (in which case the batsman is deemed out caught). The batsman could also be out bowled (inc. played on) or hit wicket. Wides and byes may also be scored.|$|E
500|$|The Dragonlord is {{a dragon}} who rules from Charlock Castle, which is visible from Tantegel Castle, the game's {{starting}} point. His soul became evil by learning magic. Rumors say that, through a spy network, he knows {{everything that happens}} in Alefgard. He seeks [...] "unlimited power and destruction", which results in {{a rising tide of}} evil throughout Alefgard. The Dragonlord wants to enslave the world with his army of monsters that <b>he</b> <b>controls</b> with his will.|$|E

50|$|The {{reign of}} Omaha {{political}} boss Tom Dennison ended in 1933. For more than thirty-five years, <b>he</b> <b>controlled</b> gambling, drinking, prostitution and other criminal interests throughout Omaha, particularly in his seedy Sporting District. <b>He</b> <b>controlled</b> bootlegging operations in Little Italy through the Prohibition Era. He was closely allied with James Dahlman, Omaha's only eight-term mayor. Dennison was implicated in agitation of groups {{related to the}} Omaha Race Riot of 1919.|$|R

500|$|Using {{fighting}} skills Yotoriyama {{described as}} [...] "horrific splendor", Necrid attacks using Maleficus, a transforming, physical {{manifestation of the}} energy in Soul Edge. <b>He</b> <b>controls</b> Maleficus by channeling it through his hands to form various bladed weapons, able to set them aside or reabsorb them as needed. Necrid can also attack using other forms of energy, such as ignis fatuus, æther, and chaos, represented in game as equipable alternate weapons with varying effects and attributes. Necrid also incorporates acrobatics into his fighting style {{through a variety of}} flips and kicks.|$|E
500|$|According to Scotland on Sunday, Gunn {{suffers from}} {{ankylosing}} spondylitis, [...] "a rheumatic spinal condition", diagnosed in about 1995, [...] "which <b>he</b> <b>controls</b> with medication". He appeared in an ITV2 celebrity football quiz called [...] "Taking the Pitch" [...] in 1998, alongside singer Fish. Gunn's autobiography—In Where it Hurts—was published in 2006, {{and includes a}} foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson. He said of writing the book, [...] "it brought {{up a lot of}} good memories and a lot of awkward memories". The book was described by The Times as [...] "shot through with sharp humour and astute observation". The publishers agreed to donate £1 to Gunn's Leukaemia appeal fund for every book sold.|$|E
500|$|With {{the support}} of the Democratic {{political}} organization, Daley was elected to the Illinois Senate, serving from 1972 to 1980. State Senator Daley rarely spoke to reporters and didn't hold a news conference for six years. Daley chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. Daley was named one of Illinois' ten worst state legislators by Chicago Magazine [...] "for arrogance, for sharklike qualities, for living off his father's name, and for pulling puppet strings attached to some of the worst members of the Senate." [...] He was considered [...] "too shrewd {{to be one of the}} worst, but <b>he</b> <b>controls</b> so many of the worst senators that he belongs on the list to represent all of them." [...] After the Spring 1975 state legislative session, Chicago Democrat Dawn Clark Netsch, who served with Daley as Illinois Constitutional Convention delegates and as State Senators, blamed [...] "dirty little Richie" [...] for frustrating her good government legislative agenda in the state legislature.|$|E

500|$|Ellsworth Monkton Toohey is Roark's antagonist. He is Rand's {{personification}} of evilthe most active and self-aware villain {{in any of}} her novels. Toohey is a socialist, and represents the spirit of collectivism more generally. He styles himself as representative of {{the will of the}} masses, but his actual desire is for power over others. <b>He</b> <b>controls</b> individual victims by destroying their sense of self-worth, and seeks broader power (over [...] "the world", as he declares to Keating in a moment of candor) by promoting the ideals of ethical altruism and a rigorous egalitarianism that treats all people and achievements as equally valuable. Rand used her memory of the British democratic socialist Harold Laski to help her imagine what Toohey would do in a given situation. She attended a New York lecture by Laski as part of gathering material for the novel, following which she changed the physical appearance of the character to be similar to that of Laski. New York intellectuals Lewis Mumford and Clifton Fadiman also helped inspire the character.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri muses that Valhalla must {{be quite}} crowded, to which High {{responds}} {{by stating that}} Valhalla is massive and remains roomy despite {{the large amount of}} inhabitants, and then quotes Grímnismál stanza 23. In chapter 41, Gangleri says that Odin seems to be quite a powerful lord, as <b>he</b> <b>controls</b> quite a big army, but he yet wonders how the Einherjar keep themselves busy when they are not drinking. High replies that daily, after they've dressed and put on their war gear, they go out to the courtyard and battle one another in one-on-one combat for sport. Then, when mealtime comes, they ride home to Valhalla and drink. High then quotes Vafþrúðnismál stanza 41. In chapter 42, High describes that, [...] "right at the beginning, when the gods were settling" [...] they had established Asgard and then built Valhalla. The death of the god Baldr is recounted in chapter 49, where the mistletoe that is used to kill Baldr is described as growing west of Valhalla.|$|E
500|$|Hausmann {{says the}} film [...] "explicitly affirms the {{importance}} of upholding the prohibition against incest"; a recurring theme of Ball's work is his comparison of the taboos against incest and homosexuality. Instead of making an overt distinction, American Beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence. Col. Fitts is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester. Ball said, [...] "The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what [...] can do." [...] The film implies two unfulfilled incestuous desires: Lester's pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter, while Col. Fitts' repression is exhibited through the almost sexualized discipline with which <b>he</b> <b>controls</b> Ricky. Consequently, Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual, while Angela's vulnerability and submission to Lester reminds him of his responsibilities {{and the limits of}} his fantasy. Col. Fitts represents Ball's father, whose repressed homosexual desires led to his own unhappiness. Ball rewrote Col. Fitts to delay revealing him as homosexual, which Munt reads as a possible [...] "deferment of Ball's own patriarchal-incest fantasies".|$|E
