No other South American rainforest muroid rodent is known to have a similar distribution. Musser and colleagues reported it from three locations and Patton and others added a fourth; <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> it occurs together with E.macconnelli or Hylaeamys megacephalus.|$|E
5|$|Stigand {{may have}} been in charge of the royal administration. He may also have been behind the effort to locate Edward the Atheling and his brother Edmund after 1052, {{possibly}} to secure a more acceptable heir to King Edward. His landholdings were spread across ten counties, and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> counties, his lands were larger than the king's holdings. Although Norman propagandists claimed that as early as 1051 or 1052 King Edward promised the throne of England to Duke William of Normandy, who later became King William the Conqueror, there is little contemporary evidence of such a promise from non-Norman sources. By 1053, Edward probably realised that he would not have a son from his marriage, and he and his advisors began to search for an heir. Edward the Atheling, the son of King Edmund Ironside (reigned 1016), had been exiled from England in 1017, after his father's death. Although Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester, went to the Continent in search of Edward the Exile, Ian Walker, the biographer of King Harold Godwinson, feels that Stigand was behind the effort. In the end, although Edward did return to England, he died soon after his return, leaving a young son Edgar the Ætheling.|$|E

25|$|Because the Festival Express tour {{turned out}} to be a {{complete}} financial disaster, the film project was shelved soon afterwards, as the promoters sued the filmmakers, and the footage mysteriously disappeared. Some of the film's reels turned up in the garage of the original producer Willem Poolman, where they had been stored for decades and used at various times as goal posts for ball hockey games played by his son Gavin. The plan to resurrect the film was started in 1999 by executive producer Garth Douglas and story consultant James Cullingham, who found many more reels in the Canadian National Film Archives vault, where it had been kept in pristine condition and unknown to the world. Garth got in touch with Gavin, who had grown up to become a London-based film producer. Gavin produced the film together with his old high school friend John Trapman (who had played <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> ball hockey games), and Bob Smeaton, double Grammy Award-winning director of The Beatles Anthology was brought on board. The music tracks were mixed at Toronto's MetalWorks Studios, and produced by Eddie Kramer, Jimi Hendrix's producer, and engineer for Led Zeppelin, Woodstock, and Derek & The Dominos Live In Concert.|$|E
25|$|It is {{discovered}} that {{consumption of the}} spice melange {{has the effect of}} both bolstering immunity to the retrovirus and stopping its progression <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> already infected. Omnius, unaware that the virus has been effectively stopped, prepares for the second phase of its attack. Gathering the bulk of the machine armies stationed at the different synchronized planets, the evermind launches the massive fleet towards the League capital Salusa Secundus. After learning of the imminent destruction headed their way {{in the form of the}} machine fleet, Vorian Atreides formulates a plan whereby the humans can launch pulse-atomic attacks on all of the undefended Synchronized Worlds, ridding the universe of Omnius altogether. However, this plan called for the use of the still unreliable space-folding technology in order to carry out the attacks before the machines have a chance to recall the fleet en route to Salusa. The Great Purge is successful in destroying Omnius on all but one planet, albeit with an appalling cost in human lives because each planet was turned into slag, and while all the machines were obliterated, all the captured humans and slaves on these planets were also killed. Each time the human armies fold space to a new location there is a 10% attrition rate due to the undependable space-folders because of the uncertainty principle. In all, it amounted to billions of lives lost. The humans are also unable to destroy Omnius on the primary synchronized world, Corrin. While the other Evermind incarnations are being attacked, the cogitor Vidad travels to Corrin and warns Corrin-Omnius of the human counter-offensive. The machine fleet is recalled to defend their last remaining stronghold. Despite this, Serena Butler’s Jihad is declared over. The Great Purge ended with an impasse between humans and thinking machines on the planet Corrin. While unable to destroy the machines, the human army is able to trap them on Corrin by surrounding the planet with a net of scrambler satellites, so that any thinking machine attempting to leave would have its gelcircuitry mind destroyed. This situation continues for almost 20 years with the machines unable to escape, and most humans unwilling to enter another battle.|$|E

500|$|Through the {{overwhelming}} insistence {{of the blind}} pupils, Braille's system was finally adopted by the Institute in 1854, two years after his death. The system spread throughout the French-speaking world, but was slower to expand in other places. However, {{by the time of}} the first all-European conference of teachers of the blind in 1873, the cause of braille was championed by Dr. Thomas Rhodes Armitage and thereafter its international use increased rapidly. By 1882, Dr. Armitage was able to report that [...] "There is now probably no institution in the civilized world where braille is not used except <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in North America." [...] Eventually even these holdouts relented: braille was officially adopted by schools for the blind in the United States in 1916, and a universal braille code for English was formalized in 1932.|$|E

2500|$|All of the {{previously}} published stories in Bishop's UrNu sequence, along with a new novella, [...] "Death Rehearsals", are contained in Catacomb Years, a fix-up published in 1979 by Berkley/Putnam. [...] Bishop also wrote new connecting material and provided a timeline. Spider Robinson's comments on the book's structure: [...] "Plainly [...] intended the Domed City to be a metaphor for something or other…and it probably worked just fine <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> individual novelettes, where an emotionally involving story made you overlook a shaky premise. [...] But the [...] "novel" [...] has no emotional continuity… There are a few marvelous stories in this book, and one superb one , but they are ruined by a setting which exposes their worst weaknesses." [...] Robert Frazier strongly disagrees: [...] "Catacomb Years is not a rough sculpture with visible seams and weak welds; it is a polished puzzle entity a la Miguel Berrocal." [...] Author Elizabeth Lynn was equally impressed: [...] "Bishop takes his wildly diverse plot elements…and weaves them into a shining and almost seamless tapestry… The material, {{to those who have}} read the pieces as they appeared…will be familiar and friendly. [...] But set against each other they acquire new significance and a new luster. [...] Bishop's skill at characterization is impressive, as is his ability to juggle his cast and his numerous subplots." ...|$|E
2500|$|Four RCMP officers, Constables Gerry Rundel, Bill Bentley, Kwesi Millington, and {{supervisor}} Corporal Benjamin Robinson, {{arrived and}} entered the Customs room where Dziekański was pacing about. They apparently directed him to stand near a counter, to which Dziekański complied but picked up a stapler sometime after being told to place his hands on a counter. Shortly thereafter, about 25 seconds after arriving at the scene, Corporal Robinson ordered the Taser to be used. Constable Millington tasered Dziekański. He began to convulse and was tasered several more times after falling to the ground, where the four officers pinned, handcuffed, and continued to taser him. One eyewitness, who recorded the incident on her cellphone, told CBC News that Dziekański had been tasered four times. [...] "The third and fourth ones were at the same time" [...] delivered by the officers at Dziekański's right and left, just before Dziekański fell. According to B.C. Crown counsel spokesman Stan Lowe, Dziekański was tasered {{a total of five}} times. Constable Millington testified that he deployed the Taser four times, but he believed that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> instances the probes may not have contacted Dziekański's body. Dziekański writhed and screamed before he stopped moving. Cpl. Benjamin Monty Robinson stated he then checked for a pulse, but his heart had stopped. [...] Testimony from the other RCMP officers state they never saw anyone including Robinson check for a pulse. Dziekański did not receive CPR until paramedics arrived on the scene approximately 15 minutes later. They were unable to revive him and pronounced him dead at the scene.|$|E
