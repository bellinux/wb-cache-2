5|$|The line started {{construction}} in 1884, and rapid transit {{service on the}} line started on February 23, 1886. Passenger service ended on March 31, 1953, and freight service ended by 1989. In 2005, freight service on the western portion of the line was reactivated, and there are proposals to reactivate the former passenger line <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> or bus service.|$|E

50|$|As governor-elect, Kasich lobbied {{the federal}} {{government}} to use $400 million in federal dollars allocated <b>for</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>for</b> freight <b>rail</b> projects instead. In a November 2010 letter to Kasich, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood wrote that the federal funding was specifically allocated by the 2009 economic stimulus act <b>for</b> high-speed <b>rail,</b> and could not be used for other purposes. In a December 2010 meeting with President Barack Obama, Kasich again unsuccessfully lobbied to use the grant money <b>for</b> freight <b>rail</b> rather than high-speed rail.|$|R

5|$|Victoria {{does not}} have a {{dominant}} mining base as with other states, and has traditionally been more dependent on agriculture <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> freight traffic. By the 1990s road transport had captured most general freight traffic, with an average of only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried each year between 1996 and 1998; containers being the major cargo, followed by cement, logs, quarry products and steel.|$|E
5|$|Accessibility to Odense {{was greatly}} {{increased}} when the ferry service {{between the two}} main Danish islands, Zealand and Funen, {{was replaced by the}} Great Belt Bridge – opened in 1997 <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> traffic, 1998 for road traffic. When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the Great Belt Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take as little as an hour and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|After work on UB-10 was {{complete}} at the Weser yard, she was readied <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down {{into what was}} essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{all three}} routes had their {{operations}} {{taken over by}} the MTA Bus Company brand of MTA Regional Bus Operations. The Q53 originally was a premium fare service, with a long nonstop segment between Rego Park to Broad Channel, as it was a replacement service <b>for</b> <b>rail.</b> Soon after the MTA's takeover of the route, it was converted to be a limited-stop service, with six stops along the corridor. Subsequently, the Q21 was extended up Woodhaven Boulevard, and its southern terminus in the Rockaways was switched. Increased ridership resulted {{in the creation of the}} Q21 Limited, which was soon replaced by the Q52 Limited, which replaced Q21 service south of Howard Beach.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> traffic, it proved to be a challenge for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was dangerous for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E
5|$|The Scotswood, Newburn and Wylam Railway (SN) {{supplied}} the North station, trains reaching the power station via a junction at Newburn. Despite the SN's closure on 11 March 1968, and the rerouting of the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway through Dunston in 1982, the track between Scotswood and Newburn was retained for supplying the North station, {{as well as}} <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> access to the neighbouring Ever Ready battery factory and Anglo Great Lakes Graphite Plant. The tracks outlived the power stations, and were finally lifted when the Ever Ready factory shut down in 1992. Part of the line serving the station is now a well-used section of the Hadrian's Way National Trail.|$|E
50|$|In July 2006 a Siemens Velaro train-set (AVE S-103) reached 403.7 km/h. At that time, {{this was}} the world record <b>for</b> <b>railed</b> and unmodified {{commercial}} service trainsets.|$|R
50|$|Besides the Griffen Gun and the Phoenix Column, {{the company}} {{produced}} iron <b>for</b> <b>rails</b> <b>for</b> the Pennsylvania Railroad and other eastern railroad lines, wrought iron for fencing and home decorative usage, and similar applications, {{as well as}} steel products. The Eiffel Tower in Paris used puddled iron from Phoenixville.|$|R
50|$|Amtrak {{currently}} {{does not}} serve the area. Proposals <b>for</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> in New York have included a route from Binghamton to New York City through Scranton, Pennsylvania, a route that {{could at least}} partially be upgraded <b>for</b> high-speed <b>rail.</b> As of 2011, the highest priority <b>for</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> projects in New York is in the Empire Corridor, of which no part crosses the Southern Tier. The hilly terrain of the Southern Tier's I-86 corridor is not ideal <b>for</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> service, especially compared to the relatively flat and straight land in the Empire Corridor.|$|R
5|$|The bus tunnel was {{originally}} intended to be converted for use by light rail trains {{at some point in}} the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, a move that would later make them unusable <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> service.|$|E
5|$|The first streetcars {{appeared}} in 1889 and {{were instrumental in}} the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|The six-boat {{group that}} {{included}} UB-43 and UB-47 was ordered in July 1915, and both boats {{had been laid}} down in early September. This group was selected by the German Admiralstab for deployment to the Mediterranean, but, unlike the smaller UB I boats, they could not as easily be transported overland by rail. Weser prepared the boats <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> shipment by cutting the boat sections longitudinally, and sent all the materials, along with German shipyard workers, to Pola, where the boats were reassembled. UB-43 was launched in early April 1916, while UB-47 followed in June.|$|E

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 {{as part of}} the Program for Action, but was not actually implemented for almost three decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> links to New York City airports during this time. Serious planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990. An environmental impact statement for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death during one of the system's test runs.|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> carriages with the grain harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E
5|$|Plans <b>for</b> <b>rail</b> transit {{have existed}} since the 1970s, {{following}} the 1965 {{closing of the}} Bergen Tramway. A rapid transit design was first discarded, and in the 1990s a light rail line was proposed. The decision to start construction was made in 2005. The first stage was built by the municipality, with financing {{from the state and}} the toll road ring, based on the Bergen Program. Ownership, maintenance and further extensions and vehicles are the responsibility of Hordaland County Municipality through its wholly owned subsidiary Bybanen AS. Operation is governed by public service obligation contracts issued by the county public transport authority Skyss. From 2010 to 2017 the line and its 20 Variotrams will be operated by Keolis Norge (formerly Fjord1 Partner).|$|E
