5000|$|In {{order to}} promote a more {{balanced}} trade relationship, China will continue {{to take steps to}} expand domestic consumption and imports in accordance with the 12th Five-Year Plan; and the United States will increase domestic savings and exports, including through the National Export Initiative. China takes promotion of employment as the priority objective for economic development, and strives to achieve full employment. China strives to raise the proportion of residents’ income in gross national income, increase the proportion of wages in the primary income distribution, and realize the increase of people’s income in line with economic development and the increase of workers’ pay in line with gains in labor productivity. China’s minimum wage has steadily increased in recent years {{and will continue to do}} so in the future. China will raise the ratio of services value-added to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by four percentage points over the next five years, with measures to develop the services sector including expanding areas open to foreign involvement, encouraging and guiding a variety of categories of capital into the services sector, and actively developing services enterprises with diversified forms of ownership. The U.S. economy is rebalancing toward sustainable growth, emphasizing higher domestic savings, a commitment to improving long-term fiscal sustainability and productivity-enhancing investments. The personal savings rate was 5.8 percent in 2010, which is the highest rate since 1993 and well above the 2.7 percent average between 2000 and 2007. Thus, much of the transition on the private side to higher saving has already taken place. To increase public saving, the President’s Budget freezes discretionary spending for five years, freezes government salaries for two years, and brings the deficit to three percent of GDP by the second half of this decade - a path consistent with the Administration’s commitments to cut the deficit in half by 2013, and to stabilize or reduce the national debt as a share of the economy. To lay the foundation for future growth, including through greater U.S. exports, the United States will increase and improve investment in innovation, infrastructure, and education. …… The two countries reiterate their support for the G-20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth, and reaffirm their commitments to improve the living standards of our citizens through strong economic and jobs growth, and use the full range of policies required to strengthen the global recovery and to reduce excessive external imbalances and maintain current account imbalances at sustainable levels. The two sides support a bigger role for the G-20 in international economic and financial affairs, and pledge to strengthen communication and coordination to follow through on the commitments of the G-20 summits and push for positive outcomes at the Cannes summit in November. …… II. Strengthening Financial Systems and Improving Financial Supervision [...] The two countries reaffirmed their commitment to deepen bilateral and multilateral cooperation on financial sector investment and regulation, in order to enhance global regulation, establish stronger international coordination to prevent future crises, and ensure a level playing field. Recognizing the positive contributions that financial institutions from each country can play, the two sides pledged to support open environments for investment in financial services and cross-border portfolio investment, consistent with prudential and national security requirements. The United States and China commit to further promote and strengthen financial sector reform.Following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the United States is implementing comprehensive financial reform that better serves households, workers, entrepreneurs, and businesses by reducing systemic risk, raising prudential standards, establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for derivatives, ending the problem of “too big to fail” financial institutions, creating a Federal Insurance Office, and ensuring robust consumer financial protection. China will continue to deepen the reform of its financial system, which has supported the process of transforming its economic development model, developing a financial system that consists of diverse institutions, provides efficient service, controls risks, and encourages financial innovation. China will increase the use of direct financing channels, including stocks, bonds and private equity, to better satisfy the diverse demands in its economy for investment capital and financing. In accordance with the medium- and long-term development perspectives, China will push forward the market-based reform of interest rates. …… The United States and China committed to further strengthen their respective financial systems against money laundering, counterfeiting, terrorism financing, and WMD proliferation financing activities. China will continue to develop and strengthen its regulatory framework for freezing terrorist assets. The two countries will continue to enhance both policy and operational cooperation on combating illicit finance. The two countries will also continue to work collaboratively in the freezing, seizing, and forfeiture of criminal proceeds. Both countries seek to rely on bilateral mutual legal assistance to implement forfeiture orders, and seek to avoid unilateral enforcement action of forfeiture orders to the extent possible. III. Enhancing Trade and Investment Cooperation [...] The two countries, recognizing the importance of open trade and investment in fostering economic growth, job creation, innovation, and prosperity, re-affirmed their commitment to take further steps to liberalize global trade and investment, and to oppose all forms of trade and investment protectionism. The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to work proactively to resolve bilateral trade and investment disputes in a constructive, cooperative, and mutually beneficial manner. China will take stock of the results of the Special Campaign against <b>IPR</b> <b>Infringement</b> and Fake and Shoddy Products (Special Campaign), and improve on the high-level, long-term mechanism of IPR protection and enforcement, building on the Special Campaign currently in place. China will strengthen the government inspection mechanism so as to make sure that the software being used by the government agencies at all levels is legitimate. China and the United States will strengthen cooperation in the JCCT IPR Working Group on software legalization. …… China and the United States reaffirm their prior SED outcomes on transparency. The United States welcomes China’s statement that it will issue a measure in 2011, to implement the requirement to publish all proposed trade- and economic-related administrative regulations and departmental rules on the SCLAO website for a public comment period of not less than 30 days from the date of publication, except as specified in China’s Protocol of Accession to the WTO or in public emergency situations. China will steadily increase its solicitation of public opinions on regulatory documents with a direct influence on the rights and obligations of citizens, legal persons, or other organizations. China welcomes the United States’ commitment to implement measures in 2011, to enhance regulatory transparency, including by taking steps to ensure the online publication of the text of proposed regulations, as well as supporting technical and scientific information, at www.Regulations.gov for a public comment period of 60 days, and the United States’ decision to strengthen the Office of Management and Budget’s participation in the ongoing Transparency Dialogue. …… The United States and China agree on the importance of fostering an open, transparent and predictable investment climate.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to review foreign <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> issues {{affecting}} selected U.

Although the review is primarily based on qualitative information, some attempts to measure the effects of <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> quantitatively also are reviewed. To provide background and context for the analysis, the authors discuss the problem of foreign <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> for U. S. industry; describe certain U. S. trade laws and international agreements that attempt to address such infringement; review examples of inadequate foreign patent, trademark, and copyright protection and their implications for selected U. S. industries; and describe U. S. private and public sector efforts to address such problems. The paper finds that (1) intellectual property protection is essential to encouraging creative expression and the development of new products in a number of industries; (2) the development of intellectual property-based products is generally far more expensive than their manufacture or duplication; (3) inadequate IPR protection leaves firms vulnerable to infringement, causing them to risk their investment and reputations; (4) foreign <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> results in billions of dollars in lost revenues for U. S. industries; (5) current estimates likely understate the actual cost of infringement; and (6) more rigorous empirical research is needed to confirm the actual amount of U.

40|$|Abstract: Based upon a {{comparative}} institutional {{analysis of the}} institutional frameworks involved in the governance of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) systems in France and in the US, both {{in the domain of}} patents and copyrights, we demonstrate that the differences of performances among contrasted systems of property rights do not only depend upon the wording of the Law, but also result from the governance mechanisms that implement and complete the Law. In particular we show that there are essential complementarities between public and private institutions designed by the owners of IPRs. Institutions allow agents to reduce the costs of settling and defending exclusive rights of use over intangible goods by collectivizing the related operation. Collectivization can however generate mal-adaptation costs since the management of these rights cannot be customized. We then show that the optimal division of labour between public institutions, private institutions and individuals varies according to the type of <b>IPRs</b> <b>infringement</b> and according to the diffusion strategy used by the owner(s) of the IPRs. We conclude by pointing out that the design of the organization of the institutional frame should be more carefully taken into account when dealing with the optimal design of IPRs systems to solve the protection/diffusion dilemma...|$|R

40|$|Consumers are {{the actual}} {{force behind the}} {{counterfeiting}} trade. The main problem of the demand side is clearly an issue of consumer misbehaviour. Such behaviour is potentially harmful to business, the consumers themselves, and society as a whole. Astonishingly, Asian people who constitute {{the majority of the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s population support this activity. Asian people generally have low expectations of branded products, because they tend to blindly believe that foreign brands are best, and they do not distinguish among different brands. It is possible that most of the Intellectual Property Rights (<b>IPR)</b> <b>infringements</b> taking place in Asian countries may stem from cultural differences in morality and perspective between people in the East and the West. Asian cultures have traditionally emphasized that individual developers or creators are obliged to share their developments with society. IPR, on the other hand, reflects a characteristic value of the Western World in general. Indeed, some Asian nations seem to believe that IPR is a Western concept created to maintain a monopoly over the distribution and production of knowledge and knowledge based products. As a result, when foreign countries on Asian countries to develop laws to counter trademark infringements place pressure, counterfeit products have not diminished. In relation to the demand for acknowledgment of original works of human intellect and the magnitude of the protection of intellectual property rights, the Indonesian Government has taken a number of considerable measures in establishing and improving the intellectual property rights system, with regards to its worldwide obligations as approved in the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, as one of the agreements of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

The artifacts between the IP regime and the national economy can be easily interpreted by the fact that India&#x 2032;s independence had itself brought an era where the enactment of the national IP laws were considered to stand on the touchstone of the market economy. The aim of the present article is to investigate the impact of a strong IP regime on the economic development of a nation and also a light is raised into Indian economy, and the creation of an efficient innovative system is discussed.

The fact that a strong IPR actually provokes <b>IPR</b> <b>infringements</b> in many developing nations also seems to be an issue that needs to be analyzed while understanding the need of the former. The trade-off between unfair competition laws and IP also assumes importance of high magnitude and hence needs to be particularly emphasized.

The critical themes in this thesis are how a developing country at the low level of development {{as in the case of}} Vietnam, with various distinctiveness in term of economy, society, culture, politics, or legality can enhance its judicial effectiveness in dealing with IP cases in order to fulfil its international obligations under TRIPs Agreement. Despite the importance of the issue, there has not been any research on the first integration of Vietnamese judiciary in line with international regulations on IPRs protection and enforcement applicable to all WTO member states. This thesis will also examine impacts of this international compliance for the Vietnamese judiciary in particular, and to this South East Asian country in general. After analysing the critical situation of <b>IPRs</b> <b>infringements</b> in Vietnam, which lie behind an impetus for change, the thesis will review the historical development of IPRs and main provisions of the TRIPs Agreement. Next, the thesis will examine the definition of judicial effectiveness in special reference to minimum standards as provided in the TRIPs Agreement. I will argue that judicial effectiveness in enforcing IPRs can not be improved to comply with the TRIPs Agreement unless judiciary’s capacity in preventing and deterring IP infringements, judicial organisation and knowledge, and other factors involving legal procedures are enhanced. In the light of above analysis, I will analyse the judicial organisation and legal knowledge in dealing with IP cases, and the adequacy of legislation concerning judicial measures for IPRs enforcement. I will also argue that any content of the reform of Vietnamese judiciary to comply with TRIPs Agreement must take into account, inter alia, the distinctiveness of Vietnamese judiciary, and other unique factors of this country in terms of its economy, society, politic and culture...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, prestigious courts {{around the world}} have refused to {{adjudicate}} cases relating to foreign registered or unregistered intellectual property rights (hereinafter: IPRs), where the proceedings concerned an <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> claim or where the defendant in an <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> action or the claimant in a declaratory action to establish that the IPR is not infringed pleaded that the IPR is invalid or void and that there is also no infringement of that right for that reason (so called validity issues incidentally raised). In these cases the refusal to adjudicate the foreign IPRs infringement and validity claims was grounded on exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction (exclusive jurisdiction) rules. According to those rules, the State that granted or recognized the IPR has the exclusive jurisdiction to address claims related thereto, independent of its also having personal jurisdiction over the defendant. This paper adopts and develops a thesis according to which exclusive jurisdiction rules in IPRs cases are not suggested by public international law; are actually illegal according to its rules on the denial of justice and on the fundamental human right of access to courts; and therefore, must be abandoned not only with respect to IPRs infringement issues, but also to IPRs validity claims raised as a defense in infringements proceedings, as the majority of the scholars maintain and the most recent academic initiatives like the ALI Principles and the CLIP Project codify...|$|E

TRIPS agreement and border enforcement of IPRS [...] Chapter 4. Role of Customs as a border security agency [...] Chapter 5. Socio-economic impacts of IPR enfringement [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion and recommendations. In the present era of rapid globalisation, countries are intrinsically integrated {{with each other}} by way of international trade to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources. Trade facilitation is now recognised as a key driving factor in determining export competitiveness of a country. Customs administrations, the frontier border agency responsible for regulating import and export of legitimate goods, are increasingly {{faced with the challenge}} of intellectual property rights (<b>IPR)</b> <b>infringement.</b> In addition to national governments, various international organisations have devised guidelines and tools to facilitate and empower Customs agencies in their fight against <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement.</b> In particular, the multilateral Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) articulates a prescription for border enforcement of IPRs in Articles 51 - 60. In this backdrop, this thesis attempts to answer a very fundamental question: What are the implications of ‘Border Measures’, specified under the WTO TRIPS Agreement, for facilitating international trade? To this end, it critically examines the concepts of trade facilitation, TRIPS and IPR protection to highlight the links that connect them and the missing links that need to be established. Obligations to protect IPR under national and international laws are also scrutinised. Research shows that efforts by WTO, World Customs Organization (WCO) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) have been instrumental in this context. While policy planning at the national level should be the first priority, commitment by the advanced economies to support their less developed counterparts through technology transfer (TT) is of paramount importance. The thesis suggests that TRIPS-plus provisions, if implemented arbitrarily by developed countries, have the potential to undermine the interests of countries with resource constraints. In this context, the thesis analyses the effects and implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreements, and the Revised Kyoto Convention (RKC) for the border protection of IPRs. The thesis investigates the socio-economic impacts of <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> and articulates strategies to be adopted and applied at individual, collective, business and government levels to stop trade and use of IPR infringed goods. Drawing on the analysis of the relevant WTO Articles, scrutiny of various border measures put in place by national governments and international bodies, and current state of play under the Doha Development Round (DDR), the thesis puts forward a set of short and long term policy recommendations for all relevant stakeholders. These inclusively include: (i) strengthening risk management procedures; (ii) cooperation and coordination at national and international levels; (iii) awareness raising initiatives; (iv) establishing advanced technologically driven border enforcement system; (v) empowering Customs with effective administrative authority; (vi) IP related technical capacity building within the Customs and business community; (vii) technology transfer to LDCs from developed countries; and (viii) LDC friendly dispute settlement process under the WTO.

40|$|According to U. S. {{industry}} and government officials, intellectual property rights (<b>IPR)</b> <b>infringement</b> has reached critical levels in the United States as well as abroad. The speed and ease with which the duplication of products protected by IPR can occur has created an urgent need for industries and governments alike to address the protection of IPR {{in order to keep}} markets open to trade in the affected goods. Copyrighted products such as software, movies, music and video recordings, and other media products have been particularly affected by inadequate IPR protection. New tools, such as writable compact discs (CDs) and, of course, the Internet have made duplication not only effortless and low-cost, but anonymous as well. This paper discusses the merits of IPR protection and its importance to the U. S. economy. It then provides background on various technical, legal, and trade policy methods that have been employed to control the infringement of IPR domestically and internationally. This is followed by an analysis of current and future challenges facing U. S. industry with regard to IPR protection, particularly the challenges presented by the Internet and digital piracy.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} the first applied econometric model {{to examine the}} efficiency of existing enforcement measures and legal framework on prevailing software piracy rates in Egypt. Hence, {{it can be used}} as a tool when discussing new policies concerning the welfare of the interest groups and the pricing of protected software products (i. e., original software products). The model will focus on the available time-series data during 1992 - 2002 in Egypt. This time period was chosen due to the paucity of quantitative data concerning the model. The institutional environment is examined according to the New Institutional Economics (NIE) to illustrate the legal framework, the informal constraints and the enforcement authorities to support the empirical model. Analytical results show that efficient enforcement of property rights does not only imply increasing legal enforcement through imposing more severe punishments and prosecutions, as decreasing the prices of software plays a much bigger role. Thus relying on legal enforcement authorities alone is not always economically optimal, as it will not be able to deter <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> on its own.

40|$|IPR {{laws are}} {{supervised}} by the Ministry of Economic Affairs {{as part of}} the laws of economics. The Intellectual Property Office of the Ministry takes the responsibility to amend the laws when necessary but usually without the participation of judges. Even so the courts handle the criminal cases when people are accused of crime involving <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement.</b> Because judges lack information regarding the original intent of the legislation, judges have difficulties to find an exact application of the new laws. Furthermore, with the impact of the recent amendment of criminal procedure code judges not only have to adapt to new structures of the IPR rights but also to comply with the new procedure regulations {{to make sure that the}} bench has an exact way to question the parties, define the issues of law and facts, and choose the appropriate experts to help the court make a decision. Based on the recent amendments both of trademark law and copyright law and his trial experiences, this article written by an IPR court judge of the Taiwan High Court analyzes some issues from a practical perspective and from the legislature side and tries to give his own opinions in order to benefit the bench and lawyers when facing the problems of IPR criminal cases. ...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{importance}} attached to intangible assets in the modern world, the remedies for intellectual property infringement have been brought under the spotlight.   In this background, {{there has been an}} increased interest regarding the scope and desirability of using criminal sanctions for the protection of IPR, especially in cases involving commercial-scale counterfeiting and piracy.   However, this development has been received with mixed sentiments, with some commentators criticising the legitimacy of using criminal law for the protection of private property rights. This thesis undertakes a search for a coherent justification for criminalising intellectual property infringement.   The thesis also attempts to demonstrate the evolution and progression of criminal enforcement of IPR at the international level.   Furthermore, the thesis analyses crosscutting issues encountered by developing countries when enforcing criminal sanctions, thereby explaining the reluctance to reform criminal remedies for <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> in these countries.   The thesis identifies criminal sanctions as a desirable remedy for countering the rising threat of piracy and counterfeiting.   It also highlights the achievements and shortcomings of multilateral actions taken thus far in relation to criminal IPR enforcement, thereby providing valuable insights for future negotiations.   Finally, it emphasises that a criminal IPR enforcement regime in any jurisdiction should be evaluated with caution, giving due consideration to other economic development interests and priorities of developing countries.

40|$|Increasingly, {{progress}} in standards committees is hindered by claims on the 'intellectual property ' of contributions (patents, copyright, and trademarks). Standards bodies have developed rules {{to handle this}} problem and have learned to improvise, but tension between judicial regime and the standards regime remains. The judicial regime is the default regime for standardisation. Standards fora, therefore, incorporate parts of the legal system. What characterises the judicio-standardisation regime that results? Which views on property are embedded in the IPR rules of standards fora? How do these views relate to European and international law? What is the weight of 'compatibility {{for the sake of}} the public interest and the market ' in respect to 'property protection ' in the judicial regime? Is the rationale behind relevant parts of the current legal regime foremost based on the primacy of ownership and market competition, and are there means to address supra-company public interests of compatibility? Java development and 'standardisation ' is used to illustrate the problems that occur. It demonstrates three areas of concern. Firstly, the fear of ICT market players for <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> during technology and standards development processes. Secondly, the role of IPR rules of standards bodies. Inappropriate IPR rules were, allegedly, Sun's reason to withdraw Java from ECMA. Thirdly, how law deals with intellectual property and compatibility issues (Sun vs. Microsoft lawsuit). The illustrations are based on data from expert interviews, literature, and observations during ECMA TC 41 meetings. 1 This is a first draft. Comments are very welcome. M...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{illustrate}} {{the current state of}} intellectual property rights (IPR) in Saudi Arabia in light of certain international agreements, specifically TRIPS, as well as Sharia law, that have informed the Saudi legislature in its creation and handling of intellectual property matters. Various matters of IP today may be debated among Saudi 2 ̆ 7 s Islamic jurists, which in turn may bring such issues into conflict with Sharia. Such conflicts over matters of IP cannot be dismissed lightly by the Saudi legislators. They must determine the proper enforcement and protection of IRP as stipulated by modern Saudi IP laws and/or by international agreements signed by the Saudi government. Potential deficiencies in the proper protection and enforcement of IPR may foster dear among IPR owners regarding access to legal protection for their IP. The main objective {{of this study is to}} prove the possibility of reducing <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> in Saudi Arabia. This study also argues that it is possible for Saudi to provide strong enforcement and protection of IPR through the enforcement of religious law, and through other means and measures that are compatible with Sharia and the cultural environment of Saudi Arabia, which is in general strongly religious, traditional, and conservative. Such legal and religious measures may place Saudi 2 ̆ 7 s IPR laws on par with international IPR standards and the laws of other countries, and may assist in elaborating a more globalized vision about IPR systems in Saudi Arabia. This study will analyze and evaluate current Saudi IPR legislation, including Trademarks, Copyrights, and Patents from the viewpoint of Islamic and Saudi laws. The methodology adopted in this study is reflective of traditional Saudi IPR laws and international IPR conventions, with reference to other jurisdictions when needed to compare the legislation and practices of diverse countries. Special attention is paid to countries such as Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) that have a culture similar to Saudi Arabia 2 ̆ 7 s and comply with Sharia. This study will serve the important purpose of educating Saudi and international IP owners and lawyers, Saudi authorities who regulate IPR, Islamic countries, and scholars and practitioners in other legal fields seeking to understand the status of IPR in Saudi Arabia, especially as related to Sharia. In additione to the above mentioned analysis, the author will employ other methods for certain matters, including the critiques and reforms of IP laws and practices. In addition, an attempt has been made to close-read the test of Saudi statutes in light of Sharia and its theories related to IPR. The scope of this study is to examine the aspects of protection, enforcement, and infringement of IPR in the framework of Sharia, the TRIPS agreement, and the current Saudi IPR laws. This study is divided into three main parts and eight chapters, as follows. Part I comprises Chapters 2 and 3, and deals with the general background of intellectual property rights in TRIPS, Saudi statutes, Jurisprudence, and Sharia. Various theories related to IPR are discussed with respect to modern laws and Sharia. Part II comprises Chapters 4, 5, and 6, and discusses infringement and enforcement of IPR in Sharia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. The underlying concepts and reasons for <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> and enforcement, and the criminal and civil remedies regarding IPR, are elucidated with respect to Saudi and Sharia law. An examination of the enforcement of religious law by the religious police as related to Sharia and its modern practices is provided. Recommendations and improvements that might be made to current legal practices are illustrated. Part III comprises Chapters 7, 8, and 9, and examines matters of IPR that might raise issues related to the implementation of proper IPR protection and enforcement. Such matters are related to trademarks, and concern the function, ownership, and protection of banned trademarks in Saudi Arabia with reference to Sharia and other legislation. Likewise, matters of copyrights concerning moral and financial rights, duration, and protection are deliberated. Regarding patents matters concerning monopolies, public interest, infringement and remedies are discussed. Recommendations are provided as important results in the conclusion of this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is the {{jurisdiction}} of the arbitral tribunal in disputes related to intellectual property license agreements. The situations that I study concern different types of claims regarding a licence agreement that contains an arbitration clause. In which situations does the arbitral tribunal have jurisdiction over a dispute where the licensee has utilised the protected right outside of the scope of the agreement? What if the licensee utilises the protected right in territories that are not covered by the agreement? Is this a breach of the license agreement or simply an infringement of intellectual property, or could it be both? And does the arbitral tribunal have jurisdiction over the dispute if the situation is seen to be an infringement of intellectual property? The same questions can be asked when the licensee has taken advantage of the intellectual property right during time periods other than agreed in the license agreement. When is a license agreement dispute not arbitrable at all, or are all such disputes arbitrable? The scope of the arbitration agreement has a very central role in the thesis. I examine how the scope is determined and which claims the arbitration agreement covers. The study is limited to disputes regarding use outside the scope of the license agreement. It does not deal with e. g. disputes concerning royalty payments. In the thesis, I {{come to the conclusion that}} the international trend is that the view towards the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction is becoming more liberal. A restrictive interpretation of the jurisdiction is seen to be out-dated. This trend will probably increase the use of arbitration in license agreement disputes even further. The three main prerequisites for {{the jurisdiction of the}} arbitral tribunal are a valid arbitration agreement, a dispute that is arbitrable, and a dispute that falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. In this study, the starting point is that there is a valid arbitration agreement. The arbitrability of IP disputes is not unambiguous. Disputes regarding registration and validity of IPRs are non-arbitrable in Finland and in many other countries. Such disputes are not capable of settlement and thereby, they belong exclusively to the courts. Most disputes related to license agreements are, however, arbitrable. In conclusion, a dispute regarding exceeding a license restriction is principally arbitrable, unless a question of validity is included. Exceeding a license restriction normally constitutes both <b>IPR</b> <b>infringement</b> and a breach of contract, which means that this type of dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Nevertheless, there are situations where the arbitration clause would probably not be applicable, since the infringement is too distant from the license agreement. In these cases, it could be deemed that the dispute concerns a legal relationship other than the one specified in the arbitration agreement...|$|E
