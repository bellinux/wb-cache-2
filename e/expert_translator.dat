40|$|As machine {{translation}} quality continues to improve, {{the idea of}} using MT to assist human translators becomes increasingly attractive. In this work, we discuss and provide empirical evidence of the challenges faced when adapting traditional MT systems to provide automatic translations for human post-editors to correct. We discuss the differences between this task and traditional adequacy-based tasks and the challenges that arise when using automatic metrics to predict the amount of effort required to post-edit translations. A series of experiments simulating a real-world localization scenario shows that current metrics under-perform on this task, even when tuned to maximize correlation with <b>expert</b> <b>translator</b> judgments, illustrating the need to rethink traditional MT pipelines when addressing the challenges of this translation task. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} quality {{has become an}} {{important}} topic in the translation domain, especially as most translation projects are no longer just {{the outcome of the}} work of a single <b>expert</b> <b>translator,</b> but rather a corporate activity, consistent with the norms of the structural environment and bureaucratic workflows of the organisation that is responsible for the work. Managing quality across this value-chain is therefore one of the most challenging areas in 21 st century translation. In such a complex process, the notion of Total Quality Management (TQM), originally a quality management tool in mass production, has started to be implemented effectively in many diverse sectors, such as medicine and education (Hansson, 2003); and translation project organisations have themselves become interested in applying TQM in their own quality assurance processes, especially as their activities also include digital translation mechanisms (DGT, 2009; Mitterlehner, 2012; BSI ISO 17100, 2015). The starting point of this research was to understand the existing quality management mechanisms and processes across English to Arabic translation companies and how they could be improved in a corporate context. Kalima, a translation project organisation, was selected as the leading case study, given its well-established reputation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as well as the wider Arab World, as a serious contributor to the body of translated into Arabic. Two other non-profit translation service providers (TSPs) of the sector were also analysed, so as to have a sound overview and to provide a broader insight into managerial practices concerning quality assurance within translation processes, and thus to determine whether TQM in its wider state-of-the-art sense could be relevant for the translation sector in the UAE. This research has developed a framework for implementing TQM in TSPs based on three main dimensions of critical success factors (CSFs); namely, leadership commitment and strategic direction; managerial and structural reforms; and procedural changes. The proposed framework suggests appointing a portfolio manager as suggested by Giammarresi (2011) in order to regulate the organisational strategy and optimise resources for effective and efficient quality in TSPs performing in a similar context to those particularly studied in this research. The researcher’s critical analysis is the basis for a novel framework that may be of interest for TSPs, and may be used as a benchmark for further research...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{transformation}} of Greco-Arabic medical teachings of Salerno 1050 - 1200 in a broader political context. It argues that the skills of key individuals and their pedagogic innovations not only created learned medicine but also contributed to new habits of mind in northern Europe in the twelfth century. The eleventh and twelfth centuries are at the very dawn of a Western understanding of logical truth from personal observation in medicine as distinct from received wisdom. The incorporation of natural philosophy and Aristotelian analytics from Alexandrian medicine into Salernitan medicine was an important step by which the West learned to interpret the experienced world. The world, as perceived by human senses and interpreted by human reason had, itself, to be validated {{as a source of}} reliable information in contrast to Augustine's Neoplatonist view. Augustine taught that the real world existed only as more or less imperfect copy of the ideal Form in the mind of God and that truth can only be known through contact with God. In the mid eleventh century, Salernitan doctors were widely respected as skilled empiricists, but lacking in theory. Their knowledge, from the relatively scanty medical texts surviving from antiquity, was collated and edited before 1059 into the Passionarius by Gariopontus, an experienced Salernitan doctor. His succinct clinical attenuated theory of humoural medicine. In about 1062, in Constantinople, Alfanus, Archbishop of Salerno and a learned physician, translated a fourth-century treatise on the Nature of Man which contained a much more complete exposition of Galenic medicine than had been seen in the West. After he returned, Alfanus and his group collated a primer of brief treatises from the old masters, but it lacked a good introduction to Galenic medical theory. Many key texts of Galenic medicine, as it had evolved in the curriculum of the medical school at Alexandria, had been translated into Arabic under the ninth-century Abassid Caliph, al-Mamun. Constantine the African, a Saracen physician recruited as an <b>expert</b> <b>translator</b> provided a concise Introduction (lsagoge) for Alfanus' collection from an Arabic authority. Constantine also made a number of other translations from Arabic, including the encyclopaedic Pantegni. Over the twelfth century, Salernitan teachers, particularly the unknown author of the Second Salernitan Demonstration, Bartholomaeus and Ursa, expounded and embellished the new Greco-Arabie theory. The new translations, their theories and their commentaries soon attracted intense interest in northern Europe where they provoked a vigorous reaction from conservative churchmen. Salernitan medicine was itself taken to Paris by Giles of Corbeil in about 1194, when he returned to become physician to King Philip Augustus. Giles became an important early teacher of Medicine at the evolving University of Paris {{at the very beginning of}} the thirteenth century. This thesis argues that Salernitan medicine thus provided the learned canon by which the craft of medicus became the profession of physicus. Salernitan texts and teachers helped set the scene in Paris for the rejection and then acceptance of Aristotle's teaching on logic and natural history...|$|E

Experimental results, using challenging language-pairs, demonstrate improvement in correlation with human judgments over traditional evaluation metrics. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, 5 table...|$|R

For this reason, we fi rst discuss the requirements that each stage of the drafting process must meet in order to facilitate the production of high-quality legislative texts.

40|$|Corpus based {{approaches}} to automatic translation such as Example Based and Statistical Machine Translation systems use {{large amounts of}} parallel data created by humans to train mathematical models for automatic language translation.

40|$|It {{seems obvious}} that <b>expert</b> <b>translators,</b> whether self-taught or {{formally}} trained, {{work on the}} basis of some theoretical notions and are capable of voicing them explicitly. What may not seem so obvious is that novice translators also have some theoretical bases. Nonetheless, empirical studies show that even novice subjects can formulate certain principles that they have applied when translating. From a different perspective descriptive studies try to identify in translated texts which standards have been used by the translators. Both kinds of studies show that translators often make their decisions intuitively but based on some theoretical knowledge. In the social sciences and psychology this kind of knowledge is referred to as implicit theories or subjective theories. My paper will present the results of a preliminary qualitative analysis of work from my own translation students. The notional framework for this analysis draws from precursors in both descriptive and cognitive approaches to translation. It also draws from a model of implicit theories of translation that has been developed from models in the fields of pedagogy and cognitive psychology. The results may not be taken as solid proof, but they partially confirm our assumptions about the content, nature and function of the implicit theories of novice translator...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the fact}} that {{professional}} translators, who are socially recognized as ‘experts’, are required to predict risks and solve problems in an exceptional manner, {{little research has been}} undertaken from the expert performance perspective in the area of translation studies. To enable novice translators to achieve such an exceptional performance, notion of ‘translator belief’ appears to hold a key. This is because beliefs and behaviour are closely related, as scholars including Johnson (1991), Williams & Burden (1997), and Woods (1991) posit in the area of teacher education. This paper will first explore the nature of professional beliefs and their relationship with performance (particularly in terms of predicting risks and solving problems), and this will lead to the discussion of their applicability to the context of translation. I will then present the findings from the analysis of two pilot attitudinal surveys, in which a focus was placed on novice-expert differences in ‘translator beliefs’ in dealing with such risks and problems. In this study, I generated a 97 item survey in which findings from my previous studies on ways in which novice and <b>expert</b> <b>translators</b> address risks and problems were reflected.
