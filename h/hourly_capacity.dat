40|$|Forage {{harvesting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important operations in grassland technology. Optimal timing and duration in performing such operation provide better forage quality. Specific fuel consume was assessed by reporting fuel quantity to the worked area and obtained working volume. Work capacity at shift time depends on the effective work moving speed, but is also influenced by some operation interruptions. In alfalfa harvesting and Sudanese grass harvesting, the specific fuel consume varied from 0. 23 l/t in Sudanese grass to 0. 25 l/t in alfalfa green fodder parcels. Forage harvesting fuel consume per area unit is bigger when using machineries with inappropriate technical characteristics.

Mobile batching plants are typically a single unit, made up of a cement silo, an aggregate bin, an aggregate conveyor and the cement and aggregate batchers, but at higher <b>hourly</b> production <b>capacities</b> may require numerous loads for a single plant. Typically, a mobile batching plant can be dismantled and reassembled in a few days time. As a result, they can be used at multiple construction sites to reduce transportation costs.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on the ride vehicles could not stand up to the demand of the ride course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused the ride to be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track to run with the highest <b>hourly</b> <b>capacity</b> possible, twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed. The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of the ride. One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{feature of}} climate impacts on {{occupational}} {{health and safety}} are physiological limits to carrying out physical work at high heat exposure. Heat stress reduces a workers work capacity, leading to lower hourly labour productivity and economic output. We used existing weather station data and climate modeling grid cell data to describe heat conditions (calculated as Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, WBGT) in South-East Asia. During the hottest month in this region (March) afternoon WBGT levels are already high enough to cause major loss of <b>hourly</b> work <b>capacity</b> and by 2050 the situation will be extreme for many outdoor jobs...|$|R

50|$|Analytical Performance Modeling is {{a method}} to model the {{behaviour}} of a system in a spreadsheet. The model is fed with measurements of transaction resource demands (CPU, disk I/O, LAN, WAN), weighted by the transaction-mix (business transactions per hour).

Using the responsetime formula (R=S/(1-U), R=responsetime, S=servicetime, U=load), responsetimes can be calculated and calibrated {{with the results of}} the performance tests. Analytical performance modeling allows evaluation of design options and system sizing based on actual or anticipated business use. It is therefore much faster and cheaper than performance testing, though it requires thorough understanding of the hardware platforms.|$|R

50|$|The runway was {{extended}} northward to 2500 m on October 22, 2009, allowing an additional 20,000 flights per year.

40|$|The {{importance}} of cable driven APMs (Automated People Movers) {{has become much}} higher in the recent years, for <b>hourly</b> <b>capacities</b> up to nearly 8 - 9 thousand passengers per direction. This is due also to their undeniably competitive energy consumption per passenger and per km since {{they do not need}} to be provided with a motor on board and - consequently - neither the mechanical transmission to the wheels nor a structure suitable for such weights; this leaves power transmission to a mechanical component with small inertia, such as a steel wire rope. However, in any rope transport system based on a carrying-hauling rope, a relevant part of energy losses comes from rollers and related roller assemblies, in particular from the interaction between the metal rope and the rubber on rollers. So, having the possibility to quantify and, possibly, reduce their contribution to energy losses may result in positive effect on the overall energy performance of APMs. The temperature of rubber increases under cyclic loads; this is due to hysteresis losses and low rubber thermal conductivity. This paper presents a new procedure to assess the generation of heat in the ropeway roller with rubber band. The procedure consists in assessing hysteresis loss, i. e. the dissipated energy within the rubber band, by an analytical procedure. The model works with a limited number of data and without direct experimental measures on the rubber compound, which would be hardly feasible in practice. The dissipated energy obtained was used as an input for steady state thermal analysis. Verification of the proposed procedure was performed by comparing the simulation results to the data obtained experimentally during the periodical tests that have been developed in various plants. This model allows obtaining a preliminary value about the actual roller energy consumption, in order to provide a better comparison between different urban transport systems in terms of energy consumption...|$|R

Firstly, the amount of passenger traffic affects the optimal choice of passenger vehicles and secondly, the intensity of road traffic on the streets of areas where passengers pass routes. It should also be kept in mind that passenger traffic can fluctuate significantly depending on the time of day and days of the week.
