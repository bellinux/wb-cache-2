2500|$|In autumn Cadland was not sent {{north for}} the St Leger (which The Colonel won) but raced instead at Newmarket, {{as he would}} do {{for most of his}} career. On the Monday of the First October meeting he led from the start in the Grand Duke Michael Stakes and won easily by two lengths. Two days later he won the Newmarket St Leger [...] "in a canter", {{finishing}} fifty yards clear of the runner-up. Commenting on these successes the Sporting Magazine observed that Cadland, for all his ability, was not a [...] "free pleasing" [...] runner, often seeming reluctant and idle in his races. At the Houghton meeting his owners claimed the <b>forfeit</b> <b>money</b> when Bessy Bedlam, his opponent for a match race, was withdrawn. He ended the season undefeated, with five competitive wins, one walkover, two match forfeits, and almost £6,000 in prize money.|$|E

50|$|Even {{after the}} first season, {{exemptions}} are usually twists in the game. In some cases, exemptions are awarded to a single player for an exceptional effort or performance during that day's task. Sometimes the exempted player is chosen by the group, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Other times, the exemption {{comes in the form}} of a temptation to not complete a task and <b>forfeit</b> <b>money</b> for the pot; or as an unexpected consolation prize for failure during a task..|$|E
50|$|Mameluke reappeared as {{a four-year-old}} at the Craven meeting at Newmarket in April. He won the Oatlands Handicap on 8 April and then {{defeated}} Amphion in a two-runner {{race for the}} Port Stakes. For the second successive year at Newmarket's Second Spring meeting his owner was able to claim <b>forfeit</b> <b>money</b> for a match race, when his scheduled opponent, the 1826 Epsom Oaks winner Babel (formerly known as Lilias) was withdrawn. Mameluke's return to Doncaster in September ended in disappointment as he finished unplaced behind Laurel in the Doncaster Cup.|$|E
5000|$|On 2 April, Shelley {{collected}} 80 guineas from Sir Charles Bunbury when a match {{race between}} Phantom and Bunbury's Sorceror colt was cancelled. On his first competitive race of 1812, Phantom finished second to Rainbow (also known as [...] "General Gower's colt") at level weights in the Claret Stakes at Newmarket on April 14, {{a race for}} which he started 2/5 favourite. Two weeks later at the same course, he won a 200 guineas match race against the five-year-old Crispin who attempted to concede eight pounds to the Derby winner. Four days later, a match between Phantom and Beverley did not take place, with Shelley claiming 300 guineas in <b>forfeit</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

The $30,000 film was funded with <b>forfeited</b> <b>money</b> earmarked for training. [...] "His theft of the credit is not going to sit well with my staff and our hard working partners," [...] Minneapolis police chief Tim Dolan said in an e-mail.

5000|$|In this game, {{two players}} {{want to trade}} possessions. [...] An umpire decides whether the items have the same value, and if not, what the {{difference}} is. Both players and the umpire then put some <b>forfeit</b> <b>money</b> in a cap. The players put their hands in the cap, and then remove them either open, to signal agreement with the valuation, or closed, to signal disagreement. If both players agree, the difference in valuation is paid, the items are traded, and the umpire collects the forfeit. If both players disagree, the items are not traded, and the umpire collects the forfeit. If one player agrees and the other does not, the items are not traded, and the player who agreed to the valuation collects the forfeit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{total number}} of rounds played may vary. In Chatto's account a full game {{is made up of}} four rounds. In the version {{described}} by Maudranalay, there is no fixed number of rounds, rather the game must continue round after round until a losing player (presumably meaning a player who lost the previous round of gameplay) beats the card led by another player on the last trick of the round. This last lead card is called the 'akheri', from a word for 'last' (which exists in persian and arabic ( [...] آخر [...] ). In Wilkin's account, this event has a different significance. Wilkins writes that if a player beats the akheri card, he is exempted from paying any <b>forfeit</b> <b>money</b> going into the next round.|$|E

50|$|The town {{used the}} {{proceeds}} from the seizures {{to build a new}} police station and personally reward high-revenue generating officers. Other purchases included a $524 popcorn machine and $195 for candy. Donations to Little League teams and local chambers of commerce were also made using seized funds. Texas law states that <b>forfeited</b> <b>money</b> can only be used for official purposes by district attorney offices, and for law-enforcement purposes by police departments. Lynda Russell, Tenaha's district attorney, has denied any impropriety. However, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas re-prosecuted drug offenders after officials in Tenaha and Shelby County gave known traffickers lenient sentences in exchange for cash forfeitures. In 2008, Shelby county was investigated by the Department of Justice's civil rights division over an allegation made by its former auditor that seized funds had been used for campaign materials in local elections.|$|R
50|$|The {{champion}} {{was asked}} {{a maximum of}} six true/false questions in a single category, starting at one point and increasing by one per question to a maximum value of six.

[...] Rio de Janeiro State Sports Superintendent Ricardo Labre said, [...] "The chances are 99.9 percent against the bout being held here." [...] He said setting up the ring, seats and other equipment [...] "would destroy our grass. This is a soccer field." [...] The bout was officially called off on May 12. Ali made $250,000 and Holmes $100,000 in <b>forfeit</b> <b>money.</b> After the cancellation, Holmes signed to fight Scott LeDoux, whom he stopped in seven rounds on July 7.|$|E
5000|$|Mameluke's {{career began}} in {{controversy}} {{when he made}} his debut at Newmarket in April. He ran in the Riddlesworth Stakes, which at that time had a prestige almost equal to the Classics. Mameluke finished second to an unnamed filly by Partisan (later named Donna Maria), but the judge mistakenly awarded second place to his stable companion Glenartney, who was carrying the same colours. This error would have been unimportant if the winner had not then been disqualified for carrying the wrong weight. Glenartney, rather than Mameluke, was therefore credited as the official winner of the race. Mameluke was then able to take two valuable prizes without having to gallop for them. On 20 April he was allowed to walk over for a Sweepstakes at Newmarket when his opponents were withdrawn. He was next scheduled {{to take part in a}} match race on 30 April, but collected the £200 <b>forfeit</b> <b>money</b> without running when his opponent, a filly later named as [...] "Mulebird" [...] failed to appear.|$|E
50|$|On August 25, 2005, {{three people}} were indicted on {{two counts of}} fraud and one count of {{criminal}} conspiracy. On March 6, 2006 Jennifer R. Clason, 33, of Raymond, New Hampshire, pled guilty and was to be sentenced on June 5, 2006. She faced a maximum sentence of 5 years {{on each of the}} three counts and agreed to <b>forfeit</b> <b>money</b> received in the commission of these crimes. On June 25, 2007, the remaining two were convicted of spamming out millions of e-mail messages that included hardcore pornographic images. Jeffrey A. Kilbride, 41, of Venice, California, and James R. Schaffer, 41, of Paradise Valley, Arizona, were convicted on eight counts in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, Arizona. Both were sentenced to five years in prison, and ordered to forfeit $1,300,000. The charges included conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, and transportation of obscene materials. The trial, which began on June 5, was the first to include charges under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, according to the Department of Justice. The specific law that prosecutors used under the CAN-Spam Act was designed {{to crack down on the}} transmission of pornography in spam. Two other men, Andrew D. Ellifson, 31, of Scottsdale, Arizona, and Kirk F. Rogers, 43, of Manhattan Beach, California, also pled guilty to charges under the CAN-SPAM Act related to this spamming operation. Both were scheduled to be sentenced on June 5, 2006 in Phoenix.|$|E

40|$|Ian Ayres {{brings the}} central {{insights}} of behavior economics alive through sustained story telling. His latest book 2 ̆ 2 Carrots and Sticks 2 ̆ 2 teaches about the personal lives {{of men and}} women who have used these insights to their advantage, as well as how they are being used by business. Professor Ayres has published more than nine books and more than 100 articles on a wide range of topics, including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal Business bestseller “Super Crunchers. 2 ̆ 2 Behavioral economics can help us supercharge incentives by identifying when carrots are likely to work better than sticks. Though losses may loom large, sometimes contingent rewards can be even more effective. 2 ̆ 2 Carrots and Sticks 2 ̆ 2 show when contingent rewards work better than punishments, and where contracts work best with both carrots and sticks—punished if you fail as well as rewarded if you succeed. For example, some dieters have been entering into pari-mutuel commitments to lose weight, where they <b>forfeit</b> <b>money</b> if they fail to lose weight, but potentially receive the forfeiture of others who fail to lose. Some stop-smoking contracts also have this feature. This free event was presented in collaboration by the Yale Club of Nevada, UNLV Boyd School of Law, and the law firm Greenberg Traurig, LLP...|$|E
40|$|Contractual {{liability}} is {{an important}} topic of the ongoing reform of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations (2007 - 2009), which aims to harmonize the national legislation in this field with {{the laws of the}} European Union. In this paper the author analyzes the evolution of the traditional European civil codes (the German BGB, French Code civil, the Austrian ABGB the Swiss OR and the Hungarian Civil Code), with due attention to the doctrine and jurisprudence, taking into account the proposed reforms of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations concerning issues of contractual liability, such as the legal consequences of nonperformance, misperformance, default, etc. The author is of the opinion that the notion of the breach of contract doesn't cover all the cases in which contractual liability arises, although it embraces nonperformance, misperformance and default. The notion of contractual liability, namely, covers not only the cases of breach of contract, but the infringement of public policy, good morals and mandatory rules, which all lead to the nullity of the contract. In cases of voidable contracts (that is in case of defects of contractual will, such as mistake, deceit and duress) it is questionable whether the scope of contractual liability should be extended to mistake, which is a case of nonconscious discrepancy between contractual will and its expression. It is undisputable that contractual liability arises in case of deceit and duress, to the burden of the party acting in bad faith. The rescission of contract entails a separate complex of legal issues, since it may be justified by the other party's breach of the contract. It can also be onesided, two-sided or by a mutual agreement. Furthermore, specific rules apply to rescission of contract due to changed circumstances. In case of termination of a contract by mutual agreement, the parties usually agree on the extent of liability, that is on the extent of indemnification. Contractual liability is also specific that, according to the principle of parties' autonomy, the parties always may in advance agree on the extent of damages for the case of breach of contract, in a form of a clause on liquidated damages, <b>forfeit</b> <b>money,</b> suretyship for indemnification, the limitation of the sum insured in insurance contracts, clauses in the general conditions of business, etc. The author calls {{attention to the fact that}} these clauses in certain extent limit the scope of the indemnification for breach of a contract, according to which this liability differs from the liability for torts, where the principle of full indemnification applies as a rule...|$|E
