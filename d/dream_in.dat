5|$|Early {{drafts of}} the novel {{entitled}} Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby have been published. A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby's <b>dream</b> <b>in</b> Trimalchio. Another {{difference is that the}} argument between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby is more even, although Daisy still returns to Tom.|$|E

2500|$|Studies have {{observed}} signs of <b>dreaming</b> <b>in</b> all mammals studied, including monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, elephants, and shrews. There {{have also been}} signs of <b>dreaming</b> <b>in</b> birds and reptiles. Sleeping and dreaming are intertwined. Scientific research results regarding the function of <b>dreaming</b> <b>in</b> animals remain disputable; however, the function of sleeping in living organisms is increasingly clear. For example, [...] sleep deprivation experiments conducted on rats and other animals {{have resulted in the}} deterioration of physiological functioning and actual tissue damage.|$|R
5|$|Herg√© {{returned}} to creating fictional nations as allusions to real countries in subsequent Adventures, such as Syldavia and Borduria (based largely on Yugoslavia and Nazi Germany) in King Ottokar's Sceptre and Sondonesia (based on Indonesia) in Flight 714 to Sydney. He also re-used other elements pioneered in The Broken Ear {{in his later}} Adventures: a parrot in The Castafiore Emerald, a ravine crash in The Calculus Affair, a fireball and vivid <b>dream</b> <b>in</b> The Seven Crystal Balls, and a firing squad in Tintin and the Picaros. Tintin {{returned to}} San Theodores in Tintin and the Picaros, in which the characters Pablo and Ridgewell also made a reappearance.|$|E
5|$|Homer's {{escape from}} the {{overturned}} paddy wagon is a homage to the 1993 film The Fugitive. Chief Wiggum's <b>dream</b> <b>in</b> which Lisa speaks backwards is reference to Twin Peaks and Special Agent Dale Cooper's interaction with the Man from Another Place. While recording Lisa's lines for the segment, Yeardley Smith recorded the part backwards; the recording was in turn reversed, a technique known as phonetic reversal, the same technique used on Twin Peaks. Several other parts out of the segment are direct references to the dream, including a moving shadow on the curtain, and Wiggum's hair standing straight up after waking.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{a larger}} 100cc HA05E engine model was {{introduced}} especially for Asian markets. The newer 100cc model was developed exclusively for Southeast Asian market, especially in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, where underbones were very popular, with new {{features such as}} a telescopic front suspension to replace the older leading link suspension, and a four-speed transmission to replace the older three-speed transmission used in older Cub variants. The 100cc model was initially known as the Honda <b>Dream</b> <b>in</b> Thailand and Honda EX5 in Malaysia, before being standardised as the Honda EX5 <b>Dream</b> <b>in</b> 2003. In addition, Honda Japan began importing the made-in-Thailand Dream as the Super Cub C100EX in 1988. The Japanese C100EX was later being facelifted in 1993, while the Southeast Asian EX5 Dream retains the 1986 design until the present day, with only minor cosmetic changes. In 2011, the carbureted EX5 Dream was phased out in Thailand and being replaced with the fuel-injected Honda Dream 110i, with the powertrain being derived from the fuel-injected Honda Wave 110i.|$|E

40|$|As {{an attempt}} to clarify the {{clinical}} use of <b>dreams</b> <b>in</b> psychotherapy, survey of clinical use of dreams among the eminent psychotherapists was made. The survey showed the marked similarity of using <b>dreams</b> <b>in</b> practice of therapy even though the formulations of the psychology of dreams widely differ. It is considered that E. Erikson's epigenetic approarch to the dream interpretation showed the possibility to integrate the divergence of the dream theories and also it might help to integrate the normative study of dreams and the clinical use of <b>dreams</b> <b>in</b> psychotherapy...|$|R
5|$|LCD Soundsystem {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, This Is Happening in May 2010. The album was LCD Soundsystem's first to {{debut in the}} top ten of the Billboard 200, selling around 31,000 copies in its first week of sales.

5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{crossover}} or mashup title bringing the popular video game characters Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog into one game had been a long-running <b>dream</b> <b>in</b> video game culture. Although Somari does not feature both characters in the same game, the fact that Mario had been placed {{into the world of}} Sonic the Hedgehog was registered with astonishment. Russian gaming magazine Great Drakon scored the game 4/10 (only 2/10 for sales volume) and commented in a review that at last 8-bit console gamers could roughly gain the experience of 16-bit gaming as with Sonic.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} six levels {{and a final}} battle. The player {{controls}} Bart as he helps his sister Maggie recover her ball, explores the basement and attic of the Simpsons' home, sneaks out to the movie theater and the Springfield Mall, and has a <b>dream</b> <b>in</b> which he is inserted into the Itchy & Scratchy universe.

However, he soon starts to suspect that Martin may be innocent of the crime he has been arrested for. Black also has a <b>dream</b> <b>in</b> which a mutilated Bletcher tries and fails to speak to him, which leads Black to believe he has lost his ability to see into the minds of others.|$|E

5|$|Worsley, in London while {{awaiting}} a new berth, joined the expedition {{as a result}} of a <b>dream,</b> <b>in</b> which he was navigating a ship around icebergs drifting down Burlington Street. He took it as a premonition and the next day hurried down to Burlington Street, where he noticed a sign on a building advertising what Shackleton called the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. He promptly entered the building whereupon he met Shackleton. After a few minutes of conversation, Shackleton offered him the captaincy of the Endurance, which Worsley accepted.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game's development, {{the music}} team were shown an early build before {{starting}} {{work on the}} score. Their work was mostly complete later in development but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. Edgar Froese, Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music. He recorded with Tangerine <b>Dream</b> <b>in</b> Austria but further work was conducted at Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist and Oh No used as well.|$|E
5|$|Gaiman {{revisited}} Hell {{as depicted}} by Alan Moore in Swamp Thing, {{beginning with a}} guest appearance by Jack Kirby's Etrigan the Demon in issue No. 4 (April 1989). The story introduces Hell's Hierarchy (as their entry is titled in Who's Who in the DC Universe), headed by Lucifer (who would spin off into his own series in 1999), Beelzebub (later adversary to Kid Eternity), and Azazel, whom Dream defeated later in the series. Dream visited the Justice League International in the following issue, No. 5 (May 1989). Although multiple mainstream DC characters appeared in the series throughout its run, such as Martian Manhunter and Scarecrow, {{this would not be}} the norm. Gaiman and artist Mike Dringenberg introduced Death, the older sister of <b>Dream,</b> <b>in</b> issue No. 8 (August 1989).|$|E

5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's <b>Dream</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E
5|$|In Roanoke, Virginia, Wayne Weinsider (Bruce Campbell) and his {{pregnant}} wife Laura (Lisa Jane Persky) learn via an ultrasound scan that their unborn child has bizarre physical abnormalities, such as horn-like protrusions. Weinsider appears to be especially distraught after hearing the news. That night, Laura has a terrifying <b>dream</b> <b>in</b> which a demon-like figure snatches the baby from her womb. When she wakes up, the couple discover that Laura has seemingly miscarried. Laura's brother, local deputy sheriff Arky Stevens, reports her story to the X-Files section at the FBI. Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) discards the report, but Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) salvages the case and travels to Virginia, along with Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to interview the Weinsiders.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a <b>dream</b> <b>in</b> which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
