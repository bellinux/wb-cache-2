5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} only at the fringes of <b>jackal</b> territory. Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets, with the <b>jackal</b> being three times bigger than the red fox. The red fox will avoid close {{proximity}} with jackals, and fox populations decrease where jackals are abundant. Striped hyenas prey on golden jackals, and three <b>jackal</b> carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestor}} {{of the golden}} <b>jackal</b> {{is believed to be}} the extinct Arno river dog that lived in Mediterranean Europe 1.9million years ago. It is described as being a small, jackal-like canine. Genetic studies indicate that the golden <b>jackal</b> expanded from India at the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago. The oldest golden <b>jackal</b> fossil is 20,000 years old and was found at the Ksar Akil rock shelter near Beirut, Lebanon. The oldest golden <b>jackal</b> fossils in Europe were found in Greece and are 7,000 years old. There are seven subspecies of the golden <b>jackal.</b> The golden <b>jackal</b> is not closely related to the African black-backed or side-striped jackals, being instead more closely related to the gray wolf, coyote, African golden wolf, and Ethiopian wolf. It is capable of producing fertile hybrids with both the gray wolf and the African golden wolf. Dog-jackal hybrids called Sulimov dogs are in service at the Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow where they are deployed by the Russian airline Aeroflot for scent-detection.|$|E

40|$|Eight black-backed <b>jackals</b> {{and seven}} side-striped <b>jackals</b> were given SAD (Berne) rabies vaccine by direct oral instillation. Three {{different}} vaccine doses were used: 106. 3, 106. 8 and 107. 5 median tissue culture infectious doses. Two additional <b>jackals</b> were given vaccine in chicken heads. One group of <b>jackals</b> was challenged with a lethal dose of jackal-derived rabies virus 1 {{month and a}} second group 12 months after vaccination. All 17 vaccinated <b>jackals</b> developed high and persistent serum neutralizing antibody titres. All challenged <b>jackals</b> resisted a lethal dose of rabies virus, whereas 3 control <b>jackals</b> given the same challenge developed rabies...|$|R
50|$|Golden <b>jackals</b> tend to {{dominate}} smaller canid species. In Israel, red foxes will avoid close physical proximity with <b>jackals,</b> with {{studies showing that}} fox populations decrease where <b>jackals</b> are abundant. Conversely, <b>jackals</b> vacate areas inhabited by wolves, which {{have been known to}} approach jackal-calling stations at a quick trotting pace, presumably to chase them away.|$|R
5|$|Outside of India, golden <b>jackals</b> in the Caucasus and Turkey {{indicate}} the next highest genetic diversity, while those in Europe indicate low genetic diversity, which confirms their more recent expansion into Europe. Genetic data {{indicates that the}} golden <b>jackals</b> of the Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia may represent two ancient populations that have survived into modern times. Golden <b>jackals</b> in the Balkans originated from those expanding from southeast Europe and from the Caucasus. Golden <b>jackals</b> from both the Balkans and the Caucasus are expanding into the Baltic. In the Middle East, golden <b>jackals</b> from Israel have a higher genetic diversity than European <b>jackals.</b> This {{is thought to be}} due to Israeli <b>jackals</b> having hybridized with dogs, gray wolves, and African golden wolves, creating a hybrid zone in Israel.|$|R

5|$|The golden <b>jackal</b> {{may have}} once been tamed in Neolithic Turkey 11,000 years ago, {{as there is}} a {{sculpture}} of a man cradling a <b>jackal</b> found in Göbekli Tepe. French explorers during the 19thcentury noted that people in the Levant kept golden jackals in their homes. The Kalmyk people near the Caspian Sea were known to frequently cross their dogs with jackals, and Balkan shepherds once crossed their sheepdogs with jackals.|$|E
50|$|Black-backed <b>jackals</b> {{can carry}} {{diseases}} such as rabies, canine parvovirus, canine distemper, canine adenovirus, Ehrlichia canis and African horse sickness. <b>Jackals</b> in Etosha National Park may carry anthrax. Black-backed <b>jackals</b> are major rabies vectors, and {{have been associated with}} epidemics, which appear to cycle every four to eight years. <b>Jackals</b> in Zimbabwe are able to maintain rabies independently of other species. Although oral vaccinations are effective in <b>jackals,</b> the long-term control of rabies continues to be a problem in areas where stray dogs are not given the same immunisation.|$|R

5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that is inherited from one of its parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the golden <b>jackal</b> form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by golden jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes golden jackals from all of the other regions. Indian golden jackals exhibit the highest genetic diversity, and those from northern and western India are the most basal, which indicates that India was the center from which golden jackals spread. The extant golden <b>jackal</b> lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, the warmer regions of India and Southeast Asia provided a refuge when compared with the surrounding areas. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum {{and the beginning of the}} warming cycles, the golden <b>jackal</b> lineage expanded out of India and into Eurasia to reach the Middle East and Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} golden jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (African golden wolf), {{reducing the number of}} golden <b>jackal</b> subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this study shows the golden <b>jackal</b> diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the African golden wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the golden <b>jackal</b> and the African golden wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, some golden jackals carry {{intestinal}} worms (helminths) and Echinococcus granulosus. In Israel, some jackals carry intestinal helminths and Leishmania tropica infection. In Romania, a <b>jackal</b> {{was found}} to be carrying Trichinella britovi. In northeastern Italy, the <b>jackal</b> is a carrier of the tick species Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus, and the smallest human fluke Metagonimus yokogawai that can be caught from ingesting infected raw fish, which can lead to metagonimiasis. In Hungary, some jackals carry dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis, and some have provided the first record in Hungary of Trichinella spiralis and the first record in Europe of Echinococcus multilocularis. The <b>jackal</b> is dispersing across Europe through rivers and valleys, bringing parasites into regions where these did not previously exist.|$|E

5|$|In Russia and {{the other}} nations of the former Soviet Union, golden jackals are {{considered}} furbearers of low quality because of their sparse, coarse, and monotonously colored fur. <b>Jackal</b> hairs have very little fur fiber; therefore, their pelts have a flat appearance. The jackals of Asia and the Middle East produce the coarsest pelts, though this can be remedied during the dressing process. Elburz in northern Iran produces the softest furs. <b>Jackal</b> skins are not graded to a fur standard, and are made into collars, women's coats, and fur coats. During the 1880s, 200 jackals were captured annually in Mervsk and in the Zakatal area of the Transcaucasus, with 300 jackals being captured there during 1896. In this same period, a total of 10,000 jackals were taken within Russia and their furs sent exclusively to the Nizhegorod fair. In the early 1930s there were 20,000–25,000 <b>jackal</b> skins tanned annually in the Soviet Union, but these could not be utilized within the country, and so the majority were exported to the United States. Commencing from 1949, they were all used within the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The golden <b>jackal</b> {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the <b>jackal</b> diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia fistula.|$|E
5|$|The golden <b>jackal</b> often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, the <b>jackal</b> conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they can dig Indian gerbils out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4–5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one <b>jackal</b> to another.|$|E

5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden <b>jackal</b> is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden <b>Jackal</b> informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the golden <b>jackal</b> in Europe.
