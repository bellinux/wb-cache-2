5|$|Part II {{begins with}} the tenor singing a recitative and a da capo aria in a minor mode, {{characterized}} by its extensive use of dotted rhythms.

5|$|The cantata BWV 39 is in two parts, {{conforming}} {{to the structure}} of the Meiningen series. The first part begins with a long choral movement for four-part chorus and full orchestra. It is followed by a recitative <b>for</b> <b>bass</b> and an aria for alto, with obbligato violin and oboe. The second part begins with the central movement based on the New Testament text, a solo <b>for</b> <b>bass,</b> as vox Christi, accompanied by an obbligato violoncello. It is followed by an aria for soprano with obbligato recorders in unison. The second recitative for alto and strings leads into the concluding four-part chorale in which the choir doubled by the full orchestra. The complex scoring of the monumental opening movement, employing full orchestra and chorus, contrasts with that of the succeeding non-choral movements, which are accompanied by smaller more intimate groups of instruments.|$|E
5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single woofer <b>for</b> <b>bass</b> and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both horn and drum at a constant speed.|$|E

It is arranged <b>for</b> <b>bass,</b> drums, and string instruments, {{written in the}} rock idiom with tempos centered on rock-based patterns by Palmer. Axelrod used contrast in his orchestral compositions and interspersed the album's euphoric psychedelic R form with dramatic, harrowing arrangements to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. The music's reverent, psychedelic overtones evoke their themes of innocence and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|The cantata in {{structured}} in six movements, beginning with an aria for tenor (T), {{followed by two}} pairs of recitative and aria, one <b>for</b> <b>bass</b> (B), the other for the duet of soprano (S) and alto (A), and a concluding chorale when all four parts are united.

5|$|Hammond console organs {{come with}} a wooden pedalboard played with the feet, <b>for</b> <b>bass</b> notes. Most console Hammond pedalboards have 25 notes, with the bottom note a low C and the top note a middle C two octaves higher. Hammond used a 25-note pedalboard because he found that on {{traditional}} 32-note pedalboards used in church pipe organs, the top seven notes were seldom used. The Hammond Concert models E, RT, RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 had 32-note American Guild of Organists (AGO) pedalboards {{going up to the}} G above middle C as the top note. The RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 also contained a separate solo pedal system that had its own volume control and various other features. Spinet models have 12- or 13-note miniature pedalboards.|$|E
