40|$|The rotor-stator {{clearance}} of viscous molecular {{vacuum pump}} in the static state {{is determined by}} manufacturing process of the pump components and its assembly technique. When a pump rotor starts to have the operating speed a static clearance is transformed into dynamic one. A <b>dynamic</b> <b>clearance</b> is considerably less than the static one owing to increasing pump rotor diameter {{as a result of}} centrifugal forces and thermal expansion of material. Moreover, a <b>dynamic</b> <b>clearance</b> non-evenly changes {{along the length of the}} vacuum pump wet end depending on the rotor design. To simplify the model under consideration, as an object of study, a single-stage viscous molecular vacuum pump is selected, as its working part is a cylinder. To determine the effect of centrifugal forces and thermal expansion of material is quite simple, as there are a number of techniques allowing calculation. A number of problems arise when there are channels on the outer surface of the rotor, since a changing diameter of the smooth cylinder substantially differs from the changing diameter of the cylinder with the channels. The set problem is solved by numerical methods using the software package SolidWorks Simulation. To use the SolidWorks Simulation software, an analytical calculation of increasing rotor diameter has been compared with and the numerical one. The obtained results are in agreement within a permissible accuracy of 15 %. Therefore, this software package may be used to solve the problem with the cylinder, having channels on the outer surface. The paper presents results of changing diameter of rotor with rectangular channels. Though, channels of the other profiles depending on the required pump performance data are possible at the pump-wet end. The calculated rotor surface temperatures change from 300 K to 500 K, and rotating speeds vary within 0 to 7000 rev/min. Carbon steel is used as a material, but here the use of aluminum alloys is supposed. The results obtained allow us to estimate a <b>dynamic</b> <b>clearance</b> size at the viscous molecular vacuum pump-wet end under operation conditions. Creating a methodology for determining the clearance size is important for these pumps, since its value has a significant impact on the pump performance data. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe use {{of dynamic}} seals {{to reduce the}} rotor/stator <b>dynamic</b> <b>clearance</b> in jet engine {{compressor}} stages leads to a higher rubbing occurrence between each blade and the coated inside of the casing.

The platform is instrumented to allow a dynamic measurement of forces and displacements as well as high-speed imaging of the blade/seal interaction zone throughout the experiment.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{demonstration of}} the “Aerostatic Seal” in a half scale rotating facility is described in this paper. The Aerostatic seal is a novel <b>dynamic</b> <b>clearance</b> seal specifically designed for steam turbine secondary gas path applications. The seal responds to radial rotor excursions, so a reduced clearance can be maintained compared to conventional labyrinth seal without damage to the seal. This enables increased turbine performance through reduced leakage and increased tolerance of turbine transient events typically found during start up. The seal {{is an extension of}} the existing retractable seal design already deployed in commercial steam turbines. The seal was tested in the Durham Rotating Seals Rig, which was developed specifically to test this device. The rig featured a rotor designed to run with large eccentricities to model high speed radial rotor excursions, and the seal was instrumented to measure the real time seal response to the rotor. The experimental campaign has conclusively demonstrated the ability of the seal to dynamically respond to the rotor position. The key result is that the seal is able to track the rotor position at high speed, and hence maintain a mean seal clearance that is lower than the rotor eccentricity. Overall this work marks a key milestone {{in the development of the}} Aerostatic Seal, and leads the way to testing in a steam environment and application in steam turbine plant...|$|E

40|$|Railway tunnel {{clearance}} {{is directly}} related to the safe operation of trains and upgrading of freight capacity. As more and more railway are put into operation and the operation is continuously becoming faster, the railway tunnel clearance inspection should be more precise and efficient. In view of the problems existing in traditional tunnel clearance inspection methods, such as low density, slow speed and a lot of manual operations, this paper proposes a tunnel clearance inspection approach based on 3 D point clouds obtained by a mobile laser scanning system (MLS). First, a dynamic coordinate system for railway tunnel clearance inspection has been proposed. A rail line extraction algorithm based on 3 D linear fitting is implemented from the segmented point cloud to establish a <b>dynamic</b> <b>clearance</b> coordinate system. Second, a method to seamlessly connect all rail segments based on the railway clearance restrictions, and a seamless rail alignment is formed sequentially from the middle tunnel section to both ends. Finally, based on the rail alignment and the track clearance coordinate system, different types of clearance frames are introduced for intrusion operation with the tunnel section to realize the tunnel clearance inspection. By taking the Shuanghekou Tunnel of the Chengdu–Kunming Railway as an example, when the clearance inspection is carried out by the method mentioned herein, its precision can reach 0. 03 m, and difference types of clearances can be effectively calculated.

40|$|The NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) has {{provided}} a unique capability for aeroelastic testing for over thirty-five years. The facility has a rich history of significant contributions {{to the design of}} many United States commercial transports and military aircraft. The facility has many features which contribute to its uniqueness for aeroelasticity testing; however, perhaps the most important facility capability is the use of a heavy gas test medium to achieve higher test densities. Higher test medium densities substantially improve model building requirements and therefore simplify the fabrication process for building aeroelastically scaled wind-tunnel models. The heavy gas also provides other testing benefits, including reduction in the power requirements to operate the facility during testing. Unfortunately, the use of the original heavy gas has been curtailed due to environmental concerns. A new gas, referred to as R- 134 a, has been identified as a suitable replacement for the former TDT heavy gas. The TDT is currently undergoing a facility upgrade to allow testing in R- 134 a heavy gas. This replacement gas will result in an operational test envelope, model scaling advantages, and general testing capabilities similar to those available with the former TDT heavy gas. As such, the TDT is expected to remain a viable facility for aeroelasticity research and aircraft <b>dynamic</b> <b>clearance</b> testing well into the 21 st century.

The admittance policies (sailing speed and minimum safe underkeel clearance) for safe navigation will be established.

To assess the feasibility of this concept and assist the development of these novel structures, the NASA Lewis Research Center developed in-house computational capabilities for composite structures with piezoelectric actuators and sensors, and subsequently used them to simulate candidate active casing structures. The simulations indicated the potential of active casings to modify the blade tip clearance enough to improve stage efficiency.

40|$|Due to <b>dynamic</b> effects, <b>clearances,</b> {{manufacturing}} and assembly errors in form-closed cam mechanisms, the follower jump can also occur. For conjugate cam mechanisms {{a technique to}} avoid the follower jump {{without the use of}} a spring involves making the conjugate cam profiles bigger than the kinematical ones by adding an external offset. This strategy produces an interference fit between the conjugate cam profiles and the follower train. This paper presents an ordered procedure to study the influence that the planned interference fit has on the evaluation of the contact forces, the expected fatigue life of the rollers, contact pressures and the lubrication conditions. The study is based on a conjugate cam mechanism with translational roller followers used in a real automatic process for manufacturing muselets. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is proposed and the Hertzian theory for general profiles is used to model the nonlinear contact stiffness between the cams and the crowned rollers. The dynamic model predicts {{that it is difficult to}} obtain conjugate cam mechanisms with an infinite expected fatigue life of the rollers just by considering typical achievable manufacturing errors or clearances, and as happens in reality, a set-up process is highly recommended. The procedure is also tested with measured manufacturing errors on a coordinate measure machine—CMM—and with measured radial internal clearances for the rollers measured by an experimental apparatus. Also, to evaluate lubrication conditions, surface finishing measurements have been taken of the cams and the rollers with a surface profiler. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of aircraft gas turbine engines {{is sensitive to}} {{the distance between the}} tips of its turbine blades and its shroud, which serves as its containment structure. Maintaining tighter clearance between these components has been shown to increase turbine efficiency, increase fuel efficiency, and reduce the turbine inlet temperature, and this correlates to a longer time-on-wing for the engine. Therefore, there is a desire to maintain a tight clearance in the turbine, which requires fast response active clearance control. Fast response active tip clearance control will require an actuator to modify the physical or effective tip clearance in the turbine. This paper evaluates the requirements of a generic active turbine tip clearance actuator for a modern commercial aircraft engine using the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation 40 k (C-MAPSS 40 k) software that has previously been integrated with a <b>dynamic</b> tip <b>clearance</b> model.
