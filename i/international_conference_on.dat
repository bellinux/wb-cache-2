5|$|There {{was also}} growing {{concern that the}} calls by Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia for the {{neutralization}} of his own country, and his attempts to convene an <b>international</b> <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> the matter, would increase such sentiment in Vietnam, something that was oft-repeated in the American media. Minh publicly opposed Sihanouk's ideas and similar plans mooted by French President Charles de Gaulle, but discussion of the concepts continued to grow.|$|E
5|$|At least 41 systems {{measure the}} severity, or grade, of a mild head injury, {{and there is}} little {{agreement}} about which is best. In an effort to simplify, the 2nd <b>International</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a 'simple' or 'complex' classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days), and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the <b>International</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> Weights and Measures {{redefined the}} meter {{in terms of}} a red cadmium {{spectral}} line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the NATO attacks, the Pakistani {{government}} refused to attend the Bonn conference scheduled on 5 December 2011. The event in Bonn, Germany is an important <b>international</b> <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> Afghanistan. International pressure over Pakistan amounted as it refused to attend the Bonn conference. Secretary Hillary Clinton contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister but her plea was rejected because Pakistani public opinion prohibited attendance. The conference was generally regarded as a disappointment, partially because of Pakistan's absence.|$|E
5|$|Two {{international}} {{emergency medicine}} conferences were {{launched in the}} 1980s, the <b>International</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> Emergency Medicine (ICEM) and the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine Conference (WADEM).

5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first <b>international</b> <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the <b>International</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E
