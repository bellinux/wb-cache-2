5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|Club Tepes, {{named after}} Prince Vlad Tepes—better known as Vlad the Impaler, {{who was the}} {{inspiration}} for Dracula—was shot inside a closed-down and redecorated nightclub, with extras recruited from other Vancouver clubs. The location for Kristen's house was the mansion of hockey player Pavel Bure, then the leading name of the Vancouver Canucks. The producers had an agreement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> filming from {{all but one of}} Bure's neighbors, who was absent during the petitioning. Said neighbor later tried to sue Fox, only agreeing to let production continue after receiving an indenization.|$|E

5|$|It was {{discovered}} in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, {{one of the pioneers}} of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E

5|$|As regards numbers, the mid-2nd-century army {{contained}} c. 80,000 cavalry out of c. 385,000 total effectives i.e. cavalry constituted c. 21% of {{the total}} forces. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> army, about {{one third of the}} army units in the Notitia are cavalry, but in numbers cavalry were a smaller proportion {{of the total}} because cavalry units were on average smaller than infantry units. For example, in the comitatus, cavalry vexillationes were probably half the size of infantry legiones. Overall, the available evidence suggests that the proportion of cavalry was much the same as in the 2nd century. Examples: in 478, a comitatus of 38,000 men contained 8,000 cavalry (21%). In 357, the comitatus of Gaul, 13–15,000 strong, contained an estimated 3,000 cavalry (20–23%).|$|E

A third school, the Sara Cohen School in Rutherford Street, was established in 1926. This school caters for special needs pupils from primary school age through adulthood. The school was named <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> wife of Mark Cohen, city councillor, campaigner for women's rights, {{and editor of the}} Evening Star newspaper from 1893 to 1920.

5|$|During the Victorian era, Clevedon {{became a}} popular seaside town, having {{previously}} been an agricultural village. Due to improving transport links, via the Clevedon Branch Line, Clevedon {{was able to}} cater <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 19th century craze for bathing in the sea with saltwater baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations can still be seen), and bathing machines on the main beach. Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. At Clevedon tourism grew following {{the opening of a}} branch line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter Line, enabling travel {{from the rest of the}} country. It was also proposed that a pier could form part of a route from London to South Wales with the use of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary. An enabling act was submitted to parliament in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest, Armenian media {{claimed that}} Azerbaijan's {{broadcaster}} had {{cut off the}} broadcast when {{it became apparent that}} Armenia had won; however, it was disputed whether the contest was even broadcast in Azerbaijan as they had not yet participated. Accordingly, as Azerbaijan prepared to host the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest following its victory in 2011, a group of Armenian musicians led a boycott effort, and the country would ultimately withdraw from the contest, causing the broadcaster to be fined <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> notice. Armenia returned in the 2013 edition, which was held in Sweden. The move was criticized by an Azeri politician and a representative of the country's state broadcaster, who felt that Armenia's participation could have been a symbol of peace between the two nations, and that the decision would further damage the country's reputation.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Florida Legislature {{recognized}} {{demands for}} higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university would establish a campus in Dania Beach in 1997 and another campus in the City of Davie in western Broward County in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (20 ha) of land in Port St. Lucie in 1994 to establish a campus on the Treasure Coast. This would be the institution's fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in 1999 when it opened its Jupiter Campus, named <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> John D. MacArthur. This campus houses the university's honors college.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, the {{production}} of weapons and equipment was highly centralised (and presumably standardised) {{in a number of}} major state-run arms factories, or fabricae, documented in the Notitia. It is unknown when these were first established, but they certainly existed by the time of Diocletian. In the 2nd century, there is evidence of fabricae inside legionary bases and even in the much smaller auxiliary forts, staffed by the soldiers themselves. But there is no evidence, literary or archaeological, of fabricae outside military bases and staffed by civilians during the Principate (although their existence cannot be excluded, as no archaeological evidence has been found <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> fabricae either). Late fabricae were located in border provinces and dioceses. Some were general manufacturers producing both armour and weapons (fabrica scutaria et armorum) or just one of the two. Others were specialised in {{one or more of the}} following: fabrica spatharia (sword manufacture), lanciaria (spears), arcuaria (bows), sagittaria (arrows), loricaria (body armour), clibanaria (cataphract armour), and ballistaria (catapults).|$|E
5|$|King Francis II died on 5 December 1560, of {{a middle}} ear {{infection}} that led to an abscess in his brain. Mary was grief-stricken. Her mother-in-law, Catherine de' Medici, became regent <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> king's ten-year-old brother Charles IX, who inherited the French throne. Mary returned to Scotland nine months later, arriving in Leith on 19 August 1561. Having lived in France {{since the age of}} five, Mary had little direct experience of the dangerous and complex political situation in Scotland. As a devout Catholic, she was regarded with suspicion by many of her subjects, {{as well as by the}} Queen of England. Scotland was torn between Catholic and Protestant factions, and Mary's illegitimate half-brother, the Earl of Moray, was a leader of the Protestants. The Protestant reformer John Knox preached against Mary, condemning her for hearing Mass, dancing, and dressing too elaborately. She summoned him to her presence to remonstrate with him unsuccessfully, and later charged him with treason, but he was acquitted and released.|$|E

5|$|Mendelevium was {{discovered}} by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles in 1955, the same method still used to produce it today. It was named after Dmitri Mendeleev, father of the periodic table of the chemical elements. Using available microgram quantities of the isotope einsteinium-253, over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced each hour. The chemistry of mendelevium is typical <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced mendelevium {{and all of its}} isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{cemetery}} represents a fusion of Christian and pagan Saxon customs. It was not {{until the end of the}} 7th century that the practice of burying people in consecrated ground around a church became the norm. There are examples of known Christians being buried in an ostensibly pagan fashion, as was the case <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 7th century Kentish princess Eormengyth, sister of the abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. She was buried in a traditional tumulus a mile east of her sister's minster. John Blair argues that the Church in early Saxon England may have tolerated Christians being given pagan burial rites due to the 'Christianising' effect this would have had on a pagan site. This would have been consistent with the advice given by Pope Gregory the Great in 601 that Saxon shrines should be converted to Christian use, rather than being destroyed, and that pagan festivals and rites should be converted into Christian ones. On this interpretation, the cemetery may symbolise the continuity between the pagan past and the increasingly Christianised present.|$|E
5|$|The Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center {{adjacent}} to the park headquarters at Moose, Wyoming, is open year-round. Opened in 2007 to replace an old, inadequate visitor center, the facility is named <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> U.S. Senator Craig Thomas and designed by acclaimed architect, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. It was financed {{with a combination of}} federal grants and private donations. An adjoining 154-seat auditorium was opened to the public in April 2011. To the north at Colter Bay Village on Jackson Lake, the Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum is open from the beginning of May to the early October. The Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum has housed the David T. Vernon Indian Arts Exhibit since 1972. The Colter Bay Visitor Center was built in 1956 and was determined in 2005 to be substandard for the proper care and display of the Indian arts collection. During the winter of 2011–2012, a $150,000 renovation project was completed at the center and a portion of the arts collection was made available for viewing when the center opened for the season in May 2012.|$|E
