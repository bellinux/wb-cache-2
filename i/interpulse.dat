The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed.

The commonly observed inferiority of mass-reared males, compared with wild males, when they are paired with wild females, is apparently due to their inadequate courtship. Anastrepha ludens males produce two types of wing vibration during courtship and mating, the "calling sound" and the "premating or precopulatory sound". There were clear differences in the calling songs between successful and unsuccessful courtships in sterile (irradiated) and fertile Mexican flies. Among sterile flies, successful males produce longer buzzes, shorter <b>interpulses</b> and a higher power spectrum in the signal. Fertile flies showed the same trend. For mating songs a significant difference occurred in two parameters: power spectrum between sterile and fertile flies {{with respect to the}} type of song, and the signal duration and intensity were greater in non-irradiated flies. Calling songs of wild flies compared with laboratory grown flies from Mexico had shorter <b>interpulses,</b> longer pulses, and a greater power spectrum.

When photoionization is taken into account with a level of seed charges of about 10 ^ 9 cm− 3, the dynamics and the characteristics of the discharge during a voltage pulse are shown to depend only weakly on the nature of negative seed charges (electrons or ions).

The simulation of several consecutive nanosecond voltage pulses at a frequency of 10 kHz shows that, at 1000 K, the discharge can reach in a few voltage pulses a stable 'quasi-periodic' glow regime in agreement with experiments.

Based on the observations that the <b>interpulses</b> seen in some pulsars are located asymmetrically between the main pulses, they assume that pulsar magnetic fields arise in general from off-centred dipoles. The asymmetric radiation reaction produced by such an inclined off-set rotating dipole accelerates the pulsars in a direction parallel to their spin axes and gives the observed velocities. Any verification of the above hypothesis hinges {{on the possibility of}} determining, and comparing, the angle projected by the spin axis on the sky S with the observed direction of motion of the pulsar V. According to Harrison and Tademaru's model 1, 2, these directions would coincide (V = S).

Unlike a bat’s echolocation, Aerodramus swiftlets make clicking noises that are well within the human range of hearing. The clicks consist of two broad band pulses (3-10 kHz) separated by a slight pause (1-3 milliseconds). The <b>interpulse</b> periods (IPPs) are varied depending on the level of light; in darker situations the bird emits shorter IPPs, as obstacles become harder to see, and longer IPPs are observed when the bird nears the exit of the cave. This behavior {{is similar to that of}} bats as they approach targets. The birds also emit a series of low clicks followed by a call when approaching the nests; presumably to warn nearby birds out of their way. It is thought that the double clicks are used to discriminate between individual birds. Aerodramus sawtelli, the Atiu swiftlet, and Aerodramus maximus, the black-nest swiftlet are the only known species which emit single clicks. The single click is thought be used to avoid voice overlap during echolocation. The use of a single click might be associated with an evolutionary shift in eastern Pacific swiftlets; determining how many clicks the Marquesan swiftlet emits could shed light on this. It was also discovered that both the Atiu swiftlet and the Papuan swiftlet emit clicks while foraging outside at dusk; the latter possibly only in these circumstances, considering that it might not nest in caves at all. Such behavior is not known to occur in other species, but quite possibly does, given that the Papuan and Atiu swiftlets are not closely related. However, it has recently been determined that the echolocation vocalizations do not agree with evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species as suggested by DNA sequence comparison. This suggests that as in bats, echolocation sounds, once present, adapt rapidly and independently to the particular species' acoustic environment.|$|E
5000|$|The FPS-16 system {{originally}} {{planned for the}} Project Mercury tracking network did not have adequate displays and controls for reliably acquiring the spacecraft in the acquisition time available. Consequently, a contract was negotiated with a manufacturer to provide the instrumentation radar acquisition (IRACQ)RAnge Acquisition modifications. For the near earth spacecraft involved a major limitation of the FPS-16 was its mechanical range gear box, a wonderful piece of engineering. However, for a target at a range typically, say, [...] at acquisition of signal AOS, the radar was tracking second time around, that is, the pulse received in this <b>interpulse</b> period was that due to the previously transmitted pulse, {{and it would be}} indicating a range of [...] As the range closed the return pulse became {{closer and closer to the}} time at which the next transmitter pulse should occur. If they were allowed to coincide, remembering that the transmit-receive switch disconnected the receive (Rx) and connected the transmit (Tx) to the antenna at that instant, track would be lost. So, IRACQ provided an electronic ranging system, the function of which was to provide the necessary gating pulses to the Az and El receiver channels so that the system would maintain angle track. The system utilized a voltage controlled crystal oscillator VCXO as the clock generator for the range counters. An early/late gate system derived an error voltage which either increased a closing target or decreased an opening target the clock frequency, thus causing the gates to be generated so as to track the target. It also, when the target reached an indicated range of less than 16000 yd, took over the generation of transmitter trigger pulses and delayed these by 16000 yd, thus enabling the received pulses to pass through the Big Bang, as it was called, of normally timed Tx pulses. The radar operator, would, while IRACQ maintained angle track be slewing the range system from minimum range to maximum so as to regain track of the target at its true range of <500 nmi (900 km). As the target passed through point of closest approach (PCA) and increased in range the process was repeated at maximum range indication. The most difficult passes were those in which the orbit was such that the target came to PCA at a range of, say 470 nmi. That pass required the radar operator to work very hard as the radar closed, and then opened in range through the Big Bang in short order. The IRACQ Console contained a C-scope associated with which was a small joy stick which gave C-scope operator control of the antenna angle servo systems so that he could adjust the pointing angle to acquire the signal. IRACQ included a scan generator which drove the antenna in one of several pre-determined search patterns around the nominal pointing position, it being desirable that IRACQ acquire the target as early as possible. An essential feature of this modification is that it allows examination of all incoming video signals and allows establishment of angle-only track. Once the spacecraft has been acquired, in angle range. Other features of the IRACQ system included additional angle scan modes and radar phasing controls to permit multiple radar interrogation of the spacecraft beacon. The addition of a beacon local oscillator wave meter permitted the determination of spacecraft-transmitter frequency drift.|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} paper {{outlined the}} general {{aspects of the}} theory of radio light curve and polarization formation for pulsars. We predicted the one-to-one correspondence between the tilt of the linear polarization position angle of the and the circular polarization. However, some of the radio pulsars indicate a clear deviation from that correlation. In this paper we apply the theory of the radio wave propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere for the analysis of individual effects leading to these deviations. We show that within our theory the circular polarization of a given mode can switch its sign, without the need to introduce a new radiation mode or other effects. Moreover, we show that the generation of different emission modes on different altitudes can explain pulsars, that presumably have the X-O-X light-curve pattern, different from what we predict. General properties of radio emission within our propagation theory are also discussed. In particular, we calculate the intensity patterns for different radiation altitudes and present light curves for different observer viewing angles. In this context we also study the light curves and polarization profiles for pulsars with <b>interpulses.</b> Further, we explain the characteristic width of the position angle curves by introducing the concept of a wide emitting region. Another important feature of radio polarization profiles is the shift of the position angle from the center, which in some cases demonstrates a weak dependence on the observation frequency. Here we demonstrate that propagation effects do not necessarily imply a significant frequency-dependent change of the position angle curve.

40|$|Ca ions play an {{essential}} role in hair celi functioning. Indeed, localized changes in cytosolic Ca concentration, [Caji modulate the transduction process and regulate the amplitude of the receptor potential. The latter activates in turn Ca and K basolateral conductances, which ultimately control the transmitter release. Given the relevance of Ca in canal hair cell functioning, the present work is focused on the properties of Ca currents in whole-cell recorded hair cells that were mechanically isolated from the canals. Depolarization to - 20 mV activated two Ca currents (4 mM [Ca]o) : one current (A) had a mean activation time constant of 0. 5 ms and an amplitude of 130 pA; the other one (B) had an activation time constant smaller than or similar to that of A, peaked at 42 pA and inactivated with a time constant of 7 ms. The activation threshold was - 60 mV for A and - 40 mV for B. The run-down of B was faster than that of A; the protease inhibitor calpastatin prevented the run-down of both currents. The A amplitude peaked at - 20 mV, with a Vrev of + 40 mV, whereas the B amplitude peaked at - 30 mV and became progressively smaller for larger depolarizations, being undetectable for voltages >= 0 mV. These results strongly indicate that A is generated by a non-inactivating channel population, whereas B by an inactivating one. Preliminar pharmacological experiments suggest that the non-inactivating channels are of L-type, whereas the inactivating ones are of T-type. The small value of Vrev was due to an outward Cs current flowing through the non-inactivating channels at positive potentials. In some cells the A amplitude increased almost two fold upon repeating the stimulating protocol. This increase was probably due to the activation of silent non-inactivating channels through a run-up mechanism not involving a cGMP or cAMP dependent phosphorylation. Theoretical considerations demonstrated the impossibility to attain a control, by means of the patch pipette, over the temporal and spatial changes of [Ca]i produced by the Ca inflow. Thus, it was impossible to assess the Ca-dependency of the current run-up mechanisms. However, it was possible to demonstrate that B inactivation was Ca-dependent. Indeed, the inactivation disappeared reversibly when the current was carried by Ba instead of Ca. The recovery from inactivation was investigated by using the standard two-pulse protocol, where two depolarizations to - 20 mV were separated by progressively longer <b>interpulses</b> at different holding potentials. It resulted that the recovery from inactivation required times of the order of 100 ms at - 120 mV and 300 ms at - 70 mV. If both channels control transmitter release, the non-inactivating one may generate the spontaneous activity, and its modulation may affect the response to slow and prolonged stimuli, whereas the inactivating channel may be important in sustaining fast transmitter release in response to strong stimuli...|$|R

Here we describe the courtship songs of the Drosophila willistoni sibling species group, which consists of several species and subspecies. We find that song pattern is species-specific, despite significant differences among strains within species. D. paulistorum has the most variable song pattern, which reflects this species ’ traditional subdivision into semispecies. All the other species could be unambiguously identified by song. The major differences among these species was in the <b>interpulse</b> interval, as {{has been found in}} other studies of fly song. However, the <b>interpulse</b> intervals of the species studied here were often multimodal. This was partly due to the presence of multiple song types within the courtship repertoire, but it also reflected changes in <b>interpulse</b> interval within a song type by some males. Unusually, some species had distinctively patterned variation in <b>interpulse</b> interval. Song must have evolved rapidly within the species complex, probably due to sexual selection...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} impact of <b>interpulse</b> (pulse-to-pulse) {{transmit}} pattern diversity on Space-Time Adaptive Pro-cessing (STAP) performance. It is shown that varying <b>interpulse</b> transmit characteristics within a Coherent Processing Interval (CPI) can re-shape the clutter power spectrum, resulting in a in-terference whitening effect. For conducting comparative anal-ysis with non-adaptive transmit techniques, a commonly used clutter model is extended to effectively incorporate <b>interpulse</b> pattern diversity effects. The work shows promise for achiev-ing better Minimum Discernable Velocity (MDV) using phased array transmit weights derived from optimum STAP weights (known covariance). Pattern diversity effectively re-distributes clutter energy away from the clutter ridge. For the unambigu-ous clutter case, the proposed adaptive transmit technique shows promise for improving MDV at the clutter ridge peak. 1...|$|E
40|$|The article {{offers the}} method for {{evaluation}} of mental fatigue, based on the method of paired light pulses. Ten pre-trained test men with normal vision, aged 18 – 20 participated in the experiment. Testees were showed subsequent paired light pulses at a 200 ms interval, divided by initial <b>interpulse</b> interval of 70 ms, recurring at the fixed time interval of 1 s. Testees determined the threshold <b>interpulse</b> interval, at which the two pulses in a pair merged into one, three times, using the method of successive approximation. Then testees solved algebraic equations with several unknowns for two hours. The threshold <b>interpulse</b> interval was determined three times every 20 minutes {{in the course of}} equations solving. The degree of mental fatigue DMF was calculated, using the formula: DMFi = (TPIi – TPI 0) 100 % / TPIi; i = 1, 2, …, n, where DMFi is the degree of mental fatigue at the i-th measurement; TPIi is average arithmetic duration of threshold <b>interpulse</b> interval at the i-th measurement; TPI 0 is average arithmetic duration of threshold <b>interpulse</b> interval before algebraic equations solving; n is the dimension of threshold <b>interpulse</b> interval measurement in the course of algebraic equations solving. After 20 minutes of work, the degree of mental fatigue of one of the testees was 9. 5 %, rose to 21 % {{by the end of the}} first hour and exceeded 39 % by the end of the second hour. Similar dynamics of mental fatigue was observed in all testees, but its development and the degree of fatigue are individual. To prevent fatigue and ensure high level of efficiency one should set the individual schedule and rest pauses duration during mental activity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Our {{high time}} {{resolution}} observations of individual pulses from the Crab pulsar {{show that the}} main pulse and <b>interpulse</b> differ in temporal behavior, spectral behavior, polarization and dispersion. The main pulse properties are consistent with one current model of pulsar radio emission, namely, soliton collapse in strong plasma turbulence. The high-frequency <b>interpulse</b> is quite another story. Its dynamic spectrum cannot easily be explained by any current emission model; its excess dispersion must come from propagation through the star’s magnetosphere. We suspect the high-frequency <b>interpulse</b> does not follow the “standard model”, but rather comes from some unexpected region within the star’s magnetosphere. Similar observations of other pulsars will reveal whether the radio emission mechanisms operating in the Crab pulsar are unique to that star, or can be identified in the general population...|$|E
40|$|The various rate {{processes}} {{that govern the}} <b>interpulse</b> relaxation in metal vapor and metal halide vapor lasers are considered. Computer calculations indicate that the rapid metastable levels relaxation observed in copper and copper halide laser experiments requires {{the existence of a}} relatively small resonance in the cross section for metastable excitation or deexcitation near threshold. The accurate calculation of <b>interpulse</b> relaxation requires knowledge of rate constants presently not well known; this is especially so for metal halide lasers...|$|E
