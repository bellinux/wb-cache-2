5|$|Some {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} more rigid skull of Tarbosaurus was an adaptation to hunting the massive titanosaurid sauropods found in the Nemegt Formation, which {{did not exist in}} most of North America during the Late Cretaceous. The differences in skull mechanics also affect tyrannosaurid phylogeny. Tarbosaurus-like articulations between the skull bones are also seen in Alioramus from Mongolia, suggesting that <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> Tyrannosaurus, is the closest relative of Tarbosaurus. Similarities between Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus might therefore be related to their large size, independently developed through convergent evolution.|$|E

25|$|Measurements of the {{preceding}} sort are of ambient air - that is, air where people might breathe <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> in workplaces. These measurements are usually reliable and available. A possibly trickier measurement is of where the pollution comes from, often a question addressed by emissions inventories. In BC and other Canadian jurisdictions facilities are required to report to Environment Canada {{on an annual basis}} their releases of toxic substances to the air. There is a natural tendency in self reporting to under-report, notwithstanding which the inventory resulting tracks releases in an interesting way. At the NPRI we can see a complex example in the historical report summary of Canfor's NPRI reporting in recent years. Criticisms of such reporting has been done by Scott Vaughan, Commissioner for Sustainable Development and the Environment in his Fall 2009 report.|$|E
25|$|The Renault Alliance was {{the first}} joint product of the AMC-Renault partnership. Introduced in 1983, the Alliance was a front-wheel drive Renault 9 compact car {{slightly}} restyled for the American market by Richard Teague mostly to comply with American safety standards and produced by AMC at Kenosha. The car was initially badged as a Renault, and some cars carried both Renault and AMC badges, however most 1986 and all 1987 models had only AMC branding. It was available as a sedan with two or four doors and later as a convertible. The hatchback, introduced in 1984 and badged as the Encore, was basically {{the same as the}} European Renault 11 model. For the final 1987 model year, a higher-performance version of the Alliance 2 door sedan and convertible was sold as the GTA. This version had a Renault two liter engine that was exclusive to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> shared with the European Renault 9 and 11 models.|$|E

The southern part of it is mostly coppice woods, a considerable quantity of which belong to the archbishop. and are in his own occupation. There are thirty-seven teams kept in this parish. There are about seventeen acres of hops in <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> long ago double that number, and these are continually displanting.

25|$|Torishima {{is a fan}} {{of video}} games and was {{therefore}} put in charge of the first video game-related articles in Weekly Shōnen Jump, for which he brought in Yuji Horii to help. When his manager told him to figure out why CoroCoro Comic was doing so well, Torishima determined {{it was because of the}} sealed pages that had to be cut opened and included cheats and tips for video games. In addition to including similar pages in Jump, they also began to rate games, something new at the time, with the resulting content being voted third in the magazine's reader polls. This was the birth of , the video game section of Weekly Shōnen Jump issues. After finding success with video game articles and wanting to show readers of Jump how one is developed, the magazine decided to develop their own role-playing game like Ultima so that they would have exclusive coverage of it. He decided to have Horii, who had begun working at Enix, write the scenario and Toriyama design the characters. Torishima claimed that he purposefully had Enix fully fund the game, intentionally keeping Shueisha out of the decision making process for the good of the product while still reserving the option to create a manga based on <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> pay any royalties. The video game was Dragon Quest.|$|E

This language policy contrasts with that of Alexander, who aimed to impose Greek throughout his empire as the official language. Latin was not a requirement for Roman citizenship, {{and there was no}} state-supported schooling that privileged it as the medium for education: fluency was desirable for its [...] "high cultural, political, legal, social and economic value".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} fourth century, when Armenian King Tiridates III adopted Christianity {{as a state}} religion, {{virtually}} all known pagan places of worship were destroyed. The Temple of Garni is the only pagan, Hellenistic, and Greco-Roman structure to have survived the widespread destruction. It remains unknown why the temple was exempted from destruction, but philosopher Grigor Tananyan argues that {{its status as a}} [...] "masterpiece of art" [...] possibly saved it from destruction. He suggests that the temple was perceived to be a [...] " [...] of an entire culture." [...] Robert H. Hewsen suggested that the reason why it was not destroyed is because it was not a temple, but a tomb of a Roman-appointed king of Armenia. He also noted that in the seventh century a church was built immediately next to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> in its place.|$|E

The recording was not specifically intended to emulate their live concert sound, but to sound more natural – [...] "This is Priestess playing in a room," [...] Heppner clarified, thus emphasizing that they wanted to simply record the band and nothing else. Schiffman gave the band a lot of creative freedom as well, not interfering with song arrangements and simply allowing the band to record as they desired, which led Heppner to enthusiastically state that he was [...] "all about recording <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> fucking with it." [...] Heppner noted that if Schiffman had any suggestions, he never forced them onto the group, which made them more willing to consider his suggestions.
