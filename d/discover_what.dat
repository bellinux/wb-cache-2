5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve.

Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and <b>discover</b> <b>what</b> things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E
