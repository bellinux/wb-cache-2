Of the estimated 240,000 Jews in Poland in 1946 (of whom 136,000 were refugees from the Soviet Union, most on their way to the West), only 90,000 remained a year later. [...] The surviving Jews of Poland found themselves victims of the explosive postwar political situation. The image of the Jew as a threatening outsider took on a new form as antisemitism was now linked to the imposition of communist rule in Poland, including rumors of massive collaboration of Jews with the unpopular new regime and the Soviet Union. Of the fewer than 80,000 Jews who remained in Poland, many had political reasons for doing so. Consequently, – as noted by historian Michael C.

5000|$|Profiles {{must also}} be {{classified}} according {{to the kind of}} subject they refer to. This subject can either be an individual or a group of people. When a profile is constructed with the data of a single person, this is called individual profiling [...] This kind of profiling is used to discover the particular characteristics of a certain individual, to enable unique identification or the provision of personalized services. However, personalized servicing is most often also based on group profiling, which allows categorisation of a person as a certain type of person, {{based on the fact that}} her profile matches with a profile that has been constructed on the basis of massive amounts of data about massive numbers of other people. A <b>group</b> <b>profile</b> can refer to the result of data mining in data sets that refer to an existing community that considers itself as such, like a religious group, a tennis club, a university, a political party etc. In that case it can describe previously unknown patterns of behaviour or other characteristics of such a group (community). A <b>group</b> <b>profile</b> can also refer to a category of people that do not form a community, but are found to share previously unknown patterns of behaviour or other characteristics [...] In that case the <b>group</b> <b>profile</b> describes specific behaviours or other characteristics of a category of people, like for instance women with blue eyes and red hair, or adults with relatively short arms and legs. These categories may be found to correlate with health risks, earning capacity, mortality rates, credit risks, etc.|$|E

50|$|More {{traditional}} artist collectives {{tend to be}} smallish {{groups of}} two to eight artists who produce work, either collaboratively or as individuals toward exhibiting together in gallery shows or public spaces. Often an artists collective will maintain a collective space, for exhibiting or as workshop or studio facilities. Some newer, more experimental kinds of groups include intentional networks, anonymous, connector, hidden or nested groups, and groups with unconventional time-scales. Artist collectives may be formed: For economic reasons, to give members volume purchasing power and allow costs of publicity and shows to be shared. For political reasons, to increase local lobbying power for arts infrastructure, to gather behind a cause or belief. For professional reasons, to develop a higher <b>group</b> <b>profile</b> that benefits the individuals by association, to create a hub for curators and commissioners to more easily locate potential talent.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the end of}} World War II, the Soviet imposed {{government}} in Poland, lacking strong popular support, found it expedient to depend disproportionately on Jews for performing clerical and administrative jobs and many Jews rose to high positions within the political and internal security ranks. Consequently, as noted by historian Michael C. Steinlauf - [...] "their <b>group</b> <b>profile</b> ever more closely resembled the mythic Żydokomuna" [...] (Judeo-Communism). As with Polish citizens from other ethnicities, Jews held positions of repressive authority under the communist administration. In March 1968, they {{became the center of}} an organized campaign to equate Jewish origins with Stalinist sympathies and crimes. The political purges, often ostensibly directed at those Jews who had held office during the Stalinist era, marked by gross abuse of power and widespread persecutions, affected all Polish Jews regardless of background.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the comparative advantages {{of data from}} group as compared to individual <b>profiles,</b> 233 <b>group</b> MMPI <b>profiles</b> were used to construct both sequential and simultaneous classification procedures for psychiatric diagnosis. Virtually perfect separation of the <b>group</b> <b>profiles</b> was accomplished by both procedures, the results ranging from 93 % correct (psychotic versus neurotic) to 99 % correct (psychiatric versus sociopathic). Moreover, a predictor index initially developed on individual profiles produced a cross-validity coefficient of. 83 when applied to the <b>group</b> <b>profiles.</b> These findings suggest that group data appear to contain such a high signal-noise ratio that they become extraordinarily efficient indicators of underlying processes—processes which are normally obscured by the unreliability inherent in individual profiles.

5000|$|Group {{profiles}} {{can also}} be divided {{in terms of their}} distributive character [...] A <b>group</b> <b>profile</b> is distributive when its properties apply equally to all the members of its group: all bachelors are unmarried, or all persons with a specific gene have 80% chance to contract a specific disease. A profile is non-distributive when the profile does not necessarily apply to {{all the members of the}} group: the group of persons with a specific postal code have an average earning capacity of XX, or the category of persons with blue eyes has an average chance of 37% to contract a specific disease. Note that in this case the chance of an individual to have a particular earning capacity or to contract the specific disease will depend on other factors, e.g. sex, age, background of parents, previous health, education. It should be obvious that, apart from tautological profiles like that of bachelors, most group profiles generated by means of computer techniques are non-distributive. This has far-reaching implications for the accuracy of indirect individual profiling based on data matching with non-distributive group profiles. Quite apart from the fact that the application of accurate profiles may be unfair or cause undue stigmatisation, most group profiles will not be accurate.|$|E

When a <b>group</b> <b>profile</b> is not available, different profile aggregation strategies can be applied to recommend adequate content and services to a group of users based on their individual profiles. In this paper, we consider an approach intended to determine the factors that influence the choice of an aggregation strategy.

The conducted experiments compare the group profiles obtained by aggregating individual user profiles according to various strategies to the "reference" <b>group</b> <b>profile</b> obtained by directly analyzing group consumptions...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, most of e-service portals {{focus on}} {{individual}} users rather than considering shared characteristics {{that could be}} useful when searching a portal. Service providers searching activities involve different types of common user behaviors and preferences that should be considered. Thus, <b>group</b> <b>profiling</b> {{can be used to}} group customers with similar interests together and recommend service providers based on their common characteristics. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new approach that recommends service providers, based on <b>group</b> <b>profiling</b> and ranking, to be used by e-service portals. Such an approach is unsupervised and is carried-out in two steps. First, <b>group</b> <b>profiles</b> are generated. Second, whenever a user tries to search for a service provider, a different result may be returned based on the data collected about that specific user. Thus, customers would most likely find the most suitable service provider more accurately and in less time. This approach focuses on <b>group</b> <b>profiling</b> and <b>group</b> users based on the Ant Colony Clustering (ACC) method, which is a new type of clustering that is based on an Artificial Intelligence algorithm called Ant Colony Optimization. In addition, this approach has been tested and three measures have been recorded including speed, aggregation precision, and result accuracy. Such test has shown that this approach is promising and produces high quality results...|$|R
