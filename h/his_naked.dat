5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and {{had a difficult time}} getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.|$|E
5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not doing very well {{at the time of}} this episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make him want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E
5|$|With the bar full, {{the guys}} begin their routine, but are soon {{stopped by the}} police, who explain that due to zoning regulations, {{stripping}} is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys go before the city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks {{what they should do}} with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks off stage and into the audience and starts handing out the extra cash, apologising for them having seen <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> buttocks.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Huan had Sauron by the throat. Lúthien gave Sauron two options: either {{surrender}} {{to her the}} magical control he had established over Tol-in-Gaurhoth, or have his body destroyed so that <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> ghost would have to endure the scorn of Morgoth. Sauron yielded, and Huan let him go. Lúthien destroyed the tower and rescued Beren from the dungeons.|$|E
25|$|The two admirals were a {{contrast}} in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating and cautious. Notwithstanding their different personalities, Spruance and Halsey were close friends. In fact, Spruance {{had a knack}} for getting along with difficult people, including his friend Admiral Kelly Turner, the hotheaded commander of 5th Fleet's amphibious force. One exception was Admiral John Towers, a constant critic of Spruance, whom Spruance came to despise for <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> ambition.|$|E

25|$|These {{sketches}} {{begin by}} announcing {{an activity that}} shouldn't be done whilst naked and assigning the activity a number. The sketches then depict one of the cast members performing the activity. The humour {{comes from the fact}} that the activities are things that shouldn't be done at all, naked or otherwise such as eating a surfboard, towel whipping a bear or impersonating the Crazy Frog ring tone. According to the Season 1 DVD commentary, when Heath Franklin appears in one of these sketches he is the only actor to do <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> scenes in the nude, the rest of the cast wore flesh-coloured underwear.|$|E
25|$|Born {{and raised}} in the village of Clavering, Essex, he was educated in London before taking his first culinary {{engagement}} at Antonio Carluccio's Neal Street restaurant as a pastry chef. When he moved to serve as a sous chef at the River Cafe he was noticed by the BBC and in 1999 debuted his television show, The Naked Chef which was followed by his first cook book subsequently becoming the No. 1 best-seller in the UK. After <b>his</b> <b>Naked</b> Chef Series he was endorsed by multiple companies and expanded his television capacity to include a documentary called Jamie's Kitchen; garnering him an invitation from the Prime Minister to 10 Downing Street. In June 2003, Oliver was honoured as a Member of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
25|$|Brown's {{tenure as}} chief {{came to an}} end when he became {{involved}} with the Barker-Karpis gang, who had come to St. Paul at the invitation of Gleckman's rival Jack Peifer. The gang committed series of robberies. When a neighbor recognized the gang from pictures in True Detective magazine, Brown delayed responding to the tip, and he or one of his associates tipped them off. They quickly cleared out. Wrongly believing that Ma Barker's lover Arthur Dunlop had informed on them, they shot him and dumped <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> body. The Dunlop murder sealed Brown's fate as chief. The publicity led to questions about how the gang had got away. He was dismissed as chief by the new mayor, who was elected on an anti-corruption ticket. However, he remained a member of the force.|$|E

25|$|After a {{short while}} he was dragged down and {{stripped}} of his nightgown and shirt, which was then wrapped around his head before he was hauled up again. However, the mob had not tied his hands and, as he struggled free, they broke his arm and shoulder, while another attempted to set light to <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> foot. He was taken down a further time and cruelly beaten before being hung up again, and died {{a short while}} later, just before midnight on 7 September 1736. The spot where Porteous died is today marked by a memorial plate in the Grassmarket. The site of the Tolbooth is marked by paving stones arranged {{in the form of}} a heart, 'The Heart of Midlothian'. Tour guides will assure you that, even today, passers-by will spit on the spot, a tradition originally intended to demonstrate their contempt for the hated Tolbooth.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California on October 15, 1997. The set {{was closed to}} the usual taping {{audience}} when Carey, Bader, Ferguson, Gomez and Stiles performed their striptease to The Edgar Winter Group's [...] "Free Ride". The Full Monty cast members came to the set to offer advice and watch the taping. The remainder of the episode was filmed before an audience later that same night. Gomez quipped that having two guys paint his body in make-up was [...] "more embarrassing" [...] than filming the routine, while Stiles joked that the episode {{was the first time}} he had been [...] "totally naked" [...] since he was cast in the show. Carey admitted that he was grateful that stripping during prime-time had to be PG and apologized that viewers had to see <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> buttocks. He also clarified that the cast wore pouches to protect their modesty.|$|E

500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip a bowling ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This might sound odd, but I think you need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in <b>his</b> <b>Naked</b> King.|$|E
500|$|In October 1562 the Queen {{fell ill}} with {{smallpox}} and, believing {{her life to}} be in danger, she asked the Privy Council to make Robert Dudley Protector of the Realm and {{to give him a}} suitable title together with twenty thousand pounds a year. There was universal relief when she recovered her health; Dudley was made a privy councillor. He was already deeply involved in foreign politics, including Scotland. In 1563 Elizabeth suggested Dudley as a consort to the widowed Mary, Queen of Scots, the idea being to achieve firm amity between England and Scotland and diminish the influence of foreign powers. Elizabeth's preferred solution was that they should all live together at the English court, so that she would not have to forgo her favourite's company. Mary of Scotland at first enquired if Elizabeth was serious, wanting above all to know her chances of inheriting the English crown. Elizabeth repeatedly declared that she was only prepared to acknowledge Mary as her heir on condition that she marry Robert Dudley. Mary's Protestant advisors warmed to the prospect of having Dudley as their prince, and in September 1564 he was created Earl of Leicester, a move designed to make him more acceptable to Mary. In January 1565 Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador to Scotland, was told by the Scottish queen that she would accept the proposal. To his amazement, Dudley was not to be moved to comply: But a man of that nature I never found any ... he whom I go about to make as happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, to lay in <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> arms a most fair ... lady ... nothing regardeth the good that shall ensue unto him thereby ... but so uncertainly dealeth that I know not where to find him. Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning that he was not a candidate for Mary's hand and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance. He also worked in the interest of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Mary's eventual choice of husband. Elizabeth herself wavered as to declaring Mary her heir, until in March 1565 she decided she could not bring herself to it. Still, she finally told the Spanish ambassador that the proposal fell through because the Earl of Leicester refused to cooperate.|$|E

2500|$|Chichele died on 12 April 1443. He {{is buried}} in Canterbury Cathedral, in a [...] "cadaver tomb" [...] between the upper choir and the choir ambulatory, {{adjacent}} to the north-east transept. The neighbouring gateway, from the transept into the choir, {{is known as the}} 'Chichele Gate'. His elaborate and colourful tomb, built many years before his death, depicts <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> corpse on the lower level, whilst on the upper level he is depicted resplendent in archiepiscopal vesture, his palms together in prayer.

2500|$|On 5 November 1991, he {{was last}} {{in contact with the}} crew of the Lady Ghislaine, his yacht, at 4:25a.m. local time, but was found to be missing later in the morning. Maxwell was presumed to have fallen {{overboard}} from the vessel which was cruising off the Canary Islands, and <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> body was subsequently recovered from the Atlantic Ocean. The official ruling at a Madrid inquest held in December 1991 was death by a heart attack combined with accidental drowning, although three pathologists had been unable to agree on the cause of his death at the inquest; he had been found to have been suffering from serious heart and lung conditions. [...] Murder was ruled out by the judge and, in effect, so was suicide. He was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|And {{they come}} into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, [...] "Son of David, have mercy on me." [...] But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and {{straightway}} a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near Jesus rolled away the stone from {{the door of the}} tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over <b>his</b> <b>naked</b> body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned {{to the other side of}} the Jordan.|$|E
