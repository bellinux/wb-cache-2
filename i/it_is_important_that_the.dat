5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E

25|$|D50 is {{scientific}} {{shorthand for}} a standard illuminant: the daylight spectrum at a {{correlated color temperature}} of 5000K. Similar definitions exist for D55, D65 and D75. Designations such as D50 are used to help classify color temperatures of light tables and viewing booths. When viewing a color slide at a light table, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light be balanced properly so that the colors are not shifted towards the red or blue.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{beneficial}} to select the cover material carefully in order to not only cover the feces but also to inoculate them with beneficial soil microbes. In that case, finished compost {{could be used as}} cover material, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> users either do not touch this cover material with their bare hands or that the composting process is sufficiently controlled such that no pathogens remain in the material.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scorers note {{down the}} play {{accurately}} {{and therefore the}} appropriate signals {{will be made by}} the umpire when the ball is dead (see Law 2.13). In addition to the following, the umpire repeats signals of dead ball, wide, and no-ball to the scorers. Scorers are required to acknowledge the signals from umpires; and umpires are required to get an acknowledgement before allowing the match to proceed.|$|E
30|$|Since our {{tracking}} {{application is}} targeted to mobile platforms, which have limited resources, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> we view <b>it</b> comprehensively as a multiobjective design problem (e.g., see [19]). Apart from developing a tracking application with good output accuracy, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> we also optimize memory requirements, power consumption, and execution time. Therefore, we apply design methods and optimization techniques that {{take all of}} these metrics into account.|$|R

25|$|It is the {{responsibility}} of the forensic entomologist to adequately instruct on the collection and handling of all specimen evidence. Even though, it is upon them to try to ensure efficient collections, they cannot always prevent inept actions; because of this, the FE can refuse improper analyses and tests performed on the evidence. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FE is diligent with the procedures and collection, so that when in court, the opposing side can’t question the findings.|$|E
25|$|The micrometre-sized {{phosphor}} particles used in thermographic PIV are seeded {{into the}} flow as a tracer and, after illumination {{with a thin}} laser light sheet, {{the temperature of the}} particles can be measured from the phosphorescence, normally using an intensity ratio technique. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> particles are of small size so that not only they follow the flow satisfactorily but also they rapidly assume its temperature. For a diameter of 2µm, the thermal slip between particle and gas is as small as the velocity slip.|$|E
25|$|In many {{applications}} of capacitors dielectric absorption {{is not a}} problem but in some applications, such as long-time-constant integrators, sample-and-hold circuits, switched-capacitor analog-to-digital converters and very low-distortion filters, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> capacitor does not recover a residual charge after full discharge, and capacitors with low absorption are specified. The voltage at the terminals generated by dielectric absorption may in some cases possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit or can be a safety risk to personnel. In order to prevent shocks, most very large capacitors like power capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that are removed before use.|$|E

25|$|For {{the subtle}} {{observations}} on phase transitions <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> disorder {{is of the}} right kind. The random nature of the potential landscape should be apparent on a scale sufficiently smaller than the sample size in order to clearly distinguish the different phases of the system. These phases are only observable by the principle of emergence, so the difference between self-similar scales has to be multiple orders of magnitude for the critical exponent to be well-defined. On the opposite side, when the disorder correlation length is too small, the states are not sufficiently localized to observe them delocalize.|$|E
25|$|Building binary {{classifiers}} which distinguish (i) {{between one}} of the labels and the rest (one-versus-all) or (ii) between every pair of classes (one-versus-one). Classification of new instances for the one-versus-all case is done by a winner-takes-all strategy, in which the classifier with the highest output function assigns the class (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> output functions be calibrated to produce comparable scores). For the one-versus-one approach, classification is done by a max-wins voting strategy, in which every classifier assigns the instance to {{one of the}} two classes, then the vote for the assigned class is increased by one vote, and finally the class with the most votes determines the instance classification.|$|E
25|$|Accurate weather {{reports are}} {{elemental}} in a death scene investigation, especially one where {{any type of}} developmental insect are involved. Even within a relatively small area, the weather can vary, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source of climate conditions is extremely reliable and accurate. For an ideal estimation as per the general maturation of the live specimens found on the body, {{a record of the}} ground and ambient temperatures should be taken for several days after the corpse is removed from the scene. To ensure the utmost accuracy it is best to collect weather data from a weather station located {{as close as possible to}} the actual crime scene.|$|E

25|$|Systematic {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} interval sampling) relies on arranging {{the study population}} according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. Systematic sampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element from then onwards. In this case, k=(population size/sample size). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> starting point is not automatically {{the first in the}} list, but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the kth element in the list. A simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory (an 'every 10th' sample, also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10').|$|E
25|$|Maintaining {{the consent}} of the peacekept is an {{important}} facet of modern peacekeeping. Notably in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda, fundamental principles of retaining that consent was ignored on the grounds of a humanitarian intervention—reflecting the nature of an Article VII intervention. Yet in order to stress and maintain the legitimacy of an intervention <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UN's forces continue to enjoy {{the consent of}} the population and government of the country to which they were deployed. This means making the peacekept feel a part of the process in addition to important cultural knowledge of the area in which peacekeepers are operating, in order to reduce friction and provide for a successful operation.|$|E
25|$|If {{any type}} of {{photographic}} evidence is involved, the expert witness has to request permission from the judge or attorney prior to the trial {{to make sure that}} the photographs that are to be presented aren’t prejudiced and have the ability to sway the jury. Finally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> expert witness realizes that replying “I don’t know” to a question is perfectly fine; it is preferable to say that you don’t have the expertise in that particular area than to claim that you do and make yourself look like a liar. Before leaving the witness stand, proper notification will be given to the expert witness to see if he is dismissed or if he will be recalled later.|$|E
