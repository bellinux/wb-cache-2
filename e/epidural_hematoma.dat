5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include <b>epidural</b> <b>hematoma,</b> subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. <b>Epidural</b> <b>hematoma</b> involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis differs {{depending}} on the severity and location of the lesion, and access to immediate, specialised acute management. Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality. Subdural hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality, while people with <b>epidural</b> <b>hematoma</b> {{are expected to have}} a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly. Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe, and poor outcome. Following the acute stage, prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient's involvement in activity that promote recovery, which for most patients requires access to a specialised, intensive rehabilitation service. The Functional Independence Measure is a way to track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation.|$|E

25|$|A 2010 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, {{most of which were}} due to improper technique. Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events. Prospective surveys show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%. In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%. Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 incidences among 229,230 patients. Infections, mainly hepatitis, after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China. Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles. Other adverse events included spinal <b>epidural</b> <b>hematoma</b> (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.|$|E
500|$|Concussion {{falls under}} the {{classification}} of mild TBI, {{but it is not}} clear whether concussion is implied in mild brain injury or mild head injury.

40|$|SummaryWe {{report on}} a case of vertex <b>epidural</b> <b>hematomas</b> with injury of the {{superior}} sagittal sinus due to a traffic accident. Imaging studies revealed skull fractures, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, <b>epidural</b> <b>hematomas</b> and injury of the superior sagittal sinus. On admission, his vital signs were normal except for pain {{at the site of}} fracture. Half an hour after admission, however, the patient’s Glasgow coma score suddenly dropped to E 2 M 4 V 2. Emergent craniotomy with removal of hematomas was performed. Nine days after admission the patient had recovered well and was discharged with no neurological deficits. Cases of traumatic brain injury have been reported before, and this type of clinical presentation with sudden change in consciousness is not rare. Vertex <b>epidural</b> <b>hematomas</b> with injury to the superior sagittal sinus requires special attention, however, because it has a varied clinical course.

40|$|Introduction: Spontaneous spinal <b>epidural</b> <b>hematomas</b> are rare. However, in {{patients}} on anticoagulant treatment the risk may increase. Symptomatically patients may present with radiculopathy and even progressive neurological deficits. Case description: We present {{a case of}} a warfarin treated patient with left L 5 radiculopathy. MRI was evaluated as showing a lumbar disc prolapse or synovial cyst at L 4 -L 5 level. The patient was operated and an organized material was removed and analysed as a hematoma. No prolapsed disc or synovial cyst was found. The patient was neurologically restored following the operation. Discussion and Evaluation: This case illustrates how spontaneous <b>epidural</b> spinal <b>hematomas</b> can present with symptoms of radiculopathy and radiologically be misinterpreted as a protruding disc or cyst. Conclusion: Warfarin treated patients may have an increased risk of spontaneous spinal <b>epidural</b> <b>hematomas...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{cases of}} pineal tumor {{combined}} with obstructive hydrocephalus, preoperative ventriculostomy or ventriculoperitoneal shunting is typically required prior to tumor resection.

500|$|The {{nature of}} the head trauma also {{influences}} the risk of PTE. [...] People who suffer depressed skull fractures, penetrating head trauma, early PTS, and intracerebral and subdural haematomas due to the TBI are especially likely to suffer PTE, which occurs in more than 30% of people with {{any one of these}} findings. About 50% of patients with penetrating head trauma develop PTE, and missile injuries and loss of brain volume are associated with an especially high likelihood of developing the condition. [...] Injuries that occur in military settings carry higher-than-usual risk for PTE, probably because they more commonly involve penetrating brain injury and brain damage over a more widespread area. [...] Intracranial hematomas, in which blood accumulates inside the skull, {{are one of the most}} important risk factors for PTE. [...] Subdural hematoma confers a higher risk of PTE than does <b>epidural</b> <b>hematoma,</b> possibly because it causes more damage to brain tissue. Repeated intracranial surgery confers a high risk for late PTE, possibly because people who need more surgery are more likely to have factors associated with worse brain trauma such as large hematomas or cerebral swelling. [...] In addition, the chances of developing PTE differ by the location of the brain lesion: brain contusion that occurs on in one or the other of the frontal lobes has been found to carry a 20% PTE risk, while a contusion in one of the parietal lobes carries a 19% risk and one in a temporal lobe carries a 16% chance. [...] When contusions occur in both hemispheres, the risk is 26% for the frontal lobes, 66% for the parietal, and 31% for the temporal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} buffers {{for increased}} volumes include CSF and, {{to a lesser}} extent, blood volume.

50|$|The {{anatomy of}} the {{epidural}} space is such that spinal <b>epidural</b> <b>hematoma</b> has a different clinical presentation from intracranial <b>epidural</b> <b>hematoma.</b> In the spine, the epidural space contains loose fatty tissue and a network of large, thin-walled veins, {{referred to as the}} epidural venous plexus. The source of bleeding in spinal <b>epidural</b> <b>hematoma</b> is likely to be this venous plexus. Anatomical abnormalities and bleeding disorders make these lesions more likely. They may cause pressure on the spinal cord or cauda equina, which may present as pain, muscle weakness, or dysfunction of the bladder and bowel. The diagnosis may be made on clinical presentation, but CT or MRI scan is usually performed for confirmation. The treatment is surgical decompression. The incidence of <b>epidural</b> <b>hematoma</b> following epidural anaesthesia is difficult to quantify; estimates vary from 1 per 10,000 to 1 per 100,000 epidural anaesthetics.|$|E
