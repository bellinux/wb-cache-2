50|$|In atherosclerosis, {{a severe}} disease in modern society, {{coronary}} blood vessels occlude. These vessels {{have to be}} freed and held open i.e. by stents. Unfortunately after certain time these vessels close again {{and have to be}} bypassed to allow for upkeep of circulation. Usually autologous vessels from the patient or synthetic polymer grafts are used for this purpose. Both options have disadvantages. Firstly there are only few autologous vessels available in a human body that might be of low quality, considering the health status of the patient. The synthetic polymer based grafts on the other hand often have insufficient <b>haemocompatibility</b> and thus rapidly occlude - a problem that is especially prone in small calibre grafts. In this context the fibrin gel based tissue engineering of autologous vessel substitutes is a very promising approach to overcome the current problems. Cells and fibrin are isolated by low invasive procedure from the patient and shaped in individual moulds to meet the required dimensions. Additional pre-cultivation in a specialized bioreactor is inevitable to ensure appropriate properties of the graft.|$|E

In this study, the effect of titaniferous {{upgrading}} of different polyurethanes on the bio- and <b>haemocompatibility</b> was investigated by endothelial cell (EC) adhesion/proliferation and platelet adhesion (scanning electron microscopy), respectively. There was no EC adhesion/proliferation and only minor platelet adhesion on upgraded and pure PCU (Desmopan). PEUs (Texin 985, Tecothane 1085, Elastollan 1180 A) differed in their cyto- and <b>haemocompatibility.</b> While EC adhesion depended {{on the type of}} PEU, any proliferative activity was inhibited. Additional titaniferous upgrading of PEU induced EC proliferation and increased metabolic activity. However, adherent ECs were significantly activated. While Texin was highly thrombotic, only small amounts of platelets adhered onto Tecothane and Elastollan. Additional titaniferous upgrading reduced thrombogenicity of Texin, preserved <b>haemocompatibility</b> of Elastollan, and increased platelet activation/aggregation on Tecothane. In conclusion, none of the PUs was cytocompatible; only titaniferous upgrading allowed EC proliferation and metabolism on PEUs. <b>Haemocompatibility</b> depended on the type of PU...|$|E

This effect on the already complex human blood theology can be used to our advantage in the screening of blood-contacting materials. An attempt has been made in the present work to evaluate the <b>haemocompatibility</b> of materials based on changes in microrheological parameters of human blood. Samples of materials of equal surface area known to be haemocompatible (medical grade silicon, polyvinyl chloride from blood bags) and materials known to be extremely haemo-incompatible (pyrex glass, copper, cotton fabric, all commercial grade) were incubated at 37. 4 degrees C in freshly drawn anticoagulated whole human blood, and changes in the haemorheological parameters (whole blood, plasma viscosity, intrinsic viscosity of red cells, platelet aggregation, albumin fibrinogen ratio) have been evaluated.

These relatively simple mechanical devices have considerably prolonged the lives of patients impacted with morbidity and poor prognosis. This has largely been possible to advancements in material science and valve design which have enhanced the durability of PHVs. However, issues with <b>haemocompatibility</b> such as haemolysis, thrombosis and calcification still often arise which can lead to mechanical obstruction or leaflet tearing, sometimes with fatal consequences. The journey to improving the <b>haemocompatibility</b> of heart valves has been complex, often driven by failure to join the loop between mechanical design and physiological requirements.

Haemoperfusion is an extracorporeal blood purification technique in which a patient’s blood is passed over a column containing a material designed to adsorb a board spectrum of biological toxic molecules. Direct blood contact with the adsorbent requires a material that is able to display good <b>haemocompatibility</b> whilst maintaining adsorption efficiency.

40|$|Artificial {{cardiovascular}} implants are {{now made}} mainly from extruded polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE). However, the limited <b>haemocompatibility</b> of PTFE causes blood clotting {{and results in}} early replacement. Many techniques are being developed to improve the <b>haemocompatibility</b> of such devices. One {{of the most promising}} techniques is to coat the devices with nitrogen-doped diamond-like carbon (NDLC) thin films. However, the structure of NDLC and its effect on the <b>haemocompatibility</b> of the coated devices have not been fully investigated as required for practical applications. In this thesis, ion beam deposited DLC and Nitrogen doped thin films on PTFE were investigated {{in order to have a}} better understanding of the relationships between the structure and biomedical properties of the DLC thin films. DLC and NDLC thin films were synthesized using ion beam deposition. Commercially available PTFE sheets, which are similar to the material used for vascular grafts, were used as substrates for the DLC thin films. Silicon wafers were also utilized as substrates for condition optimization and property comparison. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photo emission spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the structural and morphological properties of the coated surface. The results show that the ion beam deposited thin films have a very smooth surface and exhibit low coefficient of friction and high adhesion to the substrate. Low concentration of nitrogen doping in DLC improved surface hardness and reduced surface roughness. Higher concentration of sp 3 hybridized bonds was observed in the DLC thin films on Si than those on PTFE. DLC coating decreased the surface energy and improved the wettability of PTFE films. The <b>haemocompatibility</b> of the pristine and DLC coated PTFE sheets were evaluated by platelet adhesion technique.

No standardized methods are available to measure <b>haemocompatibility</b> in solid materials. However, a material could be considered haemocompatible if its surface does not modify the normal activation of the coagulation pathway and produces no damage in the blood components. In this work, the <b>haemocompatibility</b> of coatings obtained by anodic oxidation of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (with H 2 SO 41 M and 40 to 70 V) with and without heat treatment (1 h for 500 °C), is evaluated and compared with the <b>haemocompatibility</b> of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrate and pyrolytic carbon. Standard clinical trials for clothing: Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) were adapted to evaluate the <b>haemocompatibility</b> of solid materials. Besides, the interaction between blood platelets and solid material were performed through an analysis of interfacial tension (γi,j), this parameter could indicate the degree of preferential adsorption of each protein of the blood plasma. The ratio between albumin-material and fibrinogen-material interfacial tension, (γs,Alb/ γs,Fib), is an important parameter used to predict the platelets adhesion and the trend at the formation of cloth. The results of the clothing trials indicate that the tested surfaces would be haemocompatibles due {{to the values of}} PT and APTT obtained which were in range of the normal ones. In addition, the measured values of γs,Alb/ γs,Fib indicate that all the tested surfaces are more haemocompatible than pyrolitic carbon.

It has been demonstrated that NP-Pt had harmful effects on in vivo mice model, causing kidney injury after intravenous administration [25] and inflammatory responses after intratracheal instillation [26]. Furthermore, NP-Pt had harmful effect on in ovo model, causing mitochondria degradation at chicken embryo brain tissue ultrastructure, activation of apoptosis and reduced proliferation rate of the brain cells [11]. In the present research, NP-Pt at 2.6  μg/ml incubated with whole chicken blood affected RBC morphology and <b>haemocompatibility</b> status. Comparing the effects of NP-Pt and cisplatin on RBC structures, there were substantial differences between NP-Pt and cisplatin.

The present results demonstrated that both cisplatin and NP-Pt induced haemolysis compared to the control group. Evaluation of <b>haemocompatibility</b> of nanoparticles should be considered as one of the factors of assessing systemic toxicity. Haemolytic properties of the nanoparticles can be determined by spectrophotometric measurement (540  nm) and based on adjustments of the ASTM F- 756 - 00 standard [22]. Human RBC have different morphology than chicken RBC, with the primary difference being that chicken RBC have a nucleus containing genetic material. The mechanism of action for platinum-containing anticancer drug utilizes the presence of DNA to induce cancer cell death by apoptosis [30, 31]. Regarding the antineoplastic properties of ciplatin, it is important to emphasize that the intravenous administration of cisplatin has severe side effect on blood compartments. The present results confirmed that cisplatin and NP-Pt not only induced haemolysis but also caused the structural damage of RBC.

Empty Fun or HEP non-functionalized (control) NLs were used as controls. NLs were characterized for mean diameter, surface charge and heparin encapsulation/release. Different lipid compositions were used for NL construction; PC/Chol (2 : 1 mol/mol) or PC/Chol (4 : 1 mol/mol) (fluid type vesicles) [which allow gradual release of heparin] and DSPC/Chol (2 : 1 mol/mol) (rigid type vesicles).

The prosthesis was designed {{with the aim}} of overcoming the need for anticoagulant therapy, which is required for current mechanical prostheses; while also having lifelong durability, which current bioprosthetic heart valves are not able to achieve. Inspired by the anisotropic architecture of collagen in the natural valve, a shortlist of polystyrene based block copolymers (BCPs), which can be processed to yield mechanically anisotropic materials, was proposed. The shortlist was evaluated based upon processability, biostability, ex vivo <b>haemocompatibility,</b> and a novel material performance index comprising the flexural modulus and the cyclic fatigue stress predicted by fracture mechanics methods. Polystyrene-block-polyethylene-polypropylene-block-polystyrene with 22 mol% polystyrene (SEPS 22) was selected for further testing and use in the design. <b>Haemocompatibility</b> and calcification of the BCPs was assessed against reference materials. In measures of coagulation and thrombogenicity the BCPs were better than polyester, but worse than expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and pericardium graft materials. In measures of inflammation, the BCPs and polytetrafluoroethylene were better than polyester and pericardium. A durable heparin coating gave SEPS 22 superior <b>haemocompatibility</b> compared to all the reference materials. The BCPs calcified less than pericardium, but calcification still accelerated failure. The technique of injection moulding discs of the BCP from a point was used to create a novel biaxial structure of cylindrical polystyrene domains. A combination of modelling and bench-scale injection moulding was used to select a point from which the prosthetic heart valve injection tool cavity should be filled. By simultaneously injecting at a point at the centre of the free edge of each leaflet, a bioinspired orientation was produced. Based upon hydrodynamic testing, a spherical form leaflet design was selected. The hydrodynamic performance of the complied with the ISO 5840 standard for cardiac valve prostheses, but the fatigue performance was inadequate due to the leaflets being thinner than specified due to manufacturer error. Fatigue prediction and finite element analysis were used to conjecture that correctly manufactured polymeric valves could theoretically reach the ISO limit, indicating that there is potential for polymeric prostheses to overcome the issues of durability and need for anticoagulation...|$|E

Thrombin generation, blood platelet adhesion and com- plement convertase activity tests revealed the following classification, from the most to the least heamocompatibl...|$|E
40|$|Background: Reduced <b>haemocompatibility</b> {{and early}} filter failure are {{frequent}} complications during extracorporeal organ therapy with continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH). Beyond {{adverse effects of}} artificial surfaces, coagulation disorders diyplay the main reason of filter blockage. Still, {{little is known about}} the impact of therapy dependent factors (lung protective ventilation strategies with permissive hypercapnia/acidaemia, infusion therapy with hyperchloraemic solutions, buffer strategies, anticoagulation) and a CVVH-circuit with respect to the coagulation system. Acidaemia through lung protective ventilations strategy needs to be corrected independent from ventilation. Methods: Acidaemia (pH 7, 2) was induced by infusion of an acid solution (0, 2 M of lactic acid and HCL) and combination of low tidal volume ventilation (6 - 8 mL. kg- 1). One group underwent additional hypoxaemia (pH 7, 2; PaO 2 < 70 mmHg). CVVH was operated with reinfusion of the filtrate to the venous line for 3 hours based on standardized heparinization (60 IU. kg- 1. h- 1). Correction of acidaemia was performed with predilutional application of THAM buffer in the CVVH open mode. Results: Acidaemia led to a contradictory pattern with respect to the plasmatic haemostasis. Compared to the control group with PH 7, 4 acidaemia was associated with elevated markers of coagulation activation, loss of platelets and a decrease in fibrinogen concentration. Filter function did not differ between groups, but a tendency for higher rates of filter blockage was found. Predilutional THAM application with 8 mmol. kg- 1. h- 1 successfully corrected acidaemia and reduced filter blockage presumably due to improved haemorheology. Discussion: We could show that there is an interaction of acidaemia with the CVVH <b>haemocompatibility</b> with respect to the coagulation system. Further studies are needed to systematically clarify the overall influence of the accompanying therapy...|$|E
40|$|Blood-contacting {{medical devices}} have been {{associated}} with severe clinical complications, such as thrombus formation, triggered by the activation of the coagulation cascade due to the adsorption of certain plasma proteins on the surface of biomaterials. Hence, the coating of such surfaces with antithrombotic agents has been used to increase biomaterial <b>haemocompatibility.</b> Biomaterial-induced clotting may also be decreased by albumin adsorption from blood plasma in a selective and reversible way, since this protein is not involved in the coagulation cascade. In this context, this paper reports that the immobilization of the thrombin inhibitor D-Phe-Pro-D-Arg-D-Thr-CONH 2 (fPrt) onto nanostructured surfaces induces selective and reversible adsorption of albumin, delaying the clotting time when compared to peptide-free surfaces. fPrt, synthesized with two glycine residues attached to the N-terminus (GGfPrt), was covalently immobilized onto self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) having different ratios of carboxylate-hexa(ethylene glycol) - and tri(ethylene glycol) -terminated thiols (EG 6 -COOH/EG 3) that were specifically designed to control GGfPrt orientation, exposure and density at the molecular level. In solution, GGfPrt was able to inactivate the enzymatic activity of thrombin and to delay plasma clotting time in a concentration-dependent way. After surface immobilization, and independently of its concentration, GGfPrt lost its selectivity to thrombin and its capacity to inhibit thrombin enzymatic activity against the chromogenic substrate n-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide. Nevertheless, surfaces with low concentrations of GGfPrt could delay the capacity of adsorbed thrombin to cleave fibrinogen. In contrast, GGfPrt immobilized in high concentrations was found to induce the procoagulant activity of the adsorbed thrombin. However, all surfaces containing GGfPrt have a plasma clotting time similar to the negative control (empty polystyrene wells), showing resistance to coagulation, which is explained by its capacity to adsorb albumin in a selective and reversible way. This work opens new perspectives to the improvement of the <b>haemocompatibility</b> of blood-contacting medical devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{usage of}} {{biomaterials}} in modern medicine is of increasing importance. Biocompatibility {{is one of}} the most important parameters in their practical use. In case of direct blood contact <b>haemocompatibility</b> is of great importance. In this study four biopolymers (polypropylene, cuprophane (non-resorbable) and PDLLA, PDLLA/HEMA (resorbable)) are compared with regard to their haemocopatibility and suitability as an intravascular implant. The biomaterials are first incubated with isolated, discoid and non-activated platelets, drawn from fresh human blood. Paraformaldehyde 0, 5 % is used for fixation. Following a qualitative and quantitative detection of adherent and activated platelets on the used biomaterials by two anti-platelet antibodies, isolated from chicken. Results are compared with the qualitative and quantitative detection of adherent and activated platelets on the biomaterials by a common commercial anti-platelet antibody (CD 41). Immune fluorescence microscopy is used to proove the results. Due to the results the biopolymers are divided into the Goodmann-classification, which is used to quantify different levels of activation in platelets. Polypropylene as a material with a well-known high thrombogenity is used as a reference material. The two chicken-anti-platelet antibodies show nearly the same results on every biomaterial tested. They show a higher thrombogenity for polypropylene and cuprophane compared to the results with the CD 41 antibody. In contrast to this fact the results for PDLLA with the chicken-anti-platelet antibodies show a lower thrombogenity compared to the results with the CD 41 antibody. Results for PDLLA/HEMA are identically for every used antibody. There is are significant improvement in <b>haemocompatibility</b> of PDLLA/HEMA in comparison to PDLLA due to the addition of HEMA. PDLLA/HEMA and cuprophane show the lowest thrombogenity among the tested biopolymers. These results confirm PDLLA/HEMA as a potential candidate for the use as an intravascular implant...|$|E
40|$|A {{layer of}} TiO 2 film was {{prepared}} by sol-gel method {{on the surface}} of TLM(Ti- 3 Zr- 2 Sn- 3 Mo- 25 Nb) alloy. Then the coated samples were treated by hydroxyl solution and amination solution in order to introduce the OH- and NH 2 - active groups, and the heparin was linked {{on the surface of}} TiO 2 film through these active groups. The phase identification and the surface characteristics of the samples were successively undertaken using XRD, SEM and EDS. The in vitro blood compatibility of the TLM alloy specimens with and without heparinization treatments was evaluated by the contact angle test, the hemolysis test and investigation of their platelet adhesion behavior. The results showed that the <b>haemocompatibility</b> of the TLM alloy could be significantly improved by surface modification via heparinization...|$|E

In this work, reconstituted collagen films were prepared from neutralized acid-soluble solutions for subsequent <b>haemocompatibility</b> and cell viability performance assays. First, haemoglobin-free, thrombelastography and platelet adhesion tests were performed in order to investigate the blood contact performance. Secondly, specimens were seeded with endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, and cell viability tests were carried out by MTT and SEM. Results show that neutralized acid-soluble type I collagen films do not enhance blood coagulation, do not alter normal viscoelastic properties of blood and slightly activate platelet adhesion and aggregation. Cell culture shows that the samples are adequate substrates to support the adhesion and proliferation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells...|$|E
